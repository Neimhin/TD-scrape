#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will agree there is no more important responsibility for the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine than to ensure the safety of food consumed by our citizens. The food industry is a vital one for the country. Its ultimate success depends on absolute confidence and trust in its operation, processes and, above all, in its products. Obviously, complete transparency is required at all times in the industry. Regarding the contamination of beef products with horsemeat and pigmeat, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine said yesterday that he was told only on Monday last for the first time. I accept the Minister's word. However, does the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform believe it is acceptable that, although positive tests for such contamination were conducted and obtained in November that the Minister responsible was only told last Monday? Is it acceptable he was only told last Monday about an issue so grave and profound for the industry's reputation? The departmental officials were informed by and asked to co-operate with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, on 21 December. Does the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform believe it is acceptable that officials did not tell the Minister in December about such a serious issue? Who is heading up the investigation into this matter? Is the FSAI involved in it and will independent experts also be involved? Is the Government prepared to introduce a traceability system for horses, similar to that which exists for cattle, pigs and sheep? Last March, following a TV3 documentary and a major expos√© in The Sunday Times on the illegal slaughtering of horses, my colleague Deputy Kelleher put down a question to the Minister on this matter of traceability. The Minister confirmed in his reply that there was no central database. I understand the number of horses slaughtered in this country has rocketed to 20,000 last year. There are clearly issues in this sector. In his reply to Deputy Kelleher, the Minister also did not commit to establishing such a traceability system. Will he now rethink this and will the Government commit to establishing such a traceability regime which is important for food safety?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	All Deputies will agree the food industry is a critical part of our economic activity, as well as being critical to our export sector and to jobs. That is why we have such a high standard of oversight of food production in this country. It is the best, I would say, in the world. It is important to reiterate this is not a public health issue, nor does it relate to food safety but to food standards. It is important to bear this in mind with some of the questions raised, for example, in the United Kingdom because it does not do the level of testing we do here. Our food safety authority is not only focused on ensuring that no contaminants which would impact on the health of individuals go into any food product but that food products are as labelled. These high standards have been acknowledged, even in the past 24 hours. To answer the specific questions raised by the Deputy, it will be a matter for the FSAI to conclude its current investigations. It is being assisted by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Its inspectors have gone into the meat plants in question and I understand the results of the most recent testing will be made public this afternoon. It is important we approach this entire episode in a completely open and transparent way and that the sequence of events, as laid out by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine yesterday, is clear to the House and the public so we can have confidence in robust systems. Where failings occur, they will be identified because our systems are so robust. As to what might follow on with further legislation or food tracing systems, all of this will be addressed once we find the source of the current contamination and give absolute assurances to the Irish people who consume these products and to any exporter who buys an Irish product that the highest standards we are determined to maintain are in place. We must assure them that there is no threat either to the safety or health of anybody - which is quite clear already - and that the product that is labelled is the product people get.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	4	The first batch of tests was completed at the end of November and proved positive for contamination. A further set of tests was carried out in December which proved equally positive. Why was the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine not told in November or December that such tests were being carried out and the results were positive? That is the fundamental question. Does the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform believe it is acceptable that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was not told in December by his officials or the FSAI that a major issue regarding our food industry's reputation had arisen? It is not a good enough answer to say it had to be confirmed in Germany before the Minister was told. I asked that question yesterday and I did not get an answer. There is still no answer to it. Is it acceptable that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was not told tests were going on and the results of these tests were positive?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	5	This was laid out in some detail yesterday by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney. I will give Deputy Martin the sequence again for clarity. The first samples were taken by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland as part of the snapshot surveys that it does periodically across all food production in the country. These were taken in mid-November and sent for analysis to a private laboratory. In December the Food Safety Authority of Ireland took further samples at retail level and again had them analysed in a private laboratory.

The FSAI informed the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine of the results last Monday, 14 January.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	28	This morning the latest survey from the Irish League of Credit Unions revealed that 1.6 million people are left with ‚Ç¨50 or less to spend at the end of each month after they meet their household bills. The survey reflects that since October last an additional 230,000 people have fallen into this bracket. This is a direct result of the Government's austerity policies and its most recent austerity budget. That is before the dreaded family home tax is imposed. The family home tax is the brainchild of Fianna F√°il and it will have serious implications for households that are already teetering on the brink. It will especially punish those on low and middle incomes. It will punish social welfare recipients and even those with disabilities. It takes no account of ability to pay, people's mortgages, the amounts people have paid in stamp duty or whether a household is in negative equity. The Government is almost two years in office and its response to those struggling with significant mortgages is to lump more taxes on them, but this is a tax too far. Where does the Minister, Deputy Howlin, propose that these 1.6 million people should get the money to pay the family home tax? The Minister should bear in mind that these are not only families dependent on social welfare payments. Many of them are working families and families in which two people are out at work, but they simply cannot afford this family home tax. Where are they to get the money? How many more citizens will be pushed over the brink by this family home tax?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	29	The notion that we can have a debate as if we are in a vacuum and not in an economic crisis that every household in the country knows about never ceases to amaze me. I am acutely aware, as is the Government, of the pressure on citizens throughout the State because of the economic catastrophe that the country met due to bad political and economic decisions made in recent times. The Deputy is referring to a survey done by the Irish League of Credit Unions. It is interesting to note that the Central Statistics Office publication of 14 January contains some interesting facts on savings. This is factual and not based on surveys or opinions; these are factual issues. The gross savings ratio increased in the last quarter of last year. Savings were at an unprecedented level of 14.5% and increased in the last quarter of last year to 16%. The normal level of savings in a functioning economy is of the order of 7%.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	31	One thing we need to do is to get people to spend money in the economy rather than save it. The strategy of the Government from the beginning has been focused on restoring the economy and getting the economic infrastructure right to create jobs. In the three years before the Government came to power a staggering 250,000 private sector jobs were lost. It is almost mind-numbing. Naturally, this has had an impact on households throughout the country and their capacity to pay bills, but we have begun the process of reversing that. In the past 12 months 12,000 net new jobs in the private sector have been created. We have several labour market activation measures in place. We will have a Cabinet meeting on the jobs crisis this afternoon. From the very beginning our focus has been on getting our economy repaired and getting people back to work in order to lift them out of the pressures that the Opposition has referred to. The notion that when faced with a vast deficit we can continue to fund services to the level that we had without increasing taxes is fanciful and the Deputies opposite know that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	32	That is what the Government promised.

Let us take tourism, which is important to such counties as Kerry. F√°ilte Ireland has reported that there are 5,000 net additional jobs in the sector since we set up the jobs initiative within 100 days of coming into office. These are measures to address the issues of poverty and joblessness, and our efforts are working demonstrably.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	37	I hope the Minister is not questioning the validity of the survey carried out by the Irish League of Credit Unions, although it sounded remarkably like it. The Minister certainly lives in a vacuum or bubble if he is unaware of the extent to which households are struggling, and the Irish League of Credit Unions is truthfully and accurately reflecting that reality. The Government cannot expect people to spend in the domestic economy if they do not have the money to spend. I would have appreciated an answer to my question. Perhaps when he takes to his feet for a second time the Minister will do me that courtesy. I want to know where these 1.6 million individuals and their families will find the additional resources to pay the Government's family home tax. I suspect the Minister has not given me a straight answer because he knows full well that those individuals have no prospect whatsoever of finding that additional resource. This will not mean additional savings for those people and their families.It will mean additional hardship and debt. The Minister rushed through the House the proposal for the family home tax which he borrowed from Fianna F√°il. Perhaps those on the Government benches had not thought through fully the implications of that tax. Today's credit union survey asks them to do just that. With ‚Ç¨50 per month disposable income, which is ‚Ç¨12.50 per week, individuals and their families cannot pay a family home tax. I ask the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, to tell me where those individuals and families identified in the survey will find the ‚Ç¨300 to ‚Ç¨500 per annum he demands from them.

#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	62	I wish the Ceann Comhairle well for the new year as I do all Members, staff of the Houses and press representatives. Ireland's unemployment rate is the fourth highest in the EU with long-term unemployment accounting for 60% of people who are unemployed. Only massive emigration is keeping unemployment below the 500,000 mark. Surely, the Minister will concur that the onset of the economic downturn is one of the greatest threats to public health in the history of the State. Having no job is seen as an economic problem but it damages the physical and mental health of people who are unemployed causing heart disease, high blood pressure, depression and anxiety. The links between unemployment and health receive little or no attention from Government and policy makers. Job loss is associated with elevated rates of mental and physical health problems, increased mortality and detrimental changes to family relationships and the psychological well-being of spouses and children. The Irish Mental Health Commission, EU and World Health Organisation have all released reports recently which set out compelling statistics on the negative effect of the recession on national psychological health and well-being. Mental health across the population, particularly among men, has deteriorated since the onset of austerity measures over the last number of years. Suicide levels are increasing at an alarming rate, particularly among young unemployed men. Figures from the Irish Association of Suicidology suggest that for every percentage increase in unemployment, there is a corresponding increase of 0.7% in the incidence of suicide. With 700,000 people on or below the poverty line and more than 200,000 children going to school hungry or without proper clothing, two national organisations - the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Social Justice Ireland - which advocate for those people have seemingly been ignored. Why was there no in-depth social impact assessment carried out prior to the publication of the budget to ensure the circumstances of those experiencing poverty and social exclusion would not be made worse by austerity measures? Will the Minister give a commitment to the House, prior to the publication of the national social report for 2012, to agree to an impact study and to establish a task force comprising the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Social Justice Ireland, MABS, the Mental Health Commission and Aware to deal with the serious health problems associated with unemployment?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	63	From the very establishment of the Government and before in the discussions on a programme for Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party were absolutely clear that the primary objective of the Government was economic recovery. A core part of that and the primary issue for Government was the creation of jobs. The Government accepts fully the point made by Deputy John Halligan that the impact of joblessness is huge on the mental, physical and economic well-being of our people and on the structure of our society. That is why jobs have been at the heart of everything we have tried to do from the moment of the establishment of the Government. Within 100 days of taking office, we established the first jobs initiative and set out our strategy to repair the economy and create an environment for investment. We have had some significant successes to date but there is no doubt that there is a considerable way to go. We have the strategy to address the issues and I can lay out to the House in some detail what action has been taken. Our first act was to abandon the failed strategy of our predecessor Government which sought to build an economy on property, banking and debt. We have sought to move to an economy based on enterprise, exports and innovation, the strategy which led to recovery at the end of the 1990s. The level of unemployment is wholly unacceptable which is why the Government is determined to work might and main to address the problem. We have moved in the right direction. The IDA reported 12,000 net new jobs in the last two years while Enterprise Ireland reported 3,804 in 2012. In 2011, Irish exports reached the highest level ever at ‚Ç¨173 billion, exceeding the level of exports during the boom years. In the years 2008 to 2010, we lost 40,000 jobs in the export sector but in 2011, we gained an additional 10,000. As I said when referring to F√°ilte Ireland, we have recently seen the first significant rise in employment in the tourism sector since 2008.The strategies are working and we have a way to go. We are very aware that this is our number one priority which is why we have a special Cabinet meeting devoted to this where every Minister will make a series of proposals that will be drawn together this afternoon. 
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	64	The Minister is out of touch with reality. Over Christmas, many thousands of people throughout the country had no heating, no television service and no proper food. I ask the Minister to acknowledge that this is the case and if so, to take the opportunity to meet the people working in front line services like the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and Social Justice Ireland, whom he ignored in the previous budget, and to undo the mistake he made in the two most recent budgets. He should bring in the groups working with the 700,000 people who are our people and who voted for and put their trust in us in the last election so they could have a better quality of life. Instead they are condemned to poverty, despair and desolation. I will not get into an argument because I am into conciliation rather than confrontation but I appeal to the Minister to meet Social Justice Ireland and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul as I and many other Deputies have done and to listen to what they have to say, which might shock him, rather than talk to them for five or six minutes. I understand the Minister did not meet the Society of St. Vincent de Paul before the last budget. I urge him to set up this task force because he would do a great service to all those who are ill on the unemployment system.

Social Justice Ireland held a formal meeting this week with the Secretary General of my Department so we are very aware and in touch and I know the Deputy will acknowledge that. We are aware of the impact of the economic catastrophe that has befallen this country but there is no point in decrying it. We must present solutions and hope to people and have set out our journey to recovery. We have travelled a fair degree of that journey but we have a way to go and we know there are people who are hurting badly. We will do everything we can to sustain the supports we have. We must borrow to do so in terms of social protection, health, education and so on and at the same time ensure we create an environment that will put growth, jobs and investment back in our economy and break away from the dependency on the troika so we can make our economic decisions. We are on the path to that recovery and I think people will stay with this Government because they know we are competently walking down that road.

The motion before the House is incredible and represents an attempt by the Government, particularly the Labour Party, and Sinn F√©in to suppress dissent and punish Members who voted against the cut to the respite care grant in the case of Deputy Keaveney in the D√°il. We are being asked to remove Deputy Keaveney from the Committee of Public Accounts, the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs and the Oireachtas Committee on Transport and Communications because he voted with his conscience consistent with commitments he made before the last general election. This new Parliament in the aftermath of the last general election was meant to usher in a new democracy and a change in how we organise ourselves in the Parliament. The entire Parliament is being asked to punish a Deputy because he voted against the cut in the respite care grant. So we must now summarily remove him from three committees. I have no wish to remove Deputy Keaveney from any committee. He is an able member of these committees.

The Government regularly claims that its priorities are to create jobs, re-skill and retrain those who have lost jobs in order to prepare them for a return to employment and to protect the vulnerable against the impact of austerity and cuts. The cuts in the further education sector fail having regard to all of these priorities and do precisely the opposite to what the Government claims it is committed to doing because the further education sector caters for some of the most disadvantaged communities in society, those who have lost their jobs as a result of the economic crisis and who are in difficulty and need to be re-skilled and retrained in order to have some chance of returning to employment. The cuts being made will also lead to the loss of existing jobs, the loss of approximately 500 temporary jobs and up to 200 permanent jobs. The cuts make no sense whatsoever. The range of courses that will be available to people who are seeking to re-skill or retrain or who are not candidates for university will be degraded and reduced, further reducing the opportunities for people who find themselves in this situation. Therefore, I urge the Government to rethink its position urgently. The further education sector provides a significant service for society, particularly the most marginalised, and is a key part of any serious attempt to chart a way out of the unemployment crisis. The Minister should reverse the cuts.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	104	On numerous occasions I have said the Government is a job destruction government. This proposal is another indication of this.There are fewer jobs in the economy now than there were when the Government came to power. The Government's economic programme for the next three years which it set out last November is based on a net decrease in the number of jobs in 2012, no increase in 2013 and a very small increase in 2014. Of course, the 2014 figure is a target. These proposals run counter to the effort to get the economy back on its feet and people back into employment. They will lead to a reduction of 500 in the number of jobs in the economy. Some 500 teachers, many of whom are in part-time or temporary positions, will lose their jobs and join the dole queues at an additional cost to the State. Approximately 38,000 students are catered for in this sector which is being targeted for cuts, even though it is hugely important for the retraining, re-skilling and upskilling of people who need to gain employment. Some 30% of the students in question are on back to education courses. A further 10% are participating in vocational training opportunities schemes. More than 50% of these students are being upskilled on various schemes. This measure will ensure fewer courses will be available to those who lose their jobs and wish to return to education. It runs directly counter to the suggestion the Government intends to create jobs. There is huge productivity in the sector. The number of students already exceeds by over 5,500 the number who are supposed to be catered for in it. The teachers are very productive. As I said, they cater for an additional 5,500 students and do a great deal of administrative work on these courses.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	105	We already know the benefits of having a well educated and well trained workforce. This is of increasing importance as we strive for economic recovery. That is why it is so difficult to understand the logic behind the decision to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio across the board. While the increase in the ratio from 17:1 to 19:1 might not seem like a major change when it is reported, it is important to state it will have a major impact. The impact of the increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in the further and continuing education sector, in particular, will differ significantly from the impact a similar increase would have at second or third level. A typical further education course involves several modules taught by people from different professions. A course might have to be taught by a qualified instructor in that field in order for it to be recognised. It is not simply a matter of asking the remaining instructors to share the workload. If the instructor goes, the entire course might be discontinued, which would narrow the choices of students. The Teachers Union of Ireland has estimated that the increase which has been announced will directly result in the loss of some or all of the hours of 500 people. The equivalent of 200 whole-time posts will be lost. We know that the further education sector embraces courses that add to further education in the wider sense. I refer to areas such as computer literacy, enhanced technical programming and multimedia skills, all of which have benefits. People involved in the technology sector keep telling us that there are jobs available in it. Given that the Government keeps going on about its jobs strategy, it seems illogical that it is cutting the provision of training to produce people to fill jobs in this sector. It just does not make sense and needs to be reversed.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	106	The decision to impose cutbacks on the further education and training sector is an extremely retrograde step. It flies in the face of the Government's Action Plan for Jobs which was announced with great fanfare last year. The plan linked economic recovery with the development of skills in the workforce. It included a commitment to give those who have been on the dole for more than 12 months priority access to places in the further education and training sector. According to those who work in the sector, however, the cuts will have a devastating impact. As my colleagues said, it will lead to a loss of up to 500 jobs, or the equivalent of 200 whole-time posts. It will have a particular effect on part-time teachers who bring specialist knowledge to specific courses. These specialists cannot be replaced by fixed-term teachers who do not have the specialist knowledge needed. This will result in a substantial decrease in the number of courses offered. The Teachers Union of Ireland suggested yesterday that a college with 1,000 students could lose the courses being undertaken by 400 of these students. The Inchicore College of Further Education will lose five teachers if the pupil-teacher ratio is increased from 17:1 to 19:1. The loss of so many teachers would decrease subject choice and remove specialist options from various courses. It would lead to losses of guidance hours, the cancellation of courses, decreases in enrolments and reductions in the number of support hours in language and general courses. The Teachers Union of Ireland has made the point that these reductions will inadvertently target areas of disadvantage in Dublin 7, Dublin 8, Dublin 9, Dublin 10 and Dublin 12. Other areas that particularly need support will also be affected. The Action Plan for Jobs allocated ‚Ç¨20 million for new education and training programmes. The bulk of this money is going to private companies that are running programmes and courses originally developed in the public sector by further education colleges in the post-leaving certificate sector. The further education sector has been very innovative in responding to the need for new skills and new employment demands in the economy. When this cut is considered, with the scrapping of the cost of education allowance and the increase in college fees, it is clear that it will exacerbate our society's move towards the position where access to higher education is not a right for all but the preserve of a privileged few. While I support the motion, I question the motives behind it.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	107	My contribution will be based on my experience as a second level teacher who was closely involved with local post-leaving certificate colleges such as Col√°iste Dh√∫laigh, the further education colleges in Killester, Marino and D√∫n Laoghaire and Col√°iste √çde. I acknowledge the work of my colleagues in these colleges who saw the gaps and did the work to draw up the courses provided, in which there is great variety. Some amazing opportunities are offered. I also acknowledge the hard work done by the college authorities in securing accreditation for these courses, which was not easy because they had to go through some rigorous steps. I refer, in particular, to the tremendous amount of work done to draw up progression routes with the British colleges which were the only ones to buy into this process in certain years. In more recent times these colleges have worked with the institutes of technology. In my own area Dublin City University has been very receptive to progression from post-leaving certificate colleges. I always encouraged my students to consider post-leaving certificate courses as their plan A or plan B. Having attended many open day events with them, I know about the work done on such occasions. I always reminded my students to ask where people went after they did post-leaving certificate courses. The statistics in that regard were very positive. Many went directly into employment. They did not need to attend further education courses because they had secured particular qualifications. I support the ladder route introduced by the post-leaving certificate colleges which has been absolutely amazing. Second-chance education is even more important today. We are familiar with the statistics. While I do not want to see anybody losing his or her job or any course being withdrawn, I am probably the only Deputy on these benches who does not think post-leaving certificate colleges should have a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio than secondary schools. Having said that, I accept that these colleges need more help in the guidance area. We are aware of the usual situations and difficulties encountered by pupils. These colleges also have to deal with a range of issues relating to those who have returned to education. I refer to lone parents, social welfare and housing issues, for example. Friends of mine have told me that each post-leaving certificate college usually supports between 100 and 140 students each year as they take the UCAS route. They help with references and personal statements as part of that process. Guidance counsellors also have to do extra work to assist students who are making CAO applications. There is a need for guidance in the post-leaving certificate sector. If we are serious about tackling educational disadvantage, we have to invest resources at primary level and even before that stage. If we do not get it right, it will be more difficult to do so at a later stage.  I will conclude by mentioning a statistic. In certain areas of Dublin Central only 18% of people advanced beyond primary education. That is a scandal. We have to look at that issue again.

Yesterday, I was very happy, in this Chamber, to laud the leader of Fianna F√°il for his work during his time as Minister for Health and Children, particularly in regard to the tobacco legislation of that time. Today, regrettably, I have to criticise the same Deputy and his party for what I consider a pointless and insensitive Private Members' motion. I am opposed to this motion because it is the strong opinion of the Government, as well as my opinion, that we must and will continue to protect front-line education services in primary and second level schools. I know the value of adult education and the role the further education sector plays in our society today. I also know the damage that has been done to our economy and to the education sector, in particular, by Fianna F√°il-led Governments over the past 14 years. I want to place on record the excellent work VECs do throughout the country in providing places for those who want to return to education or post-leaving certificate courses. In excess of 30,000 pupils are already availing of VEC courses which contribute greatly to them having an opportunity to return to the workplace, change career or get an excellent qualification, even though they may have left school early in life. I want to refer to some recent experiences in the Lucan, Palmerstown and Ballyfermot areas of my constituency, where I saw headlines stating "Ballyfermot VEC College to lose 9 teachers". However, when one goes on to read the actual story that is printed, what is stated is that the principal is readjusting staff and there is every possibility there will be no loss of teachers. It was reported that six teachers could be lost on post-leaving certificate courses in VEC colleges in the County Dublin area. Again, upon a review of this story, it now seems clear to me and to the Department of Education and Skills that, with adjustments, there will be no loss of teaching posts. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, like all other Ministers, has an exceptionally difficult job to find savings in the 2013-14 budget. Today, we need to ask ourselves why the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has to do this. The reason is very simple. Education, like other sectors, has suffered because of the actions of the previous Fianna F√°il-led Governments over a 14-year period. It is Fianna F√°il which recklessly brought this country to economic ruin. I am not sure whether teachers, adult education-goers or, indeed, union representatives fully appreciate how close this country came to bankruptcy. I recall the Minister, Deputy Quinn, when speaking in this House last year, stated that Michael Collins had more resources and better opportunities at the foundation of the State than our current Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan. I believe education is one of the keys to getting us out of the current economic crisis. I am a huge advocate of adult education and, from the many different experiences in previous careers and, in particular, from working as a community volunteer in my constituency, I know the contribution that night school, back to education courses and mature student availability in universities have played in the improvement of individuals' quality of life and opportunity in both changing career and developing their own self-esteem and their own knowledge base. This time last year, there were pickets and protests outside the gates of Leinster House because of what were then seen to be difficulties with the pupil-teacher ratio and SNAs. This year, it is PLC courses and VEC funding that get the attention from the Opposition, particularly Fianna F√°il and Sinn F√©in. In the circumstances, I believe this represents nothing other than political opportunism to clutch at any issue that will give them the opportunity to increase their popularity in the opinion polls - short-term gain indeed. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has my full support in his efforts to ensure that every person seeking a place in school, college or university will have an opportunity for education. However, this has to be measured so we continue to protect the most vulnerable and ensure that savings and budgets are met, given what this Government inherited from the Administrations of the previous 14 years. In conclusion, I am very confident that the CEOs of our VEC colleges and institutes of technology have the capacity to reorganise courses, to take into consideration natural wastage, retirement and so on, so there will be no loss of teachers and no reduction in the range of courses and subjects available. That is what matters most. The CEOs of VEC colleges and the principals of our colleges have the capacity to work with the Department to meet the challenges that were inherited by the Minister, Deputy Quinn. Therefore, I reject this opportunistic and irresponsible proposal put forward by Fianna F√°il once again.

I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the matter. The further education sector that has developed in Ireland, through the VECs, is strong and successful. Colleges in my area, such as Inchicore College of Further Education and Ballyfermot College of Further Education, are great examples of what can be achieved with relatively limited resources. They continue to punch above their weight in giving people the skills they need to gain employment and build careers. They allow people who otherwise might not have an opportunity to pursue further education, to forge a path into employment and to gain acclaimed professional qualifications. People who perhaps had poor initial experiences of education and have struggled to secure employment are, as a result, given a second chance. Others who might have left education to find a well-paid job, for example, in the construction sector or elsewhere, can return to education and refine and upgrade their skills for the new, emerging economy. The further education sector is responsive and flexible, working with and within communities and responding to community needs and the needs of the local workforce. It creates a vital continuum between education, training and work, ensuring that graduates leave colleges of further education with skills and certification relevant to the labour market. In the life of this Government so far, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has shown his commitment to further education and training with, for example, the creation of the education and training boards and of SOLAS. He is putting further education and training firmly within our educational framework, which is a very progressive step. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, is also playing his part in tackling the unemployment crisis we face through the Springboard initiative and the new and very exciting Momentum initiative, which are providing thousands of places in education programmes for unemployed people.These programmes are targeted directly at existing job vacancies and skills shortages and contain worthwhile work experience elements. The Department of Social Protection invests nearly ‚Ç¨1 billion each year under this heading, in community employment, JobBridge, T√∫s and elsewhere. In the budget the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, announced an additional 10,000 places on these schemes, including a new local authority activation scheme, which I look forward to seeing implemented as soon as possible. Further education has an important role to play in these activation measures. The Minister for Social Protection published a report earlier this week which shows that last year approximately 25,000 people received the back-to-education allowance from her Department. This allowance supports people in their efforts to return to education to gain new skills and find employment. Of the recipients, 66% attend third level institutions while the remaining 34% attend second level and PLC courses. A total of 20% of all participants on PLC courses are supported by the back-to-education allowance. Colleges of further education are the backbone of this provision. The decision to increase the pupil-teacher ratio in colleges of further education by two points, from 17:1 to 19:1, is regrettable. It has been made, however, in the context of a budget adjustment of ‚Ç¨3.5 billion in 2013 by a Minister faced with finding savings of ‚Ç¨90 million in his Department - a Department that I, the Minister and the entire Labour Party would rather see protected in its entirety, although circumstances do not allow that. As one of the biggest-spending Departments, in this time of national crisis it cannot be protected in its entirety. I hope that when the economic context improves, as I am convinced it will, we will be able to reverse the impact of this decision and ensure that further education will be fully resourced. The people who laid this motion before the House today are the architects of the difficult context in which this decision was taken. The recent budget, including this measure for further education, was part of the Government‚Äôs mission to rebuild an economy shattered by Fianna F√°il, to exit the troika bailout entered into by Fianna F√°il, to balance a budget that was allowed to spiral out of control by Fianna F√°il, to create employment to replace hundreds of thousands of jobs lost under Fianna F√°il, and to undo the catastrophic damage inflicted on our society by Fianna F√°il. The Government will succeed in its mission. This measure aside, the Minister did a fantastic job in framing the education budget. Despite needing to find savings of ‚Ç¨90 million he was able to protect the disadvantaged in our education system, and particularly the DEIS schools. I am sure Fianna F√°il will agree that this is a remarkable achievement, given the mess they left for him. One of the arguments the Minister made yesterday was that, in this time of limited resources, it is hard to justify a preferential staffing ratio for colleges of further education over second level schools, but we must be clear that there is a radical difference between second level schools and colleges of further education, as well as the rest of that sector, which must be treated differently.

These courses need more flexibility and more teacher specialisation. I hope that in future we will be able to ensure these colleges of further education have all the resources they need. When one considers the scope and scale of innovation and reform undertaken by this Minister and his colleague, the Minister of State, who is present here, one is in Donogh O‚ÄôMalley territory. I am reassured by Deputy Quinn‚Äôs commitment to restore to full the resources-----

In the 2008-2010 era, when the nature of the situation finally dawned on Fianna F√°il and the Independents who supported them, including one Independent from my constituency, we saw savage cuts in the education sector.

That is important. The primary sector is the most important area in our education system. It covers the formative years that we absolutely need to protect. I feel very strongly about this. It is an area in which we need to invest further in the future, and I hope we will see that happen. Once this country keeps the type of solid government it now has, compared with the ridiculous Government that was there for 14 years exercising the politics of lunacy, there will be some chance for our future generations. In considering the overall education sector, we need to examine the cost of service provision at the higher education level where there is scope for major savings. We need to study the cost of service provision. We need to grasp the opportunity in the discussions on the second Croke Park agreement to achieve major savings across the sector and protect the vital front-line services that will pay dividends for every community in our country and society.

I wish to be positive towards those who tabled the motion. It is a good one because there is no sector in Irish society in which we witness more discrimination than education. I have no objections in principle to such a motion, but it would be dishonest to pretend that the Minister could somehow ring-fence everything in education at a time when we are borrowing ‚Ç¨41 million per day from our nearest neighbours. It would be impossible. I doubt that has ever happened in a democracy at any time in the past. No Department was going to escape, given our financial circumstances. If the Members opposite are concerned about discrimination in education, there are areas of far greater discrimination than the one they have highlighted, which is that of PLC courses.I point out to Members opposite and to the Sinn F√©in group, which presented an amendment to their motion, that there are many greater examples of discrimination. The thread of thinking is the same. The greatest discrimination that takes place in this jurisdiction in terms of tilting educational opportunities against those who are less well-off, or who are the children of those less well-off, is the fact that for 40 years the party opposite - and Sinn F√©in also because not one of its members mentioned this fact during the debate on the education budget - has supported 55 private schools getting ‚Ç¨103 million as a subsidy from the taxpayers of this State. Such schools do not get this money in Northern Ireland or in any part of Scotland, England or Wales. If those Members are concerned about discrimination in education they should not stay up all night on the basis of the motion they proposed. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves for that ‚Ç¨103 million. The current Minister for Education, along with his Department, is the first Minister in the history of the State to have reduced this subsidy in any way. The reduction for this year was ‚Ç¨6 million although I would have preferred if it had been ‚Ç¨60 million. My position about the 55 private fee-paying schools is well known; I do not believe they should get a euro. However, in fairness, the Minister and his Department are the first to tackle this problem. I refer again to another area of discrimination in education, the literacy issue. A speaker referred to Fianna F√°il's 14 year period in office. At present 17% of children at second level have difficulties in reading and writing. I know where the ‚Ç¨103 million that goes to 55 private schools should be going. However, the problem of literacy continued to grow while Fianna F√°il was in office because it was not a priority. The party members can check out this Minister and his Department for themselves. For the first time there is a programme to deal with literacy issues, which is almost exclusively dedicated to children of working-class parents. The Minister, Deputy Quinn, has for the first time tackled the issue in the most substantial way possible. I wish to acknowledge that for the record. Perhaps we could all work together to have fairness in education and not have an educational system which is exclusively for the great and the good, the privileged of society. The way to have fairness in education is to tilt it in favour of those who have literacy problems.

The opportunity to speak on education and related issues is always welcome because the value of education can never be overstated. Increasingly, with the passage of time, we see the many highs and lows in other different sectors and areas of society and the economy and we realise the staying power of education and the productive benefit it has for all who are fortunate enough to avail of it. Therefore, any debate on this subject is important. There are many students in the House today listening to the debate so it is important to go to basics and not to get too tied up in the political angle. If we stand back and look at our economy most of us will agree with the diagnosis. The single greatest threat to the next generation, to its future and well-being, is unemployment. Everybody in this House will recognise and accept that. Where we differ is in the prescription and how to deal with it. This motion argues that the pupil-teacher ratio should have been maintained in post leaving certificate courses. The reality is that ‚Ç¨90 million was the agreed figure for this. Every Member in the House will understand and appreciate that this figure had to be reduced in the education budget because we are living in very different times. I do not agree with borrowing more and more money which ultimately will go onto the shoulders of the next generation - the people in the Gallery, my children at home and the children of the next generation will have to pay for it. To continue with the status quo is not an option for us. Nobody likes change and politicians live by that weakness in society, hopping on horseback whenever the opportunity arises. People do not like change, they will object and politicians are the cheerleaders in this regard, depending on whether they have the responsibility of governance or the luxury of opposition. We are all guilty of the same trait; that is a fact. I believe that in trying to save ‚Ç¨90 million, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, and the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, made the right decision. This is the lesser of the evils. Politics is about options and tough, difficult choices but, most important, it is about the right choices. As a former educationalist and as a parent of young children going to school, I consider this change far preferable than to have the pupil-teacher ratio affected or levelled off in primary or secondary schools. A parallel cannot be drawn between the PLC courses, which involve motivated adult learners, and secondary schools. In almost every education debate in which I have spoken in this House, I welcomed above and beyond all else that the Minister and his Minister of State were not forced or, more important, did not choose, to cut resources to special needs pupils and those with learning difficulties and challenges. For me, that is always a top priority and must be protected - everything else is on the table. I cannot countenance the other situation, having seen in my career in the education system the way these resources have evolved and the impact they have had on the needs of children with special learning challenges. I am delighted to welcome another budget which has protected the number of resource teachers and SNAs in the system. I refer again to change, which is necessary. We must look at the solutions and prescriptions we are doling out. I am involved in a jobs initiative in west Cork along with some of the leading employers in the west Cork region. We meet once a month with a view to trying to diagnose a solution for the problem of unemployment and there is no doubt that education plays a key role here. I spent the morning in committee where the Bill on education and training boards is on Committee Stage. Many initiatives, such as SOLAS and ETBs and other new developments, are being taken by the Department of Education and Skills and I welcome every one of them. We must be more creative in how we upskill. The big challenge for us is to identify the shortage of skills. One can consider an initiative such as CoderDojo which is strongly supported by the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon. I look forward to joining the Clonakilty group on Friday with my children. That initiative cost absolutely nothing but it recognised a flaw in our current education system and has gone about addressing it on a completely cost-neutral basis. This is the kind of thinking in which we must engage as legislators. It is just one initiative albeit an extremely powerful one. We are wasting time talking in this Private Members' debate which, let us be honest, is only showboating. It would have been far superior if we had a more productive, progressive and constructive conversation about the real challenges in addressing the unemployment crisis in this country.

Sometimes I read these motions and get angry at them or laugh at them. However, I listened to the debate last night in which speakers were criticising the numbers in PLC courses, complaining that the pupil-teacher ratio had changed from 17:1 to 19:1. That was a bit sad. We are talking about adults who want to attend a course and are willing to sit there, to learn and listen. This is not primary school. When Deputy Dara Calleary and I were in primary school there were probably more than 40 in our class. These are adults. Surely to God it is okay to have 19 adults learning in a room. If one goes to any lecture hall or theatre there may be hundreds present to listen to a lecture. Let us cop ourselves on. We are living in different times. We do not have the money we used to have and we know where the blame for that lies - with the party opposite. We do not have the money any longer and must make changes. There have to be cuts. It is truly ridiculous to criticise an area of this kind where the pupil-teacher ratio has been slightly moved, especially given that the number of places has stayed the same and has not been reduced. During Fianna F√°il's time there was a budget cut in 2009 to grants for physics and chemistry. That is what the party decided to cut in the current climate. It also decided to cut funding for the Centre for Talented Youth, which was very clever. Grants for home economics were abolished. There were 200 fewer primary teachers and 200 fewer secondary teachers.

This is not about putting 19 people into a classroom where there were previously 17; this is about 500 jobs that will be gone because of the change.

This is the big danger. We have heard much, particularly from the Labour Party, about discrimination. This is discrimination. This time last year we were talking about the attack by the Labour Party on DEIS schools which it had to reverse and, now it is going after the PLC and further education sector, many of which are located in the same areas. It is a sector that I often wish, when I see the courses on offer, was available in my time. The courses it offers throughout the country are different and are responsive. It is a sector that is unbelievably flexible. In the education sector, which everybody admits is usually completely inflexible, the PLC sector has been able to get approval and provide courses in the shortest timeframe in response to the demands of employers. That is the reason it provides courses in information technology such as cloud computing and ethical hacking. I too acknowledge the work done by the Minister of State, Deputy Cannon, in CoderDojo, but there is no sense in training and inspiring a whole generation of teenagers about IT and their role in it if we cut off their access. If they do not wish to attend third level institutions or universities there are PLC courses that are perfect for them, but they are being withdrawn. This is not about putting two extra bodies in the classroom but about the undermining of an entire sector which has shown itself to be innovative and responsive and, in many of its courses, quite exciting.

Today the Government will meet at 2.30 p.m. for a special meeting on the jobs action plan. The only thing that will come out of that meeting is headlines and it will be forgotten about again. I said already this morning that I tabled a parliamentary question to each Minister on what their Departments did in 2012 on the jobs action plan. I have received detailed responses and we are going through them to see what is real. The best response I got was from the Minister for Finance, the man who writes the cheques - perhaps the real Taoiseach. He said it was not a matter for him but a matter for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The Minister for Finance has washed his hands of the jobs initiative. It appears that in the changes to the PLC courses we have a Government that says it responds to the skills shortage. The Joint Committee on Education and Skills, chaired by Deputy Damien English, has drawn up a fantastic document on skills shortages, on which I compliment Senator Deirdre Clune. The Minister has undermined the PLC sector, which has been so responsive and flexible. Taking 500 jobs out of the sector will not do anything to address the skills shortage. Much has been said about F√ÅS and SOLAS. The work in respect of SOLAS was under way in the Department of Education and Skills prior to the arrival of the Minister, Deputy Ruair√≠ Quinn. It was under way when the former T√°naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Mary Coughlan, was in office. I cannot recall whether it was Deputy English or Deputy Eamonn Maloney who said the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair√≠ Quinn, would be the new Donogh O'Malley. I am afraid not.

Let us look at the people who use PLC courses. They are people who are taking a second chance - people who may have been out of employment for some time and have decided to follow all the advice, to improve their skills and gain new ones and see where the demand is. The Minister represents a constituency that is a model in terms of further education.Ballyfermot Senior College is a model for the further education sector. Its work is amazing and replicated in Castlebar and Galway in the Minister of State's constituency. We are undermining the ability of the unemployed to access second chance education courses by imposing this cut. We are saying they should be given a second chance, but we are cutting them off at the legs when they attempt to take that opportunity.  I have listened to all the praise for the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton - give me a break. If she was still in opposition and my party introduced this cut - something we would not have done - she would be heard from Malin Head to Mizen Head. She says she will provide extra places, but last year the number of extra places amounted to just over 5,000 at a time when 515,000 people were unemployed. The one sector in a position to respond will face cuts. Surely the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair√≠ Quinn, could have co-ordinated a response with the Minister for Social Protection. They could have decided that this was the sector producing the goods and which was flexible. It does not take 20 years to approve and design a course, by which time it is irrelevant. Surely between the two Departments a solution could be found for the sector that would deliver. That no places will be cut is a falsehood because we all know that many colleges are over quota because they do not want to turn people away who want to avail of the opportunities provided by PLC courses. The skills and ability of local management are to be cut. I refer to the variety of courses available which include cloud computing, ethical hacking - an interesting course, computer network infrastructure support, computer network management and smart technology application development. These are things which control our lives. The development of applications - app development - is an area in which money is to be made on a large scale. One does not need big IDA backup to set up an app development business. It does not require large factory space. People have ideas for application development. I would never be able to do it, but those with the ideas want to learn the skills, but we are taking that chance away from them. This week another traditional retail icon has gone to the wall. These courses are designed to upskill retail staff in order that they can provide a better service for the customer. That opportunity will be cut, which does not make sense.  I am not making a political point, but I note that the Government system operates in silos, so to speak. For example, a decision taken in the Department of Education and Skills will have consequences for the Department of Social Protection because more people will be driven towards social welfare schemes. We need to abolish the silo mentality. The Department of Education and Skills should have decided to work in partnership with the Department of Social Protection. The cost will be ‚Ç¨90 million and opportunities will be lost. That ‚Ç¨90 million will now be spent by the Department of Social Protection because people who had been willing to return to education will be forced to apply for jobseeker's allowance. There is a chorus about 14 wasted years, but it seems to be a case of shooting the messenger. I agree with Deputy Jim Daly - education is opportunity. It is the key which every four year-old child is given when he or she starts school. We need to ensure every person is given that key and can use it to the best of his or her ability. However, some fall between the cracks for various reasons. PLC courses give such persons a second chance at a time when they may be in a better position to access education. It demonstrates to the business and industry sectors that the education system can be responsive, yet the cuts are to proceed. I presume from the tenor of the contributions of Labour Party Members that on this occasion, unlike last year, there is no cabal led by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte to beat up the Minister for Education and Skills on this issue. We are not showboating on this side of the House; we do not have time to showboat, rather we are highlighting a very serious issue which will be slow burning because the cuts will be made in dribs and drabs. They will not be reported in The
Irish Times or the Irish Independent and Joe Duffy will not be talking about them. As a result of these cuts, right around the country potentially hundreds of people will have a future denied to them. They had decided to pursue a course and the PLC sector fitted their needs and abilities. Many of those who use the PLC sector may have had bad experiences in the education sector and the PLC sector was designed to facilitate them to return to upskill to gain employment, yet this sector has been targeted for the biggest cut.  I congratulate the Minister who did well in protecting his budget. However, he is no Donogh O'Malley and never will be. Donogh O'Malley would not have stood over the mess that is SUSI.  Deputy Eamonn Maloney referred to discrimination. The Minister specifically discriminated against rural schools last year when they were chosen as the target for a very specific cut in the pupil-teacher ratio to be made over three years. That is discrimination and he would have tried to get away with it had it not been for Labour Party backbenchers and Fianna F√°il. He attempted to completely undermine the DEIS system. I must check out his amazing initiative on literacy. During the period of 14 years to which Members opposite refer school completion rates rose to record levels because of the investment at primary and secondary level; capital investment was made in all aspects of the education system during that period.  This cut of ‚Ç¨90 million will not be reversed, but we will continue to highlight it. The Government is digging in on the issue, but backbenchers had their Weetabix this morning, judging from the tenor of the contributions made. If there is an underspend in the Department at the end of the year, which is possible, this is the sector which needs to get the money. I ask the Minister to look after a sector which has provided so many niche opportunities. I ask him to ensure any unspent moneys will be allocated to this sector in order to alleviated the effects of the cuts to be made. I am disappointed Deputy Damien English portrayed the effect as having two extra participants in a PLC course. He is a very genuine politician, but if that is the level of understanding on the Government side of the House of the effects of the cuts, we have a far bigger problem in understanding the importance of skills training.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	150	T√° √°thas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an √°bhar seo. I am very pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is necessary to have an overview of where the Government is making cuts. As has been pointed out by my colleagues, they can be made in three places. The first is in rural schools. We know that the rural schools system works. Maps showing areas of social disadvantage show many rural areas fit into this category. On the other hand, with regard to levels of educational attainment, rural areas score as high as urban areas. The Minister is, therefore, trying to break a system that has been working for generations. Both he and staff in the Department have an ideological hang-up when it comes to small rural communities. It is well known that the Minister believes we should all live in towns and cities. In his view, the traditional settlement pattern is wrong and outdated. According to him, we should conform to some continental model.He then targeted the DEIS schools in band 1. Despite what any map shows, the reality is that when examining social and educational disadvantage, one should examine the areas in which the DEIS schools operate. We have witnessed the demise of the RAPID programme under the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan. We know that the very day children are born in RAPID areas, they are at a disadvantage. Instead of trying to minimise disadvantage systematically, as Fianna F√°il was trying to do, the current Minister tried last year to compound it. The areas with the lowest level of access to third level education are disadvantaged urban areas. While there are people throughout the country who do not proceed to third level education, only 10% to 20% of students from RAPID areas reach third level. Therefore, those who most need access to PLC courses and further education, and who require the chance to do the leaving certificate, are those in the very areas of which the Labour Party would always claim to be the champion. Despite this, these are the areas targeted for the cut. We hear a lot of easy talk around here that class sizes are being increased only by two. Those who are making these statements obviously have no experience of PLC or adult education. Owing to the wide variety of courses that must be offered, the reality is that class sizes will be small, by definition. This is because the courses are necessarily technical and specialised, unlike Irish, English and mathematics as taught in an ordinary school. The classes are small because the demand is low in certain places. Making a comparison with university, where there may be 300 students in a lecture theatre, is an absolute nonsense. Anybody who went to third level will know the lecture is part of what one is offered but that one also gets tutorials. There are some very small specialised classes in universities. If one calculated the total number of staff, including graduate staff, in any university and compared it with the number of students, one would find the pupil-teacher ratio is very good. I am fascinated by how slow the Minister is to curb the excesses in universities. Let us be honest: universities still spend money in many cases in a way that any other organisation, including the Government, could only dream of. If adult education had to be subject to a cut, why was it not where it could be carried? We must always recognise that those who have had advantages in life, be they associated with their background, family or good education, will always swim to the top. Those who need the most support are those who have experienced disadvantage or those who might not have had an education, for all sorts of reasons. There is a direct relationship between employment attainment and one's employability. Those with degrees, even degrees that are not directly relevant to the job being applied for, have a significant advantage over those who do not have a leaving certificate. Therefore, if we want to deal with the long-term, intractable unemployment problem, we must ensure educational attainment for those without a leaving certificate. Specialised education for those with a special skill that does not match the skills covered in the general curriculum will likely result in their being employed. If we do not achieve this, we will consign the cohort in question to a life of unemployment. That is absolutely terrible for them and not good for society. The decisions regarding disadvantage may not seem serious on their own but if they are all stacked on top of one another, one suddenly realises there is considerable compounding of attention against very vulnerable groups, which the Government seems to be targeting all the time. We have pointed out time and again the manner in which the Minister for Social Protection seems very much set on targeting families and women. A plethora of Ministers seem to have as their great goal in government the demise of rural Ireland. It seems the urban disadvantaged are also very much in the Ministers' sights. For the life of me, I do not know what the urban disadvantaged have done to offend the Government. Let us consider the compounding of three decisions. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government has decided to withdraw the co-ordinators from the RAPID programme. He has effectively wound down the programme in full and is not holding any meetings of the RAPID co-ordinating committee. We had been making significant progress in giving people a say within their communities, with the scientific focus on the urban communities facing the greatest disadvantage. The Minister for Social Protection said she would add to this step by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and consequently she has put in her penny's worth of attack. She has withdrawn the allowance that enables people to buy the books required to attend courses and she has reduced the back-to-education allowance, which is focused very much on those on low incomes. The Minister for Education and Skills says he will top that by attacking further education and PLC courses. People have argued that we should not get political about this. While the Government keeps pointing out that there is a fixed amount of money, which we all accept, it should note the real issue concerns what it should do with that money. The reality is that it has made its choices. The Opposition has a perfect right and obligation to pose alternatives to those choices if it disagrees with them and to ask the public to make up its mind on them. The Government has two mantras. It blames everything on what my party was doing in government. When one reads Government scripts, be they from the Department of Education and Skills or the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, one realises it claims as its own the reforming decisions that the former Government was making. I was amazed to hear the current Government talk about SOLAS. On the first day of my term in office as Minister for Social Protection under former Taoiseach Brian Cowen, it was decided that the skills side of F√ÅS would be the responsibility of the then Department of Education and Science and that the labour activation and employment engagement sides would be the responsibility of the Department of Social Protection. That happened on 28 March 2010. By 1 January 2011, F√ÅS was already under the ambit of the two Departments. The current Government, which is so critical of everything we did, has tried to claim responsibility for this. Since we are talking about what we had in mind, let us remember that by placing activation under the remit of the Department of Social Protection, we were saying that everybody in receipt of a long-term unemployment payment would have the opportunity, on a continuous basis, either to engage in education or to participate on a training or work scheme to the benefit of the community instead of being paid to do nothing or being penalised for becoming active.The Government has thrown out that big idea but if it wants to take on board another idea, and we would praise it for doing so, it should complete the work we had started in our time in government. It is utterly ridiculous to be paying the 200,000 who are long-term unemployed and telling them to do nothing rather than inviting them to make a contribution to society, as we know they would wish to do. Deputy Maloney spoke about fee paying schools. The Minister for Education and Skills has a good knowledge of fee paying schools and he knows the complexity of the issue. Instead of pretending that these issues are all simple and one just needs to pull the ‚Ç¨100 million, it is time for the Minister to be upfront and explain to the likes of Deputy Maloney the reasons this is not so simple. For the past month and more there have been nightly protests in the North which are to do with the perceptions of communities in regard to disadvantage. One of the things this State set out to do to the best of its ability, and which it did, was to try to ensure that religious minorities in this State were fairly treated. The Minister of State opposite and the Minister, Deputy Quinn, know that the difficulty with the issue in regard to the private schools relates to the fact that it would have a huge effect on the minority or the Protestant schools. One cannot discriminate between religions and if one is going to make a exception of Protestant private schools, one cannot refuse to allow the Catholic schools have the same dispensation.  It is time we stopped codding ourselves that there was some wrong or selfish interest or that we had a particular interest in private schools. I come from the same neck of the woods as the Minister of State. I went to a non-fee paying school and he went to a fee paying school. That was his right and the right of his parents and the other choice was the right of my parents. I come from a background where the choice was made to select the non-fee paying school but I do not pretend it is a simple issue to withdraw the grants. It is important that the Minister of State explains to his Labour Party colleagues that this is a highly complex issue and that the last thing we should do in this State is to be seen for some political cheapshot to take steps that would discriminate unfairly against the minority faith communities here and that would give ammunition to those who would want to say that we have not treated all of the citizens of this State equally.

I welcome the opportunity to address the House on what I consider to be a very important issue. It is entirely appropriate that we highlight the importance of our further education system and its aligned training sector both as part of our education system, which promotes lifelong learning, and as part of our country's future in terms of providing reskilling and upskilling opportunities for our citizens and in particular the very large number of people who are unemployed. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Quinn, made a point last night that deserves repeating, namely, that for far too long the further education sector has been something of a Cinderella in our education sector. Our debate in this House is at long last a welcome indication that we are making progress in bringing that sector forward and giving it a unique identity all of its own. The Government is leading on that both through maintaining and consolidating investment in further education and training to ensure that it has a sustainable future. It has introduced an ambitious programme of reforms to ensure that it can adequately meet the challenges of the 21st century. Chief among those reforms is the establishment of SOLAS, the new further education and training authority. We are abolishing F√ÅS and transferring its training provision to our new network of education and training boards, ETBs. SOLAS will have a role in a distinct and integrated further education and training sector not unlike the role played by the HEA for higher education.  For many Deputies the debate on the sector has focused on the budget decision to raise the pupil-teacher ratio in post-leaving certificate courses from 17:1 to 19:1. While it would have been preferable to avoid such a decision the Government saw that it was necessary at this point in time to protect front-line services to our children to ensure they can get the very best possible start in life. It was hard to justify a more favourable pupil-teacher ratio in the post-leaving certificate, PLC, sector which is geared mainly to very motivated adults rather than teenagers. I would highlight the fact that across the further and higher education training sectors the Government will provide more than 430,000 part-time and full-time places, including 32,688 approved PLC places, all of which are open to young people and adults including the unemployed.  Alongside the substantial reforms we are making across the education sector, the Department of Social Protection is fundamentally reorganising the public employment service with the creation of Intreo alongside a newly integrated further education and training sector as well as innovative schemes in higher education such as Springboard. I am confident we can continue to meet the needs of unemployed people who want to upskill or reskill to re-enter the labour market. I take this opportunity to acknowledge publicly the very hard work that has been done by staff and management in VECs who are responsible for the vast majority of further education delivery. I also acknowledge the hard work of F√ÅS staff. It is without prejudice to the efforts of those staff that we are abolishing F√ÅS and transferring its training provision to the network of ETBs.  Earlier Deputy Calleary correctly described the PLC and VEC sector as being very innovative and responsive. I have every confidence in the management and staff of that sector to be equally innovative and responsive in responding to the challenge, and I acknowledge it is a challenge, of increasing the pupil-teacher ratio from 17:1 to 19:1 to ensure that the provision in the PLC sector responds effectively to the demands of the labour market and empowers those who access those courses to re-enter the labour market in a very short space of time. In the coming period it would be vital for us all, including staff and management in F√ÅS and the VECs, to work in partnership. We are faced with an array of challenges and I am confident that based on our progress so far we will deal successfully with them.

If one had left this country and was away for two years and had read the press releases about the cuts in education, one would have assumed that the Minister responsible for the Department was somewhere right of Genghis Khan because one would not believe that it could be a Labour Minister. There has been a sustained attack on the disadvantaged by the Minister and the Department during the past two years. This time last year people were out on the streets throughout this country campaigning to get the pupil-teacher ratio restored to DEIS schools, schools which cater for those who are disadvantaged and which are on the front line of dealing with the most vulnerable people in our communities. What did the Government do? It cut places and supports to primary schools that are dealing with the most severe disadvantage in this State. There is now a sustained attack on the further education and adult education sector at the other end of the scale. It is not credible for the Minister of State or the senior Minister to say that "we have increased the pupil-teacher ratio by two". The Minister of State knows full well that the profile of most people in further education and going back to education is that they are already educationally disadvantaged. To say that because the Government increased the pupil-teacher ratio in private fee paying schools, it can justify it on the other side for cheap political point-scoring is the most disingenuous thing I have heard in this House in a long time. It is not acceptable for people to say that because we cut the pupil-teacher ratio in the private schools and colleges we are entitled to rip supports away from people who are already educationally disadvantaged. These people who are in the most difficult circumstances now that there is 14.6% unemployment want an opportunity to go back to education, and they need and deserve that, to gain opportunities for themselves at a time they are most vulnerable now that they are unemployed.For the Government to suggest this will have no impact is wrong. It will have a devastating impact on further and adult education courses. The Minister of State should not believe the nonsensical spin being put on it by the Department that the cuts will have no impact on courses in the further and adult education sector. We need honesty from the Department to restore budgets to ensure those from an educationally disadvantaged background will be given a second chance. For most of the people in question, the system has already failed them and the Government is now deliberately targeting them with the result that they will never have a chance or an opportunity. The Minister of State has said the further and adult education sector is the Cinderella of the education sector. If it is, not only is the Government taking the glass slipper off her, but it is also taking the clothes off her. This attack is an awful indictment of the Government and the Labour Party in particular. I have looked at the promises made prior to the general election and in the programme for Government. I cannot find in either the various manifestos or the programme for Government a statement that the Government would make cuts in the further and adult education sector. The Government is going against the very thing it said it would not do. It is, in effect, undermining the capacity of the State to make amends to people who fell through the cracks at primary and secondary education level. It must acknowledge that this is a grave error. If it speaks about social justice, equality, parity of esteem and giving people a second chance, these cuts are anything but. I am disgusted by the PR spin in the Department that disadvantage is something that can be attacked on a continual basis. It is shameful to take funding from DEIS schools and further and adult education programmes when another part of the education sector is short a few million euro. The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair√≠ Quinn, is a member of the Labour Party, a party that always championed the disadvantaged when it was on this side of the House. Now that the shoe is on the other foot the Minister has singularly failed. He has failed because he does not understand what disadvantage entails or the efforts people make to claw themselves back on to the opportunity ladder. The further and adult education sector is an integral part of that effort.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	153	I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on this important motion. I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, on his work in highlighting the attack the Government has made on an education sector that has proved to be very successful in the past decade and needs additional support because of its success with the increasing numbers attending further education colleges. I am familiar with the sector because I was the first chairman of the board of management of Cavan Institute. In the relatively small town of Cavan the institute has 1,300 day pupils and 500 night pupils enrolled. It will face a reduction of at least eight teachers if the cuts are introduced. The Teachers Union of Ireland has issued clear statements on the regressive steps taken in the budget that will affect this sector. Any of us who has attended graduation ceremonies at a further education institute will have seen the pride of the students, with their families, having attained a further education qualification. One of the greatest success stories in the past decade about which we seldom hear is the significant increase in participation in higher level education. By 2009, Ireland had achieved the highest participation rate in tertiary education in the European Union. This is a statistic about which current Government members never speak. One of the important ingredients was the progression of students through the further education sector. I have seen people from homes where there was no interest in education get a chance to attend Cavan Institute to pursue a FETAC or other approved course. Many of them went on to attend an institute of technology or a university to achieve a third level qualification. Not only did many of them attain a primary degree but they also went on to conduct postgraduate research. It is absolutely reprehensible that the Government has attacked this sector. The Minister of State, Deputy Ciar√°n Cannon, has claimed this is the first time the further education sector has been given its own identity. It is right that it is to be given its own identity but one could not do so if it were not for its success and high participation rates. While we welcome the new proposals for the new structures of the further education sector, the amalgamation of vocational education committees and the establishment of SOLAS, Seirbh√≠s√≠ Oideachais Leanunaigh agus Scileanna, this work was begun before March 2011 when the Government took office. I hope the new structures will be more successful than those put in place by the Government to administer the higher education grants system. I also hope the necessary preparatory work is done to ensure the new systems will work and that we will not have the dreadful failures experienced in the case of SUSI, Student Universal Support Ireland. It is deplorable that further education and Youthreach programmes are under attack. All Members know the importance of these programmes to young people who have not taken a traditional route in the education system to have a second chance to obtain educational qualifications.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	154	I have had a lifelong involvement and interest in further education and have served on the boards of management of a variety of colleges of further education in my native city of Cork. I was also the education Minister who introduced the first student grants system for students at colleges of further education and initiated the first major capital investment programme in the colleges. The results have had a significant impact on learners. One of the great lessons of the past 14 years is that we did succeed in transforming the education system to create pathways for people, irrespective of background, to be given a second chance. The Government‚Äôs problem is that it is seeking underhand and sneaky ways to implement cuts. It is picking out sectors so as to avoid adopting a more generic approach to the system and hoping it will get away with it. Hence, we see a two point increase in the pupil-teacher ratio for colleges of further education. This is unprecedented in its scale and I have never before witnessed such an increase in one year. The impact on colleges of further education will be dramatic. One cannot apply the pupil-teacher model for primary and secondary schools to colleges of further education. It is not just about increasing class size but also removing specialist teachers in a variety of courses.  The sector is synonymous with innovation and diversity, with courses ranging from cloud computing to animal husbandry, music management to dance, as well as animation so celebrated in Hollywood with the success of Ballyfermot Senior College. All of these courses require specialist involvement and recruiting people for a period of six hours to teach a particular module. Those teachers with security of tenure will not lose their jobs. In essence, however, the Government is pulling the temporary specialists providing short-term courses out of the system.By doing this, the Minister is reducing and eliminating courses. In many of these colleges if there were 50 places on two given courses the number will be reduced to 22 because of this decision. The Minister is removing choice and opportunity for people who need it. Another key strength of the sector has been its connectivity with the marketplace, industry and the place of work. It is ironic. We realise that the situation is difficult but the troika has pointed out time and again that individual spending and tax decisions remain at the discretion of the Government. Therefore, the Government has choices and that is important to remember. The Government has issued statements to the effect that it has reviewed every area of spending and that it has developed a strategically visionary approach to spending. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, was at it again this morning saying the same thing. We know that the reality is different from the rhetoric. There was a jobs budget. What did the Government state at the launch of the jobs budget more than one and a half years ago? It stated that further education and training were the core of its plan to revive the economy. Last year the Taoiseach made a presentation to European leaders recommending that they follow his approach to further education and training. Then, when it came to the budget, the Government cuts the legs from under one of the most important sectors in further education and training which has provided thousands of places throughout the years and thousands of opportunities and placements. In the European Parliament yesterday the Taoiseach said that the fight against youth unemployment was his absolute priority. For people watching, including students in these colleges, this is why politics is like something in a foreign land. They read these statements but they must live with the reality they are experiencing, which is that there will not be places for them next September in some of these courses, because they will be eliminated. The decision the Government has taken on colleges of further education makes a mockery of the language the Taoiseach used in the European Parliament yesterday. Independent international evaluations have been carried out and have repeatedly shown that this sector delivers for individuals, society and our economy. I was pleased when I read a report recently outlining a 90% completion rate at second level because of the policies we had introduced since 1998, including the school completion programme and provisions in other programmes. These programmes drive social mobility. The one chance we have to come out of this crisis is to protect education and ensure that it can continue to deliver progression and social mobility in the country at the level of the individual learner, collectively and for society as well. That is our way out of the crisis. It is extraordinary for the Government to have taken this decision. Let us consider the decision in the context of the jobs initiative, the alleged commitment to job creation and the chronic unemployment situation. There is a special Cabinet meeting today at which Ministers will be asked to bring forward proposals on unemployment. It makes no sense. What will the Minister for Education and Skills bring forward today? What will he say to the Cabinet? Will he say that the Department is cutting several thousand places from colleges of further education because he believes the sector has no relationship to jobs? It is a joke. There is no coherence or strategy whatsoever. What is more difficult to comprehend is not only that the Government is cutting the courses and places but it is cutting the financial incentives that we have had in place for more than a generation to encourage people back into education, including the back-to-education allowance, the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, and a range of measures that have helped people and provided a financial underpinning for them to get back into education. The Government has cut these at the same time that it has cut places in colleges of further education. Up to 500 teachers will go as a result. Teachers have been impacted, colleges will be impacted as will their capacity to be innovative and to provide diversity of courses, but above all this decision will impact on the learner, the person who seeks to get on in life, who may have had challenges but who may wish to go back to education for a second chance, or who may not have attained the points to get into an institute of technology or a university this time around but who has a pathway through the colleges of further education to get there at some stage. We have cut off the opportunity for these learners. Shame on the Government for targeting in a selective way this sector of education to deliver savings to the Minister which he could have secured elsewhere, especially in terms of a universal charge increase as recommended by other parties in the House including the Labour Party, although it did not have the bottle to follow it through.

A number of issues were very prominent in public discourse in the 2011 general election. One of those was political reform, which was made prevalent by the significant distrust of our political institutions on the part of ordinary people and the many cases of corruption by the political class and those around it. Political reform became a buzz word. For some, it meant one thing and for others, something quite different. For those engaging in a grab for power and seeking to appeal to the simplest of arguments, political reform took on the meaning of slashing and burning democratic structures in order to give the impression that politics was changing. These measures remove people further from power and consolidate it in the hands of those who have controlled this State since its foundation without ever showing any real desire to bring about meaningful democratic reform which would put power in the hands of the people at every level and in every part of the State. Any moves towards democratic reform previously undertaken by Government have mostly been, as in this case, to remove power. What are the grand reforms proposed by this Government? The first measure I will deal with is the cut in the number of Deputies from 166 to 158. This will surely look attractive to an electorate that has become so disillusioned from years of corruption and bad governance but it is playing to the idea that all public representatives are wasteful and not worth paying for. It is the very issue against which the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources spoke recently when he challenged the popular sentiment that politics and everyone involved in it are rotten. We have all heard the arguments on doorsteps that we are all the same. I am not the same as the people who took the State down this terrible path and who gambled, lost and then sold out the people they claimed to represent. Many in this House are not like that and the argument that the less Deputies the better plays to the idea that we are all just elected "Seanie Fitzs".Sinn F√©in proposes to cut the cost of Deputies but not to reduce the representation of the people. Our proposal would save nearly twice what is proposed in this Bill. With fewer Deputies, people and non-mainstream views will have less representation. Ireland has become a much more diverse place in recent decades but with fewer Deputies these new views, ideas and backgrounds will have less chance to be heard. The last census found that the population had increased by 8.2% since 2006, which means Deputies represent more people than was previously the case. Our workload has also increased due to the current economic and political climate. Five constituencies are now in breach of the constitutional minimum standards for representation. One of them is my constituency of Dublin North-West, which is now to take in parts of Drumcondra and Glasnevin. Dublin North-West is a highly populated constituency which was recently highlighted in the map of deprivation produced by the International Centre for Local and Regional Development as containing a large number of areas of high or extreme disadvantage. The constituency returns three Deputies, which is the minimum figure permitted in our voting system, but it is now to expand. How can the Government make laws that blatantly contradict the Constitution? There is on average one Deputy for every 27,640 people. Given the trend of population growth and the possibility of emigrants returning in the future, this figure is dangerously close to the 30,000 mark. My party argues that local and general election boundaries should mirror each other. A person should not be in a local authority area that has the vast majority of its population in a different general election constituency because it is bad practice and makes the work of providing representation and services more difficult. However, under these so-called reforms, 22 of the 40 constituencies, in breach of the commission's own terms of reference, will cross county boundaries. My colleague, Deputy Stanley, has shown how his own constituency of Laois will take in six divisions from counties Kildare, Offaly and Tipperary. Sligo-Leitrim will also include parts of counties Cavan and Donegal. If there is sense in these proposals I am eager to find it. It is also essential to locate polling booths within reasonable distance of voters. It would make more sense to introduce boundary changes at European, national and local level simultaneously rather than by different commissions over time. I want to see the most accessible and representative democratic structure possible in this country. I want people to feel engaged in the decision-making process. If we are to carve a republic that has any hope of providing an equal, fair and just society, it is essential that people have a sense of ownership of the political infrastructure. They must not see it as adversarial or a necessary evil. These reforms do nothing to make that goal a reality and are a retrograde step. We are told these changes are a done deal. Maps have been circulated and politicians have produced literature outlining the changes for their respective constituencies. It would have been preferable to have had our debate before this happened. There are crossovers among local authority areas, including my own, in terms of local elections. Swords is closer to Ballymun and Finglas but the constituency includes parts of Blanchardstown, Swords and the Fingal side of Santry. These boundaries should reflect the general election constituencies. People have to travel long distances to polling booths. I have spoken to many people who have to travel from one end of the constituency to the other to vote. It is an affront to democracy that people should be required to do this. We should also take account of the types of people in the constituencies and how they travel around. Young people are becoming alienated by the thought of travelling long distances by bus. Women are also coming under huge pressure because they generally have other things to do than travel to the other end of a constituency to vote. Constituency boundaries have to be changed but it is important that any such changes are reflected at local and European level. I recognise that the Constitution requires proportionality of population and representation, but it is frustrating that boundaries constantly change from one election to the next. Politicians and voters are frustrated by this constant change. In the last local election sections of the area I represent were moved to another area and residents' associations had to begin an entirely new process of developing relationships with their representatives.

I was only two years old when the most infamous changes to D√°il constituencies took place in 1977 and the term "Tullymander" entered the Irish political vocabulary. The result of that episode, as well as one or two others, is that any change to electoral boundaries must be overseen by an explicitly independent authority. It is a fundamental feature of our democracy that the Constituency Commission is defined by law and is unfettered in its operations and activities. Any citizen in any constituency can make a submission to the commission on his views and opinions of its task. The current commission received more than 530 submissions, a substantial increase from 99 in 2004 and 335 in 2007. Furthermore, four out every five submissions were from a non-party-political person or organisation, thereby demonstrating an increasing and welcome engagement with politics among citizens. It is testament to the Government's commitment to transparency and fairness that the Electoral (Amendment) (D√°il Constituencies) Bill 2012 has been introduced speedily in order to legislate for the commission's findings.The Bill also contains measures which meet commitments given by the Government to reduce the number of Deputies to 158 and the number of constituencies to 40. These measures will save over ‚Ç¨2 million and are broadly welcome.  What are of more concern are the proposed changes to the constituencies. The commission worked on the basis of avoiding the breaching of county boundaries as far as practicable. As a result there was a false sense of security that constituencies, with one or two exceptions, would, more or less, adhere to county boundaries. It should be emphasised that county boundaries are recognised boundaries which have remained the same for centuries. However, the numbers failed to stack up, particularly in certain regions and most notably in the west. In a statement which caused trepidation in some quarters, the commission declared that an arrangement of constituencies based exclusively on county boundaries was not feasible. Breaches in county boundaries already in existence in constituencies, including in Carlow, Clare, Meath and Westmeath, will now be joined by new breaches in Cavan, Donegal, Galway, Kildare, Mayo and Tipperary. While I respect the decisions of the constituency commission and defend strongly its independence and impartiality, I appreciate the difficulties facing it in taking on board the constitutional and legislative requirements regarding D√°il representation and the number of Deputies. Nonetheless, I must express reservations regarding the abundance of county boundary breaches. It seems in the west and north west that in order to reunite the county of Leitrim, we are carving up counties across the region, including Cavan, Donegal, Mayo, Roscommon and Galway. My fear is that such large scale breaches in county boundaries will result in isolation and alienation from the national, political process and discourage political participation and voter turnout. It could be said that sufficient consideration has not been given to these consequences, because they are not a factor for Dublin or other major population centres. In my constituency, the commission's proposals will see a total of nine electoral divisions of Mayo and will include the transfer of Neale, Cong, Shrule, Garrymore and Ballinrobe to Galway West. The people of these areas are rightly proud of their Mayo roots, a county with its own newspapers, radio stations, county council, community organisations, sporting teams and so on. I appreciate their fears that their voice will somehow be drowned out by the influence of or focus on Galway, the larger county in the new configuration. I wish to assuage these concerns and pledge that as a Deputy I will represent the citizens of south Mayo to the best of my ability, if elected in the new Galway West-Southeast Mayo constituency. I will work for them, as I currently do for the citizens of Galway West. That said, I believe the situation whereby this area of Mayo is lumped in with a larger Galway West gives rise to huge concern that the voice of the people of that part of Mayo will be drowned out in this new configuration. If the commission had looked at the map, it might have noticed that the town of Headford, which is in Galway East, remains in Galway East although there is a large connection between south Mayo and Headford. Therefore, if the commission had looked properly at the maps, it could have come up with a fairer configuration. The Government must take action to ensure a smooth introduction of the proposed changes, by outlining, as soon as possible, the names of the new constituencies - if there are to be further changes from the document we have received - to better reflect the new configurations. It should also conduct an information campaign on the upcoming changes so that all citizens know who their representatives are in the national Parliament.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	168	I will share my time with Deputies Kevin Humphreys and Joanna Tuffy. The purpose of the Electoral (Amendment) (D√°il Constituencies) Bill is to provide for the number of members to be elected to D√°il √âireann, for the revision of constituencies and for the number of members to be elected for each constituency. The Bill implements the recommendations of the report of the constituency commission on constituencies and on the European Parliament constituencies. The commission was established under the Electoral Act 1997 to report on the constituencies for the election of members to D√°il √âireann and the European Parliament in light of the results of the 2011 census of population. This means that in line with the programme for Government, the number of Deputies elected to this House will be reduced. One of the most significant changes of the Bill will be to amalgamate two large constituencies, Dublin North-Central and Dublin North-East, where I have spent most all of my career as an elected representative. I am sorry to see Dublin North-East go, as I am sure are many people in politics, both currently and formerly. Some distinguished Dublin North-East Deputies have been Labour Party Deputies. James Larkin was a Labour Deputy in the 1930s and his son, Denis Larkin, was elected as a Labour Party Deputy in the 1950s and 1960s. Conor Cruise O'Brien was elected for Labour in the 1960s and 1970s. Noel Browne was also a Deputy in part of the constituency during the late 1970s. The environmentalist, Sean Dublin Bay Rockall Loftus, was elected as an Independent Deputy in the early 1980s. The new constituency now bears his name, which is a fitting tribute to him. However, not everyone is completely enamoured with the new constituency title. I met a Dublin North-East constituent recently who asked, when I told him that he would soon be in Dublin Bay North, whether that meant he would get more money for his house if he sold it. I could not answer that. We cannot refer to the demise of Dublin North-East without referring to Fianna F√°il's Charles J. Haughey, who in his time dominated the constituency like no other. When I first came to live in Raheny, he was the local political boss. His election campaigns have been written about before. At election time, I remember seeing builders' trucks going around putting up Fianna F√°il posters and leaving no room for any others to put up theirs. They also erected gigantic Fianna F√°il hoardings at strategic locations. One could not move anywhere in Dublin North-East without having CJ gazing sternly down at one. His election campaigning was the stuff of Tammany Hall type politics, which involved the spending of massive sums of money on electioneering, money that we now know belonged to somebody else. Most people knew that at the time, but just could not prove it. Thankfully that type of politics has now been consigned to the past.

Pat McCartan, now a justice of the Circuit Court, was a Deputy for the Workers Party in Dublin North-East in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Richard Mulcahy was a Dublin North-East Fine Gael Deputy in the 1930s. The only occasions on which two Labour Deputies were elected to Dublin North-East in the same election occurred in 1992 and again in the most recent general election in 2011. I remember both occasions very well indeed and I pay tribute to all of the members of the Dublin North-East Labour Party who campaigned for all of the Labour Party candidates who were elected to D√°il √âireann, as well as those candidates who stood for election under the Labour Party banner. It is worth mentioning that Dublin North-East was abolished once before. In the 1970s, the Dublin constituencies were completely rearranged and parts of Dublin North-East were allocated to Dublin-Artane and Dublin-Clontarf constituencies. This arrangement existed only for the 1977 general election and Dublin North-East was then restored again as a D√°il constituency. I believe the proposed abolition of Dublin North-East may be more permanent. The new D√°il constituency of Dublin Bay North, which is an amalgamation of Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central, is a much larger five-seat constituency, spreading from the fringes of inner city of Dublin to Howth Head and to the edges of the more rural parts of north County Dublin. As a large geographic area, it will one of the largest urban constituencies in the State. The Deputies elected to represent the constituents of Dublin Bay North in the years to come will have a challenge to ensure they represent their constituents effectively.
#KevinHumphreys	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-party	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-dob	unknown-#KevinHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	171	Changing the shape and size of constituencies and the number of Deputies is a worthy topic, but these are small concerns compared to our need to tackle the unemployment crisis and to create more jobs. I wish the special Cabinet meeting this afternoon the best of luck in its work in that regard and look forward to seeing what ideas come from it. I want to put on the record during this stage of the debate the objections I have to the renaming of the constituency of Dublin South-East to Dublin Bay South. Dublin South-East was created in 1947 for the general election to the 13th D√°il, from the old constituency of Dublin Townships, which had been part of the original constituency of Dublin County in the second D√°il. I remind the House that in 1948 the constituency of Dublin South-East elected three Deputies, including Fine Gael Deputy and leader, John A. Costello, who became Taoiseach in that D√°il and Fianna F√°il Deputy, Se√°n McEntee, who served as a Minister for Finance and was a member of every Fianna F√°il Cabinet from 1932 to 1965. The constituency also elected Noel Browne, who was elected first to Dublin South-East. He was appointed Minister for Health on his first day in the D√°il and went on to do great work in the area of TB and became a hero of the left.The Dublin South-East constituency has elected two leaders of this nation - John A. Costello and Garret FitzGerald - both of whom represented the Acting Chairman's party. The former President, Mary McAleese, ran for election in the constituency. Indeed, another former President, Mary Robinson, ran in a local election in the Rathmines township. Dublin South-East has also elected three other former party leaders - Deputy Ruair√≠ Quinn of the Labour Party, Michael McDowell of the Progressive Democrats and John Gormley of the Green Party. I am making these points to show that the voters of my constituency have lived with the Dublin South-East name for decades. The Constituency Commission suggested in its report that there is very little sense of place in Dublin South-East and very little connection with the name. I contend that there is a strong sense of identity in the constituency. There is a strong connection with the locality and with the name of the constituency. The statement made in the report of the Constituency Commission is misinformed and wrong. The voters of Dublin South-East are attached to the name of the constituency after using it for 65 years. None of the submissions made to the commission called for a change of name. It is probable that the commission's sense of the geography of Dublin Bay is seriously misinformed. The name change makes no historical or geographical sense. Terenure village, which has been added into Dublin South-East, is 6 km from Sandymount strand. I remind the House that the urban villages of Portobello, Rathmines, Rathgar, Ranelagh, Milltown, Ballsbridge and Donnybrook are not beside the sea. I hope it remains that way. Perhaps this is why we need to include serious targets in the forthcoming climate change Bill. More of the constituency fronts onto the River Liffey and the quays than onto the coast. The Ringsend, Irishtown and Pearse Street areas have a natural affinity with the River Liffey and Dublin Port, rather than with Dublin Bay. Sandymount is the only part of the constituency that fronts onto Dublin Bay, and then for a distance of just 2 km. I welcome the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to the Chamber. I put it to him that Dublin South-East is a city centre constituency with no interest in having "Dublin Bay" included in its name. If any constituency on the south side suits the "Dublin Bay South" tag, it is probably the D√∫n Laoghaire constituency. I accept that the naming of Dublin Bay North makes more sense, given that the constituency includes Clontarf, Bull Island and the Howth Peninsula, which actually look out on the bay. The only reason provided in the report for changing the name of Dublin South-East is symmetry. I suggest the constituency that matches Dublin South-East on the north side is Dublin Central rather than the proposed Dublin Bay North. The commission has mismatched the names it has used. I urge the Minister to accept an amendment on Committee Stage to retain the current name. The proposed name change has little or no public support. Change for the sake of change is no change at all. I am disappointed that the number of three-seat constituencies has not been more substantially reduced. The decrease from 16 to 13 in the number of such constituencies reflects the decrease from 43 to 40 in the total number of constituencies. That works against the principle of proportional representation, which is that seats should be allocated in proportion to how votes are cast. I am also disappointed that the significant under-representation of the Dublin constituency in the European Parliament is not being addressed. There is a variance of 11%. The number of people per MEP in Dublin is almost 60,000 higher than the number in the rest of the country. That will need to be addressed when the European Parliament constituencies are revised following the accession of Croatia to the EU.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	172	I would like to echo what Deputy Ellis said by pointing out that cutting the number of elected representatives and abolishing democratic forums of various kinds is not the same as introducing reform. I accept that there may be some merits in the Minister's proposals regarding local government. Apart from anything else, the proposals address the issue of there not beng town councils throughout the country. I understand the concerns of town councils that have been in existence for approximately 100 years. The real reason these cuts are being made has nothing to do with reform. An effort is being made to be seen to save money. The reforms before the House, such as the reduction in the number of Deputies, will lead to a theoretical saving of money that will not be seen in practice until after the next general election. I suggest that the ongoing increase in population makes it likely that this change will be a one-term wonder, as the constitutional requirement to have a certain number of Deputies per head of population is likely to lead to an increase in the number of Deputies before the following election. In other words, just one election will take place on the basis of these new constituencies. As the D√°il does not have to complete a full five-year term, another election could be called within a year or two of that election. This change is also being made to satisfy the hunger for political scalps that exists. It is very much a red herring in that regard. There is also the ideological basis for this measure. The Minister referred to the idea that cleaner and more efficient government is desirable. I cannot remember the exact term he used, but it alluded to rolling back the State and providing for smaller government. I do not believe smaller government makes for more democracy. If anything, it makes for less democracy. I believe this is an anti-democratic move. I wish we could have had a proper debate on it. While I welcome what Deputy Ellis has said, I feel that Sinn F√©in was very muted on this proposal when it was originally made. The same is true of the Opposition generally. I have been one of the most vocal people on this issue. I would have liked a more thorough debate on the issues I raised. We need a reflective debate about the size our Parliament should be. We should compare like with like when we speak about other countries. Studies have shown there is a relationship between the size of a country's parliament and the cube root of its population. Given that our population is 4.5 million, the cube root rule means we should have exactly 166 TDs. If one is to believe studies that have looked at what works in practice, we have exactly the right number of TDs at the moment. We should not be compared to countries like India, Britain and Italy that have levels of regional and provincial government that we do not have. Ireland is too small to have regional assemblies - autonomous provincial parliaments - of the kind found in Italy, for example. We are familiar with the assemblies etc, that have been established in Britain. I will not go into all the detail. We have similar levels of representation to countries of a similar size, such as Finland and Sweden. Cyprus, which recently held the Presidency of the EU, has 56 MPs to serve its population of 800,000. Its proportion of parliamentarians per head of population is far greater than the proportion in this country. That is the case because Cyprus is a smaller country. That is the way it has always been in practice. I have been a Member of the Oireachtas for over ten years. I have been a Deputy since 2007. The workload of Deputies has increased significantly in that time. Obviously, it has increased substantially since the number of Deputies was originally set at 166. The population of this country was smaller by some 1.2 million at that time. Politicians are now much more accessible. It is absolute rubbish to suggest we can move away and tell our constituents to shove off because we are legislators. We are much more accessible to the public now. We are accessible through social media. We can be contacted via e-mails and telephone calls. We meet people on the streets. We represent our constituents just as MPs do in other countries. We do not do a higher percentage of constituency work than MPs in other countries. In fact, MPs in Canada do the most work in that regard. We are not here to legislate in an ivory tower - we are here to legislate on behalf of the people. I think we will regret the move that has been announced by the Minister because as our workload increases, we will be less able to do our jobs as legislators who are informed by the lives of our constituents. I wish the Minister had engaged more with the silent majority, rather than the elitist commentators, the academics or the advisers who drove this debate, before he announced this supposed political reform. If he had engaged with the silent majority, he would have learned that people want to be in touch with politicians. They believe they have a right to contact their elected representatives about the issues that concern them and the effects of the decisions that are made in here on their daily lives. I reiterate that I regret the move that is being taken by the Minister.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	175	I agree that we need to have a wider debate on what the reform of our system of governance, in the widest sense, should mean and should look like. Having said that, I am intimately aware of the reason we need to pass this legislation. Along with Deputy Finian McGrath, I took a constitutional case in 2007 regarding the timeline within which we are required to work. I believe the 2007 general election was deeply unfair because ten constituencies were radically out of line with the average.We took the case because it was an affront to democracy and the substance of the point subsequently found its way into law. As Mr. Justice Frank Clarke said at the time, the obligation was not on the Minister or on the Government but on the Oireachtas, once a commission is set up, to within six months bring in legislation that will have the boundaries altered. This is because the 2007 elections were basically fought on the 2002 census as opposed to the 2006 census. It is just one thing that needs to be done but we have an obligation to do it. The public expectation was that reform would look very different from what has in fact transpired. There was an expectation there would be a radically reduced number of TDs. That, of course, would have required a constitutional amendment because, while there is a tolerance on either end, there must be one TD for between 20,000 and 30,000 people, with rough parity - it is not exact but it has to be near enough. Essentially, the kind of reductions that were being talked about were never going to transpire in the absence of a constitutional amendment being passed by the citizens of this country. It was very dangerous to do that. It was to suggest we had too much democracy and that this was the cause of our problem. In fact, I would argue the reverse, but I would also argue that democracy and the outlets for citizen engagement are not wide enough and not open enough to something beyond a representative democracy. I believe the change has not just to happen in regard to the number of TDs but also in regard to the relationship between the Legislature and the Executive. It has to take the localism out of the national Parliament and place it where there is a particular genius in this country. One often hears people say things like "We are better than this". We are better than this. When one considers some of the organic developments at local level - for example, the credit union movement, the GAA, the co-operative movement, the Tidy Towns, the level of volunteerism and the trust that exists at local level, where people know each other - how is it that we do not build this into our governance? I believe it would unleash something that would truly be a democratic revolution. The notion that democratic revolution is a Government made up of two thirds of the Parliament is really quite insulting, and I wish people would stop using that phrase as it is simply not true. The issues of the use of the guillotine and the shoehorning of key legislation into very tight timelines so there is not ample time to debate it need to feature in the kind of debate we have. To go back to the origins of the local government system, it pretty much developed as a result of the shiring of counties, which was about putting in a sheriff to maintain control for the Crown. It was all about control. We are pretty bad in that regard. If anyone tries to control Irish people, they will resent it. This is about designing a system that gives people a lot more flexibility and trusts the citizens of this country - it is about deepening democracy. If one looks to countries where this has been done, there is a particularly good example in Colombia, where the capital city was redeveloped in conjunction with a deep democratic involvement of the people, and the results are there to be seen in terms of reduced crime rates and greater levels of equality. There are other examples around the world that we should be looking at. There is often one opportunity in a lifetime to really radically reform. Unfortunately, what we are doing is tinkering at the edges rather than doing something with people that will leave something lasting in regard to deepening our democracy. I was a county councillor and a town councillor for many years and I know we could operate in a radically different way in both areas. The town council I was involved with became a facilitator of the local community and networked that local community. Not a single, solitary penny will be saved to this State as a consequence of abolishing that town council. I would have liked a much bigger debate about what it is that people identify with, and what it is that would unleash the kind of common purpose that could be garnered by a deeper and different kind of democracy that is much more inclusive than what is being proposed. I believe this is tinkering at the edges, it is piecemeal and it is a wasted opportunity. As I said, this is a time for the deepening of democracy. With regard to local government reform, we currently have a managerial system and a system of local administration, and I do not foresee that changing substantially. There is a mistrust between the centre and the local. While some of that was understandable in the early days of the State, we do not seem to have moved on from that. Unless we do move on, I do not believe we will see that localism being taken out of the national Parliament and placed exactly where it should be. The idea of the parish pump is actually very positive if it is in the right place. It is about collaboration, about a community coming together and about people looking after each other. If this Parliament was de-cluttered from the excessive localism we see here, we would have a Parliament that would function more in the way parliaments function in other countries. There is an ample number of examples in other countries and we should be looking at best case scenarios rather than just tinkering at the edges. I completely accept there is a need for this legislation. I would like to see an electoral commission permanently in place to deal with issues such as the register of electors, which is very hit and miss, and to deal with matters that arise at the time of referenda. To have such a commission permanently in place would mean we are building towards something and it would provide checks and balances to the Executive. To conclude, I accept the decision of the commission in the work it did and I will be supporting the legislation on that basis.

While I believe there should be more democracy in this country, at the same time, the democracy is all in the wrong place. I personally believe 80 TDs would be plenty for this country but, in order to achieve that, we need real local and regional government reform. I found what Deputy Tuffy said very interesting. She pointed out that people often mention Britain and India as an example when they talk about the number of MPs, or TDs in our case. Deputy Tuffy rightly said this was unfair because they have regional and local government. That being true, and I agree with it, what are we going to do to create more regional government and more real local government?The proposals are to close down many of the local councils, further castrate the county councils and turn them into even bigger talking shops, but there is no real desire for change in the power base. Last year a Fine Gael Deputy espoused an opinion on local government that showed what many here thought. The Deputy said people were looking for more power at local level but what they seemed to forget was that it would give us less power here. That sums up the attitude - the governing party wants to hold onto the power it has. God knows it had to wait long enough to get it and I can understand the natural urge to hold on to it, but if that is not for the benefit of the majority of the people, why do it? It does not benefit the majority. The current system only puts people off politics, the proof of which is that there are people cheerleading the idea that we would enjoy less democracy. There would not be localism in the D√°il if we had real local democracy. In those circumstances I would not be here because my place is in local government. The Minister‚Äôs job is to legislate, but he has neither the time nor the incentive to drive that agenda, as it will not get him re-elected. If he did bury himself completely, 100%, in dealing with legislation, he would never get a chance to talk to his constituents in the way he does now. We need a separation. The concern about having more elected representatives is that it would cost us more, but it would not. The money saved in reducing the number of Deputies to 80 would more than cover the cost involved. If the Minister is to cut at local level, he should cut the number of county councillors and invest the money saved in real local government reform at town level because otherwise it will not work. Consider the position in Switzerland: in areas with a population of only 100 they decide whether a footpath is to be pulled up again this year, they make a practical decision on whether to lay another shiny new footpath 12 months after laying the old one or on whether to upgrade their swimming pool, which would increase the possibility of increasing tourism in the area and decrease the possibility of people committing suicide because they would have more recreational facilities available and help to combat obesity, etc. Instead we have a system in which there is an attempt to control these decisions from the centre. This is not a question of Dublin against the rest. The Government cannot decide exactly what is right for people in Castlerea any more than I from Dublin can make my kids eat Weetabix at home, no more than people in Donegal know what is best for people in Castlerea and no more than I know what is best for people on Jervis Street. The decisions should be made locally. Then the system would work much better. Even though the members of the Government and the people who vote for it seem to have a problem with the fact that we do not have real local government nothing will happen or change. As the Fine Gael Deputy said last year, they would have no power. That is what it is all about, us having power because then a Deputy can be reported in the newspaper boasting about getting X, Y and Z for his or her constituency. That does not help people in general. This commission guarantees that yet again my constituency will not return the same Deputies. In the history of the State Roscommon has never returned the same three Deputies. Even in my short time in politics, I have run for election in Longford-Roscommon, South Leitrim and Roscommon and now it appears that I will run in Roscommon and Galway East. No one can question the independence of the commission and if anyone does, I will say he or she is wrong. It is not often I can say that definitively because even when it comes to God, I am agnostic. I am not sure either way, but I am definite about this. The commission was totally independent because otherwise it would have redrawn my constituency in a slightly differently way. People on the ground are saying the commission hanged the Government guy. I do not know whether that is true, but I do know from the way my constituency has been redrawn that it was definitely independent, as otherwise it would not have made a big attempt to put me in that constituency.

In essence, this means reducing the number of Deputies from 166 to 158, the number of D√°il constituencies from 43 to 40 and redrawing many constituency boundaries. This may not be great news for everyone in the House. I have noticed that there is some very uneasy shifting on the backbenches, not to mention perspiration on some brows. The great Canadian motivational speaker Brian Tracy often refers to doing things that are important rather than urgent. This Bill may not be urgent, but it certainly is important. That is a line the Government has tried to adopt at all times. We believe in the long-term prosperity of the country. As a result, we are not afraid to make the often overlooked important decisions as opposed to the more popular urgent ones. The Bill provides for a reduction in the number of Deputies, implementing the commitment in the programme for Government to reduce the number of Deputies following publication of the results of census 2011. Prior to the establishment of the constituency commission in 2011, its terms of reference were changed by the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2011 which fixed the range for the total number of Deputies at between 153 and 160, as compared with the previous range of 164 to 168. In any group there will always be those who are thinking about their personal interests. This is understandable, but the time for thinking about personal interests in this country has long past, as we all know well. Since its inception, the Government has aimed to do the right thing for the country and for the right reasons. In any reshuffle or realignment there will be winners and losers. I, therefore, urge Members to think beyond their personal interests and of the greater good of the country. Like the esteemed Mr. Tracy, I urge them to make the important decisions and support this legislation. I commend the Bill to the House.

The matter actually went the other way. We look forward to proposing an amendment in regard to that constituency on Committee Stage, to the effect that this substantial number of Mayo people be recognised in the new constituency, which should be renamed Galway West-South Mayo to reflect the large input of Mayo people. I have no doubt that Deputy √ì Cu√≠v will look after them well, along with whoever may join him from the other side. There is great concern throughout the country about the manner in which communities can be discommoded in this way. It is similar to the process currently under way, albeit with open consultations, whereby parishes can be divided for representation at council level. There is concern that there is no appeals process. In previous times the boundary review process was used for party political advantage, but surely we have moved on and can come up with a system that makes proposals on the make-up of constituencies but allows some kind of input concerning the proposals made. It is all very well making a submission in advance but many people do not fully understand the intricacies of the process or the way in which the frames of reference can be interpreted by the commission. A draft report should be published, following which communities should be allowed to facilitate input into it. There is no doubt about the anger in south Mayo concerning the way in which it is being attached to Galway, and this anger is replicated in communities throughout the country that are being moved around. It is the same in cities. People vote in different constituencies in different elections depending on the way population centres move. It is difficult for colleagues or for anybody who seeks elected office to develop a working relationship with communities or prioritise working with communities when that happens. With its proposed reduction of eight seats, the Bill demonstrates the folly of many of the pre-election promises made by the Government. The Minister, Deputy Hogan, intended to reduce the number by 20 but I understand the Labour Party got to him and kept the number to eight. That will increase again to 166 after the next election. Let us stand back and consider this. Perhaps we have lost the opportunity to have a full debate. Is having 42 or 43 constituencies the best way to go now? Should we start mixing it up a bit - mixing the electoral constituency system with a list system? Perhaps we should proceed by availing of the Constitutional Convention in advance of making any decisions. The Government has mentioned having a debate on Seanad reform or abolition. It should be on Seanad reform. Equally, we need to consider the way in which we do business in this House. While I accept there have been some minimal changes in the way business is done, we must push the bar out further and be much more ambitious about the way in which we do business. We must resource our committees. I commend Deputy Jerry Buttimer and his colleagues on the health committee on the way in which they managed last week's committee hearings. If every committee was resourced and given powers to that effect we would get through our work as a Parliament much more quickly and in a much more challenging way for those who attend. It would require a considerable resource commitment for us to do that, but if we are serious about our work and want to make it more relevant we should consider this and invest in it. The committee system can work well. There is much good work that happens, literally, in the bowel of LH2000, but it rarely gets attention unless there is a star witness. That is where the real work of this Parliament is done. Committee Stage of legislation can be beneficial for everybody. We must look at our own internal resources, work with the public relations unit of the Oireachtas, see the way in which it highlights committee work and come up with a way of improving the work. Everybody says there are too many politicians in this country, but people here like to have a relationship with their local representatives. They like to be able to reach out and have access to that person. Public representatives are generally much more available here than in many other countries. We do not have the system that pertains in the United Kingdom whereby politicians may spend a few weekends in their constituencies and the rest of the time in London. If we lose that link it will undermine our work and whatever bit of solace we have left in this House. That is why we need to engage to a much greater degree with communities in setting boundaries and respecting how deeply they are attached to those boundaries. It is not a question of sitting around a table moving around lines on a map. One is dealing, first, with people's right to representation and, second, with people's livelihoods. Many people have left this House not for want of work but because of boundary changes that reduced their ability to be re-elected. People must consider those things as well. It is all very well for a boundary review group to publish its work, but the manner in which we have completely removed ourselves from interpreting that work needs to change. There must be some kind of appeals mechanism for communities that feel discommoded. I reiterate that we can design such a mechanism, which must not be politically controlled. That is within our ability. My party will table an amendment on Committee Stage in regard to the invasion of Mayo by Galway. I know the county is short of a few footballers but it will not get away with it that easily. We will propose the renaming of the constituency to Galway West-South Mayo to reflect the fact that more than 10,000 Mayo people will be voting in that constituency in the next election. They deserve to be formally recognised in that way. I cannot imagine that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, would be too impressed at being moved into Waterford or Wexford, as Deputy Browne informs me.

There is to be a paltry reduction in the number of Deputies from 166 to 158, although the Minister's party spoke about a reduction of 20. Personally, I do not agree with any reduction and believe the number should have been left at 166. As Deputy Calleary noted, there are many people who, although they may throw rotten oranges and apples at us from time to time, like to have access to their politicians and be able to come in and have a chat. In this country politicians are generally people-friendly in comparison with those in other countries. I had two old aunties, God rest them, who lived in England and used to come home every year. They could never believe that I or the Minister, Deputy Howlin, or whoever was a Deputy at the time would sit in a hotel and allow people to drop in off the street and have a chat without making an appointment. If they wanted to see their MP they might be waiting three to six months. It would be a pity to change that system here. We should always ensure that Deputies are available to the people. That is the reason I do not at all agree with either the Minister or my own party about the proposal to reduce the number from 166 to 158. The number of Deputies should be left alone. I have always had a notion about the boundary commission and had many arguments with the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Noel Dempsey, in this regard. This group of people makes the decisions; they are like God and their decisions cannot be changed even though some of them are way off-kilter. Under the second last review there was no Deputy from County Leitrim, which was a farcical situation. I learned from a BBC programme during the week that the House of Lords was voting against a boundary review committee decision, which meant the matter would have to return to the Government. Boundary commissions should not be all-powerful and have the final say, with no Minister prepared to make any change, perhaps because of a possible backlash from the media. I refer to what Deputy Calleary stated. I was talking to some west of Ireland Deputies recently who told me that if any change was to be made, it should have been to join west and east Galway rather than throwing part of Mayo into west Galway.Before the last election the Minister said much about reform, reform of this House and reform of the Seanad and it appears the Government will abolish the Seanad. However, I think the people will take a different view when the issue appears before them as we are doing away with too many strands of democracy. The Minister, Deputy Hogan, has decided with the sweep of a brush to do away with town councils and to have municipal authorities. As town councils were at the heart of the community and were part and parcel of the community it is a wrong decision. I admit that the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Mr. Noel Dempsey, was probably thinking on those lines also and, perhaps, the Minister placed it on the table and decided to proceed with the Fianna F√°il document. It is a wrong decision to do away with town councils. I am sure if the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, were speaking from the heart he would probably agree with those sentiments. Few countries are doing away with democratic sectors. If we do away with town councils and the Seanad all we are left with is county councils and the D√°il system and people will not be properly represented in that scenario. For that reason I ask the Minister to look again at the issue.  Last November marked my service of 30 years as a Member of this House, some would say too long. Nothing has changed in the area of reform. The Minister and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe, made a decision to introduce a Topical Issue debate. Given the number of members putting their names forward for that debate it is almost impossible to get on the cl√°r. In respect of issues that are relevant and important to a constituency today it is important that a representative of that constituency would have an opportunity to raise a matter on the day it arises. Sometimes two or three weeks elapse before one can make one's point. The issue may concern the loss of jobs, the closure of a factory or other major changes in the constituency. This is not the fault of the Ceann Comhairle as he is allowed only a certain number of topical issues per day. The system needs to be looked at again and changed and the operation of the House needs to be made more relevant to the day to day issues in our constituencies. The replies from Ministers to parliamentary questions are becoming less and less informative. Perhaps the Government backbenchers are getting more concise replies than we on this side get. Many of the replies are not replies at all. If the matter concerns the National Roads Authority, the Health Service Executive or many other State bodies, the usual reply from the Minister is that the matter has been passed on to the HSE or the NRA. At the end of the day, the Minister of the day is responsible for all these organisations and should be in a position to provide a concise answer without having to wait for a month or two before the HSE, the NRA or some other body decides to reply. That system needs to be changed. I have been present for many Friday sittings which start at 10.30 a.m. and usually finish at 1 p.m. There is no Order of Business or Leaders' Question and no real D√°il business is done except the Bill that is taken. If we are to have Friday sittings they should be proper sittings with a full D√°il system in operation on the day, otherwise we should forget about farcical Friday sittings. What is happening is not relevant and is certainly not good enough. In regard to the Electoral (Amendment) (D√°il Constituencies) Bill 2012, I do not agree with the proposal to reduce the number of Deputies or some of the changes to the boundaries. I had hoped that the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, who portrays himself as a tough Minister would be prepared to take tough decisions. I argued with many, during our time in government, that the boundary review commission report should not be sacrosanct, whereby no changes could be made. Some changes were farcical and left many without public representation and counties which had no contact with each other were joined up. As Deputy Calleary said if wrong decisions are made there should be a mechanism in place to allow the Minister make the change or an appeals system should be put in place to enable a further review of the situation. Generally, I support the Bill and hope the Minister will be prepared to take some amendments on Committee Stage.

Effectively, this is being done to respond to the reasonably held concerns of the Leitrim people. When Leitrim was divided, various associations there expressed their annoyance and made representations. Rightly so. I am disappointed that the solution to the Leitrim problem, which was a legitimate concern, is the dismemberment of the division of County Cavan. The county structure is sacrosanct. It is the structure to which we relate in football and in every sphere of activity. For administrative purposes those 13,183 voters in west Cavan will come under Cavan County Council yet will not be represented by Cavan-Monaghan representatives in the House. That is a huge concern and will make for duplication and isolation of that area. It breaks up the county structure and is unwelcome. I understand the reunification of County Leitrim. I also understand its angst and annoyance in the past at its dismemberment and break up but the solution should not be the break up of Cavan. Councillors from west Cavan will be on Cavan County Council; for part of County Cavan there will be a different set of D√°il Deputies, albeit very eminent figures, including the Minister of State, Deputy John Perry, in front of me, from the other constituency who will represent a section of Cavan and Cavan will have a certain representative role. For example, as my colleagues Deputy Heather Humphreys, Deputy Se√°n Conlan and I would get representations continuously from west Cavan with Cavan implications on infrastructure and the same representations would be duplicated in Sligo-Leitrim it makes for administrative mayhem, a lack of cohesion and a lack of unity. That is a bad outcome and I ask that it be altered in the short term. If it is not to be altered in the short term it needs to be altered in the long term as it affects the homogenous nature of the county and efforts to get inward investment in the county conducted at countywide level will be frustrated.It causes duplicity and a lack of coherence.  I appreciate the time allowed for my contribution. I wish to register my annoyance, displeasure and concern about the breaking up of my county and the removal of an entire electoral division and 13,183 voters. This will result in a constituency of ridiculous length and proportions.

I also welcome the efforts of the Government and the actions of the Minister on the issue of political reform at national and local authority level. There is disagreement on all sides of the House about certain aspects of that reform and its implementation. However, what was acceptable, reasonable and efficient in 1922, 1972 or 2002 is no longer suitable in 2013. To leave things as they are is not an option. I do not object to the proposed reduction in the number of Deputies. However, I fail to see the logic in the changes to the constituency boundaries in the western and north-western regions, in particular. Deputy Joe Reilly also voiced this sentiment.  I am conscious of the resentment in County Leitrim when it was divided over ten years ago when many felt disenfranchised. The solution was to include the county in one constituency. However, the result was a terrible mess and a dog's dinner. In the case of County Mayo 10,000 people in south Mayo were transferred to the Galway West constituency. The solution for County Leitrim is the creation of a new constituency comprising four counties. The Deputies who will represent that constituency will have to deal with four county managers and four local authorities. Galway West is not the natural hinterland for the people of south Mayo and the electorate in that region will now elect local authority members in County Mayo and Deputies for Galway. I am aware that the new boundaries were drawn by an independent commission. I checked the criteria supplied to the commission and note that they stated the breaching of county boundaries was to be avoided in so far as practical and that each constituency should be composed of contiguous areas, which means sharing a common border. The outcome in the case of the new Galway West constituency is anything but the sharing of a contiguous border. I have tremendous respect for people in both Mayo and Galway, as many will know, but in the case of all counties in Connacht borders have been either breached or additional territory has been added. For political reform to be effective, it must be streamlined. The number of sittings of the House has increased dramatically since 2011. This means Deputies are unable to spend as much time in their constituencies as they did in the past. They need to have a very good working relationship with local councillors. If a constituent needs assistance in dealing with an issue to do with road resurfacing or pot holes, the local councillor will deal with the problem. However, in the case of a town such as Ballinrobe or a parish such as Garrymore, the local councillor with sit on Mayo County Council but their local Deputy will have links to Galway city and county councils. This outcome makes life more difficult for the public who are the most important in this instance, the councillor and the Deputy. It lacks cohesion. I have spoken to people on all sides of the political divide in the south Mayo region who say they are confused and angered by the new electoral boundaries. Many of them have pointed out that south Mayo is not even included in the name of the new Galway West constituency. Other Deputies have also contacted the Minister about the naming of the new constituency. I ask him to address this matter and to have the constituency renamed as Galway West-South Mayo. Even my Galway colleagues would agree with this request.  The greatest and most successful organisations in Ireland are made up of people who work together in community. In order to work well in this way, a sense of place and identity is required. This revision breaks that sense of place, as well as communities. It leaves people feeling disenfranchised. I have no doubt that Deputy √âamon √ì Cu√≠v will look after all voters in Galway West and that Deputies Brian Walsh and Se√°n Kyne will do likewise. However, the point is that the public prefer to have a sense of unity and streamlined representation. This constituency revision does not meet those criteria.

There is an appetite for a reduction in the number of Deputies. The people should get what they want in this instance. Speakers have referred ad nauseam to the commitment in the Fine Gael election manifesto in respect of a reduction of 20 in the number of Deputies. This level of reduction was not possible owing to the extraordinary growth in population in the past decade as shown in the census figures for 2006 and 2011. My community in north Dublin, Fingal, has seen unprecedented growth, so much so that it is the fastest growing local community in Europe. The average age of its population in 2006 was 31.2 years; it is now 31.7 years. However, with such a young community come strains on local services, but that is a debate for another day. An increase in population of 8.2% has made it necessary to consolidate constituency boundaries. I agree with Deputy John O'Mahony on his point about County Mayo and having boundaries which are contiguous. He noted that counties had been split in half. He also referred to the involvement of four local authorities in one constituency, resulting in Deputies having to deal with four county managers. This makes it very difficult for public representatives to carry out their duties efficiently and effectively. In the case of my constituency, the town of Swords was split down the middle by the previous boundary commission and divided between the constituencies of Dublin West and Dublin North. This was controversial and a difficult issue at the time for councillors, Deputies and Senators who endeavoured to represent their constituencies effectively. The town has now been unified, which is welcome. The reunification of Portmarnock with Dublin North and the neighbouring town of Malahide is also very important as the two towns have a symbiotic relationship. They share shopping facilities, the amenity of the strand at Portmarnock and the promenade at Malahide. The two communities are interlinked to such an extent that it would not make sense to separate them.I welcome the fact they are being reunited at the next general election. With regard to the fifth seat, Fingal has always been consistently under-represented at local authority level by comparison with its country cousins. Councillors in some local authority wards represent 10,000 to 13,000 people. Deputy Luke Flanagan, as a former local authority member, will know that some local authority representatives represent as few as 1,200 people.

The point is that there is an imbalance in representation. It is important that there be a re-balance and that is why I am pleased to see the extra seat being allocated to the north side of Dublin and my constituency. Political reform is not a reduction in the number of Deputies; rather, it is changing and consolidating what they do. It is about defining the boundaries between Deputies, Senators, councillors and mayors such that there is no overlap. Without achieving this, local authority members will continue to bite at the heels of Deputies in the hope that they will replace them at the next election, and Deputies who lose their seats, like so many at the last general election, will continue to regard local authority elections as their saviour. If we do not define the roles of elected representatives, there will be continual rotation among local authority members, Deputies and Senators. This is a young, growing nation. The number of children born here today rivals that during the baby boom of the 1960s and 1970s. The average age in my constituency is childbearing age. The Department of Education and Skills made massive planning mistakes in the past, as is evident from the fact that 80 students showed up with bags and uniforms to a school in Balbriggan in which they were not even enrolled and which was not capable of supporting them. The Department assumed that when a couple buys a house, they will have a schooling requirement four or five years later. In fact, when a couple buys a house, there is an immediate schooling requirement because they will already have a couple of kids, and potentially more on the way. Failures regarding the planning of strategic local services must not continue. They are not continuing under the Department at present. We need to be able to plan for the increasing populations in towns such as Swords, Balbriggan, Blanchardstown and Tallaght, and other hotspots of growth around the country, such that we do not need to change the boundaries of constituencies every four or five years. There needs to be representative consistency so there will not be circumstances such as those in which Swords was split in 2008 by the boundary commission. We should not have circumstances such as those in which Portmarnock must be skived off Dublin North to extend the life span of Dublin North-East for couple of years before it finally gives up the ghost and must be put in with another constituency nearby, all with a view to giving Dublin Bay North the ability to sustain itself on an ongoing basis. I appreciate that we will not achieve what I am suggesting on this occasion but I suggest that when the boundary commission is being given its terms of reference in the future, growth will be accounted for sufficiently in the drawing up of constituencies.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	192	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It proposes to implement the recommendations of the constituency commission's report of 2012, which included a reduction in the number of D√°il constituencies from 43 to 40 and a reduction in the number of Deputies from 166 to 158. These changes follow a commitment in the programme for Government. For some time, there has been growing demand to reduce the number of Deputies. While there are arguments to be made regarding the appropriate number of constituents per Deputy, the main reason for the calls to reduce the number of Deputies is largely attributable to general disillusionment among the public with the body politic. As somebody who was elected as a Deputy for the first time in 2011, I was initially surprised by the great volume of work individual Deputies face daily and the wide range of issues with which they must deal. The reason for this heavy workload has much to do with the fact that the Irish enjoy a unique level of access to their public representatives. This is a positive aspect of our electoral system, and our democracy has been the stronger for it. Ireland differs from other countries in that it is very easy for any member of the public to make contact with his local Deputy if he so wishes. It is critical that members of the public have direct contact with local Deputies so they can outline their views or concerns regarding certain policy matters. This allows Deputies such as me to outline various policy decisions and the rationale therefor. It allows me to take on board people's views as to where improvements can be made and bring these concerns back to the Government. This level of contact with the people is very significant. It is vital that we do not lose touch with the people we are here to serve. We must not allow Deputies to become overstretched such that they cannot reasonably meet the needs of their constituents. With that in mind, I believe the modest decrease in the number of Deputies, as proposed, represents a sensible start. This measure, along with the proposed abolition of the Seanad, will represent a major reduction in the number of Members and the Oireachtas. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government recently brought forward proposals for the reform of local government. They include the abolition of town councils and a 40% reduction in the number of councillors. If implemented, the result will be a vastly reduced number of public representatives nationwide. With regard to the changes recommended by the boundary commission in my constituency, I am saddened by the decision to move west Cavan out of the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. It is far from ideal when county lines are breached. For years, people were calling for Leitrim to be reunited. Unfortunately, this appears to have happened at Cavan's expense. There are a number of joint services covering Cavan and Monaghan and the two counties have always worked well together. The new amalgamated VEC will serve both counties, as does the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in Cavan at present. On a purely administrative basis, I envisage problems. Cavan County Council, for example, will now receive representations from four Deputies in Cavan-Monaghan along with five Deputies in the new Sligo-Leitrim constituency. These are the sorts of issues that will arise from the decision to divide Cavan. It could be that what appears good on paper is not always practical on the ground, especially in rural areas with a dispersed population. Based on the results of the 2011 census, I note the new Cavan-Monaghan constituency will be one of only five in which the population per Deputy will be over 30,000. If the Seanad is abolished, it will mean the number of Oireachtas members in Cavan-Monaghan will be reduced from seven to four. As part of the reform of local government, the number of county councillors in Cavan County Council will be reduced from 25 to 18, and the number in Monaghan County Council will be reduced from 20 to 18. All the town councils in the constituency are to be abolished. Some people have argued that the reduction in numbers has not gone far enough. In any reasonable analysis, this represents a truly seismic decrease in the number of public representatives at local level. However, we must tread carefully because if we were to go any further at this point, there would be a danger of throwing the baby out with the bath water. As I stated, the level of interaction between the people and public representatives and the ease of access have constituted a strength of our democracy. While I accept that reform is necessary, I believe it is important that this level of connectivity be maintained in so far as it is possible.

I doubt if any previous Administration, except perhaps the Fianna F√°il Government of 1932, came to power with more promises of reform. The record of the coalition thus far has been a litany of disappointments and broken promises. This Bill is no exception. Its purpose is not to enhance democracy or reform politics in the State or on this island but to reduce the number of Deputies by eight and the number of D√°il constituencies by three.It is a Fine Gael Bill and it arises out of a Fine Gael slogan about cutting the number of Deputies, rather than out of any real consideration of how the D√°il can be truly reformed. The irony is that the original Fine Gael target of cutting the number of Deputies by 20 could not be done because it would be unconstitutional, given the increase in the population. Census 2011 results show that this State's population has continued to grow strongly since Census 2006, increasing by 348,404 persons to 4,588,252 persons in the Twenty-six Counties. This represents an increase of 8.2% over the five-year period. The electoral commission claimed that it was required to base its report on the population in Census 2011 but the report failed to reflect this reality. It was the first time that a commission had a predetermined outcome of reducing the number of D√°il Deputies. What we have now is a Bill to axe eight D√°il seats and three constituencies - despite an increased and growing population - and carve up constituency boundaries yet again. The terms of reference given to the Constituency Commission were too narrow. Crucially, they were constrained by the undemocratic legislation which restricts the number of TDs per constituency to a maximum of five. As a result of that legislation we had, for example, the partition of Leitrim because a six or more seater Sligo-Leitrim-Roscommon constituency was not permitted. With that undemocratic five-seat ceiling still in place we now have the proposed reunification of Leitrim which is most welcome but the partition of Cavan which is most unwelcome. Real and fundamental reform would have revisited the five-seat ceiling and it would have adopted a co-ordinated approach to the Oireachtas and local government, both in terms of democratic powers, numbers of councillors and Deputies, and constituency boundaries. This would facilitate better administration and improved representation for citizens, harmonising the remit and the boundaries of local government and the Oireachtas. Instead we now face widely varying
boundaries in terms of D√°il constituencies and councils, missing another opportunity to match them up as far as possible. Under this Bill, 22 out of 40 constituency boundaries breach county boundaries. Article 16.2.2o of Bunreacht na h√âireann states that "the total number of members of D√°il √âireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population". Yet in this Bill the redrawn Cavan-Monaghan, Donegal, Dublin North West, Galway West and Mayo Constituencies each have more than 30,000 people per Deputy. Turning to the counties of Cavan and Monaghan, which I have represented here since 1997, I can only describe this Bill as a travesty. It removes a large part of west Cavan from the Cavan-Monaghan constituency and creates what I can only describe as an unnatural or, dare I say it, Frankenstein constituency comprising Sligo, Leitrim and parts of counties Donegal and Cavan - four counties cobbled together from two provinces. To facilitate this, a chunk of County Galway, in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's own backyard, is being put in with County Roscommon and all because the sacred cow of the five-seat ceiling will not be touched by this so-called reforming Government. It is a carve-up, plain and simple. County Cavan is and always has been an administrative unit in terms of local government and a united county, either as a stand-alone constituency or with County Monaghan, for D√°il elections. There is no logic or sense in splitting away west Cavan. The carve-up takes 36 electoral divisions with a population of 13,183 out of County Cavan. Thus, west Cavan, a part of the wider hinterland of the county town of Cavan, is removed to a separate D√°il constituency. The Cavan-Monaghan Constituency is to be reduced to four seats, meaning that its population will be under-represented. From two counties with three seats each, this former six-seat area will now likely only have four D√°il representatives in the Thirty-second D√°il despite the increased population of both counties. The electorates of counties Cavan and Monaghan deserve better than this. Marginalised Border counties that have suffered underdevelopment and underinvestment during the decades since partition deserve better than this.  I urge the Minister and the Government not to proceed with this crude constituency boundary redrafting proposal but to sit down with all interested opinion and address the real reforms that can and should be introduced in both local government and in D√°il and Seanad representation.

The Government promised there would be constituency reviews and that the number of seats would be reduced. While I very much welcome this I want to say goodbye to the good people of south Leitrim who were very loyal to me in 2007 and 2011. The constituency Roscommon-South Leitrim will now be Roscommon-East Galway and, as a Deputy for Roscommon-South Leitrim, I intend to live up to my obligations along with the other Deputies in the constituency - I note the Minister of State, Deputy Perry and other Deputies are present - to work on behalf of the people for Roscommon-South Leitrim during the lifetime of this D√°il. More than another three years remain of this D√°il and there are many issues with which I have to deal such as the enhancement of Roscommon Hospital, compensation for turfcutters, schools and hospitals in Ballinamore, the retention of jobs in MBNA and other issues including bringing back employment to the area. I look forward, God willing, to contesting the next general election in 2016 in the Roscommon-East Galway constituency but that would be at the behest of the Fine Gael organisation. I am very honoured to represent the people of Roscommon-South Leitrim and to have represented an area, which will be in part of Deputy √ì Caol√°in's constituency, and I wish whoever represents the people of that area well. Roscommon Hospital is not closed; it is twice as busy as it was in 2010. An application for planning permission has been submitted for a new endoscopy unit at the hospital, the cost of which will be more than ‚Ç¨3 million. By the time that is finished in the next few years Roscommon Hospital will be twice as big, five times busier but, most important, patients will be much safer. I thank the people of south Leitrim and Roscommon and I intend to remain as their Deputy doing the work a Deputy is elected to do until the end of this D√°il term in three years time.

It is ironic that the constituency boundaries revision does not affect me or my constituency to any great extent other than that the boundaries and populations will be marginally moved and that will create difficulties in terms of logistics in how to facilitate the voters in a particular area.In general, however, my view is that constituency boundaries should remain constant with county or other boundaries in so far as is possible. Over the years a certain continuity will have built up with public representatives and they will have come to identify with their respective areas, a development beneficial to the community at large. It is hugely important that the public have a rapport with their elected public representatives within a constituency boundary. It is important that public representatives devote their activities to addressing the issues that affect their constituencies. When one unravels the fabric of existing systems, there is always a tendency to create something new on the basis that it will be better. That is not always necessarily the case. Some new constituencies will prove extremely difficult for travel for their public representatives. Two Members present, Deputies Smith and Perry, will soon experience this logistical problem in their respective new constituencies. In my time, 50 miles was the longest distance I had to travel and that was in the old Kildare constituency, which has since been divided into the smaller Kildare North and South constituencies. When boundaries are rearranged, one factor that is always left out is the degree to which the voting public identifies with the people it elects. Some strange things have happened in this regard from time to time. Although a boundary change may have been well flagged in advance, there have been occasions on which people have refused to vote when they found they could only vote for a representative they had not previously voted for. These are not isolated instances but have come about on several occasions in my constituency in the past, as well as in others. I know it will happen again because of this boundary commission review. When the terms of reference of the review are set down, it naturally follows that one has to start somewhere and end somewhere else. However, as we all know, wherever one starts, the ripples extend right out to the perimeter. It is at that particular juncture that people find themselves squeezed, as it were. Some people will take great pleasure in the fact that public representatives will find themselves challenged by boundary revisions and the subsequent unease that creates. Apart from the pleasure it gives some people who like to comment on these matters, it does not do anything for the public or improve or extend the remit of the public representative. Neither does it improve the quality or level of representation. It could, however, have the effect of removing the public representative to a distance further afield from those who elected him or her. There is a theory that there is too much interaction between the electorate and public representatives. I do not agree with this as I believe it is good and important that elected public representatives engage with the electorate to such an extent as to be able to identify how the legislation they pass in Parliament affects them. If we lose that vital ingredient, there is no other avenue for the public to express themselves other than waiting for the next election. It also has the possibility of creating instability, particularly at times of economic difficulty. The one thing we now know we need more than anything else, and which will continue to be needed for some years to come, is stability. We must have reliability, continuity and stability. There must be a recognition that those outside this jurisdiction looking to invest in this or other jurisdictions will, in the first instance, seek out places that have the ability to provide stability. I am concerned that we are heading towards a situation in which the electorate is more removed from its elected representatives than in the past. Some other jurisdictions - some closer and some further afield - have had that tradition over the years. In some jurisdictions, the electorate very seldom sees its public representatives. Some may say, cynically, that it is better that way. I do not agree. The interaction that takes place here between elected representatives and the electorate is good for Parliament, democracy and the public. That does not mean to say that elected public representatives should always bend to the ever-changing whims of an electorate. It does, however, encourage public representatives to be responsible and ensures people's expectations are not unnecessarily raised. It also ensures that we are realistic, that we give leadership and that we give sound advice to our constituents and, in turn, that they will benefit economically from that. We have much to work on in this area, provided we do not expect to wave a magic wand and come up with some new invention for the democratic system to make it much more responsive and effective, because there is a contradiction in that as well. Strange things happen from time to time. I remember making comparisons between our system and those in other European countries. We have long since abolished the dual mandate which allowed Oireachtas Members to be local authority members. There was a significant amount of applause from certain quarters when that was abolished. I totally disagreed at the time because I believed it was a negative and unnecessary development. It removed people who had knowledge at national parliamentary level from local authorities. With that went much of the power that was vested in local authorities previously. Events since have shown that. Hence the need now for local government reform. I know there were some who took great pleasure in the fact that Oireachtas Members were no longer members of local authorities and it was thought to be a good idea. However, I have not seen the benefits of it. I recall meeting a gentleman from Belgium who was mayor of his town, a member of his national parliament and a Member of the European Parliament. While he would not have the same travel problems as one would have here, he was adequately able to represent his constituencies at all levels. He was always present and active. This increased the extent to which he was required to have a working knowledge of what happened in his constituency at local, national and international level. I am not saying it is possible to do the same in this country but I believe it was possible before the dual mandate was abolished. It was also much more beneficial for local and national democracy. While there are certain pundits who will strongly disagree with me, I strongly disagree with them as well. I reserve the right to hold that view on the dual mandate and will continue to hold it. We should learn from our mistakes in the past and improve on our current position. Ultimately, it should be an objective of constituency reviews that we make the constituency relevant as far as the public is concerned and we do not become slaves to someone else's grand theory about what democracy should look like. Incidentally, the basic democratic system of direct elections to the national parliament is the ultimate one.I realise various pundits have put forward suggestions on what might be improved but I do not believe in that concept either. I believe the system we have is the best one. I do not believe in list systems. The direct election system is the best. I believe that we should have a greater emphasis on continuity in so far as elected public representatives have a greater affinity with constituencies than might be the case if there were a series of electoral boundary revisions which ultimately created new and different boundaries after each revision to such an extent that there was a lack of identification with a particular area when it came to public representation. I do not accept the notion of those who believe that legislators should sit in a glass tower where legislation becomes impersonal and is done in a vacuum. As public representatives, the best lessons we learn come from listening to the views of our constituents and their reactions to the legislation that we pass or do not pass from time to time. We should keep an eye on it. We should remember that this a basic concept and tenet of democracy. If we do not, cannot or are unable to relate to the electorate and explain the situation we find ourselves in, and if we cannot identify with them and they with us, then we will lose the battle and democracy may well be replaced by something else. There are some who would regard that as a great idea but I do not concur. I hope that when the next constituency revision takes place - ultimately it will occur because of changes in population - some of the boundary changes that should be addressed again will be addressed in a positive way with a greater and due regard for county and other boundaries that have existed in the past and within which we have become familiar with working.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	197	I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution on the important legislation before us. Naturally, the legislation is based on a disappointing report. Deputy Durkan outlined the strengths of our parliamentary and democratic systems in his contribution. Public representatives must be close to the people they represent, otherwise they will not be returned to the Chamber. Earlier today, Deputy Durkan and myself attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade. We discussed the difficulties that have arisen in the greater Belfast area during the past 40 days. Last November, members of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, were in Belfast. We met representatives of the loyalist community in east Belfast. They had a serious grievance to the effect that they were not represented at all. All political parties have their faults. Our system has its faults but it has considerable strengths as well. No one is far removed from a public representative in this country. If a public representative was distant from his or her electorate, then his or her term in politics would be rather short. We have had the privilege of serving in the D√°il for some time. I was elected to the D√°il in November 1992. Deputy Durkan came in the early 1980s, if I recall correctly. The Minister of State, Deputy Perry, has long service here as well. We do not take our election for granted at any stage. When one election is over, we are preparing for the next on the basis that work starts again the following day. Earlier I saw the contribution of our colleague, Deputy John O'Mahony, on the monitor. He used the phrase "a dog's dinner" to describe the proposal for south Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and west and south Cavan and he was absolutely correct. The proposal for this constituency is outrageous and unprecedented. I tabled a question to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, on 19 September last. I asked whether any previous D√°il constituency configurations involved a constituency comprising the entirety or parts of four counties, as proposed in the boundary report for a new constituency comprising south Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and west and south Cavan, and whether he would make a statement on the matter. The Minister stated in reply:Thirteen pieces of legislation have been enacted since 1923 which define D√°il constituency boundaries. None of the D√°il constituencies specified in the relevant Electoral Acts comprise all or parts of four counties.The commission report is unprecedented. Cavan was a five-seat constituency at one stage, comprising the entirety of the county; the county boundary was totally intact. County Monaghan was a four-seater and may have been a five-seater at another stage. Both constituencies were reduced to three seat constituencies. Post the 1969 election a small area of north Meath near Carnaross and Oldcastle was added to the Cavan constituency and it remained a three-seat constituency. Similarly, for a period, the Monaghan constituency had part of County Louth and at another stage part of County Meath. These were small areas but ensured the constituencies had adequate numbers for representation. The first time Cavan-Monaghan was one constituency was in 1977 and it has been a five-seat constituency since then. There is considerable similarity between both countries. Both are Border counties. We share similar terrain. Both are drumlin counties. We have the same topography and the same type of indigenous industry and economic activity. Many public services in two counties are delivered on a Cavan-Monaghan basis, for example, the Cavan Monaghan Hospital Group, made up of Cavan General Hospital and Monaghan General Hospital. Health services are delivered on a two-county basis. Many voluntary organisations have been formed on a Cavan-Monaghan basis, including the Irish Wheelchair Association, the Irish Kidney Association and Positive Age, a group that does great work with our elderly and senior citizens. All of these groups are organised on a Cavan-Monaghan basis because there is much similarity and a natural boundary. Both countries share a boundary with Northern Ireland as well. Earlier, Deputy √ì Caol√°in referred to the considerable disadvantages that our two countries have suffered because of the Border since the foundation of the State and this is true. Naturally, our two counties suffered tremendously because of the unprecedented Troubles throughout the Six Counties and adjoining areas for a protracted period from the late 1960s until the mid-1990s. There are particular challenges for the people representing Cavan and Monaghan. I cannot fathom how a group of people could sign off on a proposal to create a constituency of south Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and west and south Cavan. Let us picture the map of Ireland in our minds. Part of Cavan is quite close to Dublin city. People commute from County Cavan to Dublin on a daily basis for work purposes. The proposed new constituency would go from the centre of Cavan, near Cavan town and the Longford border, over to south Sligo, which is currently in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy Perry. Close examination of the map suggests that the south Sligo area stretches west of Ballina, County Mayo.We now have a constituency stretching from east of the N55, the Cavan-Granard-Athlone road, to the centre of County Cavan, back to west of Ballina in County Mayo and south of Sligo where it stretches to south of Donegal town. It is ludicrous. The report as signed off by the independent constituency commission is the reason we should ensure there are people with practical political knowledge on any future commission. Anyone who has served in public office or has knowledge of the political system would not have signed off on these proposals. I acknowledge that successive Governments have appointed independent constituency commissions to draft proposals to try to take political people out of the system. However, the next commission should include representatives of the different political groups in the House. Eminent, retired politicians should be included who know the kind of constituencies it is practical to represent. I will contest the Cavan-Monaghan constituency at the next general election. The large part of Cavan to be included in the proposed south Donegal-Sligo-Leitrim constituency is where I am from originally. My home village is Bawnboy in the centre of west Cavan. I will lose that area from the constituency I will contest next time. I will not have the privilege of contesting with Deputy John Perry in south Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and west and south Cavan.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	199	I heard Deputies Joe O'Reilly, Heather Humphreys and Caoimhgh√≠n √ì Caol√°in outline clearly the ludicrousness of this proposal. Whoever is elected in the new constituency will have to deal with four local authorities and I do not know how many HSE regions they will cover.  The terms of reference quoted by Deputy John O'Mahony are worth referring to again. They set out that the constituency commission should, in observing the relevant provisions of the Constitution on D√°il constituencies, have regard to the following: the total number of Members of the D√°il and the need to avoid, as far as practicable, the breaching of county boundaries. I do not have a problem with the reduction in the number of Members or the requirement in each constituency to have three, four or five seats, but the constituency commission has not adhered to the need to avoid breaching county boundaries. It is further required to ensure constituencies comprise contiguous areas. The centre of Cavan to the Atlantic is not contiguous. If a person from Cavan intends to travel to south Donegal, he or she will travel through the Six Counties via County Fermanagh. If the constituency commission set out to ensure it breached the guidelines it was given, it could not have done so more thoroughly. I refer again to the terms of reference which state regard should be had to geographic considerations, including significant physical features and the extent and density of population in each constituency. Coastal counties have been included with counties in the midlands. The terms of reference also state the constituency commission should, subject to certain provisions, endeavour to maintain continuity in the arrangement of constituencies. Cavan and Monaghan have never had their county boundaries breached. There was an outcry by the people of County Leitrim to have their county unified, which is fair enough. However, I take exception to Fine Gael public representatives in County Leitrim who, in advocating the unification of their own county, advocated the division of County Cavan. When that party's representatives seek the support of the electorate in west and south Cavan, they will be reminded that County Cavan has been divided and that Fine Gael was to the forefront in the lobbying in that regard. The reports also suggest lobbying paid off in a big way. I do not blame the people of County Leitrim for lobbying; they were right to do so, but it should not be done on the basis of dividing another county. Swords was divided by the previous constituency commission, which was also ludicrous. I canvassed in the Dublin West by-election over a year ago and the people of Swords said the division was an issue for them. Deputy Alan Farrell spoke about the unification of Swords and the need to take into account growth in population. While Cavan is a vast rural county, it showed the third highest increase in population in the last census. Fingal, Laois and Cavan all experienced similar increases in population of approximately 14%. The county is being punished, notwithstanding the fact that its population is at its highest level in many decades. If teenagers with little knowledge or interest in politics were asked to formulate configurations for D√°il boundaries, they would not come up with the suggestion south Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim and west and south Cavan should form a constituency. Members who spoke earlier referred to the proposed abolition of town councils, something with which I disagree entirely. While I have never served on a local authority, I value the input of people who work on a voluntary basis at town and county council level. We have the ludicrous position in Belturbet, County Cavan, that the town will be split between two constituencies. It is farcical. I have mentioned that many public services in Cavan and Monaghan are delivered on a two-county basis. Many of our voluntary organisations are organised on a Cavan-Monaghan basis. This is because the two counties have a great deal in common. A pattern of local representation at community, county and constituency level is being shredded. Knowing some of the very competent public servants who sat on the constituency commission, I am astonished that they signed off on the report. I do not know if it has yet been placed in the public domain, but I would like to see the preparatory documentation which was placed before the constituency commission by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. I would love to see the permutations and combinations submitted. Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath have always been regarded as a unit and constituencies which include them should be configured on the basis of a north-east geographical area. The report is most disappointing and the people of Cavan and Monaghan are absolutely furious. The people who live in that large part of County Cavan who are being significantly disenfranchised are furious that for the first time in the history of the State their county boundaries are not being left intact. This is most disappointing. We will bring forward proposals on Committee Stage to seek a review of this matter. I heard Deputy John O'Mahony speak about how county boundaries had once again been breached in the west. We are going down a route where we will see continuing imbalance in representation which favours the east coast. Seats have been lost in counties Donegal, Mayo, Cavan, Monaghan, Kerry and Tipperary which are in the western half of the country. This must be the worst constituency commission report which has ever been produced. Despite its population being at its highest level in decades, County Cavan is the biggest victim of the poposals before the House.I agree with the sentiments expressed by colleagues from my constituency who spoke earlier about the break in the pattern of representation at public and community levels. It is disappointing. The report of the commission is unprecedented in many areas, including the fact that never before has the entirety of parts of four counties comprised one constituency.

It is an opportunity to look at the entire system and talk about what we do as Deputies. We are sent here by the people as messengers to the D√°il. There has been much discussion about the number of Deputies in the House and the number of people we represent. If one looks at national parliaments in small democracies like Ireland, one finds that we are well represented with roughly 16,000 people per public representative, including the Seanad. The proposal to abolish the Seanad would bring us up to a norm of about 25,000 people per public representative. Our electoral system is unique. I know the Constitutional Convention has been established to look at our electoral system which has a bearing on the number of constituencies and the number of Deputies per constituency. This House should start looking at different ways of electing Deputies. I am particularly taken with the mixed list system in New Zealand. Deputy Olivia Mitchell spoke earlier about having single seat constituencies with possibly a list system. We should start exploring those possibilities. Even though we talk about the reform of local government, all those who come into this House perform two roles. Many of us end up doing local work which should be the remit of councillors.

I represent Dublin Mid-West, which includes Lucan, Clondalkin, Rathcoole, Palmerstown and Saggart. Liffey Valley Shopping Centre is central in that constituency and contains HMV, which is a major employer and outlet, at least up until this week. I am very concerned for the overall welfare of the 300 employees of HMV Ireland and specifically the 16 employees in Liffey Valley Shopping Centre in Dublin Mid-West. I am aware that they have not been paid their Christmas salary on which they are depending. They were due to get five to six weeks' salary, including overtime. I am outraged that this money has not been paid. I learned today that the management instructed the employees not to open the stores and that the employees were effectively made redundant without notice. When inquiries were made by employees as to the status of their salaries, they were told that they would not be paid but that some arrangement could be sorted out in the meantime as HMV had an entitlement with the Irish Government. That is some attitude from an international outlet. I am very unhappy about this. This company had full knowledge of the difficulties it was about to encounter for quite some time and yet until last Sunday it continued to trade and indeed sold gift vouchers to customers. I contend that it knew full well the difficulties it was encountering and that the staff would lose their jobs. Vouchers are not just for Christmas but are valid for a period extending beyond that. I have some questions for the Minister for State in the short time I have. What contact has been made with Deloitte in respect of HMV and the employees' wages? What can be done by the Department and is there any legal comeback regarding the entitlement of thousands of customers whose gift vouchers the stores have refused to cash in?

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	210	HMV is a British-owned multinational and yesterday, its Irish section, HMV Ireland, closed its doors declaring it was in receivership. This has left over 300 staff in an intolerable position as regards their jobs and wages owed. It has also left an unknown number of ordinary people with gift vouchers which have been paid for but will not be honoured according to HMV. Staff are owed five weeks' wages, including a lot of overtime that was worked over Christmas. This is almost an exact re-run of what happened at the La Senza lingerie chain last January when staff were left in exactly the same situation. It is fine for Government Deputies to be angry. The question is where are the measures that should have been implemented to ensure that employers and big chains cannot act in this way. Workers in Limerick have occupied HMV stores demanding their rights and they should be fully supported. Workers in Limerick say their shops are viable and there is great potential in other areas if there was a strategy to maintain jobs and develop the activities in which the company was engaged. The State or local public agencies should therefore take ownership of this chain and with the staff, work out a plan to develop it, honour the vouchers for which ordinary people have paid and, in particular, maintain the jobs. Workers in occupation should be supported but, disgracefully, when workers in Thomas Cook Tours occupied premises to demand their rights, the doors of that company were bludgeoned by the garda√≠ and these workers were dragged in front of the courts so we want immunity for workers who occupy to defend their rights in front of powerful multinationals acting disgracefully.

#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	212	We all know companies can run into trouble and be forced into difficult decisions but HMV also has a duty of care to its staff and customers. It has failed miserably in that duty of care. It remains to be seen whether HMV Ireland has even been acting within the law. Its actions on Tuesday, 15 January when it opened for business but refused to accept gift vouchers even though it was not in receivership on that day would seem to be a clear breach of trading standards and should be investigated. Reneging on vouchers, be it due to trading difficulties or arbitrarily imposed deadlines, needs to be addressed and I intend to raise this issue again shortly. For now, our primary concern must be the staff of HMV. Their treatment has, quite frankly, been appalling. Their safety was put at risk when they were told to tell irate customers that they could not honour gift vouchers or offer refunds. On Tuesday evening, Irish staff were told in a conference call with Deloitte in the UK that their jobs were secure for the immediate future but by Wednesday morning, that commitment was in tatters. Now the company cannot even say whether staff will be paid this Friday for the previous month's work. Staff hired on a temporary basis in the run up to Christmas have already been told that they will probably not be paid. This is an appalling way to treat staff and simply cannot be tolerated. The response so far from HMV and from the receivers has been shambolic.They must be brought to account and staff must be treated fairly and with dignity.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	213	I thank the Deputies for raising this important issue. I share their concern about the situation in HMV Ireland Ltd., including in particular the position of employees in the company's Irish stores and consumers who hold unredeemed gift vouchers. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation regrets that he cannot be here as he is attending a Cabinet meeting. It was announced on Monday, 14 January 2013 that HMV in the UK would be put into administration, which is an insolvency process in the UK. The HMV stores in Ireland are operated by a separate legal entity, HMV Ireland Ltd. The Minister was informed that the Irish operation was put into receivership yesterday. The Irish receiver has indicated that he intends to seek a buyer for all or part of the business in Ireland. While I hope these efforts prove successful, at this point the future of the business is a matter for the receiver and any potential purchaser.  The Minister is aware that workers at HMV stores in Limerick began a sit-in yesterday and understands their concerns about the closure of the shops and the uncertainty they face. At his request and in an effort to allay their fears regarding unpaid wages and redundancy payments, officials from NERA were in contact last night with workers involved in the sit-in to provide advice on their employment rights. In situations in which an employer is insolvent and as a result defaults on payment of wages, the employees are protected by legislation. If the employer is unable to pay wages or redundancy payments, the employees are entitled to apply to the Department of Social Protection for payment of the amounts due from the employer. NERA is fully briefed on the situation and stands ready to provide all HMV workers with support and advice on their employment rights. My Department has opened a direct line of contact with the receiver, who has indicated that communicating with staff is a priority and to this end sent two staff to each location yesterday afternoon. It is clear that the receiver, having been appointed at 3 p.m. yesterday, is gathering all financial information relevant to the Irish operation and assessing the position. The receiver has indicated that he is making every effort to secure a purchaser for the stores. HMV in Ireland was not in receipt of supports from the State's enterprise agencies. It is my hope that jobs can be saved. In the event of any redundancies arising, all the supports of the State will be made available. The employees should be aware that their employment rights are protected by a wide variety of legislation. The Protection of Employment Acts 1977 to 2007 require an employer to engage in a 30-day consultation period with employees in collective redundancy situations. The Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act 1973 requires employers to give employees notice of termination of employment or to pay employees in lieu of notice. The length of notice depends on the length of service. Where an employer is insolvent and as a result defaults on payment of wages, the employees are entitled to seek payment from the State through the insolvency payments scheme administered by the Department of Social Protection. The employees may be entitled to payment from this fund in respect of holiday pay, outstanding pay and minimum notice, among other entitlements. Entitlements are limited to a maximum weekly rate of ‚Ç¨600 and there is a limit of eight weeks of arrears of pay, sick pay or holiday pay. Claims are made through the person legally appointed to wind up the company. Where a redundancy claim is submitted electronically, the processing of the redundancy claim is prioritised by the Department of Social Protection and payment can be expected after approximately eight weeks. Moneys owed up to the appointment of a receiver are secured by the Social Insurance Fund. For moneys owed and earned after the appointment, a claim may be made to a rights commissioner, who will adjudicate on the case. The issue of temporary lay-off is covered by the Redundancy Payments Acts, which are administered by the Department of Social Protection. An employer can lay off an employee if it is permitted by the contract of employment or if it is custom and practice in the workplace. Otherwise, the agreement of the employee should be obtained. If an employee does not agree to lay-off, he or she may be made redundant. If the receiver succeeds in selling all or possibly part of the company as a going concern, most of the employees' terms and conditions of employment may be protected by the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003. In so far as the sale of gift vouchers is concerned, consumer protection law prohibits traders from engaging in unfair or misleading commercial practices. Traders who are involved in the sale of gift vouchers are required to ensure that they do not mislead consumers through the omission of material or false information with regard to the characteristics of the gift voucher being offered for sale. The purchase of gift vouchers gives rise to particular considerations and it is important, therefore, that consumers fully acquaint themselves with the particular characteristics of any gift voucher they purchase. In this regard the National Consumer Agency provides advice to consumers on the particular matters they should consider when purchasing gift vouchers or cards. Aside from general advice, the agency also issued a public statement in the run-up to Christmas urging consumers to use gift vouchers as quickly as possible so as to avoid any difficulties in the event that the retail outlet selling the voucher went out of business. As regards consumers who have used payment cards to purchase vouchers from retailers that cease trading, the agency advises them to contact their card issuer to ascertain whether the charge-back rule of the payment card company can be invoked to recover the amount spent on the gift voucher. The agency's full advice and public statements on the purchase of gift vouchers can be obtained from its website.

I would contend that is exactly what HMV did. Clearly it was fully aware of the difficulties it was experiencing for a number of months, but it continued to sell gift vouchers as recently as last Sunday. Customers need more than advice from the National Consumer Agency in this situation. I ask the Minister of State's opinion on whether new legislation is required. I do not think the support being offered at present is sufficient.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	215	I utterly condemn the actions of HMV in regard to the treatment of staff and demand that their rights be upheld. The script supplied by the Minister of State contains the following statement which he did not have time to read:The retail and wholesale sector employs over 250,000 people in Ireland - that is almost 15% of our total workforce. The sector suffered heavy job losses throughout the recession, shedding over 55,000 jobs since 2008.We must understand this issue in the context of austerity and the crazed policy of taking from the pockets of ordinary people billions of euro which would otherwise be spent in shops to maintain employment and the domestic economy. More than 300 jobs are at risk. The infrastructure should be taken into public ownership and control and developed as a viable enterprise which would bring workers to the heart of management. This would maintain their jobs and honour the various obligations that the company entered into in respect of vouchers.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	216	The Minister of State noted that the receiver is communicating with staff. I regard that as an insult to the staff with whom I have spoken today. I acknowledge that the receiver's representatives have visited stores across the country, but that was to change the locks and codes, not to advise staff as to their rights.That is something entirely different. The Minister of State's response offers little to console staff or consumers with outstanding vouchers they want to cash. I understand the Consumer Protection Act 2007 has been reviewed. In the context of that review, is the Minister aware of any reference made to strengthening the rights of consumers who hold vouchers in circumstances like this? I agree with Deputy Keating and others that legislation should be introduced or existing legislation should be amended, whether that be the recently published Companies Bill or the Consumer Protection Act, to reflect the need for vouchers that have been paid for to be cashed and used.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	217	I will not delay on this. With regard to the company selling gift vouchers in the busy Christmas period, consumers holding unredeemed vouchers who are concerned that the company may have engaged in reckless trading in continuing to sell gift vouchers in the knowledge that, because of the company's financial trading position, these would not be honoured, may wish to bring their concerns to the attention of the receiver. The point the Deputy is making is that this should be investigated. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, has said that the Department has been in contact with the receiver, who was appointed yesterday. Under the provisions of State statutory entitlements, up to ‚Ç¨600 per week may be claimed for up to eight weeks. Therefore, there is significant protection through company law with regard to the entitlement of consumers.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	219	I am talking about existing legislation. We could not introduce new legislation that would be retrospective. There is confusion with regard to whether gift vouchers should be honoured since the company went into receivership on 15 January. It is important to put on the record that with regard to HMV Ireland, the National Consumer Agency issued a public statement at 9.15 a.m. on 16 January in which it noted that HMV Ireland was a separate entity and was not covered by the administration of the UK company. The agency queried the basis on which the Irish company refused to honour consumers' gift vouchers, given the Irish company was continuing to trade at that stage and was not under the protection of the administration or examinership process. The agency called on the company to honour the customer gift vouchers. HMV Ireland subsequently went into receivership on 16 January. The issue of honouring gift vouchers is a matter that should be addressed to the receiver, who has stated that it is his intention to institute an assessment of the viability of the Irish stores and to make every effort to secure a purchaser for the store. It is disappointing that a gift voucher is now like an unsecured creditor. However, I hope the receiver appointed will succeed in his intention to sell the store as a going concern. Deputy Higgins made the point that this will be difficult due to the nature of the business and the change in technology relating to it. It is a difficult business to be in and it is not as a result of austerity that the business has trading difficulties.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	220	I have raised this issue because of comments made by the chief executive of IDA Ireland, Mr. Barry O'Leary, last week. He said that even with regional incentives, it was becoming increasingly difficult to convince companies to invest outside of Dublin or Cork. He was speaking on an occasion when he was announcing a net 6,570 jobs resulting from 145 investments by multinationals. Where those developments went was not surprising. In fact, where such developments go has become entirely predictable. Of the 167 job announcements made by the IDA in 2011-12, 79 were centred in Dublin, 24 in Galway and 20 in Cork. We are getting used to that trend. Based on recent research, it seems that as much of 82% of jobs created by overseas firms in the past six years have been centred in those three urban areas. This trend has hardened since Mr. O'Leary took on his position in the IDA in early 2008. I would go so far as to say I do not believe there is a serious policy in the IDA for attracting foreign direct investment into the regions. My constituency of Waterford city and county has become an afterthought for the IDA and is effectively a foreign investment free zone. This brings us to the issue of regional or investment aid and the incentives that are intended to incentivise foreign companies to move outside of the three urban areas which have been getting the bulk of foreign direct investment. The objective of the regional aid scheme is to provide support to enterprises that seek financial assistance to establish an initial investment and-or job creation link to an initial investment project in Ireland. It lists the categories which can get a grant, salary costs, second-hand equipment, lease land and buildings, etc. The regional aid incentives are not working and have not worked for some time. As far as I understand, the existing framework for regional aid and the regional aid map cover the years 2007-2013. I understand also that the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is putting together new guidelines, in conjunction with the European Commission, for the post-2013 period. How is the Minister going to incentivise foreign companies to invest in areas under the new regional aid guidelines he is drawing up with the European Union? Under the current regional aid map, the highest rates are afforded to the Border, midlands and west, BMW, region. For the period 2007 to the end of 2010, the region qualified for a rate of 30% for large firms, and 40% and 50% for medium and small firms, respectively. In accordance with the guidelines, a reduced rate of aid for the BMW region came into being in 2011, reducing to 15% for large companies, and 25% and 35% for medium and small firms, respectively. The maximum current aid rates for parts of the south and east region remains at the lower level of 10% for large companies and 20% and 30% for medium and small companies, respectively. It is worth pointing out that the CSO recently reported that unemployment was highest in the south east, at 18.7%. The south east does not qualify for the highest levels of regional aid. The Minister should amend the regional aid guidelines immediately, as has been done previously, to reflect the current economic landscape in the different parts of the country. If the Minister accepts that these incentives are not working - it would be hard not to - what plans does he have to incentivise foreign firms to develop in the regions outside of Dublin, Cork and Galway?
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	221	I appreciate what Deputy Deasy has said on investment and thank him for raising this issue. State aid regulation is a matter of major concern for Ireland and the operation of a level playing field across the European Union is critical to the pursuit of industrial development. Large enterprises have an important impact on regional economies. They stimulate competitiveness and productivity, upgrade the industrial base, facilitate SME growth, increase the level of competition in local markets and improve labour and management skills for the economy in general. In order to improve European competitiveness, create jobs and emerge from the current economic situation, it is essential that EU member states have sufficient flexibility to assist the regions make the required adjustments. This is particularly relevant in Ireland, given the ongoing need to upgrade the industrial base and the fact that the economic crisis has had a severe impact on a number of Irish regions. The Government believes that the current economic crisis and resulting balance of payments imbalance provide a significant challenge to the European Union as a whole. This is particularly important given that international competition for investment is intensifying outside the Union. Regional aid is an important lever of European economic development and international competitiveness, and we are extremely concerned that a number of measures proposed by the Commission will inhibit potential investment in Europe's disadvantaged regions. I understand clearly what Deputy Deasy has said in this regard and with regard to development taking place in Dublin, Cork and Galway. The European Union as a block must often compete with third countries for mobile foreign direct investment. Recognition should be given to the positive benefits for the EU economy and society of facilitating FDI, particularly in high-tech areas. State aid is also being provided for third countries to undertake measures we believe will benefit from some consideration by the Commission. I assure the Deputy the Government is keenly aware of the impact of the proposed changes in the regional aid guidelines for the country and will strongly defend our interests in the multilateral discussions about to commence.It is important for us to have a clear position. Despite the benefits of the aid that is currently provided, it is difficult to get industry into the BMW region. That difficulty would be far greater if that aid were to be diminished in any way. Our needs and interests will be highlighted and alliances will be forged to effect the best defence possible. I have been to Waterford. I have met the regional director of the south-east region. In light of the level of unemployment in the region, it is important for IDA Ireland to give every consideration to it when decisions on foreign direct investment are being made. I will speak to Barry O'Leary to ensure that the regions beyond the places mentioned by Deputy Deasy are considered. Ireland is striving to address a real economic crisis and to avoid a depletion of its historical national and regional economic development. If Ireland is to retain the flexibility afforded by the use of regional aid, as it needs to do, we must make our case strongly with the other EU member states in the coming weeks and months. Deputy Deasy has made an important point. I do not doubt that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will fight in a determined manner to ensure we retain our regional benefits. We must make every effort to argue for foreign direct investment to be brought to regions where such industrial activity has not taken place before now.

I think we are talking about two different things. The Minister of State spoke about defending the concept of regional aid at European level. The point that Barry O'Leary and I are making is that the existing regional aid guidelines are not working. It is a question of their effectiveness and utility. The guidelines that are being used to incentivise companies to come to Ireland are not working. The Cabinet is having a special meeting this afternoon to deal with jobs. That is why the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is not here. When I looked at the press release, I read the usual lingo about Ministers being asked to report back with regard to the number of jobs that might be created. The Taoiseach and his Ministers need to start thinking about where these jobs are being created or not being created. I say that because a massive imbalance or disparity between the regions has opened up in this country. I have come to the conclusion that nothing much is being done about it. Very little thought is being given to the issue. I believe IDA Ireland has become quite content to announce every year the jobs it has created for Ireland Incorporated and leave it at that. That is not good enough. It needs to be dealt with. That disparity and imbalance is getting wider. I conclude by putting some obvious questions to the Department. Who are the stakeholders the Minister consults when he makes these submissions to the EU? Can the Minister give the Members of this House details of the involvement or input they will have when the regional aid map, and the financial incentives involved, is redrawn? Will he increase the amount of regional investment aid that is given to those parts of the country that are experiencing massive levels of unemployment? It is clear that the regional aid guidelines are not working. I would like to know why they have not been amended to date.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	223	I appreciate the concerns of Deputy Deasy. I will bring them directly to the Minister, Deputy Bruton. As Barry O'Leary could testify, it is very hard to influence foreign companies that have the potential to invest in Ireland. They tend to be driven by their own factors when they decide to go to Dublin, Galway or Cork. Although we can avail of major benefits in the BMW region, we are encountering the same difficulties as the south-east region, which have been highlighted by Deputy Deasy. Although the substantial benefits that are available in the BMW region are not available in Dublin or Cork, companies are continuing to choose to go to those cities. That is a fact. They are still going to Dublin or Cork even though they are not getting the same benefits, in terms of employee entitlements, that they would get if they went to the BMW region. The point is well made. We are fortunate that IDA Ireland has had a very successful period with regard to foreign direct investment. Obviously, we all wish there was a greater regional spread. As a representative of a Border constituency, I appreciate what Deputy Deasy is saying. I am sure the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will take on board the Deputy's concerns and fight to ensure the regions become more attractive to foreign direct investment. I remind the House that some very good investments in the south-east region have been made by indigenous Irish companies with support from Enterprise Ireland. We are all focusing on the creation of jobs. The jobs plan that will be announced in the coming weeks will have a clear focus on what we can do to facilitate the creation of jobs in the economy.

I hope the Minister of State will pass on my concerns in relation to the Beechpark services of the HSE. Since a school in my constituency - Scoil Chiar√°in in Donnycarney - contacted me about this service, I have been contacted by other schools about it. The authorities at Scoil Chiar√°in have been told that Beechpark will not provide any more speech and language therapy services to children of primary school age in this term. No guarantees have been received with regard to the next term. There are 18 children in the unit at the school in question. According to the letter I received from the school, "twelve children will now rely solely on their class teacher for SLT support". This is an untenable situation. Beechpark has provided work for the children to do within their mainstream classes, which is not the best way to proceed with children who are so vulnerable and needy. According to a letter I have received from a parent at the same school:Our son is on the ASD spectrum and is currently attending an outreach ASD class in Scoil Chiar√°in C.B.S. on Collins Avenue. We were recently informed that our son will not be receiving any in-school Speech and Language support during this new school term. The reason being that Beechpark, the HSE providers, are unable to fill a senior SLT position due to the on-going embargo on recruitment. Therefore their current SLTs are being stretched to the limit, resulting in our son losing out on crucial language therapy. It is imperative that our son has every opportunity to continue to develop his social and communicative skills. We are very concerned as to how this loss in support will hinder his development, going forward.The letter I have received from the school states:Twelve children will now rely solely on their class teacher for SLT support. Our children are enrolled in our outreach classes with the hope that they will be able to integrate full time with mainstream. How can this happen when their supports are being withdrawn? Communication is an essential area of development for children with autism.Essentially, I am asking why there does not seem to be any co-ordination with regard to special education between the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills. It is needed if we are to tackle this issue. Everyone understands the economic situation, but that is cold comfort for parents whose children desperately need these services. We are faced with the prospect of saying to the parent of a child on the ASD spectrum that he or she will have to stay within his or her mainstream class for this term, and possibly the next term, because one of the senior speech and language therapy positions within this service cannot be filled as a result of the recruitment embargo. If we believe in education as a great liberator and if we believe in the potential of every child, regardless of his or her learning difficulties, surely we cannot stand over this position. I have been told by the representatives of disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged schools in my constituency - the school in this case is a disadvantaged school - that they know of children who have been waiting for two years to access the services they need, including occupational therapy services and the speech and language therapy services that are provided by Beechpark. When they finally get those services, it is a great thing for the school. In this case, Col√°iste Chiar√°in has been told some of its pupils will have to do without certain services because of the recruitment embargo. I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the children in this unit deserve an awful lot better. I will be interested to hear his response.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	227	I thank Deputy √ì R√≠ord√°in for raising this important issue. The Government is committed to protecting front-line services, including services for children with disabilities and autism, to the greatest possible extent by seeking to maximise the provision of services within available resources. As the Deputy will know, the Government has decided that the number of people employed across the public service must be reduced to 282,500 by the end of 2014 to help it to meet its fiscal and budgetary targets. The health sector must make a proportionate contribution to the achievement of this reduction. The general moratorium on the recruitment or replacement of staff is one of the measures that have been put in place by the Government to achieve this aim. The HSE can make staff appointments as long as it remains within its overall employment ceiling and has the financial resources to do so.However, given the need to meet overall budgetary and employment targets, such appointments must be kept to a minimum. The HSE aims to ensure the resources available for speech and language therapy are used to best effect in order to provide assessment and ongoing therapy to children and adults in line with their prioritised needs. Along with the significant investment in the area of speech and language therapists employed in recent years, a range of new approaches has been developed and used in many speech and language therapy services across the country. These include providing structures, training and support to parents and carers so they can work to help improve the individual's speech and language. In addition, therapy is delivered in group settings where appropriate. It is key, in this context, that services are configured to ensure optimal effectiveness and efficiency within the existing substantial resources. As the Deputy may be aware, the Beechpark autism services in north Dublin are currently being reviewed to see how they can be provided to best effect into the future. Arising out of a report prepared by the HSE for the Minister for Health on the Beechpark autism services, I established an independent expert group to review and make recommendations on them. The review group comprises the chairman, Mr. James O'Grady, Professor Michael Fitzgerald and Dr. Fiona Keogh. The review group has already met on several occasions and has carried out two site visits as part of its work to date. The review is being conducted having regard to the national policy framework on children's disability and autism services set out in the report of the National Reference Group on Multidisciplinary Disability Services for Children aged 5-18 and the HSE review of autism services, as well as the reorganisation of services based on this national policy that is under way under the national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people aged up to 18. The review will also consider and make recommendations on how available resources for children's disability and autism services should be utilised across all HSE areas, having regard to the principles of equity of access to services, value for money, quality and sustainability, and in light of the national policy framework. The review is nearing completion and the group expects to be in a position to present its recommendations to me in the near future. The particular issue raised by the Deputy will need to be considered in the context of the report of the Beechpark review group and in light of the financial and employment control parameters. There is no doubt the current economic situation in the country is presenting challenges to us in terms of how best to maximise the provision of services within available resources. The Minister is committed to protecting front-line services, including children's disability and autism services to the greatest possible extent.

They will not be impressed with an indication of the overall economic situation, which they have been told of to death, and they will not necessarily be impressed by a review group. The situation is that a senior speech and language therapy position is not being filled. Reviews are wonderful, but the problem is there are 12 children on the autism spectrum who are being told to go back to class. They are being told, "Here is some work you can do in your classroom with your class teacher". It is completely unfair, not just to the children and their parents, but also to the teacher, who is completely incapable of dealing with the situation presented to him or her. I would ask for a more sympathetic and more realistic answer from the Minister. These are very needy and vulnerable children who have fantastic capabilities and potential. This school received a letter from Beechpark on 20 December stating that the senior speech and language position at the school cannot be filled and that it would not have any service in the first term of 2013 and possibly in the term after that. That is an unsustainable position. A school has to plan for an entire year. The Minister of State will probably agree with me that it is far from an ideal position. I would ask for more than a commitment to a review because a review does not take account of the specific situation in which we find ourselves, where the children are being left without the services they need.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	229	Being a teacher himself, the Deputy knows only too well the challenges facing children and I fully respect what he has said. I would ask him to engage with Mr. James O'Grady, whom the Deputy has possibly met, Professor Michael Fitzgerald and Dr. Fiona Keogh. It is very important that the school would engage with the review group in regard to how best to facilitate Beechpark. This report is near completion and the Minister, Deputy Reilly, will be very sympathetic in this regard. As the Deputy knows, however, there is an embargo on recruitment. It is a question of utilising the services that are there to serve the greatest possible need. The expert group is to make a recommendation on the Beechpark autism services in north Dublin very shortly. It would be very important that they are invited to the school as they might be able, in some way, to come up with an idea to deal with the important issue raised by the Deputy. It might be advisable for the Deputy to engage directly with the review group and I wonder whether the principal of the school has met the members of the group, which is another possible avenue. Review groups are important and they are not just talking shops. The Minister has appointed the group with a mandate to come back with suggestions as to how best to maximise the services in north Dublin, which will be to benefit of everybody. I strongly advise the Deputy to engage with the chair and with Professor Michael Fitzgerald to see what exactly is happening and whether the outturn of the review will solve the problem at Beechpark. That is the question we have to answer. Until the Minister, Deputy Reilly, gets that answer, there is nothing he can do.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	230	With all due respect to the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, it is very disappointing the Minister for Justice and Equality cannot be present to hear the very real concerns of the people of Donegal. I suggest it shows the priority Donegal is receiving in regard to these incidents in the county in recent weeks and months. While there may be a Cabinet meeting ongoing, the Minister for Justice and Equality does not have any role in terms of job creation. In fact, with Garda numbers declining, it is probably unemployment creation that is his role. It has been clear for some time that there is a major issue with burglaries targeting the elderly in Donegal. The burglary and assault of a number of elderly people this week, as well as recent such incidents involving an 84 year old woman and the brutal attack on a 96 year old woman, are utterly despicable. Unfortunately, this has been an ongoing problem for some time. I highlighted this issue to the Taoiseach in the D√°il late last year on Leaders' Questions, but it obviously fell on deaf ears and we are now seeing the brutal consequences of the Government's attack on rural Ireland. Donegal has already seen cuts to the Garda presence, which has led to the havoc we are now experiencing. With a further five stations to close this year, I am seriously concerned as to how such incidents will be dealt with in the future, as garda√≠ appear to be struggling to cope with the current spate of vicious burglaries. We have already heard how the Minister, Deputy Shatter, has been assured by the Garda Commissioner that it is an absolute priority to bring the people responsible to justice and that the Garda is devoting all necessary resources to that end. If they are relying on the resources available in Donegal, they will not have much hope. These criminals have no fear because they know they will not be caught, as matters stand. The only answer is to increase the Garda presence and prevent any further closures of Garda stations so a clear message is sent out that this barbaric behaviour will not be tolerated in Donegal.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	231	I too have to say, on behalf of the elderly people of Donegal, it is an absolute disgrace that the Minister for Justice and Equality is not here to answer this very important question from three Donegal Deputies. I sat in my office in Leinster House to watch "Prime Time" when Miriam O'Callaghan interviewed Phyllis McGee, a very brave woman, who was robbed not once but twice in her home in Pettigo. The next morning, I got a message from Deputy P√°draig Mac Lochlainn to tell me there were two more robberies in Inishowen. As people were sitting back, some in tears, watching Phyllis McGee's bravery, criminal gangs were out preparing to rob elderly people in other parts of Donegal. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, went to the media and said the closure of rural Garda stations will ensure more garda√≠ are on the beat in Donegal and other areas. That is nothing but bull. Let us look at the facts. Some 31 garda√≠ have been taken from the Donegal service in 2012 alone and 24 garda√≠ have been taken off the street and put in offices. The station in Pettigo does not have a garda assigned to it. Ten years ago, 12 garda√≠ were assigned there, eight years ago there were four and there were two until recent years. Now, there is none. No wonder criminals see the likes of Phyllis Magee as an easy target in rural Border communities. The Minister needs to do more than spin. He should be before this House telling elderly, vulnerable people in Donegal and other communities what his strategy is to ensure that the garda√≠ are resourced to the best of his ability to ensure that these crimes do not happen in the first place and that when they do happen that the perpetrators will be caught.

He shamefully went on Highland Radio, our local radio station in Donegal, yesterday and said that Donegal is not a unique case. Elderly people have been robbed. There has been aggravated burglary, people are attacked in their own homes from the Inishowen Peninsula right down to Pettigo and Donegal town and through east Donegal. Elderly people across Donegal, particularly those living alone, are terrified. They are looking for a clear plan. The garda√≠ on the ground in Donegal say they do not have the resources or the vehicles to deal with this. I am not talking about the superintendents and the top brass who always say the Government is doing the right thing. We need the Minister to intervene. We do not need two fingers shown to the people of our county. We need a clear indication of how he will resource the garda√≠, bring in specialists and deal with this rampant criminality and send a clear message to the people of the county, particularly elderly citizens, that they will be adequately protected.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	233	I wish to thank the Deputies for raising these important matters. I am speaking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, who regrets that he is unable to be present today as he is chairing a meeting of the Informal Justice and Home Affairs Council in Dublin Castle as part of our EU Presidency programme. The Minister is very conscious of the deep distress which burglary and similar crimes can cause to householders in both urban and rural areas, as well as the broader impact it can have in terms of fear of crime in our communities. He also shares the widespread outrage at the recent incidents of aggravated burglary, and he is fully confident that the Garda is doing everything in its power to bring the perpetrators of these appalling crimes to justice. In particular, the Minister has kept in close touch with Garda Commissioner Callinan about these recent attacks. The Commissioner has assured the Minister that it is an absolute priority for himself and his force that the people involved will be brought to justice as quickly as possible. An Garda S√≠och√°na is devoting all the resources necessary to achieve this. The Garda is taking a number of operational measures to deal with this problem, including additional patrols and checkpoints, dissemination of intelligence within the force concerning potential suspects and further close co-operation with the PSNI. For obvious reasons the Minister cannot go into detail publicly about these operations but one thing is clear: whatever steps are necessary, within the law, to deal with these attacks are being taken and being taken urgently. Based on its track record, we have every reason to believe that the Garda will be successful in its efforts. In particular, the Minister welcomes the progress being made as part of Operation Fiacla, which is focused on identifying and targeting gangs involved in burglaries. Operation Fiacla is intelligence driven and, as part of that operation, specific burglary initiatives have been implemented in each Garda region to target suspect offenders. As of 31 December 2012, 3,538 persons have been arrested and 1,924 persons have been charged as part of Operation Fiacla, showing that the Garda Commissioner is effectively deploying the substantial resources available to him. Furthermore, the latest quarterly figures for burglary suggest that Operation Fiacla is having an impact, when compared with the quarterly figures prior to its introduction. While clearly it is no consolation to those who have had to endure dreadful experiences at the hands of gangs of burglars, it is nonetheless important to mention that the most recent crime figures show that the number of aggravated burglaries has gone down by over 17% on the previous 12 months. The Garda response to such crimes is robust and gangs and individuals involved in burglaries are pursued with determination arid effectiveness. Of course, there are changes to the way policing is being managed and the Minister appreciates that people have concerns about this. The priority in all the changes being made is to ensure that we have an effective and professional policing service provided to the community, throughout the country. Until recently, the Garda station network was essentially the same as the RIG network which obtained in 1922, and clearly this was not appropriate to the policing needs of the 21st century or consistent with modern policing practice. The Garda S√≠och√°na now has a class-leading police computer system, a state-of-the-art digital radio system and a transport fleet which is currently receiving significant investment. An additional investment of ‚Ç¨3 million in the Garda fleet towards the end of 2012 has resulted in more than170 new vehicles being purchased. These vehicles are currently entering into service. A further ‚Ç¨5 million has been made available for the purchase and fit-out of new Garda vehicles in 2013. This substantial investment will contribute in a significant way to the ability of the force to operate to the optimum benefit of our communities throughout the country. The Garda national policing plan for 2013 outlines the Commissioner's proposals for the continued reorganisation and consolidation of the Garda station and district network. After the closure of 100 Garda stations in 2013, there will still be 564 Garda stations in the State. That will be significantly more than comparable jurisdictions, such as Northern Ireland, where there are 86 stations with a population of 1.5 million people, or Scotland, where there are around 340 stations for a population of 5.2 million. The essential point of the Garda Commissioner's strategy for re-organisation and consolidation is to make the best use of our well-trained garda√≠ and in particular to maximise their time on operational duties. This is precisely what is required in order to respond effectively to these shocking recent incidents and the Garda has the full confidence of the Minister and the Government in the way it is tackling these challenges. I am sure all in this House would wish to acknowledge the continuing efforts and achievements of An Garda S√≠och√°na, on behalf of our communities.

I am sure that if he could point to a reduction in burglaries and aggravated burglaries in Donegal he would have included that statistic in his response today. Aggravated burglaries in Donegal have probably gone up by hundreds of per cent over the past year and over the same period that Operation Fiacla has been running. The Minister needs to address this issue straight away in Donegal and provide the resources necessary for the garda√≠ to deal with this issue. He talks about the new investment in the Garda fleet. These are not new vehicles. They are replacement vehicles, replacing fewer vehicles than have been taken out of commission. The Minister needs to make sure that the resources are available to change the situation that has existed for the past few months in Donegal where in west Donegal a squad car had to travel over 40 miles to attend a very serious incident and in Inishowen a garda had to hitch a lift to investigate a burglary. That is what the garda√≠ face in Donegal and the Minister needs to address it immediately.

I know this comes in waves and depends which gangs are operating but Phyllis Magee was robbed twice and individuals in Buncrana, Inishowen and Raphoe have also been robbed. I spoke recently to a relative of somebody who had passed away who told me that the deceased had been robbed a couple of weeks previously and went downhill completely. Unfortunately, a deceased relative of mine, a very elderly woman, was robbed. These people talk about the invasion of their personal space, their house and rooms, and how difficult it is for them to return afterwards. There is nothing of comfort in the Minister‚Äôs response to deal with the crisis in Donegal. No garda has been assigned to Pettigo Garda station since 2011. Will the Government ask the Commissioner to overturn this decision?

All the national radio stations and newspapers have focused on Donegal. They can see that we have a crime emergency in the county. Yet the Minister for Justice and Equality said on our local radio station that nothing unique is happening there.He could have delegated his Minister of State to cover the business in Dublin Castle in order to come to County Donegal, but he is out of touch. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, will communicate to the Minister that people on the ground in Donegal, particularly our elderly citizens, are terrified. They need to see clear, decisive leadership and a clear priority being given to the county until this matter is sorted out. No amount of spin about Garda numbers, vehicles, stations and rosters will cut it, because we know both from garda√≠ on the ground and from the GRA, which has destroyed the spin during the past year, that these assertions do not stand up to scrutiny. Let this matter be a priority and let the Minister show decisive leadership and take action to deal with it as soon as possible.

He is chairing an EU meeting in Dublin Castle today, an obligation of the EU Presidency. On commitment, the Minister has been in constant contact with the Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan. The resources of the State are being made available. The new cars are replacements for existing cars and are not additional, but they are brand new and are a big investment in the road fleet. The Minister empathises totally with the victims of crime. The fact is that 1,900 people have been arrested and charged and more than 3,000 have been brought in as suspects. Operation Fiacla is very effective. Major surveillance is going on at present and I assure the Deputy that the Garda S√≠och√°na currently has resources available. The Commissioner is more than happy that he is dealing with the matter very effectively. I know about this only too well, being from an adjoining county. There have been incidents in south and west Sligo and this is a concern, particularly in west Sligo. However, the superintendent on hand has dealt with it. The people involved were members of one gang that carried out a series of robberies, and they have been apprehended. There is a big role here for the community also. It is about community policing, and the State gets very good co-operation on the ground from the community. The Minister, Deputy Shatter, wishes to ensure the matter will be dealt with and I assure the Deputy that it will be.

As the Deputies are aware, the Government has been working extremely hard to secure a deal on the Irish bank debt with our European partners, and detailed work will continue to ensure that positive moves in Europe are harnessed to maximise the benefit to the Irish taxpayer. The focus of the ongoing detailed discussions has progressed to consideration of all options in regard to the promissory notes, such as the source of funding, the duration of the notes and the interest rate applicable, as well as potential avenues for the wider bank debt deal and the impact of these options on IBRC. This work is one of the Government‚Äôs key priorities and will remain a key focus during the EU Presidency. As previously advised to the House, the terms sought by the Government are those which achieve the best possible outcome for the Irish taxpayer. It is not possible to give guidance on the timing or potential outcome of the discussions, as to do so could impede our ability to achieve the best possible results, but every effort is being made to expedite the ongoing process. I am satisfied that every available and appropriate opportunity to advance Ireland‚Äôs position with regard to legacy bank debt with our European partners is being availed of and that every effort to keep the issue of the Irish bank debt at the top of the European agenda is being made. I have stated previously that I am working to try and achieve a solution before the next scheduled instalment on the promissory note, scheduled for March. The numerous references in Europe to Ireland‚Äôs special status in regard to discussions on these matters gives comfort and the Irish Presidency will build on this in the coming months. The recent comments of the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, following his meeting with the Taoiseach and T√°naiste in respect of his support for a positive outcome in our negotiations is to be welcomed. I have always stated that our problems are part of a wider European dilemma and any solution to address the Irish situation must be as part of an overall eurozone and global solution. The shift in European policy in terms of breaking the vicious circle between the banks and the sovereign is to be welcomed and represents a major step forward. It would be difficult for Ireland to make a payment on the promissory notes, and so we continue to work on a deal with our European partners to resolve this issue. I am glad to say that we meet with strong appreciation of our situation and are able to have very constructive dialogue on our approach to this question, and I believe a deal is likely in advance of the March deadline. As the Governor of the Central Bank stated yesterday to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, there has been an intensive process of discussion and negotiation on this matter, which is one of the main thrusts of the Government‚Äôs policy in Europe. It is not easy to find a generally acceptable solution and an initiative of this type must take into account both the statutory position and wider policy stance of the ECB. We have been working carefully to build understanding and confidence around a set of proposed transactions designed to deliver for Ireland.

I honestly believe he would not have made such a statement unless he was 100% sure we would get the deal. The Taoiseach stated some days ago he was confident of it and yesterday, at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, the Governor of the Central Bank stated that the ECB is an organisation that seeks to proceed as far as possible by consensus. It is not surprising that this work has been taking quite a while. I believe what we have designed is largely in the interest of the euro system as a whole. Professor Honohan made it clear yesterday that something has been designed. I accept there are probably some i's to be dotted and t's to be crossed. It is now clear that the deal is essentially ready and just remains to be signed off. The Minister's confirmation that the deal is likely is confirmation enough as far as I am concerned because I do not believe he would have used those words if the deal was not likely to happen. The question now is what will be the benefits for the general Irish public this year given that the deal has been made. It has not been officially announced or signed off but essentially it is in the melting pot, to be delivered before 31 March. Has the Minister been looking at issues such as the minimal interest rates of close to 0%? When the deal is done, even though the loan may be extended over a period - I would ask for a deferral of the principal until the end of the loan - what we do not want is to have to pay more interest over a longer period than is scheduled under the current arrangement. As part of the talks, has the Minister asked for any reduction in the actual principal? He may not be able to confirm this, but I believe that if one does not ask for this one will certainly not get it. We would like to think that every effort is being made on every front in regard to this deal. I am pleased that the deal is all but announced. The big question the people of this country want answered today is what the benefits will be for them in terms of the austerity programme and the expenditure cuts announced on the day of the budget, and whether there can be any relief on these during the course of this year.

What I said was that it was likely. In saying that, I reiterate what I said in advance of the Eurogroup meeting in Brussels last December. I was asked if Ireland would be paying the promissory note and I replied that because a deal was likely it was unlikely that we would be paying it in full. There is no advance on that. The Deputy should not assume a deal is certain. There are still significant parts of the negotiation to be completed.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	241	There has been a great deal of talk about the deal and the Minister's comments today are welcome. The Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, probably said more than the Minister, Deputy Noonan, would have wished. The comments from the Taoiseach and those made yesterday by the Governor of the Central Bank all indicate that a deal is very likely. Given that, the real question is what is a deal. Last year, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, announced a deal that was a five-hand trick with the IBRC, the State, NAMA, Bank of Ireland and back again to IBRC, in which the ECB got its money and we ended up worse off in terms of our budgetary position. We paid the capital but there is still liability and our debt did not decrease.The real question the people to whom I speak want to have answered is what impact it will have on them. According to the Governor, something is being engineered by the Central Bank. It has not been signed off on, as he has not got complete agreement on it. Will the Minister provide clarity for the House and the public at home on the proposal before the ECB? Will it lead to a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio and the liability on taxpayers to pay back ‚Ç¨28.1 billion to the IBRC, which is what the promissory note is worth at this point in time? Will there be a reduction in the amount of capital? Will we end up paying more or less in interest as a result this year? When I put these questions to the Governor, it appeared that the engineering of a deal would mean that our debt would not decrease, that we would end up paying back all of the capital and that the amount in interest we would pay this year would increase rather than decrease. That was the sense I took from him and I stand to be corrected. I, therefore, seek clarification from the Minister on where the issue lies. I understand there will be benefits in the medium term in terms of profiling and also that there could be significant benefits in the budgetary position next year. However, when Fine Gael spoke about burden sharing, most believed it would be between the bankers and the bond holders; we did not think it would be between one generation and the next. It is clear that the deal being orchestrated involves passing the burden from this generation to the next, but that is not the burden sharing most people want to see.

It has not been concluded. There are significant outstanding matters that have yet to be concluded and they are of sufficient magnitude to derail a deal. There are also some moving parts; therefore, it is not possible for me to discuss the elements of the deal until it has been finalised, which is obvious. I accept Deputy Sean Fleming's good wishes and acknowledge his concern that we negotiate a deal because the promissory note has been a significant burden on the taxpayer. Relieving the burden of the promissory note would be welcomed by all taxpayers. I am also well aware that there are certain commentators and Deputies in the House who, regardless of whether there is adeal, will spend the next couple of weeks positioning themselves to oppose it, regardless of what is included in it, and to rubbish it, but I cannot control this.

If it was, the Minister would announce it, but I hope one is close. My party hopes the Minister will get a good deal but not at any cost. There is one issue I ask him to put into the melting pot. I do not have the figures, but perhaps the Minister does and can work on them. In recent years when Irish Government bonds were trading at a figure of about 80% against par at some stages, inevitably the European Central Bank would have purchased some of them to have a floor in the market. Some commentators have said the European Central Bank is sitting on a profit of ‚Ç¨3 billion to ‚Ç¨4 billion on Irish Government bonds that it bought at the time and which are now trading above par, which is a good sign. Will the Minister ask the European Central Bank in the discussions on reducing the principal figure of ‚Ç¨28.1 billion not to make a profit on the backs of the Irish people by speculating in the bond market to make a profit of ‚Ç¨3 billion or ‚Ç¨4 billion? Perhaps the money could be used to reduce the principal at no loss to it.

We can have all the smart aleck comments the Minister wishes for the next year, but I asked him three specific questions. I know he cannot go into detail, but is it the Government's intention that the debt-to-GDP ratio will be reduced as a result of the successful negotiation of a deal? Is it the intention that the taxpayer will be spared from paying some of the capital? Is it the intention that we will pay at lower interest rates on the portion of the capital included as part of a deal? These are three genuine questions the Minister may wish to dismiss, but I have a democratic right to ask questions. I also have a right to expect answers from him.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	245	As I said, since a deal has not been concluded and is not certain to be concluded, I cannot describe the elements of a deal that has not yet been concluded. It is idle to speculate about something that is not yet in place and may not be. I am not stalling. I am saying that while the negotiations have proceeded in a satisfactory manner, they have not been concluded and there are significant outstanding items. If a deal is concluded, I will come into the House to explain it in detail and people can see what is in it and judge it on its merits. Until that happens, however, I am not in a position to do so. This is not an attempt not to answer questions fully or to show disrespect to Deputy Pearse Doherty or any other Deputy. The negotiations have gone well, but there are serious outstanding matters which could still prevent the conclusion of a deal. Also, there are some moving parts. Therefore, it is idle to speculate, but if I negotiate a deal, I will explain it fully in the House.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	246	I remind the Deputy of the long-established Government strategy to use the tax code to attract jobs and investment to Ireland, in particular foreign direct investment. This strategy precedes the current Government. We have used a competitive tax system in this way for more than 50 years, but it underpins the Government‚Äôs key objective to create jobs and economic growth by attracting foreign direct investment and encouraging enterprise. Further, as the Deputy is aware, the programme for Government states that, as part of the Government‚Äôs fiscal strategy, we will maintain the current rates of income tax ,together with bands and credits, and not increase the top marginal tax rates. I should highlight that the current prevailing low investment levels to which the Deputy refers can be attributed to the deterioration in the Irish property market. The contribution to GDP of investment in building and construction fell from close to 20% in 2007 to around 5% in 2011. This reflects the sharp decline in housing activity and the Government‚Äôs ability to provide an impetus for this industry has been limited. Domestic firm level investment has also been constrained, even though investment in machinery and equipment has remained relatively robust in recent years.  In the light of the domestic investment environment, strong FDI performance in recent years has been a welcome boost and the tax system is particularly suited to encouraging this type of activity. The positive impact this has on domestic demand, as well as on employment and exports, remains important. As an example, estimating the size of the behavioral effect of a further increase in corporate tax rates is difficult, but it is likely to be relatively significant. An OECD multi-country study in 2008, OECD Tax Policy Studies No. 17, found that a 1% increase in the corporate tax rate reduced inward investment by 3.7%, on average. On this basis, it would take only a 2.5% increase in the rate to 15% to decrease Ireland‚Äôs inward investment by nearly 10%. 
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Ireland, like other smaller member states, is geographically and historically a peripheral country in Europe. A low corporate tax rate is a tool to address the economic limitations that come with being a peripheral country, as compared to larger core countries. Ireland‚Äôs low corporation tax rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland and thereby increasing employment here. In another report by the OECD in 2010, OECD Tax Policy Studies No. 20, corporate taxes were identified as the taxes which were most harmful to economic growth prospects. Competitiveness is a crucial factor in achieving sustainable growth in a small open economy such as Ireland‚Äôs. The economy‚Äôs competitiveness is the result of a wide range of factors, with the National Competitiveness Council‚Äôs scorecard analysing Ireland‚Äôs international competitiveness using 127 individual indicators. These range from measures such as economic growth and quality of life to the policy inputs that will drive future competitiveness such as the education system and the delivery of infrastructure. Taxation is one element of this policy mix, as taxation rates impact upon the attractiveness of an economy as a place to do business and work. However, speaking generally, the marginal rate of income tax which is described as the tax rate that applies to the last euro of the base is an important consideration in the formulation of tax policy. Marginal tax rates are important because they influence individual decisions to work more. The OECD in its working paper, Tax and Economic Growth, points to the ‚Äúpossibility that high top marginal rates will increase the average tax rates paid by high-skilled and high-income earners so much that they will migrate to countries with lower rates resulting in a brain drain which may lower innovative activity and productivity‚Äù.  It should be noted that the top marginal tax rate for employees, including USC and PRSI, is now 52%. It has increased from 43.5% in 2008. The top marginal tax rate for self-assessed individuals is now 55%. It has increased from 46.5% in 2008. Not only have the top marginal rates increased significantly but marginal rates on lower income levels have also increased. In addition, the top marginal rates take effect at significantly lower income levels. For example, the top marginal tax rate for employees in 2008 was 43.5% and took effect at an income level of ‚Ç¨100,101 and above. In 2012 the top marginal tax rate for employees is 52% and takes effect at an income level of ‚Ç¨32,800 and above. It is also important to point out that higher marginal tax rates for high earners may also incentivise a greater level of tax evasion and contribute to the development of a shadow economy. The fact that foreign direct investment in Ireland was particularly strong in 2012 reflects Ireland‚Äôs competitive position and that the current Government strategy in relation to tax is working.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	247	The purpose of the question was to ask the Minister his views on the assertion, by Fine Gael Ministers particularly, that further tax increases on high earners and corporations would adversely affect investment rates when the evidence in the European Union is that countries which have much higher rates than Ireland have immeasurably higher investment and projected investment rates. Does the Minister agree that data from agencies such as the OECD, EUROSTAT and the IMF disprove comprehensively that right-wing argument that increased taxes on high earners and corporations would be a major barrier to investment and economic activity?Is the Minister aware that, for example, the effective tax rates on the highest income-earners in Austria is 37%; in Sweden, 37.4%; and in Germany, 44%, compared with 31.5% in Ireland? Is he aware that corporation tax rates are 25% in Austria, 26% in Sweden and 30% in Germany, compared with 12.5% - much less than that, effectively - in Ireland? At the same time IMF projections for 2017 for total investment which is critical to the future of the economy, put Austria, Sweden and Germany way ahead of Ireland which lags at 10.7% projected. Is it not clear that the Fine Gael-Labour Party policy is to protect the billionaire tax exiles, the rich, the elite in society, rather than being based on a solid economic policy which has not been proven?

I am quoting from two separate OECD studies, one on corporate taxation rates and the other on personal taxation rates, both of which sustain my argument that higher taxes reduce foreign direct investment and they can lead to the migration of the very highly skilled workers whom we need to grow the economy and create further employment.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	251	Why, then, do we not have a flood of migrants of the wealthy and very high earners from Germany, France and Denmark, into Ireland to avail of the significantly lower tax rates here? The Minister's argument begs that question. The evidence is that investment in all other economic indicators are much better even though still reflecting the crisis in European capitalism overall.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	252	We do not have a flow of migrants into Ireland to avail of lower personal tax rates because we do not have lower personal tax rates than the rest of Europe. We have very high marginal rates of tax in Ireland. The marginal tax rate for employees, if the universal social charge and PRSI are included, is now 52%. It has increased from 43.5% in 2008. The top marginal rate for self-assessed individuals is 55%. The top marginal rate is also being applied to much lower incomes. For example, the top marginal rate of tax for employees in 2008 was 43.5%. It took effect at income levels over ‚Ç¨101,100. In 2012, the top marginal rate of tax is 52% and it takes effect at income levels of ‚Ç¨32,800. Is it any wonder that a flood of high-skilled individuals are not coming in? We are not saying we have low marginal tax rates. We are saying we do not want them to rise any higher because we will drive people out. That is the point.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	253	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that significant progress has been made with regard to their preparations for introducing local property tax. The legislation governing local property tax is contained in the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 which was signed into law by the President on 26 December 2012. The Revenue Commissioners have already had extensive contacts with a wide range of Departments and agencies through the interdepartmental group which was set up to oversee the introduction of local property tax. They advise they are getting good co-operation from all parties. For example, significant progress has already been made with the Departments of Social Protection and of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, to ensure that the deduction at source option from certain payments administered by the Departments will be available to property-owners. In addition, detailed discussions have already taken place with a number of other private sector stakeholders such as service-providers for cash payments, payroll administrators and payroll software specialists, regarding the implementation of a deduction at source option. I am informed that there is a clear, shared understanding of the requirements involved and that they are all actively working to meet agreed timelines. A key element of the design of the tax is that property-owners will have as much flexibility as possible to spread the payment of tax in equal instalments throughout the year. This is the reason the facility to deduct the tax at source is of such importance. Regarding the resources required by Revenue, I previously advised the House in my reply to Question No. 57388/12, that the Revenue Commissioners would be resourced to ensure the successful implementation of the tax. The additional resources required for 2013 are noted in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform expenditure report 2013. The employment control framework includes 100 additional posts approved by my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, in the context of the introduction of LPT. The Revenue Commissioners further advise that they have established the nucleus of the local property tax branch in Ennis, where staff are likely to become available for redeployment in the context of the Government's policy on shared services, specifically in the areas of payroll, banking and financial management. The Revenue Commissioners are deploying additional staff to this branch by reconfiguring their district structure in the south west and by relocating functions from Clare to Limerick. I am satisfied that if the Revenue receives the additional 100 staff which were sanctioned in 2013, it will be in a position to prioritise its resources to ensure the successful implementation of LPT. In addition, Revenue is contracting for external service delivery of some data capture and call centre services. I am also informed by Revenue that substantial progress has been made on the development of the IT systems for administering and collecting LPT and its incorporation into Revenue‚Äôs existing IT infrastructure. A key aspect of the work being undertaken by Revenue is the compilation of a comprehensive register of residential properties in the State which will be used to correspond with all property-owners and will be ready in time for a general issue of LPT returns to property-owners in March next.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 This register is being developed using data drawn from a range of sources including Revenue‚Äôs own databases, the Local Government Management Agency database as well as data from utility companies. The use of multiple databases does, however, bring the risk of duplication and the Commissioners are working to lessen this risk. Local property tax is a self-assessment tax. Revenue is actively preparing valuation guidance and developing tools to assist liable persons in assessing the value of their property which will be made available as soon as possible. Beginning in March 2013, the Revenue Commissioners will be issuing an LPT tax return to all property owners together with an information booklet. Property owners will have the option of completing and submitting their LPT return in paper or by electronic means. I am advised that the development of the paper LPT return form and an on-line system for completing and submitting LPT returns are well advanced. Similarly, I am assured that all the processes and procedures required to handle the completed LPT return forms from property owners by the relevant due dates of 7 May 2013 for paper forms, and 28 May for on-line forms, will be in place. The general issue of returns will also include a Revenue estimate of LPT. This Revenue estimate is not based on a valuation of the individual property, but is an amount of tax which will be collected in the event that the liable person does not submit a return. If the estimate is paid the person is still obliged to submit the return. On the communications front, extensive frequently asked questions have already been made available by Revenue in the context of the budget and the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act. Closer to the general issue, Revenue will engage in a public communications campaign. In particular, Revenue will provide detailed guidance on how the tax will operate and the obligations for owners of residential properties. There is no doubt that introducing a new tax regime for residential property in a such a tight timeframe is a significant challenge for the Revenue Commissioners along with all of their other responsibilities, but I am fully satisfied that they will meet the challenge involved and deliver all of the necessary milestones prior to the commencement of the new regime on 1 July 2013. The scale of the logistical preparations for this tax is significant. One reason for enacting the Finance (Local Property Tax) Act in December last was to provide the basis for the development of the systems which I have outlined above. A small number of amendments, which will not impair the delivery of the project, are under consideration, including, as I indicated on Second Stage of the Finance (Local Property Tax) Bill 2012 last December, that certain residential properties that have suffered damage due to pyrite, to be prescribed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, would be catered for.

I ask if he can say why the Revenue Commissioners intend to use call centres on a contract basis to help with this work. Will people be asked for their telephone numbers in order to receive phone calls? The private sector will need to amend its payroll systems in mid-year to take account of this payment. Will this result in a cost to the private sector employers? It can take up to eight weeks to arrange for deduction at source for social welfare recipients who wish to pay council rent. The timescale will be very tight. The big issue was alluded to by his colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell. She said that if people in Dublin realise they are paying five times more than people in Donegal for the same service they will just stop paying it. Deputy Dowds of the Labour Party said he wants at least 80% of the funds collected in Dublin to be retained in Dublin. He said the majority of houses in Donegal sold last year were sold for less than ‚Ç¨100,000. Both Fine Gael and the Labour Party seem to be picking on Donegal with its low valuations. They resent the fact that people in some counties will have a lower rate because their houses are valued at a lower value. This is an anti-Dublin tax, an anti-urban area tax. The Minister's party colleagues are clearly reflecting that issue. Will the Minister consider some amendments along those lines to the Bill?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	255	The Government decided to have one standard rate of tax for the country as a whole, based on the value of houses. At present, as the Deputy will be aware, some of the funding for local government comes from motor taxation. The incidence of motor taxation falls heavily on the Dublin area and on the main urban centres also. The difference here is that unlike motor tax, which goes into a fund which is allocated around the country, it is the intention that arrangements will be made between the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, to ensure that the tax is spent where it is collected. It will take some time to get to the figure quoted by the Deputy.The intention is that the full amount of the tax will be spent where it is collected. It is a major reform in local government that those who pay most will have funding for the most services. In addition, from 2015, local councillors will have discretion to increase or reduce the rate of the tax by up to 15%. That will give real power to councillors. Future Governments may decide to give more discretion in that regard but, in accordance with the Act, full discretion amounts to plus or minus 15% at present. With regard to the other issues raised, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners realises this matter is quite complex. It wants as much assistance as possible for taxpayers so it will be operating a significant number of helplines. It will be necessary for employers who deduct the tax at source to change their payment systems, but this is no different from what they must do if VAT, personal taxes, PRSI or the universal social charge are changed on any budget night. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners has never paid for this facility. Employers are obliged to collect taxes and pass them on to the Revenue Commissioners. There is no question of agency payments being available for these facilities. The Minister for Social Protection has already made or is making arrangements within her Department so there will be an easy payment facility available through the social welfare system, if desired. The payment date is 1 July, which is a long way down the road.

As the Deputy is aware, the Irish Government has been working extremely hard to secure a deal on the Irish bank debt with our European partners and detailed work will continue to ensure that positive moves in Europe are harnessed to maximise the benefit to the Irish taxpayer. On 14 December 2012, the European Council stated:[O]nce an effective SSM is established, the ESM will be able to recapitalise banks directly. An agreement on the operational framework supporting this possibility, including the definition of legacy assets, should be agreed as soon as possible in the first semester of 2013. Aside from the issue of when this new instrument will become available, there are a number of other issues that have yet to be worked through, such as how these banks would operate under ESM ownership, what governance arrangements would be put in place between the fund and the banks themselves and between the ESM and member state governments. We need to consider these wider considerations in the months ahead. Ireland continues to be fully engaged in this process within the Eurogroup and among Heads of State or Government. Furthermore, officials from my Department participate in technical meetings with the ESM and other member states. In this regard and despite recent media reports, discussions remain ongoing and no conclusion has been reached. This issue is not on the formal agenda for EU meetings but it is discussed in the context of our successful programme and we continue to work with our troika partners towards a solution. In regard to the issue of the IBRC promissory notes, I am glad to say we meet with strong appreciation of our circumstances and we are able to have very constructive dialogue on our approach to this question. This work is one of the Government's key priorities and will remain a key focus during the EU Presidency. I have stated previously that I am working to try to achieve a solution before the next scheduled instalment on the promissory note at the end of March. It would be very difficult for Ireland to make a payment on that date so we continue to work on a deal with our European partners to resolve this issue.

The rating agencies consider our debt to be junk. Most important, we will have to pay ‚Ç¨9.1 billion this year in interest on our enormous and clearly unsustainable debt, at a terrible cost to the citizens of the country. It is the equivalent of the whole education budget being paid in interest on debt. Will Ireland's EU Presidency just be a load of pomp and ceremony signifying nothing? Alternatively, will it be used as a platform and pressure point to obtain fairness and sustainability and relief for ordinary Irish citizens from the absolutely intolerable and unsustainable burden? Can the Minister give us concrete reasons to hope that, by the end of the Presidency, we will obtain the relief we deserve and desperately need if the economy has any chance whatsoever of recovering? Can the Minister give us concrete assurances or outline plans that could lead us to believe this might be the case?

One should never expect rating agencies to come out singing and dancing and giving one a whole lot of good news because their business is to measure risk, which they are assessing constantly. The rating agencies do not say Irish paper is junk as we have a rating of BBB+. During the week, Fitch said that if Ireland got a significant deal on its debt, it would upgrade its rating to A. Therefore, we are moving in the right direction. Irish paper has a value. As a matter of fact, in the first half of today the NTMA sold three-month treasury bills worth ‚Ç¨500 million and the rate achieved was 0.2%. This is the lowest rate at which any Irish Government ever raised funds on the market according to the Central Bank. We are, therefore, moving in the right direction. I acknowledge that some kind of deal on bank debt is probably being factored in. If we do not get a deal on the bank debt, the interest rates will move in the opposite direction. The Commission, in its latest report, pointed out again the risks associated with our programme. Overall, it gave a strong endorsement of the progress we are making but it said there are still risks. I agree. All I have ever claimed is that we have made significant progress, but there are still risks. If we stop doing what we are doing, those risks will be realised and some event outside our control and our jurisdiction could occur that would magnify the problem. We certainly have not reached dry land and are still working on this. It is work in progress but progress is being made; that is all we are claiming. I assure the Deputy that we will continue to work on this and try to get the economy to grow and the growing economy to create more jobs. As the Deputy rightly identified, long-term unemployment is one of the significant corrosive elements in society. It is very hard to fix it once it gets into the system.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	261	As is widely known, the Heads of State or Government stated at the 29 June meeting "that it is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns" and that "the Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment programme."  The European Council on 18-19 October subsequently reaffirmed that the "the Eurogroup will draw up the exact operational criteria that will guide direct bank recapitalisations by the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), in full respect of the 29 June 2012 euro area Summit statement. It is imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns.‚Äù  The key timeline in regard to the realisation of these commitments is the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism. The European Council stated on 14 December 2012 that "once an effective SSM is established, the ESM will be able to recapitalise banks directly. An agreement on the operational framework supporting this possibility, including the definition of legacy assets, should be agreed as soon as possible in the first semester of 2013". Aside from the issue of when this new instrument will become available, there is a host of other issues that have yet to be worked through such as how these banks would operate under ESM ownership, what governance arrangements would be put in place between the fund and the banks themselves and between the ESM and member state governments. We need to consider these wider considerations in the months ahead. Ireland continues to be fully engaged in this process within the Eurogroup and among Heads of State or Government. Furthermore, officials from my Department also participate in technical meetings with the ESM and other member states. In this regard and despite recent media reports, discussions remain ongoing and no conclusion has been reached.  As the Deputy is aware, Ireland is a special case due to the unique circumstances behind our banking and sovereign debt crisis and the fact that our banking crisis emerged at a time when the full range of European mechanisms were not available to us. The Government has been working extremely hard to secure a deal on the Irish bank debt and detailed work will continue to ensure that the positive moves in Europe are harnessed to maximise the benefit to the Irish taxpayer.

Unfortunately, I note from media reports, an editorial in the Financial Times the day before yesterday and an article in The Wall Street Journal yesterday, that it is claimed there is a potential row back from that position in Europe at this point in time. The writer of the editorial claimed to have seen a Commission document which indicated that recapitalisation of banks across Europe in the future would be jointly capitalised by the ESM and member states up to a certain threshold, or the other option is that losses of the ESM would be guaranteed by the member states, which would not be beneficial or would definitely be a worst case position than the statement on 29 June.The Wall Street Journal took it further yesterday and claimed that the leaders have nearly unanimously agreed in the first part of this year that in terms of the recapitalisation of any banks in the future the first tranche of it, up to 4.5% of core tier one capital ratio, would be done by the member states and afterwards it would be jointly done by the ESM to a certain proportion. Has the Minister seen the Commission's document? Is he concerned that there is a potential row back on the commitment given on 29 June, or about the difficulties that would place on him and the Taoiseach to try to secure this deal and the impact that could have on our re-entering the markets? I agree with him that the markets have priced in the deal. The 29 June statement was significant for the markets and we have seen our bond yields decrease as a result of that.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	263	I read the article on the front page of the Financial Times, to which the Deputy referred, I have not seen the article in The Wall Street Journal. We have had no indication that there is such a Commission paper. When I spoke to Commissioner Rehn last week in Dublin Castle and discussed these matters with him informally he did not indicate to me that there was such a paper. My officials who have served on various subgroups in Europe have not come across any reference to it either. I do not know what the Financial Times source is or what has led to the speculation. One must be always vigilant in these matters but I have no information which can confirm that. I have had conversations very recently with Commissioner Rehn and there was no indication that there was a change of policy. As the Deputy is probably aware, the last ECOFIN meeting before Christmas concluded in passing the framework for the single supervisory mechanism and the next step is that it will go to the European Parliament and then it can be adopted as the legal document for the supervision. Once that is in place, that is the prime condition for any movement by the ESM to invest in banks directly. The Deputy may also have noticed that the ESM has raised money on the markets. It is such a strong organisation that anyone who wanted to invest in the ESM had to pay a commission. In other words, the interest rate was a minus interest rate. Not only were investors getting money at zero rates but they had to pay a small premium to ensure that their investment was secure in the ESM. That will show how strong a credit rating it has. There is a whole lot of detail to be worked out on how it would be managed if the ESM were to invest directly in recapitalising banks and I referred to that in my answer. A subcommittee of a committee is working on this at present and going through all that detail. I have not been briefed in the past 48 hours on that. I will be in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday, the Eurogroup will meet on Monday and ECOFIN will meet on Tuesday, so I may get a further update there but there is nothing particular on the agenda that directly refers to this.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	265	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 11 together. As announced by my Department last week, the State was successful in disposing of its entire ‚Ç¨1 billion holding of contingent capital notes, CCNs, in Bank of Ireland. The transaction followed an initial approach by a number of investment banks to the Department late last year which indicated that there was sizeable investor interest in the State‚Äôs CCN instruments and particularly the holding in Bank of Ireland. The sale was managed by officials in the Department‚Äôs shareholder management unit, with many years‚Äô experience working in financial markets and was not only timed to take advantage of the improving sentiment towards Ireland and its banks but the huge rally seen in international debt markets which has continued into 2013. The transaction when announced saw the State presented with the opportunity to dispose of a minimum of ‚Ç¨500 million of its position at a price of par. This stemmed from an underwriting commitment provided by the consortium of banks ‚Äì UBS, Deutsche Bank and Davy ‚Äì having done a preliminary assessment of market appetite for the notes. In the end the book build process generated significant excess demand to enable the State to dispose of its entire holding in the CCNs at a price of 101% of their par value plus accrued interest. This generated a profit for the State of ‚Ç¨10 million. Taking account of the coupon paid to the State last year, the taxpayer has earned a total return of over 15% in the space of 18 months. My officials had full visibility during the book build and pricing phases and were also provided with some valuation advice from NCB Stockbrokers which helped inform their judgment. The transaction was well received in the market and indeed the CCNs traded a few points higher in the after-market during their first few days of trading. This reflects a market recognition of a very successful transaction for Ireland, one in which we have exited this element of support to our banks with a profit. It points to a recognition that Ireland is successfully working to correct the very deep failings that have affected us in the past number of years. In recognising this, however, we must also acknowledge that this after-market price is for a very small volume of stock compared with the ‚Ç¨1 billion size of the transaction. The transaction was settled on Tuesday, 15 January and the State was paid proceeds of just over ‚Ç¨1,056 million, comprising the nominal principal amount of ‚Ç¨1,000 million, interest accrued of over ‚Ç¨46 million covering the period 29 July 2012 to the disposal date, and a profit of ‚Ç¨10 million. Fees payable by the State will be minimal in the context of the transaction and will relate to legal expenses and valuation advice provided by NCB. For commercial reasons I am not at liberty to disclose these however. The fees paid to the banks, which are the most significant, are being covered by Bank of Ireland. The State‚Äôs investment in these instruments dates back to the 2011 PCAR exercise, and the successful exit from a large portion of this position represents another step along the road to normalising the State‚Äôs relationship with the banking sector. It is Government policy to separate the State from its banks, a policy which I believe has shared support in this House. This policy will see the State this year remove the guarantee of bank deposits and liabilities which dates back to September 2008 and it also requires us to exit our bank investments over time and when conditions allow. It is true that as the CCN investments were earning the State a generous 10% return per annum, the Exchequer will have to forgo this income but will also reduce its risk exposure to the banking sector. The State made this investment only out of necessity and it is pleasing that we have been able to exit this portion of our investment early and profitably.

At ‚Ç¨1 billion, this is the largest sale of a State asset this year and should be subject to proper scrutiny. The Minister gave many figures in his reply. It is clear from this and replies to other parliamentary questions that there has been a substantial reduction in returns on the notes to the Exchequer. One figure the Minister suggested is that the Exchequer will be down ‚Ç¨18 million this year and ‚Ç¨64 million next year as a result of this sale of CCNs. Many will ask how could we have lost such amounts and still announced it as a good development. There is the question of who is the buyer of this CCN. If it were to be converted to capital, what percentage of the bank would the owner or owners have? There is also the question of who managed this sale. The Minister stated the shareholder management unit in the Department of Finance managed this. I do not want to cast any aspersions here but the head of that unit is Michael Torpey. While I wish him well, Michael Torpey will be Bank of Ireland's chief executive of its corporate and treasury division. There is a genuine question there without casting any aspersion on anyone-----

It was because of the catastrophic situation in which we found ourselves that the State had to put capital into the banks and take a shareholding in them. It has always been the policy to recover the taxpayers' money in so far as we could. Up to ‚Ç¨1 billion was put into CoCos, contingent capital notes, and we recovered it in full in accordance with that policy. The taxpayer has lost nothing and has, as a matter of fact, gained ‚Ç¨10 million on the transaction. Regarding the issue of the coupon, in any investment one measures risk by the interest rate charged. I mentioned the investment and the ESM, European Stability Mechanism. The reason one had to pay a small commission to get into that mechanism was because there is no risk to one's money. The reason one gets 10% on CoCos is because there is a very significant risk. If the capital holding in the bank were to decline below 8.5%, the CoCos get automatically transferred into equity. As soon as that happens, bad debts can burn it up. One can lose one's full capital as a result. That is why one gets 10%. The interest rate always measures risk. The lower the interest rate, the lower the risk. The higher the rate, the higher the risk. In my judgment, it was a good idea to take the taxpayers' money out in full even though if we continued with the risk, there would be an annual yield. That was my judgment call. Other people can argue it other ways but I believe the taxpayer has had enough of risk over the years. If I can get money out at par through preference shares or CoCos ‚Äì there is quite a lot of them through the system ‚Äì I will sell at par. That is because any arrangement we can get from Europe, I do not believe we will get it at par.

Did Bank of Ireland do most of the running in this sale? Last year the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform made a big play that he had got a commitment from the troika that 50% from the proceeds of the sale of State assets could be used for job creation and investment purposes. Is half of the money from the sale of the CCNs going into this fund or will the full ‚Ç¨1 billion be taken off the national debt? If it is going against the national debt, why is 50% not being used for job creation?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	287	This was borrowed money which was put into recapitalising the banks as part of contingency funding in case the banks needed it. As I explained, there was a high risk so there was a 10% coupon on it. It has been the Government's decision that any moneys got from the sale of assets in the banks will be used to reduce the debt because that money was always borrowed. We cleared the debt with the sale of the asset. On the issue of the official to which Deputy Pearse Doherty referred, he went on holidays to Australia on 14 December and did not return until last week. In accordance with normal practice, he will not take up duty in the banks for another two months. There is a kind of cordon sanitaire for three months so there is no conflict of interest in the way this was operated. It is a general policy to reduce the borrowed moneys put into the banks by the taxpayer.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	288	On 16 March 2011, the European Commission, which has the right of initiative to bring forward legislative proposals, published its proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB. This represented the beginning of a process that involves a detailed examination of the proposal, line by line, by all member states at the Council working group. Since the Commission's proposal has been published, Department of Finance officials, along with officials from the Revenue Commissioners, have been attending the working party on tax questions which is the forum for discussions on the proposal. To date, officials have attended meetings on a regular basis on the proposal and there is still a long way to go before agreement on the Commission's proposal could be expected. The Cypriot Presidency completed a first read-through of the proposal in that member states have had the opportunity to give their initial views and ask questions, but no legislative re-drafting has occurred. In our role as President of the Council of the European Union we will seek to be an honest broker in all tax policy discussions to see what the possibilities are for consensus and compromise among member states. Therefore, the Irish Presidency will continue with the work on the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, dossier following on from the Danish and Cypriot Presidencies. Our approach to the CCCTB proposal will reflect the views of colleagues from other member states. We intend to hold several meetings on the dossier, including a series of bilateral meetings.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	289	Work on the CCCTB proposal is moving rather slowly, but Ireland is committed to engaging constructively on it under the Euro Plus Pact. I note that the European Union Commissioner with responsibility for tax policy, Mr. ≈†emeta, has called on Ireland to help push forward the CCCTB proposal during our Presidency. The Government has issues with the maintenance of the 12.5% corporation tax rate and the financial transaction tax, both of which will play a role in the CCCTB proposal eventually. Owing to issues outside Ireland's control, there is no guarantee that we can sustain our low corporation tax rate, which calls into question the wisdom of relying so heavily on that policy. The Minister will be aware that 11 EU member states are pursuing the development of a financial transaction tax. This group includes four of the five largest member states, namely, France, Germany, Spain and Italy. The 11 countries combined account for 90% of eurozone GDP. Having such a tax makes good sense, given everything that has gone on in the world of financial institutions in recent years. I understand the Government's fear of losing jobs to London, but we should still sign up to the proposal because it would help to bring certainty and stability to business. The amount of money it would bring in would not be vast and would not be greatly different from stamp duty revenue in this regard. However, it would be a little more. We need to bring stability to the manner in which financial institutions operate, as they have caused so many problems. Aside from getting a fair contribution from them, such a tax would discourage risky trading activities and short-term investments. It would encourage more long-term investments, the lack of which is a major problem in the world today.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	290	The country holding the Presidency and its representatives chair meetings. In their capacity as chairmen, they are expected to act as honest brokers and advance the European agenda rather than their particular national agenda. When I chair ECOFIN meetings, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, represents Ireland. That has always been the practice. I will not do anything to inhibit those countries involved in enhanced co-operation which are seeking to advance a financial transaction tax. I will facilitate the process, but we will not participate in it. The idea behind enhanced co-operation under the treaties is that countries which share a common objective can process it, subject to certain conditions and make it policy, but it does not apply to other countries not involved in it. I have indicated that if there is a desire to discuss a financial transaction tax at the ECOFIN meeting on Tuesday, we can do so and the process could advance to the next stage. The discussion on the CCCTB proposal is not about the rate of tax but the base on which corporation tax is applied, on which there is little agreement. While we will do nothing to inhibit discussion on the proposal, the likelihood that there will be an agreement during the Irish Presidency seems remote. If people want to discuss and move it forward, that is fine.

The Deputy referred to the risk of financial services companies migrating from Dublin to London. That is a risk, but what is being examined in terms of a financial transaction tax is stamp duty on certain transactions. We already charge stamp duty of 1% on transactions of shares, a measure which is analogous to what is being discussed. However, once it is introduced, it may migrate to other areas. We will watch it carefully, but it is not 1 million miles from what we apply. There is a similar tax in London of 0.5%. The original proposal from France was stamp duty starting at a figure of 0.1%, a good deal lower than what we apply. Thus far there is nothing dramatic about it, but they may apply it to instruments other than share transactions, in which we would be interested because it might affect the financial services industry here.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	293	I am precluded from discussing the tax affairs of a particular individual or company. However, I am aware of recent media reports which refer to the ways some companies structure their international tax affairs to minimise their tax costs and the fact that some of these reports make reference to Irish companies being part of these structures. I understand some of these reports have suggested some companies in multinational groups pay Irish corporation tax at rates significantly lower than 12.5%. I emphasise that such companies are not paying a low rate of Irish tax. All companies in Ireland pay the standard 12.5% rate on profits generated in Ireland. The reports concerned appear to have incorrectly attributed to Ireland profits that represent the return due to assets in other jurisdictions owned by group companies not resident in Ireland. It is incorrect to relate the 12.5% corporation tax rate to both the profits of the Irish-resident group companies and the profits of foreign-resident group companies which are not profits chargeable to Irish corporation tax. By mixing up the Irish profits and the foreign profits of multinational groups in this way, these reports can produce an average tax rate for the companies concerned that is lower than the 12.5% rate and an incorrect inference that the full Irish profits are not being charged. Multinational groups, with subsidiaries in other countries as well as in Ireland, incur other bona fide expenditures. For example, licence payments which are paid to group companies in foreign jurisdictions for the use of intellectual property rights are properly deductible in computing Irish profits. If these licence payments are untaxed in the foreign jurisdiction, it will reduce the average rate of tax for the total profits of the Irish and foreign-resident subsidiaries when they are taken together. From an Irish perspective, we ensure the profits arising in Ireland are taxed at the 12.5% rate of corporation tax. We do not seek to charge profits properly attributable to other jurisdictions. The ability of entities to lower their worldwide effective rate of tax using international structures reflects the global context in which Ireland and all countries operate. Differences arise in the legal and tax systems between countries. International tax planning takes account of these differences in national systems and rules. The only way to combat such arrangements is for countries to work together to examine these structures and consider how international rules can be amended to ensure fair levels of taxation.

In this regard, Ireland participates fully in the OECD's forum on harmful tax practices and the EU code of conduct group. During the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the European Council my Department intends to work closely with the European Commission and other EU member states to make progress on new EU proposals on tax evasion and aggressive tax planning. The tax system in Ireland has a positive international reputation based on transparency and the fact that it is applied equally and openly to all corporate taxpayers. The fact that Ireland has an extensive tax treaty network confirms our international standing. The January 2011 global forum peer review report on Ireland's legal and regulatory framework for transparency and exchange of information found that Ireland had an effective system for the exchange of information in tax matters and was fully compliant with OECD standards. The job of the Government is to bring investment and jobs to Ireland and we have used the tax code and, in particular, our competitive corporation tax system to do so for more than 50 years. What companies do outside Ireland is beyond the scope of the Irish tax system. We cannot conclusively determine the effective rate of tax paid under international tax structures by reference to taxation in Ireland alone, but, as I have outlined, we continue to work with international bodies to ensure fair play.

We had a report that over a six year period Google had ‚Ç¨47 billion in sales but had paid only ‚Ç¨69.9 million in corporation tax, an effective rate of less than 1%. In replies to questions I had tabled to the Minister for Finance it was revealed that in 2010 total gross profits in this country made by corporations amounted to ‚Ç¨70 billion, on which they paid only ‚Ç¨4 billion in tax, an effective rate of a little above 6%. When ordinary workers and those least well-off are having their incomes looted through the universal social charge, property taxes and other cuts, how can the Minister stand over a situation where remarkably profitable corporations are getting away with paying almost nothing in tax? Is he going to do anything about this?

Does he think it is appropriate or does he want to change it and shut it down? Does the Minister believe there should be a minimum effective tax rate for corporations just as there is for high-income earners?

The company avoids UK tax by channelling non-US sales via Ireland.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	298	This arrangement allows Google to pay taxes at a rate of 3.2% on non-US profits. It also diverts some profits through Bermuda. Is the Minister not concerned that we are being used by these people to help them avoid paying tax in other jurisdictions and does he think this is something our Government should address?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	299	I do not mean this disrespectfully, but Deputy Boyd Barrett should re-read the reply of mine to which he referred earlier. He is confusing income and profit. While the income figure was ‚Ç¨70 million, there is an entitlement to deduct costs from it which is how the profit figure is arrived at. The computation should be on the profit which will give a different rate. According to international studies, including one involving the World Bank, the effective rate of corporate tax in Ireland is approximately 11.9%. The EU Commission has reported that our effective rate is in excess of 12.5% because certain corporations in Ireland have a tax rate of 25% where they are not trading internationally. The problem with the so-called "double Irish" from Ireland's point of view is that it has that name. People think that something we do here gives rise to it. That is not the case. It arises from tax codes elsewhere and the way in which the USA regards certain arrangements. We do not operate any kind of tax haven. Our position is legitimate and the 12.5% rate is applied here. Deputy Mick Wallace referred to Google's tax payments in the UK. While I cannot answer for the tax liability of Google in the UK, the 12.5% rate applies to that company here. I am concerned about the misunderstanding on this issue because it gives Ireland a bad name. If the Deputies would like a detailed briefing from tax officials in my Department, they should let me know. I will put something together to provide a briefing across parties so that Deputies can ask detailed questions in a more satisfactory way than this confrontation across the House.
