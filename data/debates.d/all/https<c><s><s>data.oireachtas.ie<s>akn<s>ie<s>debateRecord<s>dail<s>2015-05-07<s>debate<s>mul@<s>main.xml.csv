The purpose of the question is to get an update from the Minister on the steps he is taking to address the issue of excessive standard variable mortgage interest rates in Ireland, to obtain details of his engagement with the Governor of the Central Bank and the banks, and to update the House on progress on this key issue.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	As I outlined last week in the spring economic statement, the mortgage interest rates being charged by the banks in Ireland have not been reduced in line with the rate reductions by the ECB. I discussed the issue of mortgage interest rates with the Governor of the Central Bank on 2 April. As a result of this meeting, the Governor is currently reviewing the issue of the standard variable rates charged by the lenders. The Governor should be in a position to present this analysis to me in the coming days. I will then meet the six principal mortgage lenders in order to discuss this issue. The lending institutions in Ireland, including those in which the State has a significant shareholding, are independent commercial entities. I, as Minister for Finance, have no statutory role in regard to regulated financial institutions setting interest rates. The mortgage interest rates that financial institutions operating in Ireland charge to customers are determined as a result of a commercial decision by the institutions concerned. Equally, the Central Bank has no statutory role in the setting of interest rates by regulated entities, apart from the interest rate cap imposed on the credit union sector in accordance with the provisions of the Credit Union Act 1997 and the requirement to be notified of penalty or surcharge interest imposed in respect of arrears. However, if the Central Bank proposed to me that it should get control of the regulation of interest rates, I would legislate for that. It should be noted that there have been moves on interest rates. As the Deputy will be aware, on 1 May AIB Group announced a number of reductions to its mortgage interest rates for owner-occupier and buy-to-let mortgages. A series of reductions over a fixed timeframe would be acceptable to me, and in that context I welcome AIB's announcement as a good first step. Competition between the banks will be crucial in ensuring that the price that the customers have to pay moves in the right direction.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I thank the Minister for his reply. Most people understand "variable rate" to mean that the rate will vary in line with market conditions. I am sure the Minister will agree that the banks would not be too slow in hiking up their variable interest rate if conditions deteriorated in terms of their cost of funding, for example. Therefore, the rates need to come down. It is very clear now that Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank and a number of other banks are playing hardball. They are not just going to roll over when they are called in to a meeting in the Department of Finance. Therefore, the Minister for Finance will need to have a plan B. The AIB reduction is very welcome. It is modest but a step in the right direction. We need further rate cuts. A 1% cut in standard variable rates across the board would put about €400 million into the pockets of mortgage holders throughout the country, or 300,000 families. That would be a very significant boost and stimulus to the domestic economy. There is clear discrimination against existing customers. Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and KBC charge 4.5% to existing customers but significantly lower rates to new customers. That is simply unfair. The Minister needs to outline what he will do to bring competition into the market. What will be his message to the Central Bank and the banks when he gets around to meeting them?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	The Central Bank figures show the average standard variable rate for a primary dwelling house is 4.2%. Like Deputy Michael McGrath, I welcome AIB's reduction, announced last week. It is the second reduction that AIB has made, and I hope the other banks will follow suit. As I explained previously, the Central Bank is currently doing analytical work on the main lenders, namely, AIB, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB, Ulster Bank, KBC and ACC. It is analysing the margin above the cost of money that the institutions are imposing for variable-rate mortgages. As soon as I get the data from the Central Bank, I intend to engage with each of the banks separately. I will ask them to justify their margin and explain why what they are doing is different from what the Central Bank analysis suggests. We will proceed from there. Ultimately, competition in the marketplace is the best lever to encourage lower interest rates. AIB has started the process and I hope others will follow. There are now some smaller lenders entering the mortgage market, so competition is increasing. I would encourage that.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	Just as IDA Ireland is knocking on the doors of multinationals abroad, the Department of Finance and agents working on the Minister's behalf should be knocking on the doors of banks abroad to determine whether they would be willing to enter the Irish mortgage market to provide badly needed competition. We also need an active switcher market. AIB, which now has the lowest rates in the market, should be encouraged to make resources available to advertise that and actively encourage customers of other banks to switch their mortgage. That is the kind of dynamic we need in the market. It is only when consumers have the option of switching mortgage from one bank to another to avail of a better interest rate that some of the other banks that are charging higher rates might reduce theirs. This issue will simply not go away. It is gaining momentum. The fact is that the rates in Ireland are way out of line with the average eurozone rate, as the Minister knows. He read into the record the average rate in Ireland of 4.2%. It is 2.09% in the eurozone area, which is exactly half the rate here. Can the Minister clarify when he plans to meet the Governor of the Central Bank? He indicated it would be this week. Is that still the plan? When does he plan to meet the six main lenders?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	The information I have from the Central Bank is that the European average is 2.3%, not 2.09%.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	That figure is a month out of date.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	These are Central Bank figures; they are not my figures. With regard to knocking on the doors of banks internationally, there was reluctance among foreign lenders to get involved in the Irish mortgage market until quite recently for the reasons we all know about, including high levels of arrears and difficulty in collecting. These factors discourage lenders from entering the market, but this is now righting itself as 115,000 mortgages have been reconstructed. There is now an indication that banks and other lenders outside the jurisdiction have an interest in getting into the market. I did not say I would be meeting the Governor this week; I said I would be receiving the analysis that the Governor promised me. I believe I will have it sometime next week. My private secretary is arranging meetings with senior management of the six institutions that I referred to. I hope I will have seen them by mid-May.

It is very clearly an issue that will not go away. Why should it? The Minister's attempt last night to fob off and defend the KPMG investigation into the sale, which KPMG had its fingerprints all over, is not getting public support. It is important we get to the truth of all this. Can the Minister outline why he is so opposed to a commission of investigation? What are the reasons for his belief that a commission of investigation into the sale, about which his own Department has raised concerns, is not warranted?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	It was announced on 23 April 2015 that I would be directing the special liquidators of IBRC to review certain transactions which occurred between 21 January 2009, the date of the nationalisation of IBRC, and 7 February 2013, the date of the appointment of the special liquidators to IBRC. The review will cover transactions that resulted in a capital loss to IBRC of at least €10 million during that period or are specifically identified by the special liquidator as likely to give rise to potential public concern in respect of the ultimate returns to the taxpayer. I am informed that the review will cover over 30 transactions. On 27 April 2015, I formally announced the terms of reference for the review. A copy of the ministerial direction which includes the terms of reference can be found on the Department of Finance website. Retired High Court judge, Mr. Justice larfhlaith O'Neill, will monitor any actual or perceived conflict of interest with the review. The purpose of this review is to determine whether there is evidence of material deficiencies in IBRC's performance in respect of such transactions and related activities and management decisions and whether it can be concluded that the transactions were not commercially sound. I have asked that the special liquidators carry out this review and provide a report of their findings before 31 August 2015. Following this, I will make the report available to relevant committees of the Oireachtas. It is important to note that the commission of this review and report is to serve the public interest in light of recent speculation and is not being undertaken as the result of any evidence that such deficiencies existed or that transactions were not commercially sound. The special liquidators are best placed to undertake such a review thoroughly and expeditiously, given their access to all books and records of IBRC, the resources at their disposal to conduct such a review and the power set out under the IBRC Act which allows me to make this direction in the public interest. As I have stated, in order to manage or mitigate against any actual or perceived conflicts of interest, I have directed, with the agreement of the special liquidators, that they engage retired High Court judge Mr. Justice larfhlaith O'Neill to monitor any actual or perceived conflict of interest with the review. I am confident that this will ensure that the review process is robust. The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has requested a copy of the review upon completion. The review will be made available to the committee in line with the request.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I failed to hear why the Minister is so opposed to a commission of inquiry. He says he has instigated the review because of public concern about the sale, three years and two months after the issue was first raised in the Dáil. There remains public concern but that concern is not just about the sale - it is also about the review he has instigated. It is about the fact the Minister has asked the special liquidators from KPMG to investigate a transaction which KPMG had its fingerprints all over. KPMG, or people associated with it, has been involved in nearly every part of this transaction, whether in the past or the present. It was involved in the liquidation of Siteserv by the special liquidator of IBRC, it gave advice about the sale to directors of Siteserv and the company paid fees to KPMG for that advice. Does the Minister not realise that this will not garner public confidence? Can he explain to the Dáil why he is opposed to a commission of investigation that does not include KPMG reviewing a transaction in which it was involved?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	Every fact about this issue has been put on the table by the Department of Finance and myself, whether by way of parliamentary questions or freedom of information requests made by Deputies. Not a single fact or piece of evidence has been brought forward by any of the people who are making third party allegations. I see this as possibly the first step in an investigation. When KPMG liquidators have carried out the report and given it to me and after the Government has cleared it, I will send it to the relevant Dáil committees. I have already received a request from the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and I have told it I will send the report to it expeditiously. I presume the Committee of Public Accounts will also look for a copy of the report and then it will be up to whoever adjudicates on who deals with work in the House to decide which committee will deal with it.  I will not inhibit the committees in any way in continuing with an investigation. If further action is required at that time, the Government will facilitate it. The Deputy can see this, as with many other such cases in the past, as a first step, a scoping exercise by the people who have all the data at their disposal. His concerns, and those of many other people, have been about perceived or actual conflicts of interest and I have dealt with that by appointing retired High Court judge Mr. Justice larfhlaith O'Neill and he will decide whether there are perceived or actual conflicts of interest.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	The Minister says this is the first stage of an investigation and he mentioned the committees of this House. If one of those committees recommends a commission of investigation, will the Government facilitate that process after scrutiny of the KPMG review? He said the review would involve some 30 transactions. Can he confirm that every transaction that resulted in a loss of €10 million to the State will be investigated by KPMG? Will the review have the powers to look beyond the companies which traded on behalf of individuals to discover who the individuals were who bought shares in Siteserv around the time of the transaction? The scope of this review is far too short. The Minister will know that others who bid for assets of IBRC while it was in liquidation by the special liquidator have raised concerns that not all financial information was available to them. The Racing Post transaction, for example, was one where an individual is on the record in the media as saying he withdrew from the auction because the information was not available. There is concern among the public about this and I ask the Minister and the Government to commit to facilitating a full commission of investigation in the event that a committee of this House recommends one.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	The key issue of concern to a number of Deputies is over conflicts of interest. The modus operandi is that no institution will be involved in scrutinising itself. That is why the judge is involved. It is not a question of KPMG investigating 30 transactions. If KPMG has a perceived or actual conflict of interest, some other forensic accountants will be brought in to carry out that piece of the review and it is the role of the High Court judge to monitor the transactions. My commitment is to send the report to the relevant committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas. I presume the committees will discuss it and we will see what is necessary after that but I will not pre-commit because the review has just commenced and we will wait for the results before we take further steps. The information will be shared with the relevant committees and if the Deputy is on one of those committees, he will be able to have his say on what happens next.

The Minister said that any potential public concerns about conflicts of interest will be addressed by a High Court judge and that every fact has been put on the table. Some 19 questions were asked of the Minister before this blew up and the information has been pulled and dragged from him, rather than put on the table. Can he not see how one company investigating itself is not an independent inquiry?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I thank the Deputy for her question. In light of the recent concerns raised in the Houses of the Oireachtas and elsewhere regarding the Siteserv transaction and the public discourse this has caused surrounding the handling of other transactions undertaken by IBRC, I have directed the special liquidators of IBRC to review certain transactions which occurred between 21 January 2009, the date of the nationalisation of IBRC, and 7 February 2013, the date of the appointment of the special liquidators to IBRC. The review will cover transactions that resulted in a capital loss to IBRC of at least €10 million during that period, or that are specifically identified by the special liquidator as likely to give rise to potential public concern, in respect of the ultimate returns to the taxpayer. The retired High Court judge Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill will monitor any actual or perceived conflict of interest with the review. I am informed that the review will cover over 30 transactions. The review and report will evaluate whether there is any evidence of material deficiencies in the performance of their functions by those acting on behalf of IBRC, including the board, directors, management, employees and agents of IBRC and whether it can be concluded that any of the transactions were not commercially sound. I have asked that the special liquidators carry out this review and provide a report of their findings before 31 August 2015. Following this, I will make this report available to relevant committees of the Oireachtas. The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform has requested a copy of the review upon completion. The review will be made available to the committee in line with the request. I want to stress that the commission of this review and report is to serve the public interest in light of recent speculation and is not being undertaken as the result of any evidence that such deficiencies existed or that transactions were not commercially sound.

Many of its directors also had links with Siteserv. This is an old boys network that is in place. Two weeks ago, the Tánaiste told myself and other Deputies that there would be an independent inquiry into this by a competent authority and now we have KPMG investigating itself. Can the Minister say why Walter Hobbs, who was the overseer of the sale, is also a director of KPMG? Mr. Hobbs defended the sale on a "Prime Time" programme and he also has shares in three companies.

I have issued a legal instruction to the special liquidators to carry out a review. I have dealt with the concern about conflicts of interest by appointing a retired High Court judge to monitor and advise on any perceived or actual conflicts of interest. That process has now commenced. I am certainly not getting into a position of carrying out a parallel inquiry here in the Dáil in reply to allegations, but I will put this to the House. There is not a single allegation being made that is not based on information that I put before the Dáil. We have given full information both in reply to parliamentary questions and freedom of information requests. The information given by the Department of Finance and by me is the basis of everything that has been said, so to accuse me of not giving full information is a pretty ridiculous charge in that context.

How does the Minister expect people to believe in this when somebody who had a beneficial interest in this sale is now investigating it and that a judge will step in on occasion? That is not an independent inquiry. I know the Minister was concerned because he had a number of meetings about this whole issue and his officials were clearly concerned, but it seems that he can tell the Dáil another story. He should have come out at that stage when he was asked questions-----

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	First of all, there was no difference of opinion between the Department of Finance and myself. My role and that of the Department of Finance was to hold IBRC accountable. It was difficult to do so because of the arrangements made by the previous Government in the legislation that nationalised IBRC, the former Anglo Irish Bank, and also because of the relationship framework that was put in place. I understand why those arrangements were made because I remember the debate at the time and there were all sorts of allegations that there would be political interference. The attempt to protect against political interference went so far that it put me and my Department in a difficult position to exercise accountability. There were a lot of issues that concerned me but I was not asked about them in the questions. Any fair examination of the parliamentary replies will find that they were properly answered. The Deputy put down the first question and her leader put down the second question. At that stage, it was before I became aware of the Siteserv situation, so the Deputy got less than full information and so did Deputy Gerry Adams, but that was because I gave the Deputy the information that I had. After that, everything was answered in a lengthy fashion. Everybody knows that what one looks for under freedom of information is not what one looks for in a parliamentary question.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I understand an announcement will be made next week as regards the mortgage crisis and that new measures will be announced. I look forward to that. The purpose of this question is to have a debate on the nature of the changes that we need in dealing with the mortgage crisis. For me, the single key issue is to ensure that the final word in the restructuring of a mortgage is by somebody who is objectively independent. That must be the fundamental change that is required in terms of dealing with mortgages in distress. I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	I thank the Deputy for his question. As the Deputy is aware, the Government has put in place a broad strategy to address the problem of mortgage arrears and family home repossessions. The primary focus of this strategy is to support those home owners in difficulty with their mortgage repayments and, in so far as possible, to avoid repossession of the family home. The Central Bank of Ireland's code of conduct on mortgage arrears sets out requirements for mortgage lenders dealing with borrowers facing or in mortgage arrears on their primary residence and provides a strong consumer protection framework to ensure that borrowers struggling to keep up mortgage repayments are treated in a fair and transparent manner by their lender and that long-term resolution is sought by lenders with each of their borrowers. Where a borrower engages with his or her lender, a sustainable restructure arrangement to address his or her mortgage arrears situation is put in place in the majority of cases. The Central Bank's most recent quarterly release on residential mortgage arrears and repossessions, that is, for quarter 4 of 2014, indicates that almost 115,000 restructure arrangements have been put in place. A key focus of any forthcoming initiative from the Government will be to ensure that distressed borrowers are fully informed about appropriate supports, how to access them and how these can help. Many borrowers can find solutions through the options offered by the Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, and the Government will ensure that the personal insolvency process is as fair and effective as it can be and that the objectives as set out in the Personal Insolvency Act are realised as much as possible. My colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, and her officials are actively preparing amendments to the legislative framework for personal insolvency. This is aimed at enabling the Government's objectives to be met. The aim is to ensure that more people in distressed debt access the available mechanisms than has been the case to date. Where a mortgage in arrears is deemed to be unsustainable by the lender, the mortgage-to-rent scheme administered by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, may be a viable alternative and enable families to remain in the family home. His Department is examining the possibilities for more throughput via this mechanism. The effective management of the mortgage arrears issue is an issue that remains under continual review. More concerted action can be undertaken by the banks to assist customers in arrears. As the Deputy is aware, the Taoiseach announced that the Government was considering a range of options to support the existing framework and to improve the uptake of personal insolvency solutions. Given the importance of the issue, his Department is co-ordinating the response across various Departments and Government agencies and I anticipate that a detailed announcement will be forthcoming shortly.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	I thank the Minister. We need a greater throughput on the issue of mortgage to rent. Fewer than 100 cases have been completed. The process needs to be revamped, streamlined and made more efficient. We need a clear definition of what a sustainable solution is from the point of view of the borrower and we need consistency in its application. Personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, need to be more available via a publicly funded panel of PIPs to persons who are dealing with debt. We need those solutions that are working to be deployed. The most popular is one of the least effective, namely, arrears capitalisation. We need consistency in the way split mortgages are treated. I will revert to my initial point. Above all else, we need the final say in the restructuring of a person's mortgage to be taken out of the hands of the bank and put in the hands of someone or something that is independent, be it the Insolvency Service of Ireland or a court of law. Perhaps the Minister will address this issue and confirm the accuracy of media reports to the effect that the Government is planning changes along these lines so as to dilute the banks' veto at a minimum or, ideally, to remove it.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	When we entered into office, we quickly put a range of options in place so that banks and lenders could interrelate with people who were in arrears and devise solutions that would enable the latter to remain in their homes while continuing to pay all or part of their mortgages. There was a menu of solutions, but we realised that there was no one-size-fits-all solution. Some options would suit one borrower while other options would suit another borrower. By and large, this approach has been successful, with 115,000 mortgages reconstructed. There are more mortgages reconstructed than there are in arrears. Going down the scale of difficulty, however, there is a residue of mortgages that the menu of options is not addressing or seen to be addressing. We are returning to the issue to propose new options, one of which is to amend the insolvency Act so that something along the lines of what the Deputy has suggested can be put in place. I expect the Minister for Justice and Equality to bring her proposals to the Government shortly.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	That is a change that we would warmly welcome. Taking the final decision out of the hands of the banks is something for which we have called for a considerable period. Be it a court of law or the insolvency service that would have the final decision-making power on objective grounds, based on an analysis of a person's repayment capacity and the available suite of options, with a view to keeping the family in its home if possible, that must be the core objective underpinning the Government's strategy for dealing with mortgage arrears. I call on the Minister to do this because the figures are frightening. More than 100,000 restructurings have been put in place, but we still have 110,000 accounts in arrears. As the Minister knows, under the targets programme, the figures show that the banks have proposed 30,000 so-called solutions that involve the loss of the family home, with 16,000 of those under the heading "Concluded". While that many houses have not been repossessed, if there is not a fundamental shift in thinking and in how mortgage arrears are dealt with, there will be a major ramping up of enforcement activity and the loss of family homes. It is in the country's interests to avoid that situation if possible.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	I accept the Deputy's sincerity on this issue. No one has a monopoly on the knowledge about how to resolve this issue. It has proven difficult internationally. When people lose their jobs and fall into arrears, they do not have the wherewithal to service their mortgages, so one must devise solutions to keep them in their homes. It is the Government's policy that people remain in their homes. Most of the suite of options to which the Deputy referred are designed with that end result in mind. We are adding to the suite. The Minister for Justice and Equality will bring her proposals to the Cabinet shortly, but other proposals are also being considered, particularly through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	I wish to ask about the policy of banks repossessing homes that, though buy-to-lets, have tenants, sometimes of many years. These tenants are now becoming homeless. I have several cases involving families that are in hotels, sleeping in cars or sofa surfing, as it is called. I put it to the Minister that encouraging banks to repossess homes while prices are rising is a sanctioned Government policy and that he has the power to initiate a policy to stop it.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	I thank Deputy Coppinger for her question. Issues relating to the rental market and tenancy rights are for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly. I am informed by his Department that, in circumstances where a receiver is appointed to a landlord's interest in a dwelling, it is essential that the rights of tenants be protected. While the circumstances of each case may vary depending on the terms of the mortgage or charge under which the receiver is appointed, the policies and procedures of banks in appointing receivers cannot affect the statutory or contractual rights of tenants. The tenant continues to enjoy the same security of tenure. The appointment of a receiver does not mean that a tenant loses his or her rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  That Act sets out the procedures and notice periods that must be complied with when terminating a tenancy. In documentation submitted prior to recent meetings with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, AIB, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank confirmed that they adhered to the legislative framework when dealing with the repossession of buy-to-let properties. Furthermore, I understand that the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, is aware of the impact on tenants of receivership and repossession proceedings. The board is looking to engage with the Central Bank and the financial institutions with a view to developing a code of practice to apply in such situations. The main purpose of the code will be to ensure that the financial institutions are fully aware of the rights, duties and obligations under the Residential Tenancies Act and to ensure that there is a consistency and fairness in the treatment of tenants in these cases.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	Under our laws, there is nothing that a tenant can do if a bank or landlord - the owner of a property - decides to sell it. After due process has been followed, the tenant must vacate the property. Buy-to-lets are the homes of the people renting them, but those people are the group most likely to suffer from poverty and most in danger of becoming homeless because they cannot find alternative rented accommodation. Some are in receipt of rent allowance, while some are low-paid families. The current homelessness crisis is the worst in the history of the State. The Government has a role in the two issues that have led to this situation. The mortgage arrears resolution targets, MARTs, that have been set by the banks put an onus on them to repossess properties. No code of conduct protects non-home owners. The code only protects those who have residential mortgages. Something could be introduced in this regard. The Minister has stated that he favours the continual rise in house prices because he believes it will lead to a recovery.This is also why the banks are selling but nobody benefits other than the very wealthy.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	As I noted in my original reply, when a buy to let is sold, the rights of the tenants continue. They do not lose any of their rights because of a change of ownership. In circumstances where a receiver is appointed to manage a landlord's interest in a dwelling, it is essential that the rights of tenants are protected. While the circumstances of each case may vary depending on the terms of the mortgage or charge under which a receiver is appointed, the policies and procedures of banks in appointing receivers cannot affect the statutory or contractual rights of tenants.  The tenant continues to enjoy the same security of tenure.  The appointment of a receiver does not mean that a tenant loses his or her rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004.  Security of tenure under the 2004 Act is based on a rolling four year tenancy cycle. Where a tenant has been in occupation of a dwelling for a continuous period of six months and no notice of termination has been served in respect of that tenancy prior to the expiry of the six months, the tenancy is established for the remainder of the four year period and it becomes a Part 4 tenancy.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	If the bank and the receiver decide to sell the property, the tenant can do nothing about it. I am all in favour of the bank continuing to rent to the tenant in situ but the banks are not doing that because the Minister, the Government and the banks have set targets for repossessing properties. With house prices rising, it is worthwhile for the banks to sell properties and reduce the debt on their balance sheets. This problem is known to the Government and in August 2013, it committed to reviewing the laws on rent, receivers and tenants, and Threshold has asked it to do that. Nothing further has been done, however, and we are encountering the resulting human misery and suffering in our clinics. The Minister's own clinics must be dealing with similar issues. I have a large caseload of people who were made homeless because of repossessions by the banks. The Minister will be familiar with the case of Martin and Violet Coyne last year but they are only one of many families in this situation.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	The Deputy did not ask me in her original question to introduce legislation to prevent lending agencies from selling buy-to-let properties. She asked me to introduce legislation to oblige banks to honour existing leases. That is a tenant rights issue. Under the 2004 Act, lending agencies are obliged to fulfil the tenant rights obligations on a change of ownership. If a problem arises in practice whereby certain lending agencies are either unaware of, or are ignoring, the law, I noted in my reply that discussions are ongoing at Central Bank level to introduce a protocol to ensure all lending agencies are very clear on the rights of tenants under the 2004 Act and that even with a change of ownership, they are obliged to continue to comply with the rights of tenants under that Act.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	The NAMA chief executive stated in his opening address to the Committee of Public Accounts on 18 December 2014 that NAMA is aiming to redeem a cumulative 80%, or €24 billion, of its senior debt by the end of 2016 and hopes to have redeemed all of it by the end of 2018.  He stated that these targets were predicated on conditions in the Irish market remaining favourable and on NAMA being in a position to retain sufficient specialist staff to enable it to generate the optimal financial return from the realisation of its residual loan portfolio. I am advised by NAMA that any redemption of senior bonds is pro rata by reference to the amounts held by each institution.  The current breakdown of outstanding NAMA senior bonds by holding institution is set out in the following table. Of the total of €12,590,000 of senior notes outstanding, AIB holds €8.78 million, or 69.7%, of the total; Bank of Ireland holds €2.213 million, 17.6%, of the total; Permanent TSB holds €1.202 million, or 9.5%, of the total; and the Central Bank of Ireland holds €395,000, or 3.1%, of the total.

Beginning in March 2010, NAMA purchased loans from five banks for par value or the total borrower debt owed on them in October 2009, which amounted to €74.4 billion. It paid for the loans with NAMA bonds carrying a face value of €31.8 billion. As the bonds were guaranteed by the then Minister for Finance, they are effectively Government debts. However, to avoid NAMA debt appearing on the Government balance sheet, NAMA was set up as a special purpose vehicle which allowed it to remain off the balance sheet under EUROSTAT rules. Like the establishment of Irish Water, it is an accounting trick because the State is effectively on the hook for the debt. NAMA should really be counted as part of the national debt. A breakdown of the par value of the loans for each bank reveals a significant discrepancy with what NAMA paid for them. NAMA was originally intended to turn a profit of €1 billion but one could argue that it has cost the taxpayer €40 billion.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	Generally speaking what the Deputy outlined is correct but while the nominal value was €74 billion, the purchase price of €31 billion was paid with bonds. As NAMA sells its loan books, it can repay the bonds. It has committed to repaying 80% by 2016. It is in a position to pay back all of its senior bonds and junior debt and still be in surplus. NAMA is not going to cost the State anything. Indeed, the latest predictions indicate that NAMA will have a surplus, which means in simple terms that it will turn a profit, at the conclusion of its transactions. The burden will not fall on the shoulders of the taxpayers because the sale of the loan books is paying off the aforementioned €31 billion. It is making good progress in this regard. NAMA is fully accountable. I do not think the House generally knows that the Comptroller and Auditor General has responsibility for auditing NAMA and that five or six staff from that office are permanently assigned to examining all transactions in NAMA.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	The hope is that NAMA will make money but when NAMA refers to making a profit, it means that it hopes to recoup more than €31.8 billion from the NAMA bonds it gave the banks for the loans, as well as interest on the bonds and its running costs. However, this ignores the loss of €39.6 billion that the State incurred through the State owned banks because of the 57% haircut crystalised on loans as a result of the establishment of NAMA. When NAMA states that it is making a profit, it is disregarding the loss to the State of nearly €40 billion entailed in setting it up. It is hoped that money will be recouped through the sale of AIB but that is based on an underestimate on the true cost of bailing out AIB and Bank of Ireland. If AIB is privatised and sold off, it is likely that the State will not get much back because that is how these things usually go.The figure the Government cites for AIB is usually €20.7 billion but the true figure is closer to €30 billion. Similarly, with Bank of Ireland, the Government usually cites €4.7 billion, but the true cost is over €7.6 billion. What is the Minister's view on that?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	On the write-downs between the nominal value of the loans of around €74 billion and the €31 billion to which the Deputy referred, those losses were taken by the creditors who had borrowed from the banks. The losses are not to the taxpayer but to the individual creditors who effectively went broke. There are several examples of this, the most prominent of which are in the building and development industry. There are many others in ordinary businesses across the country which went broke during the crisis and there was a write-down of their loans.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	The Government is doing its level best to trumpet and spin a supposed give-back to workers in the coming budget. My question seeks to put any so-called give-back in the context of how much workers and ordinary citizens have actually lost since 2008 on the various austerity taxes and charges, be it the local property tax, LPT, the universal social charge, USC, the pension levy or the household tax. What are the annual and total figures for all of these austerity charges and taxes?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information on receipts by tax head is available on the Revenue Commissioners' statistics website at http://www.revenue.ie/en/about/statistics/index.html, under "Revenue Net Receipts by Taxhead on an annual basis" to 2014. As shown on the website, local property tax net receipts were €316 million in 2013 and €493 million in 2014. The Revenue Commissioners have also confirmed that since they took over responsibility for collection of the household charge collection from July 2013, around €2 million was paid in 2013 and €37 million in 2014. These payments are included in the local property tax net receipts figures noted above. Receipts figures for USC were €3,114 million in 2011, €3,790 million in 2012, €3,930 million in 2013 and €3,647 million in 2014. It should be noted that the 2014 PAYE and USC outturns were affected by adjustments made this year to reapportionment receipts between these two headings to correct an initial estimated allocation used for the period January to June 2013. The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that the 2013 P35s, received in early 2014, show lower USC payments and higher PAYE payments than were allocated in 2013. To off-set an automatic reallocation based on these P35 declarations, receipts are being taken out of USC collection throughout 2014. This means that PAYE in 2014 will benefit from a transfer of €407 million and USC will lose an equivalent amount.  The net Exchequer effect of the reapportionment is and will remain neutral. The receipts from the stamp duty levy on pension fund assets introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011 amounted to €463 million in 2011, €483 million in 2012, €535 million in 2013, and €743 million in 2014. Receipts for 2015 will be published in due course.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	Since 2011, up to €13 billion has been raised through the USC, €2 billion through the pension levy and close to €1 billion through the property tax. This has been an enormous gouging of moneys from the pockets of workers over recent years. We were told the property tax would improve local services. The USC was to be a social charge, while we discovered that the pension levy was not a pension levy at all. Essentially, for all that was gouged out of people’s pockets, we got fewer services as well as cuts to remaining ones. What will the Minister do to make up for this fantastic gouging from the pockets of ordinary people over recent years?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	The Deputy must be the only the person in the country who is expressing surprise at these figures this morning. Everyone knows we have lost almost a decade because of the policies pursued by the previous Government. We know the country was on the verge of bankruptcy. The banks actually became bankrupt and they had to be bailed out. We could not continue the way we were. If it were not for our colleagues in Europe, the whole country would actually have gone bankrupt. It was because of the money provided by Europe and the International Monetary Fund that the adjustment period could be spread over time to make it sustainable. It is somewhat amazing for the Deputy to express surprise this morning that these impositions were made historically, when they have been the bread and butter of political discourse for the past eight years. He never ceases to amaze me with what he comes up with. What will I do to reverse them? As I announced and implemented in the last budget, we will not increase any taxes or cut expenditure further. We are slowly unwinding the more penal of the provisions. The pension levy, to which the Deputy pointed in his question, was finished last year, and it was announced that the small residual amount to be collected in 2015 would not be renewed in 2016. We started unwinding income tax and USC receipts last year and are committed to continuing that in the next budget.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	The Minister is right that I and others have been raising these issues for the past several years. It is useful, however, to see what the totals are and how much has been taken from the pockets of people who had no responsibility for the economic crisis. What have they got back for it? Nothing. That puts into context what the Minister claims he will give back to them. Another point I repeatedly make to the Minister, but one to which he never responds, is this. How is it that workers have lost €14 billion as a result of the austerity charges and taxes while, coincidentally, the super-rich in society have gained about the same amount of money? This is according to The Sunday Times rich list, as well as the wealth distribution figures produced by TASC, Credit Suisse and Social Justice Ireland. How is it that what has been taken from the pockets of the working people has managed to end up in the pockets of the super-rich?

However, to try and present a case that a cohort of people - workers - were the only ones who lost out during the past eight years is a fallacy. Everybody got hammered. The Deputy need only look at the live register.

He is also selling unsound political currency to the people. He is pretending that out there somewhere there is a mythical enormous group of millionaires hiding under the bushes, and if we only taxed them adequately, everybody else would have to pay no tax. That is the way the Deputy presents it, which is grand. It is the money-tree-in-the-garden school of economics. It is not reality, however.

Has the Minister done an analysis of the impact this will have on our health and education sectors, on housing policy and on other significant public spending needs?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	The spring economic statement, SES, outlines Ireland's medium-term economic and fiscal plan. It demonstrates that our public finances are under control, the economy is growing and continued improvement is forecast in the coming years. In this regard, the SES outlined that fiscal space of the order of €1.2 to €1.5 billion will be available for budget 2016, while still complying with our obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact. Indeed, one of the key purposes of the SES is to provide a basis for debate with relevant stakeholders in the national economic dialogue on how this fiscal space should be best used. The exact quantum available will depend on the composition of measures, changes in the estimated 2015 fiscal outturn, macroeconomic variables, etc. In general, cost-benefit analyses are more appropriate to individual measures than to overall fiscal strategy. The 50-50 split reflects the strategy of Government to marry the objectives of encouraging economic growth while increasing the resources available to deliver quality public services. With regard to the taxation element, according to the OECD hierarchy of taxes, labour taxes are considered one of the most harmful to economic growth. Therefore, the Government has committed to reducing the tax burden for low and middle income earners as a means of encouraging labour market participation and subsequently economic growth. Given the expenditure reductions over recent years, certain sectors require expenditure increases to accommodate demographic and other demand pressures. For example, given the increase in the number of children of school-going age, the need for additional teachers has become evident. It should be noted that expenditure on education will facilitate a more productive workforce over the longer term which will improve Ireland's potential growth rate. Similarly, Ireland's investment in capital is operating at a level only just below depreciation. Further investment in capital stock will add to Ireland's growth potential. Budget 2016 will incorporate elements of the capital review to be published this summer and will prioritise projects and deliver value for money. Ultimately, the Government will use the available fiscal space to strike a balance between encouraging economic growth and ensuring that our public services are improving and fit for purpose. The exact measures to be contained in budget 2016 will reflect these objectives.

How will the Government get more teachers, nurses and so on by cutting public spending? I am in favour of a restoration of public spending, but I am also in favour of taxing the wealthy. In the previous answer, the Minister made reference to the fact that there is no wealth there to tax. The Denis O'Briens, the top 1%, have seen their wealth increase dramatically in the last few years. Regarding the impact this will have, the Government is proposing to cut taxes by €650 million to €750 million in the hope of winning the general election. However, it is likely that this would be through tax relief rather than through getting rid of the universal social charge-----

Can the Minister clarify that? Is it not more likely that it will benefit the wealthy in society, just as the last budget did, rather than low-paid workers, many of whom are outside the tax net? We have record numbers of low paid workers in Ireland.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	The Deputy raises a number of questions. First, she talked about how we were continuing to cut public expenditure. We are not. In the last budget, the Government increased public expenditure. The spring statement states that we will continue to increase public expenditure between now and 2020. We have spelled it out in precise terms for 2016. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will spend another €750 million on top of what he spent in 2015 on enhancing public services. From 2016 to 2020, the figures provided in the spring statement have built in the extra expenditure, which runs from demographic changes. In other words, the extra teachers, nursing home beds and so on that will be needed because of demographic changes are built into the figures. On top of that, we think we will have space slightly in advance of the precise space identified for the 2016 budget in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020. There is no suggestion that we will do anything other than target the incomes of low-paid and middle income people to give them extra relief. There are three personal taxes: USC, income tax and PRSI. Different reliefs affect different cohorts of people. As the Taoiseach announced in this House, we intend to reduce the burden of the universal social charge on taxpayers.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	96	With inflation, the increase in spending on public services that the Minister mentioned will actually amount to a decrease of 1% in real terms, according to the estimate of economists. Ireland would have to increase public investment by €2 billion to come up to the EU average. With regard to wealth, 10% of the top earners own 30% of the wealth in this country, while 1% owns 20%. There is, therefore, a massive discrepancy in wealth in this country. From 2006 to 2013, which includes some time under the Minister's watch, taxes on capital have plummeted. There is a conscious policy not to tax those who have wealth and those who control wealth. For example, a 10% increase on the top 10% of earners could bring in €2.6 billion. A 1% increase in corporation tax-----

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	101	The statistical tables accompanying the spring statement are quite complex and I need guidance through them myself. However, it is not true to say that they indicate a reduction in expenditure. From 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020-----
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	102	In real terms.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	103	The tables for 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 are carried forward on the basis of no policy change. That is where one gets the reduction. If there are no policy changes, there will be reductions, but there will be policy changes. The Government has committed to making policy changes and to using the fiscal space that has been identified for each year for extra expenditure to enhance the public services that have been damaged during the recession and to provide extra capital expenditure. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, will announce a public capital programme before the summer. That will also show this. The other issues the Deputy raised are political debating points with which I disagree, but she is quite free to hold those opinions.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	104	What impact has the living city initiative the Minister announced over three years ago had to date and when will it be fully brought into force, so that we see some results from this?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	The living city initiative was commenced and launched on 5 May 2015. It is an urban regeneration incentive which focuses on the regeneration of the historic centres of six cities. This initiative is a scheme of property tax reliefs which applies in certain "special regeneration areas" in the centres of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway, Waterford and Kilkenny, particularly those areas which are most in need of regeneration. This is not a widespread initiative, as it is targeted at those areas which are most in need of attention. The aim of the living city incentive is to bring life back into the heart of the relevant cities by offering tax relief for qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment or conversion of certain buildings where conditions are met. Planning for the scheme has included a thorough ex ante cost-benefit analysis, and recommendations from relevant agencies. The residential element of the living city initiative provides for an income tax deduction for qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment or conversion of a building for use as a dwelling, over a ten-year period.The building must have been constructed before 1915 and must be located in a special regeneration area of the city in question. The commercial element of the living city initiative provides for capital allowances over a seven-year period in respect of qualifying expenditure incurred on the refurbishment or conversion of a property located in a special regeneration area for use for the purpose of retailing goods or the provision of services within the State. The amount of tax relief available under the commercial element of the incentive is effectively capped at €200,000 for any individual project. Information on the scheme is available on the websites of the relevant councils, and also on the Department of Finance's website at http://www.finance.gov.ie/living-city-initiative. A document containing frequently asked questions was published by the Revenue Commissioners. Maps of the special regeneration areas are available on that website and also on the websites of the relevant local authorities.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	106	I thank the Minister. First, am I correct in saying the original plan was for the initiative to commence in Limerick and Waterford? What has been the take-up in those areas? In a way, they were a sample of what the scheme would generate in time to come. Second, we have often had schemes like this in the past and sometimes they did not really take off. My main concern in those four cities is to ensure there is a dedicated person who understands the system in the relevant local authority. It is all well and good to refer to the website, but what will happen is that when one rings the finance department in a council, on the basis that it is a finance matter, the finance department will say it is a planning matter, the planning people will say it is a zoning matter and so on. The caller will have to go through many rigours, and will then be told he or she requires advance approval from the Revenue Commissioners. Is there a single one-stop shop? The website is fine, but I have previously found that although such schemes are devised by the Department, nobody takes personal ownership of them at director of services level - as these issues can cross different directorships - and sometimes they fail on that basis. Why did it take until Tuesday to publish the information?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	Schemes along these lines must be cleared in Brussels at Commission level. When the initial proposal was put to the authorities in Brussels, certain difficulties emerged, so there was a rethink and the scheme was extended to the six main cities. The local authorities were charged with designating the areas they considered suitable. An independent outside consultant was retained to give independent adjudication on whether the areas being included were appropriate. All that has been resolved now, and the six local authorities have designated their areas. The Revenue Commissioners have the arrangements in place for the tax relief. It is now up to the private sector to see whether there will be an uptake. It is very difficult to know, when one conceives of such schemes, whether there will be an uptake. Much depends on the amount of credit in the community and the level of the incentives. In this case the incentives are of two kinds. If, for example, somebody purchases a pre-1915 house in Waterford and pays €100,000 for it, if the person then puts another €100,000 into the refurbishment, he or she can write off €10,000 a year for ten years against income tax. Previously, the write-offs were not against income tax, and the persons concerned had to be owner-occupiers. That will suit some people. For the commercial sector, there are capital allowances for seven years, with a cap of €200,000. It is possible to combine the two. One could refurbish a shop with an apartment overhead that is owner-occupied and avail of the double relief. I hope it works. The scheme is generous. It is in the hands of the local authorities now to drive it, but I understand they are very interested.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	108	The Minister will have detected that there is no objection in principle from my side of the House on this issue. If anything helps to refurbish town centres and city centres, it must be good, because we see the way all development is spreading to the suburbs. It must be good to bring back life into city and town centre areas. Will the Minister make available the cost-benefit analysis that was done? The Comptroller and Auditor General always looks at such schemes, and the cost versus the benefit will be examined. The Minister indicated that an independent person helped with the designations. Did the designations have to be approved by the elected members, or was it strictly an executive function? Did the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government or anyone else approve the areas for designation? Normally, such matters relating to town centres are planning issues, which are pertinent to the Department. I presume all the maps are on the website. When did the Minister sign the designations? I understand there were delays with the approval of the scheme in Brussels. What are the key differences between what we have now and what the Minister originally hoped to introduce when he first announced the scheme?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	The major difference is that it extends between the two cities originally involved in the pilot studies. In general terms, there was consultation between the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities. The tendency of the local authorities is to designate the biggest area possible, but of course that does not always make commercial sense, because if one spreads the benefits too wide one may not get an uptake. There will be an uptake if the area is concentrated. The areas have been agreed by all sides and I signed the orders this week.

If Deputy Paul Murphy forgoes his introduction, there will be time for the reply and possibly a short supplementary question.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	114	Yes.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	115	The Deputy may be aware that section 396C of the NAMA Act 2009 was a provision which limited the amount of trading losses incurred by a NAMA-participating bank that could be set off against future trading profits. The offset was limited to 50% of the profit of the year. It did not disallow any tax losses from being utilised but instead lengthened the period over which they could be used. It is important to highlight that the provision to allow the carry-forward of tax losses for setting off against future trading profits is available not only for banks but for all Irish corporates. Accordingly, the removal of section 396C put the covered banks in the same position as other corporates, including other banks operating in Ireland, so it was a levelling of the playing field. Section 396C was introduced as a form of clawback for the taxpayer. It was put in place at a time, however, when State involvement in the sector was far more limited and, critically, before equity stakes were acquired in AIB and Bank of Ireland. In the lead-up to the introduction of the new capital rules on 1 January 2014 under CRD IV, and at a time when the State owned 99.8% of AIB and 14% of Band of Ireland, section 396C no longer served its original purpose and indeed worked against the taxpayer. Accordingly, in the Finance Act 2014, I decided it was appropriate to remove this provision. The factors informing this decision were as follows: it improved the capital ratios under the new standards that were being introduced at the time under CRD IV; it reduced the risk to the State in its role of backstop provider of capital; and it improved the existing value of the State's equity and debt investments in the banks. The net effect of the removal of section 396C in terms of tax receipts for the Exchequer is largely one of timing. Ultimately, it will not have an impact on the State's total corporation tax take over the long term. As per their respective annual reports for 2014, the deferred tax assets relating to Irish tax losses were:
Bank 

Amount
AIB€3.2 billion Bank of Ireland€1.2 billion PTSB €0.4 billion Finally, I can confirm for the Deputy that at the time of analysing the impact of the removal of section 396C, officials in my Department requested the banks to provide an estimate of the impact of such a move based on their respective financial projections, to assist this analysis.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	116	Does the Minister not consider it a bit obscene that the banks were bailed out to the tune of €64 billion, and they now get to count that bailout - those losses - as an asset on their balance sheets? Obviously, in the case of the nationalised bank it does not really matter, but from the point of view of Bank of Ireland, which has €1.2 billion in deferred tax assets, and the benefit to which on a yearly basis was doubled in the previous budget, it is not of benefit to the taxpayer but it is clearly of benefit to the banks. Did the banks unilaterally lobby for the change to take place before the Department contacted them? Is it the case that they are allergic to paying corporation tax and the Minister seeks to facilitate them?
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	117	A factor in the decision to remove section 396C was that it improved the capital ratios under the new capital standards that were being introduced at the time under CRD IV. The rules under CRD IV, which came into effect on 1 January 2014 on a ten-year phased basis, meant that deferred tax assets in respect of trading losses would no longer be considered as tier 1 capital.The repeal of section 396C shortens the timeframe over which the deferred tax assets are used. The deduction from capital required under the new rules is, therefore, less important. For example, following the repeal of section 396C, when forecasting bank capital ratios a few years out, they are higher than they would otherwise be. Second, it reduced the risk to the State in its role of backstop provider of capital. Aside from an increase in the bank's capital ratios under the new rules, the change also improves the quality of bank capital, thereby putting the institutions in a stronger position when being assessed by regulators and investors. This reduces the risk of a future requirement for State support. Third, it improved the existing value of the State's equity and debt investment in the banks. Most investors value banks off the new, more stringent capital rules or what is referred to as a fully loaded basis, in other words, capital when calculated when all the new CRD IV rules are taken on board. It stands to reason that the improvement in the capital levels of the banks following the removal of section 396C has a positive impact also on valuation of the State's investments.
#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	118	In marking Europe Day in the House today, it is appropriate to begin by surveying the political and economic European landscape. Our Union, it is fair to say, is in a very different position from where it was a decade ago. Financial uncertainty, conflict on our borders and a heightened threat from terrorism mean that the EU is facing challenges beyond what we could have imagined in 2005. However, the European Union is no stranger to challenge and adversity. After all, this is a Union which was forged in the wake of a brutal and devastating war. As we look to the challenges of today and of the future, I am confident that the Union will draw strength from our vision of a shared future and from the shared interests and values which have successfully bound 28 member states together. Over recent years, the Union has had to grapple with the most serious economic crisis in its history. Tackling the crisis has required difficult and often painful decisions, collectively and particularly by individual member states. Today, we are in a stronger place. Faced with grave and systematic challenges, the Union's response has been enhanced economic policy co-ordination and oversight, together with the roll-out of banking union. This has helped both to weather the storm that originated in the 2008 global financial crisis and also to ensure that we are better able to respond to any future crises. Most importantly, a genuine, if fragile, economic recovery is now beginning to take hold across Europe. Ireland has been leading the way, with a growth rate of 4.8% last year. The economies in our partner states are also increasingly beginning to recover. The challenge now is to ensure not just that this recovery is sustainable, but that it translates into real and tangible benefits for Europe's citizens, most importantly in the area of job creation. There is some evidence that the improved economic outlook is feeding into the labour market, but we must do more to get people back to work. We are particularly aware of the real difficulties faced by the Greek people. Notwithstanding the scale of the challenge, it is my sincere hope that the ongoing negotiations between the Greek Government and the three institutions will deliver a successful outcome. For the European Union to be truly strong, it must have the trust and confidence of its citizens. Unfortunately, this trust has been eroded in some ways by the painful realities of the crisis as people, and particularly young people, suffered from its most serious effects. It is no surprise that there is a corollary between reduced economic opportunities and heightened levels of euroscepticism. Rebuilding trust means ensuring that people can have hope again for the future. It means supporting job creation, kick-starting investment and ensuring that credit can flow to small and medium-sized enterprises. I hope that governments and parliaments across the Union will take the opportunity afforded by Europe Day to reflect on their own role in enhancing understanding of the Union and encouraging a more positive citizens' engagement. The Union touches almost every aspect of our daily lives and it should, and must, be firmly part of our national dialogue. The European Union's neighbourhood, both to the east and to the south, has become increasingly unpredictable and unstable over the past 12 years. This presents a challenge to the security and stability of the Union, but can also represent a challenge to our fundamental values and democratic principles. The Union has taken decisive action by imposing sanctions on Russia in respect of its actions in Ukraine, and it has unequivocally condemned the illegal annexation of Crimea. It also stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian Government as it works to roll out an ambitious reform programme; this support was reaffirmed at the EU-Ukraine summit on 27 April last. Significantly, and notwithstanding some differing perspectives among member states, the EU has maintained a unified approach to this crisis in our neighbourhood. This will continue to be critical to our credibility and influence as we consider next steps, particularly in light of implementation of the Minsk agreements. Key to the Union's effectiveness as a foreign policy actor is our ability to bring an array of complementary strategies to bear in a comprehensive response, from diplomacy to development assistance to civilian and military crisis response. The world around us is being shaped by increased connectivity, but also increased complexity. The terrible attacks in Paris, Copenhagen and Brussels earlier this year reminded us that security threats are not just beyond the Union's borders, but also within the Union. These were direct strikes against the values that underpin Europe. The threat of terrorism is a problem for which there is no easy solution or magic wand. Combatting it requires constant vigilance on the part of the EU and its member states and close and effective co-operation between our respective national policing and judicial authorities. It also demands that we address the factors which contribute to radicalisation of Europe's citizens. The EU's determined response to the attacks in Paris and Copenhagen has shown that such acts only serve to bring us closer together, rather than to divide us. Member states and the Union's institutions have resolved to work more closely together than ever before in fighting terrorism. A number of steps were agreed earlier this year and the European Council in June will review the progress achieved on these very serious matters. On the issue of migration, the scale of the recent terrible tragedies in the Mediterranean rightly prompted widespread shock and sorrow. It was crucial that the EU responded with compassion and urgency; to do otherwise would have been to forsake the moral authority of our Union. On a basic human level, we simply cannot turn the other way when innocent people are drowning off our shores. At a specially convened summit, Heads of State and Government committed to a number of steps to help save lives, alleviate suffering and strengthen co-operation with countries in our neighbourhood. The member states have also committed to an ambitious plan to implement these steps. Ireland has been playing a key part in this. We have increased the level of our humanitarian assistance to those directly affected. We are also contributing a naval vessel to participate in the reinforced EU mission in the Mediterranean. We have made clear that we are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with our southern EU partners who carry a substantial load when confronting these challenges. We are all aware that the British people go to the polls today. It is no surprise that the United Kingdom's future within the European Union remains the subject of speculation. British membership of the European Union is vital to Ireland's interests. It is important for our economic well-being, central to the continuing development of strong British-Irish relations and vital to our long-term strategic positioning within the European Union. We should not forget the positive influence and the benefits that joint Irish and British membership of the European Union has brought to Northern Ireland. Given that it is central to our interests, we have been very clear about our views and these are on the record. With today's election likely to have a significant bearing on how this issue is treated across the Irish Sea, we will be watching the results very closely. No matter who is elected and who forms part of the next British Government we will continue to put the case to our British friends as to why our particular and shared interests are best served with Britain playing a leading role in the European Union. In considering the challenges which face the European Union today - I have only touched on some - we should not lose sight of the fact that in many of these challenges there are also very real opportunities for building a stronger and more comprehensive Internal Market, for building fairer and more equal societies, and for using our collective weight as a European Union of 28 member states to promote global peace, security and development. The interconnected nature of our world means that the challenges of today cannot be tackled by states acting in isolation. We must and we will work together as a European Union with focused determination. On this important day for Europe, I assure the House that Ireland will continue to play a positive, active and engaged role as a proud member of the European Union in tackling those challenges and in harnessing new opportunities.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	119	Fianna Fáil is committed to a democratic and accountable European Union of member states who work together for the mutual benefit of all Europe's citizens. We believe strongly in the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees the freedom of member states to act where they are most effective. In the past two decades we have seen a number of European institutional developments which have sought to deepen and enhance the process of European integration. While we do not wish to see any of these rolled back, we recognise that the speed and nature of some of these moves have left many citizens unsure and disconnected from the European Union. The EU must pursue policies which promote growth, equality and fairness for all its citizens. While we strongly believe that Ireland's best interests politically and economically are best served by our remaining at the centre of the European Union and the eurozone, we also believe that we must critically analyse all political developments in the European Union to ensure that the interests of the Irish people are best served by those developments. As the Minister of State said this debate takes place as the British people go to the polls today. The outcome would appear too close to call at this point. We must be conscious that the Conservative party has contested the election with a pledge to a referendum on continued membership of the European Union. In the event of the Tory party leading the next British Government, there will be legislation in the first session of the next parliament for an in-out referendum to be held on Britain's membership of the European Union before the end of 2017. The Tories pledge to negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the European Union and then will ask the British people whether they want to stay in on this basis, or leave. A key part of this will be immigration and the Tories want to renegotiate welfare rules so that immigrants have to be working for a certain period in Britain before they can claim benefits. That is the pledge that has been made. Britain is Ireland's biggest trading partner and close ally in the European institutions. We can have strong, robust differences on particular issues but I know from my own experience, I am sure the Minister of State will agree, that Britain is a close ally on a huge number of important issues of mutual concern and interest to both countries. It is also the only country with whom we share a land border. It is essential that we have a contingency plan in the event that the UK decides to leave the European Union. Such an action plan in place would outline the policy to be pursued to lessen the impact of any British decision to leave on our economy, on our position in European Union and our vital relationship with the UK overall. Coming from a rural parish that borders County Fermanagh I grew up with the customs posts and the permanent vehicle checkpoints. At our recent Ard-Fheis on a session on Northern Ireland, there was huge participation from the floor in regard to the question of British continued membership of the European Union. Many of the contributions from the floor were from people who live in Northern Ireland who are party members and people originally from the North of Ireland who are now living in the State. Their absolute concern was in regard to possible developments and Britain's continued membership of the European Union. It would be an absolute nightmare if Ireland was a member of the Single Market and Britain was not which would necessitate it leaving the Single Market if it left the European Union. We do not want customs posts back in south Ulster and along part of Leinster and Connacht. That would be a nightmare from the point of view of trade, commerce and developing business. Thankfully, since the mid-1990s we have had huge progress on a North-South basis and on an east-west basis also and we want that progress to continue. It has been asserted by some in Britain that they can quit the European Union but retain full access to the Single Market. This is a ludicrous contention. Membership of the European Union must have some distinct advantages and responsibilities. The Greek situation remains very serious. We have consistently argued as a party that Greece needs further substantial action on its debt if it is to be given a credible path to growth. There have been encouraging signs in recent days in regard to dealing with the particular issues that will arise shortly in regard to debt repayments and hopefully the necessary progress can be made. One of the very difficult issues the European Union has to face up to is relationships with the East and, particularly, with Russia. We should be developing stronger relationships with Russia. It is not the European Union's fault that there have been negative developments in the past 18 months. It is clear that all is not well with the political system in Moscow. Increasing Russian aggression towards its neighbours and internally towards political opponents is a most frightening development. There appears to be an increasing culture of fear in Russia. Current Russian foreign policy has resulted in war in Ukraine with untold devastation and the undermining of that country's sovereignty. Even Ireland, a country which has traditionally had a distinctly cordial relationship with Russia, has been touched by this aggression through the infringement of Irish controlled air space by Russian military aircraft. This we have learned resulted in commercial air traffic having to be diverted or suspended when travelling to and from Irish airports. That is not acceptable. Irish controlled air space has to be under the control of the relevant authorities. That abuse by the Russians is not acceptable. There is so much potential with regard to possible increased trade. We have witnessed the results of sanctions being imposed by the European Union and the negative effect they have had on various sectors particularly in the food area. We would like to see agreement reached from the point of view of commitments being made and conditions established to ensure trade can resume. Fianna Fáil calls for a re-examination of the structures of the Economic and Monetary Union as well as the mandate of the European Central Bank. The architecture to ensure the long-term sustainability of the eurozone still needs to be put in place to provide a secure basis for the future prosperity of the European Union. The ECB's mandate must require policies for targeted growth as well as targeting inflation. The European Union must fulfil its commitment to separate sovereign debt and banking debt within the Union. The euro area Heads of State or Government agreed in June 2012 to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. It is now time to fulfil this commitment by retroactively recapitalising Irish banks and recognising the unfair burden Ireland has largely due to ECB insistence at critical points of the financial crisis. Europe must lead in the fight against climate change. We must ensure that the European Union supports sustainable, sensible and renewable energy policies at a European level. The European Union must also ensure that our international partners keep their commitments to reduce the causes of climate change internationally. The implementation of policies to tackle climate change must ensure the safeguarding of sustainable food production systems, which are vitally important in the fight against hunger and malnutrition. We support policies which reduce European dependency on outside energy resources. The EU must pursue policies which increase energy security and stability within the Union.Fianna Fáil believes that the EU's enlargement policy is one of the most effective foreign policy tools the Union has at its disposal. Our party has, however, consistently outlined that it is important to consolidate the new EU legislative structures introduced in the Treaty of Lisbon and to continue to build economic stability in the EU in advance of any further enlargement. I do not think the Minister of State referred to the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP. Fianna Fáil supports the successful and balanced conclusion of the EU-US free trade agreement. It has the potential to boost the European economy but we have to be conscious of concerns surrounding food standards and safety. The EU must ensure that food standards are not diminished in Europe by this agreement. In that regard, the Irish Government must raise its voice to defend Ireland's interests in agriculture and the agrifood sector in the negotiation of this deal. Fianna Fáil is also opposed to any agreement which allows for the undermining of the Irish courts' jurisdiction through an investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, clause. The EU must make a clear decision and commitment in the negotiations that there be no dumbing down of workers' rights in any proposed agreement. That has to be a kernel of our position.  This is the first time that a round of funding for the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, has been reduced, between 2014 and 2020. Thankfully, the milk quotas were abolished at the end of March. We secured a commitment at the health check of the CAP review in November 2008 to the ending of milk quotas at the end of March 2015. That was a very good decision but many members of the EU did not support it enthusiastically. We were one of the few countries that were very vigorous and forceful in demanding that the EU abolish milk quotas. Subsequently, and it was utterly crazy, many member states made an effort in late 2009 to pause that decision to abolish quotas, which would have sent a terrible mixed message to the farmers in the EU who would not know whether or not quotas would be abolished. We fought that vigorously. The decision confirmed in 2008 remained in place and, thankfully, that restriction has been removed from our farmers. It is disappointing that the EU is imposing a superlevy on farmers just at the time when they need to invest to expand. All of us who represent rural counties are particularly conscious of the opportunity there is for farmers to expand but that needs investment. Unfortunately, the EU is imposing that superlevy on farmers which is most regrettable. The levy goes back into central funds and is not necessarily kept to support the dairy sector. I hope the Government will try to get the EU to change on this issue.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	120	Seventy years ago today the remaining Nazi leaders signed a total and unconditional surrender order which ended the Second World War. Out of the ashes and devastation that the war brought there was a growing realisation that something needed to change in order to ensure that Europe never fought another war of this magnitude and the need for greater co-operation and solidarity was obvious. The evils of fascism remained in some European countries, but many others marched forward progressively, creating more inclusive societies by building public health services and welfare systems which worked to create a safety net for millions who were experiencing poverty and hunger. This Saturday, 9 May, marks the EU celebration of Europe Day. There will be a handful of official parties but it will go unnoticed by millions of citizens across Europe. It marks the date of the Schuman Declaration in 1950, which proposed the pooling of French and West German coal and steel industries and led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community. The people of this State voted to join what was then the European Economic Community on 10 May 1972. Many who argued against joining highlighted issues such as sovereignty, independence, neutrality and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, the exploitation and use of natural resources, including mineral wealth, and the critical issue of jobs. There was also a discussion at that time about the direction of European and how it would evolve. Much has changed since then but many of the concerns raised at that time are equally relevant today. The EU is now made up of 27 members. Two of the biggest challenges facing Europe now are the crisis in Greece and the drownings in the Mediterranean. At the heart of both issues lies the absence or the complete misunderstanding of the responsibilities and nature of solidarity. The Mediterranean is quickly becoming a graveyard. Last year, 3,200 men, women and children died while trying to cross the Mediterranean in coffin ships to reach the EU. Many came from impoverished countries in Africa and Asia and were fleeing conflict, persecution, and hunger. A total of 170,000 made the journey safely and landed in Italy in 2014. Over 1,700 people have died in the first four months of this year while trying to cross the Mediterranean. That is 100 times more than this time last year. How can we, as human beings and Europeans, turn aside and ignore this huge humanitarian crisis? This summer hundreds of thousands of tourists will be flying to the beaches of the Mediterranean to enjoy themselves. At the same time hundreds of thousands of adults and children will be making their perilous journeys, placed in overcrowded and unsafe rafts, dinghies and boats, desperately trying to reach the beaches, towns and cities of Europe. Thousands more face drowning. We have heard that EU governments have planned to triple Triton’s mission budget to €9 million per month and provide some more rescue boats. As we face into this worsening crisis the plans for more money and rescue ships have yet to be realised. Just last weekend 6,770 people were rescued by the Italian coast guard. The Italian navy is still conducting search and rescue missions, while the EU’s Triton mission is primarily concerned with patrolling the EU’s borders. This is wrong and needs to be changed. It does not matter how much money is pumped into the Triton mission unless it has an active search and rescue mandate. I welcome the fact the Minister for Defence is planning to send the LE Eithne to the region. However, we also need to examine and increase the number of refugees that Ireland accepts. For our population size we are taking far too few. We cannot rescue migrants and just drop them off in Malta and Italy and forget about them. We need to show greater solidarity with southern Mediterranean countries. There needs to be an EU focus on increasing our collective support and help to southern European countries which are on the front line and one of those initiatives must be to increase Europe’s refugee quota. The world is experiencing an unprecedented number of simultaneous humanitarian crises and the UN estimates that 50 million people are currently displaced. Ireland must play its part on the front line and at home. The EU continues to mishandle Greece’s unstable debt and economic crisis. It is unacceptable that it fails to recognise that Greece’s debt is unsustainable and that this is also causing a humanitarian crisis, and needs to be reformed. The EU and the IMF are stalling progress on these vital issues. They continue to disagree on Greece’s reforms and debt, and this is to the widespread detriment of Greece and its people. Where is the solidarity that was supposed to be the spine of the EU when it was established? The EU's decisions on Greece continue to be led by the Eurogroup. The Eurogroup is now a key body in the EU’s economic governance but it is not democratically accountable to anyone. Legally speaking, it is not an institution of the EU. It cannot make any laws. Regardless of that, however, no money will be released to Greece unless the Eurogroup says so. The Eurogroup does not have to update the public or the institutions on its work and no minutes of its meetings are kept. It is clearly in need of significant reform to tackle its lack of accountability and transparency. The Eurogroup, with the connivance of Europe’s finance Ministers, continues to bully and punish the Greek people for voicing their democratic wishes and seeking a fairer way forward.  Europe and its leaders would do well to reflect on the lessons of the past and to remember the issues that led to the rise of fascism in the past and that are leading to the growth of right-wing groups across Europe, as well as the decisions to cancel mass unsustainable debts after the Second World War and how this allowed European countries to recover and invest in their welfare states. This type of solidarity is hugely important in building a Europe of equals. Sadly, the EU is instead creating a two-tier Europe filled with inequality. It is a dangerous route and we need to learn the lessons from the tragedies that happened in the past. We can move forward.  People describe my party as anti-European, but it is far from that. We are critical of Europe and want to see a different Europe emerge. This message is growing across Europe. People want to see a different type of Europe - a Europe of solidarity. Those in need must be supported by all of us. The two issues I highlighted here this morning are clearly two messages that we can resolve.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	121	I am not sure why we are having this debate. I know it is Europe Day but it would be absurd to imagine that anybody in Europe is going to take the slightest bit of notice of what we say in this debate today. It is a grandiose title. We talk about the challenges facing the EU. The cursory speech from the Minister of State did not really paint any vision of the future. If this was of some significance, the German ambassador or someone like that might be in the Visitors Gallery listening to what we have say. We know that this debate will cause no ripples in Europe. I will illustrate this with one incident that took place last week. Our relationship with Europe is one of supplicant and master. The Minister of State will be aware that last Friday, the former president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, came over here to appear before our democratic representatives at the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis. It was a lap of honour by a man who is not elected but who is obviously more powerful than the democratically elected representatives here. Mr. Trichet appeared on his own terms before the committee. His appearance was prefaced by a 50-minute speech from him which was applauded by the europhiles in the audience. It was followed by two speeches, one by Michael Somers, the deputy chairman of AIB, which applauded Mr. Trichet, and another by a professor of European affairs. After that, a couple of tame questions were thrown in by people involved in European business, followed by the democratic representatives, on limited time, who asked questions that Mr. Trichet failed to answer. Unfortunately, this is the kind of relationship Ireland has with Europe. It was symbolic of the attitude we have. We do as we are told, bow and scrape and let them away with that sort of dictatorial attitude. That is not how it should be. The Minister of State's speech today should have spelt out the consequences of a victory for the Tories in the British general election, which is happening today, and the consequences for Ireland if the UK does leave the EU, because this is the most serious issue and the big challenge that faces us. There is absolutely no mention of what should be there, which is plan B. If this happens to us, we will no longer be semi-detached members. We will virtually cut off because of the decision of our biggest trading partner.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	122	If Europe is supposed to mean anything, it should be about international solidarity among the peoples of Europe and creating a beacon of progress and an agency of peace in the world. However, that is not what the EU looks like today. We have war in Ukraine, in which Europe has a hand, hundreds of people desperately trying to get into Europe to escape terrible situations in the developing world and losing their lives in the Mediterranean, and cruel austerity inflicted for the past seven years at the behest of the people who seem to really run Europe - the bankers, bondholders and money men. They are inflicting really vicious austerity on the ordinary citizens of Europe, to the point at which the EU is threatened with a break-up. This is what we are looking at with the possibility that the general election in the UK could lead to the possible exit of that country from the EU. There is also the very precarious situation in Greece, which could be forced out of the EU because of the really bloody-minded and vindictive attitude of the European authorities, and, behind them, the ECB and the financial markets in Europe, which find it acceptable to sacrifice the livelihoods, services, dignity and rights of the people of Greece on the altar of profit and maintaining the international financial system of speculation, banking and so on. Europe is in a very precarious situation, and one can add to that the very alarming rise of neo-fascist organisations in Germany, Greece and France and the rise of the far right in the UK. These are very worrying signs. One can add to that the shameful collaboration of the EU with Israel, which has been given favoured trading status. While Israel crushes the Palestinian people in a most obscene and brutal way, Europe does nothing about it but continues to do business with it. If we want to save the European project, we must remember that human beings come first. Europe must not be a place of money men, bankers, bondholders and people who only see the bottom line. It must be a place that puts the rights and dignity of human beings front and centre, regardless of whether they are human beings trying to enter Europe or ordinary working people across the Europe. If we fail to do that, the EU is riding towards a crisis and a break-up, and the darker possibility of a return to the sort of crises we saw in the 1930s, with all the horrendous consequences that followed from that.We are at a critical crossroads. Is it Europe for people or Europe for profit? Currently, it is Europe for profit and that is a Europe that will not last the distance.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	123	I propose to concentrate on the critical situation in Ukraine, which we all know could have dire consequences for all of Europe. Like every other Deputy, I abhor the Russian aggression in Ukraine. However, there is a danger that the West will overlook the ongoing widespread corruption in Ukraine, which does not appear to have abated since President Yanukovych was removed from power. In 2014, Ukraine was ranked 142 out of 175 countries in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index, which puts it among what are considered to be the most highly corruptible countries and on a par with Uganda and Nigeria. I acknowledge that Russia has played an important role in bolstering this system of corruption. I have no truck for Putin's methods or his relationships with some of the oligarchs in Ukraine. However, besides a couple of stunts on camera, few meaningful steps have been taken by the current administration in Ukraine since taking office to tackle the imbedded system of corruption. A package of anti-corruption measures-laws were passed but the new coalition government comprises many of the same people suspected of having milked millions out of the system.  The old ways of doing business in Ukraine remain in operation. For years, an elite, ruthless few churned elicit profits into bank accounts around the world while the West turned a blind eye. These oligarchs are still holding the Ukraine economy to hostage. They will not hesitate to resort to additional legal means to maintain their sources of income and power. They have no interest in building a new country. As acknowledged by many governments across Europe, the infamous Right Sector still holds enormous power in Ukraine. Only two weeks ago, the press secretary of the Right Sector said in an interview that Europe needed to be told the right way to go so as to save it from the terrible situation of total liberalism. This is what members of the Ukraine Government are telling those who do not go to church or are tolerant of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights. It is crucial that we in the West take a strong position on the participation of the far right in the new government and on the uncontrolled rightist paramilitaries on the streets of Ukraine. The new government must run the country properly. Currently, Ukraine is crippled by war and corruption and there is no point in the West seeking an end for the former without a willingness to rule out the latter.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the tremendous work being done by Deputy Dominic Hannigan as Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs. It is an honour to work with him on that committee. He does superb work right across Europe, which is recognised across Europe.  We need to monitor the situation in Ukraine, which may become critical in the coming months. We need to be careful how we line up in terms of our dealings with this absolutely corrupt regime that appears to have some influence with Europe. It would appear that we believe everything it says and does.
#DominicHannigan	unknown-#DominicHannigan-party	unknown-#DominicHannigan-dob	unknown-#DominicHannigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	124	I thank Deputy Halligan for his kind remarks. I welcome this debate on the challenges facing the European Union. As Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, it is a pleasure to speak on this issue on Europe Day. It is fitting that we mark Europe Day and recall that Europe, notwithstanding the flaws and many difficulties with which we are faced, about which we heard earlier from other Deputies, has developed into a place that values cultural diversity and has brought lasting peace to member states and religious freedom, fundamental rights and human rights to the citizens within its borders. I am delighted to be here today and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, to the House for this debate. Europe Day is not just a one day event for the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs in that it engages in ongoing debate on issues of importance. Only last week, the committee held a debate with former EU Commissioner Peter Sutherland, the Italian Ambassador and others on the migration crisis in the European Mediterranean region and how we can react to that humanitarian crisis. As a result of that meeting, we will be sending a letter to the Taoiseach outlining the views of the committee in regard to what needs to be done in the region. One of the clear views expressed by all members of the committee was that Europe is not doing enough to tackle this crisis, including in terms of the number of refugees being taken in by all member states. We expect and hope that the Taoiseach will take on board our views and ensure that other European leaders are aware of the comments of the citizens of Ireland and act on them. The joint committee tries to play an integral role on behalf of the Oireachtas in the developing role of national parliaments in the European Union and ensuring that national parliamentarians have a role at European level. The role of the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs has evolved over time from that of a committee which scrutinises the laws and legislation coming from Europe to that of a committee which now also focuses on policy, which is one of the reasons for the meeting last week on the migration issue. The committee also addresses other issues such as the gap that exists between citizens and Europe and what Europe is doing.  This afternoon, the committee will engage in a discussion on changing attitudes towards the European Union. Members will be aware from talking to Irish citizens during various referenda campaigns that the level of support for Ireland's continued membership of the European Union has decreased. The committee is seeking to gain an understanding of the reason people are turning against the European project. The question of why support for the European Union is declining must be asked. As such, the committee will hear at its meeting this afternoon with the Irish Countrywomen's Association, the National Youth Council of Ireland and others what they believe can be done to combat the reduction in buy-in to Europe. Another vital issue, which was raised earlier by Deputy Ross, is the reason nobody is speaking about the elephant in the room when it comes to Europe, namely, what Britain will do. As Members will be aware, a general election is underway in Britain today. For the past three months, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs has been addressing the issue of a possible exit by Britain from Europe. Deputy Ross may not be aware of that but members of the committee, some of whom are in the House now, are well aware of the implications of such an exit on Ireland. The committee will in the coming weeks present a report on what it considers to be the implications for Ireland of a British exit. It is no secret that outgoing Prime Minister Cameron has said that if returned to government he will hold a referendum on this matter within the next two years. The view of the committee is that regardless of who is in government in the UK, a referenda will be held. There is a boil in terms of Britain's ongoing involved with the European Union that needs to be lanced. The implications of this for Ireland will be profound. This issue has been considered by the committee. I have no doubt the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, other committees and the Department will be monitoring this issue on an ongoing basis to ensure there is clarity regarding the implications of such an exit for Ireland and how we should react to it, including what negotiation strategies to employ to ensure we mitigate any impact on our citizens. When it comes to the role of national parliaments, we are trying to ensure that national parliaments utilise the powers given to them under the Lisbon treaty to the fullest extent. An issue often raised by national parliamentarians, not only by Irish parliamentarians but parliamentarians from other countries, is the relative shift in power away from national parliamentarians towards the European Parliament and European Commission as a result of the Lisbon treaty. The Lisbon treaty gives national parliamentarians additional powers, some of which were ground-breaking at the time of their introduction. The right of national parliaments to scrutinise and influence EU legislation on the basis of subsidiarity was enshrined in the treaties at the time of the adoption of the Lisbon treaty. There are issues in relation to what the definition means and what we can do with it.After five years of experience there is a growing sense that we need to develop those powers further. My committee is dealing with a number of other national parliaments, notably with the British, Dutch, Danish and Polish parliaments. Next week a number of committee members will attend a meeting in Warsaw on the yellow card issue and how the role of national parliaments can be improved. I expect an outcome of that meeting will be proposals that can be put to the European Commission and to the new First Vice-President, Mr. Frans Timmermans, on how the role of national parliamentarians can be improved over the coming years. We have received a firm commitment from the new European Union Commission to better engage with national parliaments. There is an understanding on its part that national parliaments have lost out somewhat, relatively speaking, since the Lisbon treaty. This is acknowledged by the Commission and it is willing to see an improved and increased role for national parliamentarians. We will do what we can to improve our engagement with the Commission. In the past two years we have set out a number of considered political contributions to the Commission. Last year, we put forward our views on how the Europe 2020 strategy could be improved. We also talked about how we wanted to see the social rights of European citizens more enshrined in European Union legislation and policy, looking at issues such as the pay gender gap, part-time work and the need to ensure that jobs, when created, provide a living wage. Conditions of work such as zero contract hours have a negative impact on the lives of employees. We have been making political contributions to the European Commission on a number of issues over the past number of years and we will continue to do so. We need to communicate better the message of the work done by the Oireachtas and by the European Union. I note a previous speaker said that nobody would be watching this debate. However, I know that many ambassadors watch these debates all the time.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	125	I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this important debate at this time in Ireland's history. The Fianna Fáil Party is committed to a democratic and accountable European Union of member states who work together for the mutual benefit of all Europe's citizens. We believe strongly in the principle of subsidiarity which guarantees the freedom of member states to act where they are most effective. I wish to focus on an issue that is coming down the tracks. David Cameron, the outgoing British Prime Minister has stated:I am in favour of a referendum. I believe in confronting this issue - shaping it, leading the debate. Not simply hoping a difficult situation will go away.The big question is if the UK votes to leave the EU, where does Ireland stand as Britain's largest trading partner? Our trade with Britain was clearly important in the process of economic recovery over the past three or four years. Where will the trading arrangement stand if Britain decides to opt out of membership? Given the close economic as well as geographical, political, cultural, social and historic connections between Ireland and the UK, we are extremely exposed if Britain decides to leave the EU. The UK is Ireland's biggest trading partner and close ally in the European institutions. It is also the only country with whom we share a land border. It is essential that we have a contingency plan in the event that the UK decides to leave the European Union. The voting in the United Kingdom general election is being held today. The Conservatives have indicated that they are in favour of a referendum. The view has been expressed by previous speakers that other parties will opt for a referendum, given the general attitude prevailing in Britain towards EU membership.  Ireland and Britain trade over €1 billion worth of goods and services every week. Almost 200,000 people in Ireland are employed as a result of our exports to the UK. Recent data from the Central Statistics Office shows that 43% of exports from Irish firms were destined for the UK. To put this in real numbers, approximately €6.8 billion was destined for the UK. This is the same amount that the Government is planning to invest in commercial projects of benefit to the economy and which will be overseen by the National Treasury Management Agency over the next five years. The move could also lead to the re-introduction of border controls between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This would have a disastrous effect on the people of County Louth and the Louth constituency who travel across the Border for trade, business and family reasons, on a regular basis. A UK exit from the EU would also damage co-operation in tackling cross-Border crime and would put in jeopardy the strong relationship that has been built between the Garda Síochána and the PSNI in recent years. It is for the people of the UK to decide for themselves in a referendum as to whether they want to remain part of the EU. However, Ireland has an obligation to highlight the profound benefits associated with EU membership both for them and for us. The Government needs to continue advocating the benefits of EU membership for both Ireland and the UK. Nonetheless, the Government needs to have a contingency plan in place certainly for the period of the referendum campaign. I call on the Taoiseach and the Government to develop a strategic position for Ireland that takes into account the risks for Ireland should the UK decide to leave the EU. These risks need to be identified and minimised as quickly as possible. Another market in which Ireland and the UK are interlinked is the energy market. Ireland imports 89% of its oil products and 93% of its gas from the UK. The Irish electricity grid has been linked to Britain since 2001. The gas grids are also connected via Scotland. A UK exit from the EU could impact negatively on security of energy supplies and might increase the cost of connecting to the internal energy market. Clearly, more than any other country, we want Britain to stay in the European Union. We have to ask how high a price we will pay in order to keep Britain in the EU. The undermining of the core of the Union, stripping away consumer and worker protections and restricting the ability to address clear problems in the Union, would be too high a price to pay. It has been asserted by some in the UK that they can quit the Union but retain full access to the single market. This is profoundly ludicrous. Membership of the Union must have some distinct advantages and responsibilities. We have no difficulty with the UK staying out of the eurozone. If it wishes to opt out of a broader budget there are means of accommodating it but the Union has to be about something more than trade.

The Government is claiming that 8,000 jobs could be created and GDP could increase by 1.1% through TTIP2. We have heard all the spin before. I recall all the jobs promised at the time of the Lisbon negotiations but these have yet to materialise for many in Ireland or across the EU. TTIP is aimed at stimulating trade. However, trade between the two blocs has never been better and goods worth €1.8 billion are exchanged every day between the US and EU. Ireland has a strong and arguably unique alliance with America with a range of existing bilateral agreements. Irish exports to the United States grew year-on-year by almost 1.3% in 2013 and are now in the region of €18.4 billion. I believe the Government, probably to suit its own agenda, is drawing on best case scenario figures. It is suggested that figures used by those in favour of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership are vastly overblown and are being used to convince a sceptical electorate of the benefits of what is a risky agreement. TTIP could have an adverse effect on Irish exports to the European Union, which account for over 60% of total exports. One study has quantified this and suggested that in a deep liberalisation scenario intra-EU trade could fall by approximately 30%. We are calling on the Government to commission an objective study and report to assess the real benefits and risks facing Ireland as a result of TTIP. It is not good enough that we sit on our hands and cling hard to bloated statistics. Rhetoric alone is not going to address this. We need informed negotiators who can show leadership and ensure a fair deal for people. The European Commission is negotiating this deal on behalf of Europe. The Lisbon treaty gave that power to the European Commission without any input or transparency. Furthermore, as a result of the Lisbon treaty, member states have lost the power to veto these types of agreements. The European Parliament only has the power to reject or approve the entire deal after it has been negotiated. The negotiations thus far have been shrouded in secrecy. An EU mandate document was leaked in early October 2014 and was subsequently declassified. The EU is considered to have high regulatory standards, a characteristic some industries have long complained about as representing a barrier to trade. However, these standards are in place for a reason, that is, to protect communities and consumers. Some vested interests want TTIP to become a platform for making changes to regulation to make industry more profitable for companies. This would have negative impacts on public policy and would come at a great social cost. These behind closed doors negotiations are being carried out by people who are neither elected nor accountable to Irish or EU citizens. The greatest threat to democracy in all of this is the investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism. The ISDS mechanism allows corporations to sue governments even for loss of expected revenue when government regulations are seen to affect expected profits. Through ISDS, companies can bypass the national court systems and appeal directly to international investor-based tribunals. For example, a company could potentially sue for loss of profits if a government banned fracking in its area. We know that Australia is being sued for damages by a major tobacco giant in response to public health measures to restrict smoking. There have been several threats by companies to sue Ireland to compensate for lost profits. Currently, there is no mechanism for companies to do this in Ireland but with the ISDS mechanism that will no longer be the case. Many member states, including Germany, have stated their opposition to the inclusion of the ISDS mechanism. Irish people are becoming increasingly aware of the presence and activities of a golden circle of those in big business who always seem to benefit from Government decisions and choices. I maintain that TTIP and the ISDS mechanism represent a framework for a worldwide golden circle.

#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	As I said yesterday during Leaders' Questions - I am continuing the theme of the previous Deputy - I believe that TTIP is a major challenge for the EU. In particular, the ISDS mechanism represents a challenge because it will enable foreign investors to directly sue state governments which have been democratically elected. These companies will have the legal right to challenge any regulatory or policy measures of a host state that interfere with their ability to make profits or access markets. There are consequences for the ability of countries to maintain domestic regulatory space. The question for Europe is how foreign investors will be held accountable for damage caused through their operations. Although we are told of the potential market of 800 million people for European business, this represents giving too much power to profit-making companies. There is an example of this from Canada, where gas and oil exploration companies have taken the Canadian Government to court for millions. The implication is that this will have an effect on that government's ability in respect of policy-making on the environment. Yesterday, I referred specifically to education and the potential, through the ISDS mechanism, for an increased commercialisation and privatisation of our colleges and educational establishments. There is pressure to expand the scope of education commitments in TTIP. The EU must ensure that education is excluded. There are also implications for culture and the arts. France was able to secure an exception for its film industry to protect it from the Hollywood blockbuster industry, but there are implications for the arts and theatre in this country. The challenge for Europe is to ensure the protection of workers' rights, food and the environment as well as to ensure that governments act in the public good. It is vital that we have an open and frank debate on the issue in the House. The other challenge I am keen to explore is derived from my chairing of the Irish section of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA. This has to do with the EU relationship with the developing world. Despite the progress made on the millennium development goals, poverty and inequality remain major challenges in the world and for the EU, as do political instability and conflict. These problems are causing people to risk their lives. Today over 1,000 people who lost their lives on the Lusitania are being commemorated but we must think of the thousands who have lost their lives. Europe has been found wanting in this regard. Part of the reason for this inequality is the multinational and transnational companies moving into the developing world. Through coercion, bribes, fraud and the use of military goods they are clearing people off their land. This is having severe effects on food security and the environment. There has been a process at European level towards a more transparent international tax regime but Europe must face this challenge and continue to press for transparency, country-by-country reporting and ensure no illicit flows of capital. Moreover, EU member states must implement legally-binding limits to the vulture fund claims in national jurisdictions. A new report to be launched next week will call for Ireland and the EU to make clear the level of human rights due diligence that they expect of Irish and European companies working in the developing world. The report will be about Africa but it should equally apply to Irish and European companies working in Asia and South America. Some of these companies have offices in the European countries. I offer one final statistic. International trade union conferences are claiming that 4,000 workers could lose their lives before a ball is kicked at the Qatar World Cup football finals in 2020. That is a major challenge for the EU.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	129	I want to focus on debt, climate and social Europe. We need to get to grips with the European debt mountain and to reset our ambition away from the idea that has dominated Europe in the past seven years, that is, the sense that the EU has become an agency of fiscal control more than anything else. What of the Lisbon treaty, the social chapter, social solidarity and a European Union that puts citizens first? A debt conference is absolutely essential. It is not only programme countries that have a problem with the debt mountain. For example, other countries above the 60% target include Germany, France, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Netherlands. These are in addition to the likes of Italy, Spain, Cyprus, Slovenia, Portugal and, of course, Greece. We cannot grow the European economy without a fiscal expansion into key areas. In respect of our country, we need to appreciate fully the requirement to tackle climate change. We were told last week by the Minister that this would cost us €300 million per year in hard cash because we will not meet the 2020 targets. That cost will apply every year. We run the risk of these fines. Ireland is importing approximately €7 billion in fossil fuels annually and we are almost 90% dependent on these imports. Therefore, we need to invest in public transport. That is where the fiscal expansion is needed. We need to have a major programme of home energy retrofitting and we also need to invest in areas such as broadband. All of these areas would involve the kind of fiscal expansion that would make us a better contributor to the European Union. With regard to the social crisis, as I have said before, we have achieved stability in our finances at the expense of society in Europe. We have saved the euro at the expense of democratic accountability. Inter-governmentalism has dominated the Council throughout the crisis. We have to move away from being led by politicians who are only concerned with the pragmatic present, and we need to have a vision for the kind of Europe we need to become. I have quoted Jürgen Habermas in the past. He said:If one wants to preserve the monetary union, it is no longer enough ... to provide loans to over-indebted states so that each should improve its competitiveness by its own efforts. What is required is solidarity instead, a co-operative effort from a shared political perspective to promote growth and competitiveness in the eurozone as a whole. Such an effort would require Germany and several other countries to accept short and medium-term negative redistribution effects in its own longer term self-interest - a classic example of solidarity...We need to see that kind of solidarity. It is a big challenge for Europe to combine and seek that solidarity, but there is no evidence that we have seen it. That is a huge challenge for the European Union.

There was no fanfare, no press release, no standing on Government steps with the Taoiseach on one side of the Tánaiste and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, on the other. I must put it to the Tánaiste: where has the basic decency of the Labour Party gone? We now have a situation in which an arm of the State will be a debt-collecting agency for a utility company, with no ability-to-pay clause in the primary legislation. One in eight children is living in poverty, and people are struggling on social welfare payments, although there has been a huge cut in those payments, including the cost of education allowance, the fuel allowance, the back to school allowance, the one-parent family allowance, farm assist, household packages and respite care grants. The CSO's recent figures show that there has been a 2% decrease in real family income. There is huge pressure on families, yet we now have a situation in which people in extreme poverty will be dragged to the courts and attachment orders will be made to their social welfare payments or their basic wages.

We have raised this time and again. People who advocate for those on the margins have stated that an ability-to-pay clause needs to be put in place, but it has not been. We are now being told by the Minister, Deputy Kelly, that it will be taken into account. If it is so important, why was it not put into the primary legislation in the first place? At this late stage, I would urge the reversal of this decision to allow the Government to pick the pockets of people who simply cannot afford to pay. They are queuing up in the offices of community welfare officers every day of the week looking for additional social welfare payments because they are struggling. The Government is now saying in primary legislation that it is going to put the hands of Irish Water into the pockets of people living in poverty. Would the Tánaiste agree that this legislation on the attachment of orders to social welfare payments and lower wages is an attack on vulnerable people, that it is unfair and not a decent thing by any stretch of the imagination, and that it will cause huge hardship to many families who are already living on the poverty line? The Tánaiste should bear in mind that these figures are borne out by the recent CSO surveys, which show that real household income is falling and that one in eight children are living in extreme poverty in this country today.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	The most recent CSO figures show that, thankfully, a lot of people are going back to work, and the biggest way to improve any family's income is to go back to work. Recalling reductions in social welfare, I do not think people will ever forget that Fianna Fáil cut people's social welfare by €16 to €17 a week. That is its legacy, what it has to live with and what it has to explain to people. That is the cause of the fall in people's incomes in respect of social welfare. Deputy Kelleher was a Minister of State at the time and was probably party to those decisions. In regard to the Deputy's point about Irish Water, over 1.2 million people have registered with the company. At the moment, as Members of the House are aware, the bills are going out. In fact, the Deputy will probably know from conversations that a lot of people are pleasantly surprised to find they have actually beaten the cap. However, where they have not beaten the cap, the quarterly charge for a larger household is €65. This decision by the Government is essentially to distinguish between those who cannot pay and those who will not pay, and, in the case of people who will not pay, to lay out a clear path for the recovery of civil debt. We know there are a lot of Deputies in this House who earn over €80,000 gross, so I think they are people who can afford to pay. As we know from the record of the House, however, a lot of them have said they will not pay, and they want everybody else to pay for them. That is not acceptable. Coming back to the question, the first thing about this legislation, which is based on a report by the Law Reform Commission in 2010, is that it removes from people any threat of imprisonment in regard to civil debt. The threat of imprisonment in regard to civil debt, as I am sure people know, goes back to the times of Charles Dickens, when people were imprisoned as debtors. It is a very fundamental reform to take that threat away. I have to say I am very pleased that various organisations have welcomed this legislation. The second issue is how we set out the details of the legislation and how we distinguish between the people Deputy Kelleher was rightly concerned about and the people on good incomes who just say, "Let everyone else pay for me. I am not paying." Notwithstanding the fact that our water services cost a lot of money, and despite all the work that Irish Water is doing, we know about the leaks and other difficulties such as lead in pipes that were not addressed for decades by local authorities. This reform of court-related debt procedures will be dealt with by the Department of Justice and Equality and we will then have a series of other reforms. The Bill now needs to be drafted. With regard to social protection, if somebody on social protection is faced with debts, we have long-established principles which remain absolutely intact in regard to how and when money can be deducted from a debt. It has been subjected to very detailed discussion in this House at different times and actually deals with very small amounts.More importantly, we want to have easy pay systems, in particular through An Post, something which is under discussion and is currently being finalised, through the household budgeting scheme. It will allow people to pay a small amount on a weekly basis. I resent the implications of the Deputy.

The point I made clearly is that it not that people will not pay but that they simply cannot pay. The Tánaiste should know that. Her legacy is that there are 1,000 children in this city sleeping in emergency accommodation every night as a direct result of her decisions with regard to the cap on rent allowance. I will take lectures from many people but on this issue, I will not take a lecture from the Tánaiste. There are thousands of families who simply cannot afford to make a contribution to bills for water because they do not have the money. That is evidenced by the fact that people are queuing up before community welfare officers across the State week in, week out to try to access additional payments because of the cuts to social welfare over the past number of years.  I will name the cuts. There have been cuts to the education allowance, fuel allowance, back to school allowance, one-parent family allowance, farm assist, household packages and respite care grants and a cap on rent allowance. That is the legacy of the Tánaiste. The Government will pass legislation which will take no account of ability to pay. Reference was made to the fact those in the House earn €84,000 a year. Nobody in the Chamber is on social welfare but there are hundreds of thousands of people in the country who are and who cannot afford to make their weekly payments. I am not making up those figures; every statistic and survey shows that there is a major problem with poverty in the country. Some one in eight children are living in abject poverty. Some 30% of household incomes are on the breadline.

The proposed attachment order system is draconian, an attack on poor people and does not take into account ability to pay.

If the Deputy is suggesting that people should be encouraged, including people who can pay like some Deputies in this House who will not pay-----

That is why so many organisations have welcomed that change. Fianna Fáil should welcome it. Were it true to the philosophy-----

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	160	For several months I have asked the Tánaiste to explain how families who have borne the brunt of the Government's austerity policies can pay the unjust and unfair water tax. I have asked her directly which daily necessities she proposes they forgo to prop up the discredited entity that is Irish Water. She has never once given me a straight answer. We now know the reason for her reticence.  All along she was planning legislation to pickpocket people's wages, pensions and social welfare payments. The proposal is low, sneaky and a cowardly proposition in the face of mass public opposition to her water tax. That such a Thatcherite policy is being introduced by Labour Party Ministers makes it all the more despicable. It illustrates the contempt with which Fine Gael and the Labour Party now view all of those on low incomes, the working poor, the unemployed and the vulnerable. It is an attitude best encapsulated by her colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who commented on unemployed citizens being, in his mind, allergic to work. The Government is now seeking to turn private landlords into debt collectors for Irish Water, a position they greatly resent. As a result, landlords have speculated that they may have to triple tenants' deposits. The plan to raid people's wages, pensions and welfare payments will include thresholds to ensure people are not pushed into poverty. Those who cannot pay, and many of those who will not pay, already live in poverty. Is the Tánaiste not aware of that? They are barely able to make ends meet, but she just does not get it.  The Government now proposes to raid wages, welfare or pensions. In a double whammy, it also proposes to make private rented accommodation even more unaffordable for those with low incomes. Perhaps this time the Tánaiste will answer. What advice does she have for those people? What daily necessity does she propose they forgo to pay the water tax?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	161	It is my objective, as Minister for Social Protection, as I have told the Deputy, to get as many people as possible back into work and thereby significantly improve their income and that of their households and to improve the life chances of any children they may have. The social welfare system in this country is strong and is built on social solidarity and a social contract. A lot of people lost their jobs as a result of the disastrous crash in the economy, which was engineered by the previous Government. We want to get as many people of working age as we can back into work. That is not a difficulty because many people are anxious to return to work, education and training. Many young people are delighted to take up apprenticeships. From the manner in which the Deputy talks about people who rely on income from social welfare, one would think that such people had no ambition whatsoever in terms of opportunities for themselves or their children.I have listened to Sinn Féin's mantra on social welfare and its hostility to work for so long that if it was a song we would all be able to sing it. No wonder west Belfast has the highest incidence of all the problems Deputy Kelleher was talking about as regards poverty and a whole range of social difficulties.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	168	Deputies on all sides of the House have called for this basic reform over a very long period. Does Sinn Féin welcome it or not? It is a fundamental reform of how debt is dealt with. The second thing about debt in a modern society is that it affects people at all levels of society. As we know from the crash, it is not just people on a tight budget who find it difficult to manage - lots of people do. The first thing with debt is to have easy methods of paying so that, as far as possible, nobody ever actually gets to a court and the debt can be dealt with. In the case of water charges and Irish Water, we reformed the system and the charges in such a way that many people who are now receiving their bills are finding they have beaten the cap because they have been very careful with their use of water. That is part of the reason we have put in water metering around the country.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	171	On the matter of debt, I cannot give the Deputy the kind of detail she is looking for because the legislation is being drafted as we speak. The Government made a principled decision yesterday evening to adopt broadly the reforms advocated by the Law Reform Commission in 2010 in respect of civil debt, particularly to distinguish between those who will not pay despite being on comfortable salaries but want everybody else to pay, and those who have difficulties with paying. There will be a very clear support system set out in respect of people who have those kinds of difficulty.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	172	It is not me the Tánaiste has to convince of people's anxiety to get back to work. That is a conversation she should have much closer to home, primarily with her colleague, the Minister for Finance. I trust she will have that conversation with him and will ask him to desist from insulting and being condescending towards people who find themselves out of work. That would be at least one constructive thing that the Tánaiste might do. Her comments set aside entirely the reality of the lives of people on small fixed incomes for whom the quarterly payment of €65 is simply beyond their reach. What is absolutely beyond me is the fact that the Tánaiste, as a Labour Party leader, and her colleagues on the Labour Party benches do not recognise that reality. A bill of €65 might seem like a small sum to all of us here, but when someone is stretching week after week and not meeting her bills, when her head is already below the water line, how on earth is she expected to get the €65 together? That is what this boils down to. The Tánaiste says she took a principled decision on this legislation - my goodness, a principled decision - to put her hand into the pocket of a woman raising a household of small children who does not sleep at night with worry about how she will pay her bills.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	174	Does the Tánaiste regard that as a principled position? It is a disgraceful thing to do, and none of her highfalutin' and condescending rhetoric can disguise that. People cannot afford these bills. The Tánaiste says she is acting on a proposal from the Law Reform Commission from a number of years back. That proposal does indeed exist, but the Tánaiste is not fooling anybody. This is all about Irish Water and the public resistance to an unfair imposition on struggling families. People see that this is the Government saying to the working poor - many of those struggling are at work, as I presume the Tánaiste knows - that it does not care about their living circumstances or their day-to-day struggles and that if they do not cough up it is going to stick its hand in their pockets anyway. That is the message people hear.

What does she say to that woman in that struggling household? What does the Tánaiste suggest she set aside to put together the €65? Is the Tánaiste happy to give her even more sleepless nights as she worries about how and when the Tánaiste's hand will be stuck into her pocket or her purse or when it will take bread off the table and from her children? That is the reality of the people I represent, and they want the Tánaiste to hear that message-----

#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	245	There is huge disquiet and concern in rural Ireland about the newly constructed Leader scheme to be implemented from now until 2020. The previous Leader scheme was a lifesaver to say the least for rural Ireland, and communities throughout the country benefited from funding for various projects which created jobs, supported and financed several community projects and promoted involvement by the public in projects with a bottom-up approach. The previous Leader scheme had €400 million available for the partnership local development companies. The latest funding allocation for 2014 until 2020 has been cut drastically to €220 million. This is a massive cut of 45% across the board. This drastic cut for vital services in rural Ireland is a devastating blow for rural groups. It is a further indication of the slash and burn policies which apply to our rural countryside. The decreased allocation will have a significant detrimental impact on the ability of the new realigned partnership groups to deliver community-based projects and support vital community services and facilities. The impact on business development, growth and jobs is looking very bleak. Will the Tánaiste and the Government immediately review the Government's contribution and raise the amount of matching funds from the Exchequer to compliment EU funding, and at least have a fund which is similar to what existed for past Leader groups? It is probably one of our most successful schemes ever for the delivery of services in rural Ireland. Will the Tánaiste go back to the drawing board and finance it properly?

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	247	I thank Deputy Tom Fleming. As he is probably aware, the European Union in its budgetary programme for the next number of years has reduced the amount which countries such as Ireland receive under this heading. This is alongside the various changes happening in farming and the Common Agricultural Policy. I absolutely accept what Deputy Tom Fleming said, that Leader has been an enormously important force in rural Ireland. Even in rural north County Dublin, part of which I represent, it has been a huge force for positive economic and social good. One of the consequences of the change, which will be very positive for rural Ireland, is the new programme being rolled out will be heavily concentrated not simply on what has been done in the past but on creating rural employment and rural enterprise. This will continue. The one area which I understand has been reviewed is that in some Leader programmes, and I stress some Leader programmes, the level of administration costs was very high. In some cases it was more than one quarter of the total cost. As we look forward to the forthcoming budget the Government will look at how to support these rural initiatives and rural enterprise. We have already given a significant indicative allocation to, for instance, the development of an IDA Ireland presence throughout the country in regional enterprise development programmes. As these programmes develop, with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, I am hopeful and confident they will link in with the existing Leader network. I and the Minister of State, Deputy Humphreys, have had the privilege of visiting many of these schemes in various parts of rural Ireland, and what we are doing, which is complimentary and parallel, is to expand community employment. In recent years we have created the Tús scheme, which is very popular particularly in rural Ireland with regard to initiatives on the environment, tourism and beautifying our villages and towns. There has been a reduction in the EU allocation for Ireland under this heading, but the Government has recently committed to a regional development and industrial programme. We now have IDA Ireland officials based in the regions for the first time in a long time, to look for new businesses, new initiatives and foreign direct investment to come to the regions. I hope that as we go forward ConnectIreland will work closely with Leader and with the new arrangements for the Leader companies.
#TomFleming	unknown-#TomFleming-party	unknown-#TomFleming-dob	unknown-#TomFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	248	I welcome the Tánaiste's statement that the Government will look into additional moneys, in particular with a view to the forthcoming budget. This certainly will be very much a corrective action by the Government to address this matter whereby there is a total reduction of approximately €180 million from the funding available from 2009 to 2014.The Leader model adopted by Europe is the most efficient and the best value for money Leader programmes have been conducted in this country, which has been recognised. The European Commission is concerned at the methodology used in the tendering process. Protective notice is being given to staff of current Leader groups, which have been delivering productively. Staff have been mentoring and advising in the community and they have delivered top-class administration and wonderful management. This is throwing out the baby with the bath water. If we dispose of these, we cannot allow it to happen through neglect or careless action by the Government. I am very impressed by, and I welcome, the Tánaiste's reference to the involvement of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland and job creation companies. Leader is an appropriate word because these bodies have been the leaders in delivering jobs in rural Ireland. Since 2009, some 8,698 rural enterprises were funded by the Leader programme, supporting the creation of 4,084 rural jobs in the worst economic recession in the country. From today, I hope we work positively with Leader groups for future development, for the good of our countryside and to keep people in jobs.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	249	I look forward to seeing a closer working relationship between Leader, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland. I was in Kerry recently and, if IDA Ireland were to invest in the Kerry Technology Park beside the institute of technology and facilities for entrepreneurs in IT, from listening to the Tralee chamber of commerce it sees great potential for employment in the south west and specifically in Kerry. Deputy Tom Fleming saw the Enterprise Ireland statistics last week, where new enterprises and smaller enterprises growing into larger enterprises are now exporting significantly. If, as a country, we can harness the energy of the Leader groups and the significant community contribution and participation in the Leader groups and bring it together with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, we can create new enterprises and employment in rural areas. ConnectIreland has been working very successfully since it started a few years ago and almost all of its jobs have been in rural Ireland. This is not just into the bigger towns and cities. The tendering system for the Leader groups was conducted under the auspices of Pobal and it was challenging for people to be involved in it. The main issue is that the European Union has significantly reduced the funding heading. The Government is committed to matching funding but the amount we can commit depends on budgetary issues. It is a priority of the Government to ensure the recovery, as it begins to take hold, goes right into rural Ireland as much as in urban Ireland. In that respect, I welcome the comments of Deputy Tom Fleming and I will give them my support.

There is an increase in the number of people waiting on trolleys in accident and emergency units and the National Treatment Purchase Fund has announced major increases across all categories of people wanting to access appointments. In terms of the health reform Bill, we are not quite sure what reforms are being proposed. It was proposed to abolish HSE and have universal health insurance as the funding model for the health services in the years ahead. Does anyone know the kind of reform proposed? As late as yesterday, the Taoiseach told us there would be no supplementary budget even though the Minister for Health told me two weeks in advance that there would be a supplementary budget this year. Who is in charge of the health reform Bill? Does anyone know what is happening in health any more? Regarding the Bill we spoke about on Leaders' Questions, when will it be brought before the Dáil? When will it be taken on Committee Stage? Will there be an opportunity for pre-legislative scrutiny to check this legislation and carry out broad consultation? Not everyone has welcomed the Bill. Many people have concerns about the proposed Bill and it has not been universally welcomed. The idea that the Government is being applauded for the Bill is not true. These are bully boy tactics and it offends many people. It puts people under huge pressure. The Tánaiste quoted Charles Dickens. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, will go down not as the artful dodger but as the Bill Sykes, a bully boy when it comes to taking money from social welfare payments. 
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	We are not discussing the details of the Bill.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	254	I do not have a date for the health reform Bill but last year the Government gave significant extra resources to the Department of Health and the HSE and this year its budget increased significantly. Already, additional funding has been given to the Minister for Health in respect of specific areas discussed on previous occasions. With regard to debt, the Department of Social Protection has a very well set out and well-established system in respect of the recovery of overpayments, which is protected by legislation in the consolidated Social Welfare Act. This limits the amount of money people can pay out of social welfare income, whether through the household budgeting system run through An Post or for any other purpose. The legislation is a cornerstone of how people on social welfare are protected. The legislation was worked on by the previous Government and since the current Government has been in office. It is a well-established system and I would not like the Deputy to frighten people. It is not in the best traditions of Fianna Fáil. We have a well-established system and the Department of Social Protection officials operate it up and down the country. They have done so for years and will continue to operate it.The supplementary welfare allowance part of the social welfare system absolutely protects people's incomes where there are issues with debt. What I am saying in respect of the legislation is that we want to avoid a situation in which anyone has to get into debt, because I have seen the catastrophic consequences, particularly for working-class families, of allowing debts to build up. People are then faced with debts of hundreds of euro, which are incredibly difficult for them to meet, and a repayment system must be worked out to allow them to repay that over a long period. Without this reform, people with debts would have faced the risk of going to prison. There may be some people who do not like to see the end of that system, but the announcement has been strongly welcomed by various organisations.

When can we expect to see this pickpocket legislation? Not to rehearse all that has gone before, the Tánaiste does a great disservice to those working-class families that are struggling by landing another bill on their mat and strong-arming them in this way. She knows that full well. Just to correct the record of the Dáil, the Tánaiste mentioned poverty levels in west Belfast. Poverty levels are significant there, but actually the constituency of Foyle has the biggest difficulties with poverty in the North. As the Tánaiste knows, that has been an SDLP stronghold for 40 years-----

There are elections today in the North and across Britain. What level of priority does the Tánaiste attach to an early meeting with the incoming British Administration? The last four years have been marked by absolute disengagement by her Government in terms of the North. Once the new British Government is in situ, can we anticipate a debate in this House about developments in the North, the peace process, our obligations and our ambitions for that part of the country? The Tánaiste may be aware that over the last week there has been a series of very serious attacks on Sinn Féin MLAs and candidates. There have been four attacks, including an attack on the home of Martin McGuinness. There have been seven bomb and death threats to MLAs and candidates. The Taoiseach, after being very quiet on this issue, has made his position clear and has condemned absolutely such activities under any circumstances, but particularly in the midst of an electoral campaign. I invite the Tánaiste to put on the record her position on that and, I hope, roundly condemn those who have targeted these individuals in this way.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	Of course I absolutely condemn any attack, anywhere, on any public representative. The fact that people's children and grandchildren were at home when some of these attacks were made, as was the case with the Deputy First Minister, Martin McGuinness, is particularly reprehensible. I do not know whether the attacks were political or whether the attackers had other motives - that is for the police to establish - but it is deeply unpleasant, dangerous and potentially deadly in the context of the North, where so much work has been done across the spectrum to bring peace and to resolve political issues by peaceful means and through parliamentary democracy. Like the Taoiseach, I send my sympathy to the families and individuals affected and I absolutely condemn any attack such as that on any elected representative who is taking part in democracy. Regarding the timing of the legislation to which the Deputy referred, it will be this session, but I do not have an exact timetable. As soon as this is available, it will be published by the Government. On the subject of debt, the Department of Social Protection has very well established mechanisms under legislation to protect people's social welfare payments where they are paying, as many people do on a voluntary basis, using the household budgeting scheme, which we run in conjunction with An Post. This a very popular service and it is of enormous assistance to people in managing bills such as rent and so on if they have a local authority house. We have a long tradition of doing that. It is embedded in legislation and carried out in a very careful and supportive way by thousands of social welfare staff who work very hard to give the best service possible to people who are in difficulty, and in particular, although Deputy McDonald may not agree, to help people who unfortunately have lost their jobs due to the collapse in the economy in returning to work, going back to education or starting their own businesses.

In response to Deputy McDonald's query about when the first meetings with the new British Administration would take place, I do not want to anticipate outcomes, but from everything I read, the results will be very tight, so I do not know when that administration, of whatever political colour, will come into being. However, we have a very close relationship with the British Government, as Britain is our nearest neighbour, and I anticipate that we will be having meetings with the new administration very shortly after it is formed.

We were supposed to have this soon after Christmas. In the last day or two, the Minister has been reported as spearheading the debt collection aspect of Irish Water's campaign to collect unpaid water bills. Will this Bill, as the Minister has led us to believe, include measures to take the money out of people's pockets - out of the wages of the low-paid, who are workers such as those in Dunnes Stores, Tesco and Aldi and hotels up and down the country? Will it facilitate the taking of money out of those people's wages and from the payments of those who are on social welfare and who want to get off social welfare, or has this now been completely separated? What is the issue? What will it include with respect to local authority tenants and tenants in private rental accommodation? Will it give the Government and Irish Water the power to take payment from deposits? When will we see the Bill?

Deputy Stanley asked about debt. What I said is the same as I outlined to his deputy leader, Deputy McDonald, which is that in particular, the Department of Social Protection has a very long record in helping families who have debt issues, especially through the household budgeting scheme with An Post, to meet their debts and to pay their bills on a regular basis. That system has been employed and been working very well in this country for a long period. A total of 1.2 million people have registered with Irish Water.

The first is the criminal justice (victims rights) Bill, to strengthen the rights of victims of crime and their families and to give effect to a proposed EU directive. The second Bill is No. 123, the prisons Bill, the purpose of which is to consolidate and restate prison law in modern terms. I note today that new measures have been introduced to escort high-risk prisoners. In recent times serious attacks have been made on prison officers. In light of that we do need new prison laws and supports.

That is what makes it a little odd that very little is being done about domestic violence and violence against women. Some months ago we were told in the House that moves were afoot to do something about the Government becoming a signatory to the Istanbul Convention. Could the Tánaiste indicate whether there has been any progress in that regard? We have been promised a family courts Bill, which is something we need to put in place urgently. We have also been promised a family law Bill. Could the Tánaiste indicate whether progress has been made in respect of those matters?

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	This perfunctory debate on Europe sums up the approach of the Government and the establishment parties on the question of how we discuss Europe and the future of the EU. The approach of the establishment in this country is to be so-called good Europeans. What it means by that is that it votes for - again and again if necessary - successive neoliberal, militaristic treaties. What it also means is that it does the bidding of the central bankers in Europe and of the establishment within Germany by stabbing the Greek people in the back by saying no write-off is possible for them, while at the same time overseeing write-offs for the rich in this country. What it further means is going along with the process of the increasingly authoritarian anti-democratic, neoliberal nature of the European Union with no real discussion in this country, apart from at moments of referendums when we are hit over the head with massive propaganda about how we have to be good Europeans. Let us deal with the reality. In 2012, Mario Draghi accurately said that the "European social model has already gone." The head of the ECB was right then. It goes back further than that in the sense that the dream of a social Europe never actually existed. What we always had was a big business project from the top, which as a result of major struggles in particular on the Continent, was forced to give important concessions. But now, in the age of neoliberalism, all of the illusions of a social Europe have been swept away. We have an openly authoritarian neoliberal, aggressive and imperialistic Europe. The horror of the deaths of thousands of migrants in the Mediterranean is the face of this European project. For all its crocodile tears, the EU cannot wash its hands of that. It bears responsibility on a number of different levels. It bears responsibility for the humanitarian crisis from which people are fleeing in Libya, Syria and elsewhere in North Africa and the Middle East where its interventions for its own interests have played a role in developing these crises. The EU also bears a responsibility for its policy of "fortress Europe" whereby it refuses legal access to those fleeing crises. As a result of the crocodile tears there is talk of allowing 5,000 refugees into Europe, whereas last year more than 200,000 people attempted to make the crossing in desperation. The EU forces people into the hands of the criminal people smugglers who have no interest in their lives and who treat them as commodities. The EU bears responsibility more directly because of the cut in the Mare Nostrum programme, which is responsible for the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of migrants. It is a cut to save money but it is also a cut to move away from a vision of saving lives towards the securitisation and militarisation of European borders. Externally, one has the horrific and murderous approach by the European Union to keep the consequences of its policies around the world away from European shores. Internally, the same reality is increasingly evident. In particular, it is manifest in the treatment of the Greek people and their government. The democratic mandate of the Syriza-led government has been thoroughly trampled upon by the mostly unelected European authorities. Blackmail has been threatened by the European Central Bank. The European Commission has demanded total defeat and retreat by the government and the European Council, composed of governments like that in Ireland, has said there is no possible deal for the Greek people. The EU is determined to prevent any political contagion of the status quo or to allow the idea that one can do things differently or break from the mantra that there is no alternative to austerity. There are profound lessons for the left in how to challenge the Europe of the millionaires and billionaires. There are no mechanisms to change the existing situation in Europe incrementally in a social or progressive direction. Any Government which breaks with the austerity consensus is then faced with an onslaught of attacks and a denial of their democratic mandate. We therefore need governments willing to say "No, we are not going to pay debt of the bankers and bondholders" and to engage in a strategy, if necessary, of unilateral debt repudiation. We need governments willing to break with the logic of austerity and capitalism, which are written down within the rules governing the euro and the EU. We also need governments to stand up and refuse to be blackmailed by the threat of bringing down the banking system and forcing countries outside of the euro to respond through radical socialist measures, such as capital controls, public ownership of key sources of wealth and planning in the interests of people.In that way we will lay the basis for a different, humane, democratic and socialist Europe operating in the interests of the millions and no longer for the millionaires.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	291	As Vice Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, I am delighted to speak on challenges facing the European Union. The European Union is a unique organisation which transcends national boundaries and pools sovereignty from the 28 member states. The fact that it is unique and that no other organisations follow the path that the Union has taken means that the EU faces a number of challenges. One of the main challenges is interaction with people of the various member states. At times, the European Union is viewed as something outside of this country which does not directly impact on us. The reality, however, is that the European Union and its institutions and laws have an impact on Irish people on a daily basis. Regulations and directives govern a myriad of issues ranging from social and health to economic and financial matters. The impact is often not felt, primarily because some of the laws, such as safety regulations, are common sense. One cannot imagine a time without them. However, on other occasions, the impact of the EU, particularly specific EU laws, is keenly felt and has an enormous impact on life. In my constituency of Galway West, for example, there is news today of the publication of the preferred route for a Galway bypass. We were at this stage 14 or 15 years ago, but because of European designations and court challenges to the High Court, the Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice the process was delayed. That has had a direct and lasting impact on the process to alleviate traffic in Galway. It is one area where the EU has had an impact and where it is often viewed in a less than positive light. It is a case of whether habitat or human beings - the people of Galway - are more important. The debate has been ongoing in Galway for a number of years. Another challenge facing the EU and related to the interaction of the Union with the citizens of the member states is the role of national parliaments. The Lisbon treaty envisaged a much greater role for national parliaments in the workings of the Union, including in the legislative process. I am not convinced that the national parliaments are playing the role that was envisaged. There is such a plethora of legislation, directives, regulations and rules from Europe that scrutiny by national parliamentarians presents a major challenge. In the aftermath of the referendum on the Seanad, I proposed that the Seanad adopt a European approach. I believe the Seanad could play a valuable role in scrutinising legislation from Europe, not just when the legislation is at an advanced stage in the process but from the start and at each stage. As a small member state, this would be significant to ensure our voice is heard. Recently, I participated in a European delegation to the UK to discuss the implications of the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. I wish all the candidates the best of luck in the UK elections taking place today. It will be a very important decision for the future of this country. Obviously, we share a common land border with the UK via Northern Ireland and we conduct a huge amount of trade with the UK, as it does with us. There would be huge implications if it decided to withdraw from the EU. It would have a huge impact. We met with a variety of groups during our visit, including Irish people, Irish companies involved in trade there, emigrant groups, representatives of State agencies such as Bord Bia, the ambassador, government and opposition Members of Parliament. There were wide and varied discussions, and we were all conscious of the special relationship between Ireland and the UK and the impact of a possible withdrawal by the UK from the EU. We will not know until the new British Government is formed whether it is likely that a referendum will take place. We were careful not to suggest how anybody might vote in such a referendum, but to convey to people that we have a stake in the result of that referendum. I believe we got our point across and they acknowledged the strong relationship with and the strong role this country has in respect of the UK. The other primary challenge at present is the migrants sailing from the coast of Libya to Italy. At the meeting of the European affairs committee we expressed our appreciation to the Italian ambassador for the role Italy has played in dealing with this challenge. It is beholden on every country to take its fair share of migrants arising from this crisis. No single country can handle it. A number of countries have stepped up to the plate, but many others have not. All countries have a responsibility to do something. This is a crisis. One cannot fault people who wish to come to Europe to improve their lives and to take whatever chances they might think they have. Nobody would blame them for that. Irish people have a strong reputation for emigrating and seeking to improve their lives as well. I do not blame anybody, but we must ensure that every country does its fair share.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	Sinn Féin is very critical of the democratic deficit at the heart of the European Union and of the Government's compliant attitude to the EU elites. We have long argued for a social Europe based on equality and the rights of all EU citizens. However, I will concentrate my remarks today on one of a range of challenges facing the EU, which is that if the outgoing British Prime Minister, Mr. David Cameron, wins the British general election he has pledged that he will hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU by 2017. This is a paranoid political reaction to the perceived electoral threat of the eurosceptic United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP. It is also further evidence that the political considerations of British political parties are primarily about England and English issues. The stark reality of an EU referendum is that it could take the North out of the European Union. The referendum will allow the views of English voters to dictate the future relationships of the North, and therefore of this island, with the European Union. It also further underlines the folly of the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, and Ulster Unionist Party, UUP, in supporting the Tories. It is selfish, insular politics in action, with implications for Ireland as a whole. It would reinforce the partition of this island. The partition of this island is illegitimate, immoral, an intrusion in our affairs and economically disruptive. If Mr. Cameron is re-elected and has his way, this disruptive Border would be reinforced by an international frontier with passport checkpoints and customs controls. All of the work in recent years on cross-Border co-operation and the work with everybody across the island to our mutual advantage would be set to naught. This highlights the fact that the real threat to the economy in the North comes from Britain, and that the real threat to the island economy comes from partition. The exit from the EU of part of this island will hinder free movement and severely disrupt the daily lives of people, particularly of people living in the Border counties on both sides of the Border. Irish workers, farmers and local enterprises already pay, and will continue to pay, the human, social and economic price of partition. There will be no single farm payment, rural development fund, Structural Funds or PEACE funding. Almost 1 million citizens living in Border counties pay the price for all of this daily. They do so through roaming charges, the cost of using two currencies and additional bank charges, and barriers to accessing the nearest public services, particularly health services, social housing and education. These are the people who will face increased challenges which are not of their choice. Of course, partition has resulted in ongoing violence in every decade since it was imposed on our people. Island-wide trade, which currently generates £3 billion, will be severely disrupted. The Tory proposal for a referendum, without a separate binding vote in the North, denies people in the North the power to make decisions about their lives. It is the people of this island who should decide the economic, social and political future of Ireland. That includes the right to a separate and binding referendum in the North on European Union membership. The Taoiseach has spoken about this issue on a number of occasions in Britain and, most recently, in Belfast. I ask the Government to focus its mind on this.It may be that some Unionists may support David Cameron's proposition but the fact is the economies of Ireland, North and South, are interlinked and interdependent. Many ordinary Unionists I met particularly from the rural areas of the Six Counties and the farming community are conscious of the interdependency and interlinking of an island economy.  It is time to build and strengthen the economy, not to split it up or divide it. It goes without saying that working together our economic output would be stronger. Splintering merely weakens the economy, undermines public services and undermines the spirit of citizens. While Sinn Féin is critical of the European Union's deficit, the European Union has the potential to provide a bridge towards the greater integration of Ireland, North and South, towards a single economic and political unit. It is the responsibility of the Government to actively promote and pursue this objective and there is a constitutional imperative on the Government to do so. It is past time that the European Parliament deal with Ireland as one, and not two, systems. The potential for the North to positively reshape our relationship with the European Union in the context of a limited and narrow British vote on EU membership should not be overlooked. Parties with no democratic mandate in any part of this island cannot be allowed by the Government the power to dictate the political or economic future of this country.  Political and economic decision making powers must be increasingly transferred from London to Belfast. As I said earlier, all citizens in the North should have the right to express their will through a separate legally binding vote on European Union membership. That is the only position which makes any sense whatsoever. It is a position which the Taoiseach needs to support and if in the future - we will know this within the coming days or weeks - a referendum is to be organised by an incoming British Government, he needs to assertively pursue with his British counterpart the need and the right for a separate and legally binding referendum for citizens in the North of Ireland on this issue. I, therefore, call on the Taoiseach to seek an urgent meeting with the new British Government to pursue this matter.
#PaulConnaughtonJnr	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	293	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to this debate on the challenges facing the European Union. From the outset it is important to state that I am supportive of what membership of the European Union has achieved for us over many years and its potential into the future. However, that is not to say it works perfectly for everyone all the time. It is important on a rolling basis that member states have a conversation as to where they can seek to make improvements where challenges exist and how it is important to move it on from there. Having been a county councillor and a backbench Deputy and having spent a good deal of time in the constituency, I have heard many conversations on the European Union. At times the European Union is blamed for things it had nothing to do with whatsoever. It is an easy scapegoat. There are other times when one understands that there are some concerns. One basic example, and something that is parochial to Galway and Roscommon, is turf cutting. The directive was signed by the European Union many years ago. The European Union gets the blame for this but it approached the issue from an environmental perspective. While I would wish for a greater degree of flexibility on how to solve the problem, it was created in Ireland by Department officials who did not do their job correctly 13 or 14 years ago. When this conversation comes up, often it is the European Union that is blamed. While it has a part to play in it, that is simply not the case.  Given that some 75% of our legislation comes from the European Union the question is how we impose, understand and implement directives. Nothing seems to drive people crazy like directives. For some reason, to the very letter of the law as stated, we implement them without proper consultation with the people on the ground whom they will affect most. Let us take CAP reform, from which Ireland has done very well, as an example. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Taoiseach did a great job negotiating it. One of the measures involved in it was a directive from the European Union that all farmers had to have their details, names and addresses and the amounts they receive from the European Union, printed and published. That is completely and utterly bonkers. There is already enough accountability and traceability in the system. Why do we have to publish every farmer's details? This is where the common sense element has been lost. While it might appear good in Brussels, it certainly does not work well on the ground. How much consultation took place before that measure was introduced? This is not an issue or a concern with accountability or transparency. That has nothing to do with it, and nobody is trying to hide anything. The relevant Department knows exactly what is coming in and going out of the country and what is going to farmers and yet we have to take this extra step. From the point of view of a rural security measure, it is completely over the top. This is one of the reasons people may become a bit more eurosceptic because they think there is no relationship whatsoever with the decisions it takes and what is implemented on the ground. If we were to do nothing else in the coming period, I suggest that directives be examined as to how they will work in practice.  Another major issue we are facing is designations of land, such as SPAs, NHAs and SACs, all over the country. All of these designations were introduced for environmental reasons. There is nothing whatsoever wrong with that. They were introduced at a time when the State had a great deal more money and the farming community bought into them. The European Union brought in the directives stating this is what it wanted. We have now entered a situation where the directives still stand on farmers' land but the money has run out. It is not acceptable for anybody, whether the European Union or the Government, to take over a person's land, promise him or her compensation for X number of years, and then withdraw the compensation, following which the value of the land is worthless to many of these people. This is what leads to much friction. There is one other area on which I wish to concentrate, as raised by Deputy Seán Kyne, and this is the major humanitarian issue off the coast of Italy where people are trying to escape terrible situations for a better life. Our reaction in the European Union was slow but it has happened. It is incumbent on the entire Union to try to help solve this problem. However, there is a much longer term problem here also. Political stability in these countries is of paramount importance and is the reason people are leaving. We may be able to solve the problem in the short term for a few weeks but the European Union has to show some direction in helping to improve political stability in these areas. That means dealing with our trading partners or the United States and other countries that caused the political instability in the first place. While it might become a European Union problem to help solve it at a humanitarian level, there is a much longer-term issue that has not been concentrated on half enough. Why was the political instability there in the first place? Who got involved at all the wrong levels, whether it was the US or any other country? We have to be very strong and firm on the basis that the reason this is happening is because of their involvement. There is no point in coming back here in five or ten years' time when the crisis blows up again and some other dictator has taken over and is destroying half of Africa. We can ask ourselves what we did to solve the problem in the first place. It is one thing to solve the problem in the next few weeks but if we are serious as a European Union, the one thing we have to do is get involved in the political side of things. I am not talking about going to war. Who are the vested interests who are getting involved in these countries, causing the political instability that is now causing the current situation?  There is a bright future for Ireland in the European Union. The biggest challenge is happening today in Britain with the election and nobody knows what the result will be. If the Conservatives get back in to government, there will certainly be an in-out referendum in Britain, the outcome of this would be very important to us. We will then have to have that conversation on the basis of the facts. It is my firm belief that we are better off within the European Union and I hope Britain will remain in there. Until that time comes, it is important that we set out clearly the pros and cons of what that will mean. The biggest challenge that faces us is happening today, the outcome of which will find out at the weekend.

I note the comments by two Deputies, Deputy Paul Murphy and Deputy Shane Ross, who started by describing the debate as a waste of time and yet contributed.Everybody else who contributed did so in a very productive fashion. Europe Day is an opportunity to consider in a small way the importance of the EU to the Irish people and our importance to, and the role we play in, the EU. Given the important role the Union plays in all our lives every day should, to an extent, be Europe Day. Many issues were raised and I did not have the opportunity in my opening remarks to touch on all the areas where the EU is important to us. Many speakers referred to the United Kingdom. There is no question but that a British departure from the EU would have serious and potentially adverse consequences for the country. That is why the Government has been monitoring developments in the EU-UK relationship extremely carefully. The Department of the Taoiseach has been co-ordinating interdepartmental efforts to ensure Ireland is best prepared for any situation that could arise. Given that polling is going on in the UK today, we will not have long to wait to see the likely shape of the new UK Government. It was decided to create a new division within the Department, which is up and running. Several other Departments are conducting detailed research in their areas of competence. The Department of Finance, for example, has commissioned a report on the macroeconomic links between the UK and Ireland in the context of our EU membership. Our ambassador in London and his team are also actively engaged on this issue.  I did not speak about the TTIP negotiations in my opening remarks. It is very important to re-state that TTIP is not, is not intended to be, and will not be, a race to the bottom in regulatory standards. It will not automatically overrule, repeal or amend EU laws and regulations and, consequently, Irish laws and regulations. Such laws as relate to genetically modified organisms, GMOs, for example, protecting the environment, animal welfare and workers’ rights and conditions are not part of the negotiations. Legitimate concerns have, however, been raised by civil society in Ireland and elsewhere in Europe about certain elements of the TTIP talks. It is important that we listen, which we are doing, to these concerns and learn from international best practice. On contentious issues mentioned today, such as investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, TTIP presents a prime opportunity to devise novel and mutually acceptable procedures consistent with our legal system and with relevant safeguards to prevent abusive cases. We have to be balanced in how we consider the TTIP negotiations. We have many companies operating in the rest of the world. As many American people work for Irish companies in the US as Irish people work for US companies here. That is an interesting statistic to remind people of. We have to consider TTIP from both sides of that equation. We are resolute in our belief that it will provide significant benefits to the Irish people and economy and to the EU.  I thank Deputies for their contributions. I have not had time to cover all their remarks. It was an excellent debate and as members of the Opposition pointed out, continuous excellent work is being conducted by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, under the chairmanship of Deputy Hannigan.

These offences, as we all know, are public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. I and my party broadly support this Bill but we have some concerns about it. I am conscious that the Government is implementing a European directive but there several points contained within the Bill that we are concerned about and are seeking clarification or reassurance from the Minister on. Why has it taken the Government so long to transpose this? It seems highly unusual that the transposition of something like this would take such a long time. Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Murphy, can explain this to the House or ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to respond on Committee Stage or later. Our main concern regarding this Bill is the definition of terrorism as it is formulated in the Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA. It is a very broad definition which could include virtually every act that has some element of organisation or planning. This seems unworkable and something we would be quite concerned about. By reiterating the framework decision definition, the Bill legitimately raises the question whether this instrument has a built-in function creep in order not only to combat terrorism, but to extend the definition in such a manner as to cover most public order situations and more common criminal acts as they apply under national law. While there is a definite need for cross-border co-operation in this area, even international co-operation, criminal sanctions and definitions should be solely the realm of the member state. We do not want to hand over this type of power to Europe. Such issues are for member states alone to deal with. We do not want to see the EU become involved in this area of our citizens’ lives. We would like to see greater checks and balances contained within the Bill to ensure there is no such function creep in this area. To deal with the threat from the dark net, it is not all bad. There are human rights activists and journalists in some countries who need to protect themselves from very dangerous regimes and need something that could not be monitored in order for them to communicate and tell the stories of their communities. It can be a benign force. However, it has also been used by very dangerous criminals and issues such as child abuse are a real concern. I have raised with the Minister the poor resourcing of the Garda computer crime investigation unit's information technology equipment and its capacity to conduct forensic examination. We need to ensure that An Garda Síochána is resourced and has the most up to date equipment possible to combat this threat. We need to make sure that people engaged in serious criminality, organised criminal gangs and paedophile rings, who pose a threat to our communities, have nowhere to hide and there is nothing in the Internet they can use as some kind of haven for their heinous activities. To combat that we need to resource An Garda Síochána properly.The milestone Garda Inspectorate reports into the investigation of crime, which were carried out over three years, contained very serious criticism of the IT equipment within An Garda Síochána so I wanted to avail of this opportunity to draw attention to that as a real challenge. I want to briefly mention another concern, namely, data protection issues. Any data collected under this legislation should have to comply with standards in this State and not those of any other member state. We do not want to see a situation where data shared in good faith leaves the hands of another member state and is no longer under the standard at which it left Ireland. We simply cannot afford to see an abuse of power by governments in this area. The clearest example of this in recent years was the case of Frank McBrearty from my county of Donegal. He tried to enter the US with his family and was refused entry by the US authorities because according to US immigration records, he had a conviction for assault despite the fact that the conviction had been overturned and he was found to be innocent of the charges levelled against him. This case raises very serious concerns and questions about how data on individuals is retained in this State and exchanged with agencies from other jurisdictions. This is something we will seek to strengthen on Committee Stage of this Bill. The challenge with all these measures in the area of justice and protecting our citizens from real threats is that we must strike a balance between a state's responsibility for security with civil liberties. We want to ensure that any of the powers being introduced do not impinge on civil liberties and are not used to spy on law-abiding citizens who challenge the Government and foreign policies. We know in this House that there is grave concern about the use of Shannon Airport by the US military in the theatre of war in Iraq, a war that was not sanctioned by the UN. We have concerns about the tolerance of the Israeli regime and how it essentially imprisoned millions of Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank and keeps stealing land. An appalling government has been formed there and its approach to settlements is very worrying. There are many regimes we tolerate or co-operate with under the guise of the EU which are a concern for the Irish people. We need to ensure that we have a balanced approach and that we protect our citizens from real threats. All of us are appalled by the development of Islamic State and reject utterly that creed which is an insult to the honourable people who follow the Muslim faith in Ireland and across the world. It is an honourable faith and I have huge respect for many people who adhere to the Islamic faith. We need to get that balance right in terms of the civil rights and liberties of our citizens and those across the EU versus a state's need for security mechanisms.  I will wrap up by mentioning the need for consistency. If we tolerate the Israeli regime and what it has done in Palestine and what is happening in Egypt, we send out a signal to young Muslims in the Middle East. In Egypt, the former government has been locked up and sentenced to death and an Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa, is locked up there. When we tolerate these regimes and co-operate with them, we send a message to young people that radicalises them and allows them to fall into the hands of the very organisations we seek to protect our citizens from. We need consistency in foreign policy and courage from our Government. One step we can take very soon is to recognise the state of Palestine. The two Houses of the Oireachtas have asked for this to happen and our Government needs to ensure it happens. If we are consistent in our approach to human rights internationally and if we live up to some of the great names who have come before us - Irish leaders who have advocated for human rights across the globe - we are in a strong position to confront the terrorist threat and extremists out there. That is my plea.

I welcome the debate because it is an opportunity to look in detail at the legislation and what is going on in the modern world. In recent weeks, we have seen significant levels of violence in Ireland and internationally. We have seen the kidnapping of children, women and children being killed in different conflicts and sectarianism across Europe and Africa and even in our own country. One hears a lot about terrorism in the debate but when one is talking about violence, one must also look at the impact of state violence, which is often ignored. The Bill is designed to give effect to European law on terrorism. It creates three new offences - public provocation to commit a terrorist offence, recruitment for terrorism and training for terrorism. We must all strongly oppose indiscriminate and sectarian violence, regardless of whether it happens in the Middle East or Africa and whether it involves the killing of Christians, Muslims or other innocent people. We must face up to the reality that this cannot be tolerated in any society. We as legislators and Members of the Oireachtas must constantly harp on about this issue. There is no point in staying silent, sitting on the fence and being selective in our opposition to violence.  Recently, we have seen horrific attacks on members of Sinn Féin and the murder of Gerard Davison in Belfast and yet the silence in this House and in broader society has been deafening, which is not acceptable. These double standards should always be challenged. It is not acceptable in any democratic society for people to be shot or blown up or for their families to be attacked or for people to be shot down on their way to work. It is not an option to stay silent. It is very important that we say this because I found the silence in the past 24 hours to be deafening. Yesterday, the Taoiseach had to be asked to condemn the violence.  When I talk about violence, I go right across the spectrum. I am talking about sectarian violence and the kidnapping of young girls. In respect of state terrorism, one cannot have double standards if one wants to convince people internationally that peaceful and democratic politics are the way forward. The Dublin-Monaghan bombings and the Miami show band massacre are examples in our recent history. There was considerable silence about these events because there were serious concerns about the role of the state in these acts. We asked the question and the Dáil passed a motion relating to the Dublin-Monaghan bombings and yet we have seen no real action.  There was a strong state dimension to the Dublin bombings in 1972. I was a member of the joint Oireachtas committee which dealt with these bombings. One aspect that arose during our work was the urgent need for a Garda liaison officer to work closely with the families. The families of the victims of the 1974 bombings in Dublin got a Garda liaison officer but the families of the victims of the 1972 bombings did not.I ask that the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, bring that message back to the Minister. On the issue of terrorism, international terrorism and who is a terrorist and so on, people find it nauseating that some states engage in violence while at the same time lecturing fringe groups involved in terrorist activities. Over the past 15 years I have many times raised the issue of Cuba and the famous case of the Miami Five, who thankfully were released. I welcome recent developments between President Obama, Raúl Castro and the Pope in relation to building dialogue and a peace process. Over the past 15 years many people here ignored the plight of the Miami Five, five Cubans who were trying to stop Miami-based terrorist groups from carrying out violent acts against the people of Cuba. They were found guilty of charges ranging from murder to espionage by a court in Miami which relied on the evidence of convicted terrorists. All were innocent of the charges brought against them. Extensive intimidation of jurors by these same terrorists was a feature of the trial, following which the Miami Five were imprisoned. Many of us in this House were involved in the release of the Miami Five, whose imprisonment was a blatant miscarriage of justice. In terms of the history of Cuba in these types of situations, the campaign was dedicated to the memory of the 3,478 Cubans killed and the 2,099 maimed at the hands of US based terrorists since 1959. These are issues we have to face up to as well. States cannot be allowed to do one thing while preaching another. I commend Dr. David Hickey on his magnificent work in the building of a relationship with Cuba and also Che Guevara's daughter who has done a great deal of work with Beaumont Hospital, which is in my constituency. It is important we acknowledge that many people are now working together to build bridges. There is significant potential to further develop this relationship, including in the context of small business and jobs. On the Bill, section 5 provides for the insertion into the principal Act of a new section 4B which provides:For the purposes of this Part, recruitment for terrorism means—(a) the intentional recruitment of another person—(i) to commit, or participate in the commission of, a terrorist activity,...We will need to monitor the impact of this legislation. It is important to make that point. In debating the issue of terrorism and violence, it should not be forgotten that there have been 12 gangland deaths in this city over the past 12 months in respect of which there have been no prosecutions. We also have a problem in Ireland in terms of violent acts. The Bill provides that a person convicted of this offence is liable on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for up to ten years.  Section 6 inserts a new section 4C which states:For the purposes of this Part, training for terrorism means intentionally providing instruction or training in the skills of—(a) making or using, for the purpose of committing, or contributing to the commission of, a terrorist activity—(i) firearms or explosives,(ii) nuclear material,...The issue of Shannon was mentioned earlier by some of my colleagues. It is not acceptable that peaceful demonstrators should be brought before the courts for highlighting a State's involvement in violence. This is an issue on which we should all also speak out. The issue of conflict and the Palestinians was mentioned. If the Palestine conflict ended, the result would be the disappearance from this earth of a lot of violence.  Returning to the definition of terrorism, earlier I asked whether the definition in the Bill is too broad. My concern is in relation to public order issues and my advice to the Minister and Government is that they should not go over the top in this regard. They should also be careful about handing over powers in this regard to the EU and other authorities. I do not support violence or violent acts but I do support civil disobedience. That is the way forward because it creates a healthier society. According to the latest EU statistics on terrorism, seven people died as a result of terrorist attacks in the EU; 152 terrorist attacks were carried out in EU member states; and 535 individuals were arrested in the EU in relation to terrorism-related offences and court proceedings in respect of terrorism charges concluded in relation to 313 individuals. Earlier I referred to the violent attacks being carried out on our own doorstep. We must remain conscious of what is going on in our own country. We must be very vigilant about defending and protecting the peace process and those who took major risks in that regard.  Overall, I welcome the Bill and this debate which provides us with an opportunity to see where we have reached. Again, I do not support violence but I do support the protection of civil liberties and the right of people to participate in peaceful and democratic protest.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	299	With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, it is shameful that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, is not in the House to listen to the opening contributions to the debate on this important legislation. I am particularly concerned that despite the fact that the Minister had 30 minutes to deliver her opening speech on this issue yesterday, she chose to speak for only 15 minutes and did not bother to read the complete script provided to her into the record. To me, this indicates the cavalier attitude of this Government to critically important issues of civil liberties. The Minister in her opening remarks attempted to perpetuate the idea that repression can beat terrorism. Have we really learned nothing? Repression does not stop terrorism; it spawns terrorism and the facts prove it. The Minister spoke last night about the rise of ISIS and referred to the fact that 80% of European foreign fighters are engaged in activity with ISIS. From where did ISIS come? Obviously, it arose out of the illegal invasion of Iraq and the decimation of the population there. Another breeding ground for ISIS is the break-up of Libya and interference in the civil war in Syria and so on. This is the roots of terrorism. Unless these issues are addressed, we will never have world peace. The Minister referred last night to Turkey being a main route into the combat areas of Syria and Iraq. Why are these combat areas? It is because the West invaded and destabilised them for their own interests. We know from provisions in earlier legislation in this area, which are added to through this Bill, that civil liberties and big brother watching us is not in any way making the world a safer place, rather it is probably a more dangerous place. The Minister also spoke of those who seek to destroy our democratic society. Of what democratic society was she speaking? Is it the one in which people vote for a Government which prior to an election promises to do one thing and then does another when it gets into office? Is it an EU democracy that allows the people of Greece to vote for a different government and then seeks to blackmail that government into not fulfilling its election promises or is it the democracy that the Fianna Fáil Party wants to protect? Last night, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson talked about concern for the safety of Irish citizens from returning radicalised combatants. This is the same Fianna Fáil Party that facilitated the active use of Shannon Airport by the US military. It is beyond a joke at this stage.  This Bill transposes an EU Council Directive into Irish law and, as stated by other speakers, introduces three new offences, including provocation, recruitment and training for terrorism. It also amends the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 while retaining all of the blithe and widely sweeping definitions of terrorism contained in the original Act, which includes phrases such as "unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing an act", with no definition whatsoever of what makes this compulsion undue. We could have acts that might seriously destabilise the political or economic structures of the State, but no attempts to come to grips with how we define such destabilisation, which begs the question of whether protest or civil disobedience are acts that might fall under the definition of destabilising the State. Obviously, the response of Government will be that we should not worry about that but, of course, we should worry about it. There is some hypocrisy in relation to the introduction by way of this Bill of further measures to combat terrorism when on a daily basis we facilitate terrorism at Shannon. The Government has been happily complicit in US wars of imperial aggression throughout the past decade, many of which wars were illegal.I refer to the definitions in the 2005 Act. That Act refers to seriously intimidating populations; unduly compelling governments to perform acts; and wars which have seriously destabilised and destroyed the fundamental political, constitutional, economic and social structure of a variety of states. Does this not meet the criteria of the actions of the US military in parts of the globe or the actions of NATO? It fits perfectly with the definition of terrorist activity in the original Act but, of course, we are not really talking about that now because we have one law for one type of terrorist and another rule for all the other types of terrorist. This is not good enough. Large and imperial states have a taken for granted monopoly to engage in violent military activity, regardless of its extra legality. In fact, they are even encouraged to do so, which is crazy. That repression is maintained in the Bill. One of the most troubling aspects of the Bill is the new offence of public provocation to commit a terrorist offence. The potential for abuse of this is absolutely rampant, given that it encourages not just directly encouraging the commission of a terrorist act but indirectly encouraging it. For example, someone might say: "I am sorry about that; I committed that act because I read something somewhere where I thought somebody meant I should do it." Is this what we are talking about? Could saying publicly that Palestinians, Iraqis and Afghans have the right to resist occupation and aggression through armed struggle be construed as public provocation? Could a person who targets by direct action against corporations, government policies and inter-government organisations, like the EU, fall under the remit of this new Bill and this new definition of terrorism? This is so broad and such an invasion of our public and civil liberties. It even envisages that a charge of public provocation could be brought even when no terrorist offence was committed. What does this mean for free speech? Are we really putting into law something that says a person could be prosecuted for an offence that does not even take place? This shows how ludicrous and broad this legislation is. I have no doubt the Government will tell us not to worry about it and that this does not cover civil disobedience or such like. The Government may argue that if somebody sits down in front of a Minister's car in a housing estate in Tallaght, that could not possibly come under the definition of provocation. I remind the Minister of State that one of the Government's backbenchers thought the activities of anti-water charges protesters were akin to those of ISIS. If this Bill is about ISIS, what is to say it cannot be used against Irish citizens? We have to look at the use of anti-provocation laws internationally - for example, the case of Eynulla Fatullayev from Azerbaijan who was convicted of incitement to terrorism in 2007 and was given a sentence of eight and a half years for writing an article about his country's support of US policies in Iran. Is this the direction we are taking? Even if not, it creates a chilling effect whereby people will self-censor. Assuring people that this is not the case will not stop somebody from thinking that he or she does not wish to be the first to be prosecuted under this legislation. Therefore, it will stifle dissent and will stifle opposition and alternative opinion. I think it is a radically disproportionate response to what is an over-stated terrorist threat. I refer to the European Union terrorism situation and trend report in 2014. In 2013 there were no terrorist attacks in Ireland. How many religiously inspired terrorist attacks occurred in the EU in 2013? There were none. The vast majority of them were by separatist groups and took place in France and Spain and the House passing this legislation would have no impact on such events. It is a ludicrous response to a situation which has been caused by western interference in the first place. We have to be clear and strong on these matters. International human rights law requires that any interference with a human right has to be necessary and proportionate. Interference with freedom of expression will be deemed to be necessary only if it fulfils a pressing social need. Where is the pressing social need in this situation? Under the European Convention on Human Rights, states have a certain margin within which to decide whether to curb freedom of expression through legislating to prohibit speech which seeks to incite or provoke terrorist acts. This is necessary according to circumstances and laws of each country. I do not think there is any pressing need. The so-called threat of Islamic terrorism has been exploited across the EU and internationally in order to curtail freedom, to abuse human rights, to expand the scope of state security, to increase surveillance on citizens, to militarise everyday life and to restrict freedom of movement. It certainly has not made the world a safer place because the world is more unstable now than ever because of interference and destabilisation and not because of insufficient repressive legislation.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	300	In January, in the wake of the Paris attacks, the Taoiseach stated in the House that: "The comprehensive international approach that is needed should tackle the underlying causes, prevent radicalisation, share information more effectively, deter and disrupt terrorist travel and bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice." Before we continue a conversation about terrorism, we need to consider the definition of "terrorist activity" as set out in the principal Act. A terrorist activity is defined as an offence that is committed with the intention of:(i) seriously intimidating a population,(ii) unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing an act, or (iii) seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a state or an international organisation;In March, a report authored by the Physicians for Social Responsibility, Physicians for Global Survival and the Nobel Prize-winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War concluded that in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan alone, the US-led war on terror has directly and indirectly killed, at the most conservative estimate, a possible 1.3 million people since 2001. They note that the total number of deaths in the three countries is probably in excess of 2 million. The US and its coalition of the willing have led a war that is killing people at a rate that is encroaching on some of the greatest horrors of the 20th century, and they show no signs of slowing down the carnage. This Government refuses to see this action and its complicity in it for what it is - terrorism, plain and simple. We are participants in the largest terrorist organisation on earth. Ireland, by allowing munitions, military aircraft and almost 2.5 million troops through Shannon, is complicit in this mass slaughter of so many innocent people. We have supported a regime that seriously intimidates populations by flying drones over their heads and that bombs their villages, infrastructure, schools, hospitals, farms, roads, weddings and lives to dust. We support and instigate the radicalisation of those who survive the carnage, those who can no longer tolerate their humiliation, pain, anger and sorrow. The Taoiseach says we have to deter and disrupt terrorist travel and yet the army that is responsible for the deaths of so many people and the destruction and destabilisation of vast swathes of the Middle East, travels freely and unchecked though our borders. The Minister of State refers to bringing the perpetrators of terrorism to justice. However, when we name the US President for what he is, which is a war criminal, the Government does not want to know. The man is ordering the execution, without trial, of thousands of people, including hundreds of children, and yet he faces no consequences nor censure. In theory, the wording of the Bill is sound and sections of it could possibly be supported if the intentions of its authors were not dripping with hypocrisy. The crimes of Islamic State are horrific and it should be brought to justice but the same goes for the terrorist activities of Assad, Putin, Netanyahu, the US Administration and its allies. The same goes for Irish Government personnel who have facilitated the murder of innocent civilians by allowing Shannon Airport to be used as a forward military base for the US war machine. The Saudis are as fond of beheading people as ISIS, while pouring money and arms into terrorist organisations. The Irish Government does not seem to have any problem with them. This week, the Saudi Arabia-led coalition has been condemned by Human Rights Watch for dropping banned cluster bombs manufactured and supplied by the US on civilian areas in Yemen. Ireland signed and ratified this treaty in December 2008. We are widely considered to have been a driving force in the advancement of the treaty and we are held up as an example of international best practice in our implementation of the treaty. Only two weeks ago, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade reaffirmed his commitment to the implementation of the Convention on Cluster Munitions and the Arms Trade Treaty.He went on to state: "The commitment of Ireland to the promotion and protection of human rights is a foreign policy priority for the Government." This stance is perplexing in light of the fact that the Government has repeatedly refused to bring up human rights concerns with Saudi or US officials when it has had the opportunity. This situation simply serves to underscore the poverty of the Government's foundation when it speaks about human rights. What Administration could be taken seriously when its members pat themselves on the back for having legislation that protects human rights, such as the cluster bomb munitions treaty or the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, while the National Pensions Reserve Fund has investments in a number of companies that manufacture nuclear weapons, including Boeing, Honeywell International, Jacobs Engineering, Larsen & Toubro, Rolls-Royce, Safran, Thales, Rockwell Collins, Airbus, Fluor, Leidos, ThyssenKrupp and Babcock and Wilcox, to which AIB provided a four-year revolving credit package valued at $700 million in 2010? I wish the bank had been as good to me. The Taoiseach once berated Bertie Ahern for not raising the issue of India's refusal to sign the nuclear non-proliferation treaty on a trade mission. Now, the State invests in an Indian company that manufactures weapons, Larsen & Toubro. The official line, to use the words of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, seems to be that trade missions are not the place to raise human rights issues effectively. I fear that apart from highlighting the dishonesty, duplicity and double standards of this Government, the Bill and the principal Act may be used to restrict and clamp down on civil rights, freedom of expression, freedom of association and freedom of movement - similar legislation has been used in this way elsewhere - while simultaneously embedding institutionalised racism into our criminal justice system. The inclusion of a series of new terrorist offences and the qualification that they need not necessarily be committed to be crimes is bewildering in its broad scope. For example, the proposed section 4A defines the public provocation to commit a terrorist offence as "the intentional distribution, or otherwise making available, by whatever means of communication by a person of a message to the public, with the intent of encouraging, directly or indirectly, the commission by a person of a terrorist activity". If this meant that every time the Taoiseach or a Minister was held to account for trying to justify American warmongering, then I might consider it. Sadly, however, this law will only be used to undermine the free speech of those whom it is politically expedient to criminalise. By holding a monopoly on the definition of the word "terrorism" to the effect that terrorism is only something people other than us undertake, the Bill is built upon a false, unjust and hypocritical premise. The great Nigerian-American novelist, Teju Cole, wrote in the wake of the Paris attacks:A tone of genuine puzzlement always seems to accompany terrorist attacks in the centers of Western power. Why have they visited violent horror on our peaceful societies? Why do they kill when we don't?This puzzlement is the product of a situation where the West, particularly the USA, "has consolidated its traditional monopoly on extreme violence". Accordingly, when the US and their Allies "commit torture or war crimes, no matter how illegal or depraved, there is little expectation of a full accounting or of the prosecution of the parties responsible". Some weeks ago Gary Younge of The Guardian framed the situation perfectly, stating that the West "promotes itself as the upholder of principles it does not keep, and a morality it does not practise". At the crux is the fact that we are discussing the extension of terrorism laws handed down from the planners of the great fortress that is Europe. We close our borders, monitor our citizens, police our waters and build walls to keep out the threat of violence. At least six children under the age of ten were among a reported 25 people killed in Saudi Arabian-led airstrikes in the Yemeni capital Sana'a early one morning a month ago. What protections did these children have from our trade partner, Saudi Arabia? Where are their border controls, defence systems and anti-terrorism legislation? What recourse do the remaining family members of the 14 demolished houses have to attain justice against the powerful US-supported Saudi Arabia? What structures are in place to prevent the surviving members of the family from being killed and maimed by the US-made cluster bombs that now scatter their countryside? What incentive is there not to become one of our feared terrorists? We need to tackle the root problem that this Bill is trying to address, not simply the symptom. Last night, the Minister said there was no doubt that this was significant and timely legislation, particularly in view of the deplorable terrorism witnessed in Europe and beyond in recent times. We agree that terrorist acts are terrible, but as long as we continue to ignore the fact that the US military machine has created more damage in this area than anyone else and that we are complicit by allowing that machine to continue to use Shannon Airport, then how in God's name can we say anything about human rights? What can we possibly say in defence of people who suffer at the hands of terrorism when we stay silent and remain complicit? It is too bad. Are we going to ignore the reality forever? When is an Irish Government going to stand up, behave like a neutral country and call a spade a spade? Let us call the truth for what it is.
#TonyMcLoughlin	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-party	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-dob	unknown-#TonyMcLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this significant new criminal justice Bill, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to do so. I pledge my full support for the enactment of this Bill by all Members from every side of this House. I firmly believe that terrorism has no place in any modern society, or any country, for that matter, and that those criminals who choose to encourage, recruit or train others to carry out acts of terrorism, either domestically or internationally, should feel the full wrath of the Irish criminal justice system. Given our country's long and difficult history of dealing with terrorism and the long-lasting effects of terrorist atrocities, it is unfortunate that we are still affected somewhat by deranged criminals who believe that terrorising or attempting to terrorise innocent citizens is acceptable so long as it helps them to achieve their twisted ideology. That is not acceptable. As legislators, we need to act now to criminalise certain activities, such as terrorist recruitment or training and public provocation of terrorism offences, to try to prevent any further incidents from occurring in this country or abroad in conflicts such as the Syrian civil war and the ISIS conflict. Many counties in this country have experienced the full effects of terrorism in some way, shape or form in recent decades. My county of Sligo has had its fair share of incidents in the past. The most notable incident was the tragic event of 27 August 1979 in which Lord Mountbatten and two innocent children were murdered in Mullaghmore by the IRA during the height of the Troubles. Unfortunately, despite the success of the peace process, the dreadful use of an explosive device as an act of terror is not confined to that troubled period in our history. In recent times, the threat of domestic terrorism has increased again from dissident republican groups, subversives and large-scale criminal organisations. A worrying example of this intensification occurred only last month in the quiet village of Ballysadare, County Sligo, where a dangerous pipe bomb device was detonated in a large estate where many children live and play. I have been advised that had the timing of the explosion been different, there may well have been fatalities at this incident. A similar incident occurred recently in County Leitrim, where another pipe bomb device was found in a rural community near Drumshanbo. Both of these incidents required the Irish Defences Forces explosive ordnance disposal team to be deployed alongside the Garda. These are only two examples of incidents in which explosive devices intended to kill were placed in my constituency. There are many more to which I could refer if I had the time to do so. The criminals behind these types of incident need to be stopped. I am hopeful that the proposed Bill, which will create three new terrorist offences aimed at hitting terrorist training and recruitment, will be effective at stopping this worrying trend from developing any further. Certainly, the introduction of the proposed crime of a public provocation to commit a terrorist offence is needed. I say this because I am very concerned about how the use of the Internet and social media, in particular as a method of recruiting and promoting both domestic and international terrorism, is potentially affecting our citizens. This is of particular importance to the international conflicts involving Islamic State in Syria and Iraq currently. As I am sure the House is aware, ISIS openly uses social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to promote its ideology and to post gruesome updates on its sectarian wars to a wide international audience, including Ireland. Alarmingly, up to 40 Irish passport holders are believed to be fighting with ISIS in Syria currently. My first thought when I heard about this alarming figure was to wonder if they were radicalised online in Ireland, as many of the people from other countries who have joined ISIS claimed to be. It is a worrying aspect which needs swift action from Government and I am happy to see this new Bill contains measures to combat this particular instance. I fully agree with the Minister when she says there should be no hiding place in domestic society for those who encourage, recruit or train others to carry out acts of terrorism. I also know that it has taken a great deal of time and effort to get this Bill onto the floor of the House and I commend the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her officials at the Department of Justice and Equality on the work they have put into this Bill to get it this far.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	302	I am pleased to support this very important legislation. As the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, said in her opening remarks, we already have a body of anti-terrorist legislation but the last major legislation was almost ten years ago and, since then, the geopolitical landscape has changed utterly. We have seen the inexorable growth of terrorism striking right into the heart of Europe, most recently in Paris, and also in Yemen, Tunisia and Nigeria. By definition, we know nowhere is safe because the essence of terrorism is that the terrorists instil fear of attack, even if no attack happens. Their way of terrorising is to instil fear and use threat, stealth and intimidation. Unfortunately, as we now know, the jihadists are increasingly successful in attracting young recruits, as well as money, to their cause. They use social media and all of their psychological skills to persuade not just vulnerable young people, but also well-adjusted, educated young people, to abandon everything they know and everybody they love to travel thousands of miles in pursuit of what is an alleged religious ideal, which is incomprehensible to all of the rest of us, and, I might say, also incomprehensible to the vast majority of Muslims. In my own constituency, in Clonskeagh, we have the largest mosque and Muslim school in the country, so we have a very large Muslim population. I have to say that these are extremely law-abiding citizens. I have sympathy with them because many must feel they are regarded as, in some way, tainted by association with this terrorism, in much the way that Irish people felt when they lived in Britain during the IRA attacks in the 1980s and 1990s. There is that fear that, simply because one is of the same religion or origin, one is in some way tainted by terrorism. Gardaí here in Ireland, through their own efforts and their engagement with Interpol and Europol, have excellent intelligence. Despite what some media reports seem to suggest, there are no more than a couple of dozen individuals here who gardaí feel it is prudent to keep an eye on. Therefore, I think we can be fairly confident that Ireland is not, in fact, a hotbed of terrorist activity. I know also that, in addition to their intelligence, gardaí are also proactive in prevention work and in engaging with the Muslim community to ensure that the young Muslim population is not subject to recruitment or any kind of grooming on social media or otherwise. Vigilance is necessary for all of us, however, particularly so with the ever-increasing movement of great numbers of people to Europe from Africa and the Middle East. Those in this wave of immigrants are, for the most part, trying to escape war and want in either sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East, in particular Syria and Iraq. However, as part of its objective of instilling fear, Islamic State has threatened in the most cynical way to infiltrate Europe by posing as hapless migrants. It may well be, and I hope and pray it is, that Ireland is never subject to a terrorist attack but that does not in any way lessen the need for this legislation. I say so for a number of reasons. The new protocol to the European Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism covers this whole area of procuring terrorists. It is essential for us to sign this protocol. Once the legislation is in place, it opens the way for us to ratify the convention and it is absolutely timely that we do that, given the rapidly changing landscape. We owe it to the international community to show determined solidarity with it, and particularly with those who, unlike Ireland, have been attacked and are probably still vulnerable to further attacks in the future. By ratifying the European Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism, we and all of the countries that ratify it send a strong signal that, no matter where these attacks take place, there will be no safe haven anywhere, either here or in any of the ratifying countries, for those perpetrating this kind of attack. This will be the case no matter where they attack, be it in Nigeria, where young girls were taken from school and subjected to God knows what fate, because they have never been found; in Tunisia, where utterly blameless tourists were shot dead; or in Paris, where journalists suffered a similar fate. In no case is it possible for us to identify any rationale behind these attacks, other than to try to strike terror into the civilised world. By their actions, they show their utter disregard not just for the rule of law or for life or culture, but for all of the human rights which we aspire to and which distinguish civilised man from what is the very worst in human nature. Even in parts of Syria where Islamic State has taken control, its rule is not for the betterment of the people under it. In fact, it still terrorises the population it rules. In many cases, women in particular have not left their houses for months on end for fear of their lives or of enslavement. People have not been able to send children to school for three years. Life expectancy under Islamic State has fallen by 30%, from 79 years of age, which is typical of a western European country, down to 55 years of age in a mere four years. Unfortunately, most of that drop in life expectancy is due to the high mortality rate among youth and children, as medicines, vaccines and medical services have all but disappeared under Islamic State. In a mere four years, this is what terrorism can do to a country, transform it from being, if not a democratic country, then at least a peaceful and educated one, to the unspeakable conditions that now pertain for citizens today. It is a lesson to all of us that if this can happen in Syria, it can literally happen anywhere. Only yesterday I read of girls and women who were rescued by the new Nigerian Government from terrorists in Nigeria. Of the 324 who were rescued, 314 had been raped and were pregnant, many of them just young girls of 12 and 13 years of age. This shows the utter ruthless brutality of this regime. Therefore, I fully support this legislation as a step towards ratifying the European Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism and dealing specifically with the growing evidence of the widespread practice of procuring young male recruits and, indeed, female recruits, training them and financing them, and, if they do not die for their cause in some faraway land, returning them as fully-fledged jihadis to their home country to spread further terrorism. In conclusion, I want to say how much I support this legislation. I know it is largely ignored by the media, and we are dealing with it on a quiet Thursday afternoon, but I suspect it is probably one of the most important Bills we will put through this term.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	303	The Anti-Austerity Alliance will not be supporting this Bill.We are, of course, opposed to terrorism. It and all terrorist acts are currently illegal and will remain so, subject to very strict and severe sanctions, even if this Bill is defeated. The Bill represents a broadening of the 2002 Council framework decision on combating terrorism, and that legislation represented a very serious erosion of civil liberties as well as playing into and encouraging a climate of Islamophobia.  The framework decision defined terrorism as "unduly compelling a Government to perform or abstain from performing an act", a definition so broad as to encompass the majority of people active in politics in this country. It is so broad as to include everybody who participated in anti-water charge protests and mass protests in towns comprising hundreds of thousands of people, who could be said to be unduly seeking to pressurise the Government to scrap the water charges. It defines it as seriously destabilising or destroying the fundamental political, constitutional, economic or social structures of a state or international organisation. That definition is so broad that it covers anybody who is opposed to our structure of neoliberalism and capitalism. By that definition, I am a terrorist, and the Labour Party of old may well have been defined as a terrorist group. Some of those that would have come under the definition of terrorism in the past include the ANC in South Africa, which had the aim of overthrowing the racist apartheid constitution and regime, the Greenpeace occupation of oil rigs, which was aimed at large oil companies destroying the planet for profit, and protesters in Genoa against various organisations of international capital. The safeguards introduced by the Council at the time are simply not enough. The 2002 and 2008 framework decisions are part of a series of so-called counter-terrorism measures that have played a part in the serious erosion of democratic rights and freedoms in the European Union. In total, 239 counter-terrorism measures were introduced in the EU from September 2001 until December 2013. This is part of an international attack on civil liberties, which had its zenith in the US in terms of the USA PATRIOT Act and everything else in the aftermath of September 2001. Those horrific crimes, for which ordinary people paid the price, were used to rightly whip up horror and revulsion against those terrorist acts. They were also used as a whip to try to get people to accept an erosion of democratic rights, giving the illusion that with increased repression and decreased rights in terms of people's freedoms, civil liberties and right to information and data protection, we could somehow eliminate the threat of terrorism. That is simply not the case. A British social attitudes report in 2007 found that the very mention of something being a counter-terrorism measure made people more willing to contemplate giving up their freedoms. It continued, "It is as though society is in the process of forgetting why past generations thought these freedoms to be so very important". That is the process we have seen over the past decade and a half, namely, the erosion of democratic rights under the guise of protecting people from the threat of terrorism. We are likely to see a new phase. After the terrorist attacks on Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket in Paris in January, the French Government moved quickly in the wake of the mass revulsion against the barbaric attacks to introduce what is being dubbed France's PATRIOT Act. The Act proposes a fine of €150,000 and ten years in prison for someone holding explosives who had visited the website of a terrorist organisation. Shockingly, it also gives the state the right to block websites and issue travel bans without recourse to a court or normal justice, including the checks and balances when people have their day in court. Similar laws are in place or are being put in place in Denmark and Luxembourg. In the UK, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Government has published the UK's seventh counter-terrorism Bill in 14 years. It includes travel bans, internal exile, the ability to stop UK citizens entering the UK and restrictions on Internet freedom. Shami Chakrabarti of Liberty correctly said that these laws are a chilling recipe for injustice. They come on top of the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which allows for arbitrary house arrest, electronic tagging and travel restrictions. The right to one's day in court is being dispensed with more and more. Human rights lawyer Gareth Peirce described these measures as "[T]he ultimate demand of any totalitarian regime: the executive is the accuser; the moment of the accusation is also the moment of the imposition of the penalty". There is a trend across Europe of attacks on democratic rights, which is taking place against the backdrop of massive opposition to the political establishment across the Continent. That opposition and mobilisation is feared by the capitalist classes across Europe and their political representatives. They fear people exercising the democratic right to protest and mobilise in opposition to austerity and other neoliberal measures. It is, therefore, no accident that these draconian laws are coming at this time. It is a conscious use of fear to try to keep people down. The latest Europol Terrorism Situation and Trend Report makes reference to people engaged in anti-eviction campaigns in Italy. Will the new reports make reference to people engaged in protests against water meters or charges in Ireland? Many will say that those laws and definition of terrorism may extend to people who are engaged in protest and opposition movements that are anti-austerity and social in nature, but they would not be used on those movements. The experience of the introduction of draconian laws does not indicate that will be the case. In fact, writing about the Council framework definition of terrorism, a professor in Oslo University stated that this legislation may not be used in such a broad and generalised way at first, but that we know from long experience that discretionary measures in this area will be employed less carefully and more broadly as time passes when the time is ripe and the need is there. That is precisely what history demonstrates. It is not enough to simply plead for this Government to promise not to go too far in using this legislation against peaceful protestors. We can consider previous legislation. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act was debated in the Dáil in 1994 in the context of dealing with drunkenness and threatening behaviour. It is now regularly used against protestors. It is the main law cited against those who are stopping water meters from being installed in communities where they are not wanted, protestors in Rossport and people who picket workplaces. It is used again and again against those who attempt to fight back. Another example is the miners' strike in Britain, which saw a similar use of legislation used against a major social movement. This takes place in the context of a culture in which there has been a rise in Islamophobia. In the course of the debate in the Seanad, some incredibly paranoid scare stories came from establishment politicians. One Fianna Fáil Senator implied that jihadists would be training in the Wicklow mountains or on a remote island off the coast. It plays into the idea that the majority or a significant minority of Muslims are terrorists and adds to the idea of a clash of civilisations. The first victims of jihadists were Muslims. The Europol report from 2014 shows that the majority of terrorist incidents and arrests in Europe are not related to any religious motives, but rather to separatists.  There is a whipping up of fear and an atmosphere of Islamophobia and fear about the radicalisation of Muslim youth. We have to understand the root causes of terrorism because, as I said, all of these things are illegal. More repressive laws will not stop terrorism. The things that have driven people into the arms of organisations in some cases are the poverty and precarious situation of young working-class people, the endemic and systematic racism and discrimination faced by young Muslims and other ethnic minorities and an anger against imperialism and what has happened in Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Somalia, Yemen, Libya, Mali and the Central African Republic, all of which have experienced interventions.  We need instead to build a world with no poverty, precariousness, war or exploitation, and no repression of terror Acts will deliver that. Rather, the mass force of people from below can achieve that, just as they achieved the revolutions in North Africa and the Middle East, the overthrow of Ben Ali in Tunisia and of Mubarak in Egypt, despite all of the complications and reversals and counter-revolutions that have happened since then. Mass action by ordinary people holds the key.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	304	I am pleased to be able to speak on this important legislation concerning terrorist offences as a member of the Oireachtas justice committee. The Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Bill is a significant piece of legislation with two primary objectives, namely, amending the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) (Amendment) Act 2005 in order to give effect to EU directives agreed under the Lisbon treaty and allowing Ireland to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism. The Bill creates three new offences in respect of terrorist activity which are covered by the amending framework decision and the Council of Europe convention to which Ireland is already a signatory. These three new offences are the public provocation to commit a terrorist offence; recruitment for terrorism; and training for terrorism. The Government is committed to combating terrorism, as this legislation demonstrates. Ireland needs to legislate to be able to combat terrorism in all of its guises and that includes being able to confront, when required to do so, incitement to commit terrorist offences and recruitment and training in order to carry out terrorist activities. Our own history demonstrates why legislating for these offences is important and should enable Ireland to look abroad to our fellow European countries and focus on combating terrorism alongside them so that the citizens of the European Union can be safe and protected. Those who would threaten the lives of ordinary people by engaging in acts of terrorism, whether on this island or elsewhere, must be brought to justice and must know that the international community will not tolerate their activity and will take all possible activity to prevent and punish it.  Although it is possible to criticise the comments I have just made, our own history must be considered when it comes to legislation such as this. We should also look to recent events, for example, in Paris where we saw the shooting of a journalist and other people, the bombings in Madrid in 2004 when a large number of people on trains were killed and others suffered, and similar bombings targeting people on public transport in London in 2007. Another event that comes to mind in all its horror, which is easily one of the most despicable acts of terrorism carried out in recent years, is the attack in 2011 against the people of Oslo and the Norwegian labour party. This comes to mind because of two copycat attempts that occurred subsequently in the Czech Republic and in Poland. This is directly relevant to the legislation that is before the House today. While the threat level to Ireland from international terrorism is considered to be low, we must remain vigilant, particularly where the possibility of lone wolf type actions witnessed elsewhere in Europe is concerned. The random and unpredictable nature of such attacks makes them a particular matter for concern. It is important, therefore, that we have the relevant tools at our disposal to deal with terrorist threats in all their forms and at all stages, including incitement and other preparatory activities. By criminalising the terrorist linked activities of provocation, recruitment and training, the legislation further strengthens our hand in this regard. I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House.

On behalf of the Minister, I wish to thank the House for giving its time to this most important matter. I thank Deputies for their contributions, comments and general if not unanimous support for this important legislation. It is clear that there is a shared determination to combat terrorism, in all its forms and at all stages. This Bill strengthens our hand in this regard by further developing and enhancing existing counter-terrorism legislation. It focuses on the more subtle, indirect and insidious aspects of modern terrorism, namely, public provocation, recruitment and training. The Bill makes it an offence to engage in any of these preparatory activities and provides strong penalties for those found guilty of them, including up to ten years imprisonment if the crime is sufficiently serious. We continue to learn that events far from our shores may have an impact on us domestically. Thankfully, Ireland has not experienced any of the horrendous attacks experienced in other European member states, yet we must never be complacent. This legislation will add to Ireland's ability to deal with the threat from terrorism both domestically and internationally. While we have not yet been directly affected, we must, as a long-standing member of the EU, show solidarity with our fellow member states. In that regard, the House can be assured that Ireland will continue to contribute to initiatives in this area from a European perspective also. A number of points of action have been identified as requiring particular priority from an EU perspective. The Minister for Justice and Equality yesterday alluded to the EU passenger name records directive in some detail. Member states also continue to examine other ways in which our security and policing agencies can enhance levels of co-operation and information exchange. Europol has recently proposed the setting up of a counter-terrorism Internet referral unit where police agencies can exchange information on abuses of the Internet for terrorist purposes. This is to be welcomed and An Garda Síochána will continue to co-operate with its international colleagues in this sphere. More also needs to be learned about the individuals financing and supporting terrorism within Europe. The many and circuitous routes foreign fighters take to travel to the combat areas must be identified and greater engagement with non-member states who have a shared interest in these matters must occur. Initiatives in this area are ongoing and being developed. This is a truly international problem. The threat from international terrorism is also undoubtedly a complex one. There was a time when we could point at a specific organisation or structure and take action to reduce its terror capabilities and dismantle its infrastructure. The new nature of terrorism is much more random and the traditional formal organisational and hierarchical structures no longer apply in many cases. The threat becomes more difficult to detect, anticipate and deal with. Many of the attacks we have seen recently are carried out by individuals or small cells of individuals, self-motivated and radicalised. Some have received training in the combat zones of the Middle East. A number of the attacks in France bear this hallmark. The attacks carried out by these
individuals clearly demonstrate the threat posed by the foreign fighter phenomenon. As previously outlined, the Internet has proved a powerful tool for the forces of radicalisation. The EU has identified curbing the use of the Internet for recruitment and radicalisation purposes as another key action requiring attention. The challenge in this area is phenomenal. For example, it is estimated that 300 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute. Twitter processes 500 million tweets per day. For every site or tweet taken down, there are many more waiting to replace them. Dealing with the abuse of these resources, which are enjoyed by many for legitimate reasons, requires more than simply attempting to remove the offending content or making its presence illegal. It is apparent that the companies offering Internet based and social media services do not view the exploitation of their product by terrorists as desirable. Indeed these companies are engaged in trying to develop ways of addressing the issue. However, the ready availability of this content needs to be questioned. We are not talking about curbing freedoms of expression or speech here. We are simply asking whether this doctrine of hate and intolerance should go unchallenged. Greater engagement with the technology companies and Internet service providers is required. More research is also needed into what content has a genuinely radicalising effect and what does not. Is it, for example, the preaching of radical clerics or, particularly where young people are concerned, simply peer group pressure? Why is it that our modern progressive democracies based on free speech and expression seem so hateful to some of our own citizens? Hard questions need to be asked. Responses need to be developed. Considerable resources have been invested by the EU Commission in the creation of its radicalisation awareness network to examine the issue of radicalisation in all of its facets. These include initiatives in the areas of policing, community relations, prisons, mental health and the technology sectors. Ireland contributes on a number of fronts to the workings of this network. It is obviously very important to have international co-operation, strong security measures and empowering legislation to deal with the terrorist threat. A purely law enforcement based approach will not, however, sufficiently address radicalisation and violent extremism. It is also necessary to have policies and initiatives in place at national level that serve to discourage people from being drawn into extremist activity and to protect communities that may be at risk from radical sources. The best prevention is to stop people from getting involved in anti-social, violent or terrorist activity in the first place and to convince them to turn away from such behaviour. There is a need for meaningful engagement with communities who may be under threat from radical sources.  An important part of this process is avoiding any sense of profiling or stigmatising sectors of the population. The protection of fundamental rights and the recognition that the majority of people want to live peaceably and play a productive part in society are enshrined in this engagement. Integration of all of our citizens in our society - their society - has a very important role to play in this regard. A good example of a proactive approach in engaging with our minority communities is the work of the Garda racial, intercultural and diversity office to which the Minister referred yesterday in her opening speech. On the subject of integration and inclusiveness, the office for the promotion of migrant integration in the Department of Justice and Equality is in the process of developing a new strategy on migrant integration. This follows a lengthy consultation process with a wide range of groups representing migrants throughout society. This process of engagement is very important not just in the context of seeking to prevent seditious activity, but in the general spirit of inclusiveness for all of our citizens in our democratic society. In his contribution on the Bill last evening, Deputy Collins inquired as to what action could be taken on Irish citizens engaging in foreign fighting. The Passports Act 2008 contains provisions under which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade can refuse or cancel a passport. Should the Minister, following consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality and-or the Minister for Defence, as appropriate, form the opinion that a person would be likely to engage in conduct that would prejudice national security or the security of another state, the Minister may cancel a passport already issued to an Irish citizen. A cancelled passport must be surrendered to the Minister. A person who uses or attempts to use a cancelled passport is guilty of an offence and is liable on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term of up to ten years. In addition, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides for the revocation of citizenship of naturalised persons in certain circumstances. In the event of any information being brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Equality which should have been disclosed by a naturalised citizen, the Minister can invoke the statutory process which exists for the consideration of revocation of citizenship. I understand, however, that the revocation of citizenship is not an entirely straightforward matter. Such cases would have to be handled on a case by case basis, in consultation with the State's legal services. Certain factors would have to be taken into account, such as whether the person has dual citizenship and whether he or she has already re-entered the country. Under the relevant legislation the subject has the right to appeal to a statutory committee which then considers the matter in full and reports its findings to the Minister for Justice and Equality, who will then decide on the matter. There is considerable concern throughout Europe and elsewhere at the phenomenon of individuals travelling to conflict areas in the Middle East and the consequential threat posed to national security. While the number of Irish citizens who are believed to have travelled to the conflict zones is estimated at between 25 and 30, within this number are individuals who travelled to Libya and other Arab states to take part in the popular uprisings known as the Arab Spring which began in December 2010. Some of these individuals are known to have returned and three died in the conflicts. In Ireland, the Garda Síochána monitors the movements of those suspected of involvement in extremist behaviour, and in line with best practice internationally has engaged with returnees from the conflict areas. For obvious reasons it is not possible to be any more specific than this. Dealing with, and discouraging, extremist and terrorist activity is obviously very different from discouraging or suppressing legitimate rights to freedom of speech or the expression of opinions and political ideologies. It is vital in a democratic world that the right to express views and beliefs, sometimes outside the mainstream, is protected and that journalists, for instance, are free to voice their commentary. Such fundamental human rights should not be compromised, as to do so would play into the hands of extremists who would seek to forcibly deprive us of these rights. I will turn to specific questions asked by Deputies. Deputy Mac Lochlainn asked about the delay in the transposition of the amending Council framework decision on combating terrorism. Transposition of EU legislation is, unfortunately, often delayed not due to any lack of commitment or willingness on Government's part, but due to the volume of legislation produced by the EU and to competing demands with domestic legislation. It is a question of prioritisation and I expect that the Bill will be enacted very shortly. Deputies asked why the definition of "terrorist activity" and "terrorist linked activity" in the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 are so broad. The 2008 framework decision, to which this legislation gives effect, provides for the addition of three new offences to the definition of "terrorist linked activity" in the 2005 Act. All member states agree these new offences should be included in any definition of terrorist linked activity at this time, thereby building on the existing offences contained in the 2005 Act. Existing offences covered by the definitions of "terrorist activity" and "terrorist linked activity" are set out in Schedule 2 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005. The Schedule lists the offences which, with the requisite intent, would constitute terrorist offences. These include common law offences such as murder and rape; offences under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997; offences under the Criminal Damage Act 1991; offences under the Explosives Substances Act 1883; and offences under the Firearms Acts and Chemical Weapons Act, to name but a few. In this way, only the most serious offences are covered in our legislation by the definitions of "terrorist activity" and "terrorist linked activity". In response to the points raised by Deputies Daly and Murphy, section 6(5) of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005 provides that where persons engage in protest, advocacy or dissent it does not in and of itself constitute a terrorist offence. The Government has repeatedly made it clear that extraordinary rendition is an illegal practice which Ireland does not accept, and there is no question of the State having been complicit in the practice of extraordinary rendition. Any person with credible information that Irish airports are being used for any alleged unlawful purpose should report their concerns to An Garda Síochána. Deputy Mitchell mentioned Ireland's ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism. One of the purposes of the Bill is to enable Ireland to ratify this convention. Work will begin on this process following the enactment of this legislation. I note that an amendment on data protection and onward transfer will be tabled by Deputy Mac Lochlainn on Committee Stage and we will address this next week. The Bill will ensure there are no gaps in our laws that can be exploited by those who would seek to inflict terror and mayhem on innocent people at home and abroad. We must ensure there can be no hiding place in democratic society for those who encourage, recruit or train others to carry out acts of terrorism and we must never relent in our determination to use all resources at our disposal to root them out. This is not just a fight against terrorism and intolerance. It is a battle for hearts and minds, and the House can rest assured that Ireland will continue to play its part. On behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, I am pleased to commend the Bill to the House.

#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	308	I thank the Ceann Comhairle's office for allowing us to raise this issue. It has been a concern of citizens in west Kildare, particularly in the Carbury area. This stems from the fact that Garda numbers in Kildare have not increased in line with population. In 2014, there were 305 full-time gardaí in Kildare, while there were 306 in 2008. There has been a 12% increase in population in the area but there has not been a corresponding increase in the number of gardaí. The lack of policing has had serious consequences for people in the area. People must travel as far as 40 km to Leixlip for day to day issues like getting a simple passport form and they believe that they are sitting ducks for burglaries. Community alert schemes have been told there is no point in contacting the Garda because of the length of time it will take gardaí to arrive at the location. Apart from day to day policing issues, crime in the area has taken a nasty turn in recent times. This is normally a very quiet rural area, but the absence of a full-time Garda station and inadequate policing in recent years have not gone unnoticed by some of the country's most serious criminal gangs, who view the area as an ideal base for their activities. Ease of access to Dublin and lack of policing mean that this quiet area has become a magnet for a criminal drug gang, which is wreaking havoc. The people involved are ruthless, heavy-handed thugs with no regard for people, who operate on fear and intimidation. The escalation of violence was covered recently by the national media. Incidents include a Garda station being shot at in the middle of the night, an attempt to set the station on fire and several cars being burnt out. In addition, the GRA has recently confirmed that six gardaí who work at the station had death threats made against them. One was even followed home and their families were threatened. People in this area are living in fear. I recognise the fact that extra recruits have come out of Templemore in recent months and that several gardaí have been stationed in this area. The one thing we cannot have is people going about their ordinary lives in intimidation and fear.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	309	I have raised on numerous occasions the activities of criminal gangs in this country and the extent to which they impact on the lives of law-abiding citizens. The situation in north-west Kildare in particular has taken a bad turn in recent times. Over the past ten years or so there has been a noticeable increase in criminal activity in that area. It has grown gradually but has now grown to the extent that there is absolute contempt for gardaí and their families. As has been explained by my colleague, it has now resulted in gardaí and private citizens being personally intimidated and family members of gardaí families being intimidated and threatened. That is totally unacceptable. A strong response to that challenge is required. That response will determine the extent to which this kind of subversiveness - that is what it is - will be stood down. If it is not, people will continue to live in fear and gardaí will continue to live in fear. Who will prevail? Will it be the gardaí, the forces of law and order, who represent the people and are entrusted with the responsibility of protecting the citizens of the State or are they to be intimidated out of doing their work? What is most important at this stage is that there be an urgent appraisal of the requirements throughout north-west Kildare in particular and Kildare in general, with a view to ensuring that adequate resources are put in place to deter any further illegal activity of a criminal nature, such as that to which reference has been made.To my mind, there is a requirement for a new, fully-fledged, 24-hour Garda station in that particular area to deal with the issues. The danger is that if we allow such issues to go unchallenged, they will prevail and if that happens, we, the citizens, the representatives of the citizens, and An Garda Síochána are under threat.

She is grateful to the Deputies for raising this important matter in the House, one of importance not just for Kildare, but for the country and society as a whole. The Minister has asked me to assure the Deputies that she is, of course, aware of the threats made against members of An Garda Síochána in County Kildare. I have no doubt that every Member of this House will share the Minister's view, and mine, that such actions are to be roundly condemned. I know that we also all appreciate how important it is that we discuss this issue in a manner which does not heighten the distress for those impacted and their families. It is, regrettably, also the case that the issue of intimidation of gardaí going about their duty is not confined to the instances referred to by the Deputies. An Garda Síochána plays a key role in keeping citizens and communities safe and secure. On our behalf, day in, day out, individual gardaí carry out challenging, demanding and sometimes dangerous tasks in the course of their duty. In doing that, gardaí are deserving of the support they get from the communities they serve. The Minister knows that individual gardaí, in the best traditions of the force, will not be intimidated from carrying out their duties and will continue to do so without fear or favour. As the House will understand, it would neither be wise nor appropriate for the Minister to detail the operational measures the Garda authorities have taken or would take generally in these situations. I can say on her behalf, however, that she has asked to be kept briefed by the Garda Commissioner in relation to the specific circumstances at issue. She is aware that whatever protective and detection measures are deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities will certainly be taken. The individual safety of gardaí is a priority for the Garda authorities, as it is for all of us. While the criminal law in this area is being kept under ongoing review, I should also say that there is a range of robust legislative provisions available to the Garda authorities in circumstances where threats or assaults are made against gardaí. In so far as the question of resources for policing generally in Kildare is concerned, the Deputies will appreciate that the deployment of personnel across the State is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. I can advise them that the number of gardaí assigned to the division as of 31 March was 299 gardaí, of which 73 were in the Leixlip district, which includes Carbury Garda station where five gardaí were assigned. Two additional Garda personnel have been allocated to Carbury in recent times. The allocation of overall Garda resources is kept under continuing review in the context of crime trends and policing priorities so as to ensure resources are put to the best possible use. For the Minister and the Government's part, however, the key point is that thanks to the resumption of recruitment, the Garda Commissioner now has the capacity to deploy new gardaí for the first time since 2009. In fact, on 8 May, five new probationer gardaí are due to transfer to the Kildare Garda division. Similarly, investments are being made in vehicles and IT, and in the recruitment of specialist professional staff. Policing and community safety in Kildare will undoubtedly benefit from this injection of resources, as it will in all other Garda divisions. This investment demonstrates the commitment of the Minister and the Government to supporting the Garda in carrying out its duties, including in the ongoing fight against organised and serious crime. We have not been under any illusion about the depths to which those involved in this type of criminality will sink. The latest incidents reinforces that and An Garda Síochána will continue to confront, disrupt and bring to justice those involved, on behalf of all law-abiding citizens.

I appreciate the Minister cannot be present today and understand where she is. I welcome the fact some additional resources and additional gardaí have been allocated to the area. People have said they noticed the additional presence on the ground. This cannot be just a short-term fix. A long-term solution must be found to problems in the district. Three Garda stations are located within 10 km of each other, one in Edenderry, one in Enfield and one in Derrinturn. They are probably in three different districts. Perhaps the Garda Commissioner might consider opening one of the three stations on a 24-hour basis to service the area. It is important for people to have confidence that they can go about their daily lives without living in fear of intimidation or criminal activity by the gang in this area. I welcome the opening of Templemore to recruits but it is vitally important that we have a long-term solution to the problem and that additional gardaí coming from Templemore are allocated to Kildare on a long-term basis.

I fully appreciate and understand that at any time competition for resources is a moot issue and will continue to be. However, I wish to point out that this particular situation is unique. There is a threat to the institutions of the State in a way that has not manifested itself previously in County Kildare. It requires a response of a very dramatic nature. If such a response is not forthcoming, it may be seen as a weakness on the part of the authorities. It is improper that members of An Garda Síochána should be afraid to go to and from work without taking special measures. It naturally follows that their families should not live in fear and that other families in the area should not live in fear. There is a need to respond in a way that is fairly dramatic, as has happened in other situations. I say that in particular because the area in question is in the greater Dublin area and provides easy access from the point of view of criminal activity on a 24-7 basis. I strongly urge that the only way to make a statement these people will listen to is to consider the possibility of a new station in the area.

I will share the points that have been made with her. As I said, the Minister has been assured by the Garda Commissioner that the necessary and appropriate actions are being taken in response to the threats that have been made, as we would all expect. There is no question of resources constraining the operational response to the threats. The management of policing in Kildare, as elsewhere, is of course a matter for the Garda authorities but the Government is doing all it can to ensure they have the resources to do so effectively. While the Minister is aware that the possibility of a new station at Carbury has been raised, she is advised by the Garda authorities that there are no plans at present to open an additional Garda station in the area. Ultimately, they are questions for Garda management to assess in terms of how policing can be most effectively managed and organised. The vast majority of law-abiding people in County Kildare, and all over the country, support the work of An Garda Síochána, and all will no doubt be appalled at these recent incidents and will join us in supporting the steps being taken to tackle those responsible. I thank the Deputies for raising the matters which I will discuss with the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald.

Since the start of 2014 we have seen an almost continuous increase in waiting lists both for outpatient consultations and for scheduled day case and inpatient procedures. The latest figures for April are remarkable because they show that for outpatients, there are now 412,422 on the waiting list. Of those, 83,347 have been waiting more than a year while more than 11,000 have been waiting more than two years. A total of 2,166 have been waiting more than three years and a most unfortunate 778 people have been on the outpatient waiting list for more than four years. A total of 3,879 children have been waiting more than a year in the children's hospital group alone, that is, Crumlin and Temple Street hospitals. That is a doubling of the number in the past year and obviously more children are waiting to be seen in other hospitals across the country. The number of outpatients waiting more than a year is up 16,725, or 25.1%, since the start of 2015 alone. The year-on-year figures show a jump of 60,601, or 266.4%, for the numbers waiting more than a year.For inpatient and day case procedures, there are now 67,165 on the list, with 27,260 waiting longer than the internationally accepted benchmark of six months. A total of 9,433 have been waiting more than a year and 361 of these are in the children's hospital group. The Government set a target for children of 20 weeks. Yesterday's HSE performance report for February showed that the target was being reached in a miserable 56.2% of cases, compared to 84% in February 2014. The following hospitals did not even get half way to the children's 20 week target in February - Beaumont Hospital at 48.1%, Cavan General Hospital at 34.1%, University Hospital Waterford at 48.9%, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, at 41.1%, the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital at 47.2%, Letterkenny General Hospital at 47.2% and Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, at 47.8%. In fairness to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, he said that things would get worse before they got better. Obviously, they have got much worse. As a Kildare Deputy, I am relieved to see that Naas General Hospital's figures have not risen as much as many others, but many Kildare people go to Tallaght hospital and the figures for that hospital are truly appalling. There are 30,713 people waiting for an outpatient appointment in Tallaght hospital. It is not the worst in the country overall, but 9,825 of those people, almost one in three, are waiting more than a year. That is an increase of 1,303 since January and an increase of 5,235 in a year. It has more than doubled since April 2014. When will things get better? All the Minister appears to have done is scrap his predecessor's target times. Obviously more resources are required. The Minister told us he had achieved a realistic budget last October but he has since required an additional €74 million in funding to confront the realities of overcrowding in emergency departments. Will the Minister be seeking a further Supplementary Estimate to his realistic budget, as he described it, to address these appalling waiting times and when can we expect it? The difficulty is that real human beings are enduring real hardship and suffering as a result of the bogus budgets the Department of Health has brought before this House in each of the past two years.

I am replying on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, who sends his apologies for being unable to be in the House this afternoon. He is otherwise engaged on Government business. Under the Future Health plan, significant structural changes are envisaged for the acute hospital sector, with the formation of hospital groups and the reconfiguration of services to improve both quality and access. These major structural changes will take some time to implement and there remain significant operating pressures on acute hospitals, including waiting lists for inpatient and day case treatments and outpatient appointments. Reducing these waiting lists is a key priority for Government. Taking into account current pressures on acute hospital services, the Minister has put in place a target that by mid-year nobody will wait more than 18 months for treatment or an outpatient appointment; by year-end, that target will be revised to a wait time of no more than 15 months. When these targets were announced in February, there were 4,996 patients to be treated by the end of June 2015. As of 1 May, there are 3,508 patients requiring treatment by the end of June 2015 if the 18 month target is to be achieved, a reduction of almost 1,500. It is acknowledged that the volume of the outpatient waiting list is far greater, principally due to consultant shortages in particular specialties and resource pressures on a small number of hospitals. The HSE has put in place specific measures to manage waiting lists more efficiently, including observation of the national waiting list protocol, adherence to relevant HSE national clinical programme guidelines, prioritising day-of-surgery admission where clinically appropriate and validation of inpatient waiting lists to establish and maintain a precise current position regarding the volume of people awaiting care. The monthly publication of hospital and speciality level waiting list information on the National Treatment Purchase Fund website is a welcome development, as is the HSE service plan commitment to the publication of waiting lists at consultant and speciality level. I am advised that the acute hospitals division is meeting weekly with the hospital groups to review performance against agreed clearance plans for all treatment waiting lists. A similar process is in place for outpatient appointments, with the assistance in particular of the national clinical programmes for orthopaedics, rheumatology and surgery. New pathways of care to improve patient flow through hospitals, such as medical assessment units, local injury units and urgent care centres, as well as care provision in non-hospital settings, can and must be used to provide a spectrum of care which supports the efficient use of hospital resources. Waiting list performance will be assessed within the revised accountability framework for the HSE, which requires formal performance management for hospitals to include access, quality, outcomes and financial performance. The work of the special delivery unit indicates that there is still significant potential to improve performance in hospitals. The hospital redesign programme is working with the national clinical programmes to support local change and innovation and raise national standards through the use of internationally recognised redesign and improvement methodologies. Based on the emergency department task force's action plan and in view of experience to date, the Government is providing additional funds of €74 million, in addition to the €25 million provided in 2014, to address delayed discharges and support initiatives which improve timeliness for admissions from emergency departments and waiting lists. The Department of Health will continue to work with the HSE to ensure that all issues relating to hospital waiting lists are resolved.

He is reading out a response from the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, that is effectively a non-response. He talks about programmes, protocols and delivery units, but the reality is that the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, was faced with a crisis in accident and emergency departments last winter. His response was to create a situation where it was addressed to some extent, although in Naas General Hospital, for example, over the past 12 months record numbers of people were treated on trolleys, which is absolutely unacceptable. However, as a result of the initiative taken by the Minister to address the crisis in emergency departments, there has been an exponential and phenomenal increase in the waiting lists for services throughout the health sector. All of this comes back to one critical issue, the funding of the health services. Over the past two budgets this House was presented with figures for the health budget that were inaccurate, not based on fact, bogus and which have been described on a number of occasions by Members on this side of the House as fraudulent. The people who brought them before the House knew they were not figures that could sustain the health services for the period ahead. Now, we have a situation where incredible numbers of people continue to build up month after month on the various waiting lists of hospitals throughout the country. Furthermore, we do not know where we are going in terms of the funding of the health service or whether a Supplementary Estimate will be brought forward by the Department of Health. Perhaps if the Minister could us an assurance today that there will be a Supplementary Estimate, we might have some expectation of seeing these incredible waiting lists addressed in the short term.

Anything regarding a Supplementary Estimate would be an operational matter for the Department of Health and the Minister, and I am not privy to any information that there will be a Supplementary Estimate. The Minister and I accept that, as the Deputy said, this is a hardship for families and for the human being. However, this has been a major issue over many years for every Minister with responsibility for health. There is no quick fix to ensure every patient is seen, but the Minister has put in place a target-----

I hope the plans the Minister has put in place will be implemented. There is a shortage of consultants in some hospitals across the country, but I am not saying that is the main problem. The Deputy recognised that we had a crisis in accident and emergency departments in January, which caused its own problems and had repercussions for outpatient appointments. I will bring to the attention of the Minister the concerns raised by the Deputy, and he will keep the Deputy and the House updated on how his targets are progressing. The Deputy is correct in saying it is up to Members to ensure they get a briefing and are kept up to date on the targets. I repeat that weekly meetings take place on the targets the Minister has put in place to ensure they can be achieved.

The Minister of State will be familiar with the recently published OECD report on the minimum wage. We can extract from the contents of the report that there are many employers in Ireland who consider that this is no country for those on the minimum wage. We are pretty far down the league of countries cited in the report and it most certainly is not good news for those in the retail sector, the hospitality sector, hairdressing, and the security industry, where traditionally wages have been low. We now have a situation in which many of the workforce are working for less than the minimum wage. Having said that, we can all appreciate that what is happening in those sectors is a replica of what happened during the 1980s, when the country had its most recent recession. Many people were out of work and chasing limited job opportunities, which made them very vulnerable to unscrupulous employers. On top of that, as at present, there was the difficulty of falling trade union membership which, unfortunately, meant that people who should have trade union representation in the retail or hospitality sector were without it. For many people in low-paid employment, as someone said to me during the Dunnes Stores day of action on 2 April, if faced with the prospect of working below the minimum wage, or just on the minimum wage, or going on the dole, most people will opt to work for the minimum wage. That is the reality and it is what happened in the 1980s. It has adverse consequences, with many people struggling in the sector. It is not that these industries are not making money; they most certainly are, and Dunnes Stores is a good example. Rather, it is about the treatment of people, and the report highlights this. It is important that, as a Government and as a Parliament, we make a stand on this. I welcome the Irish Congress of Trade Unions charter for fair conditions at work, which rightly indicates that the living wage should be €11.45, which I would support. I hope that all parliamentarians in the House would support the work of Congress in achieving the living wage of €11.45 into the future.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I note that he referred to the recent OECD paper entitled "Minimum wages after the crisis: Making them pay". This is a very interesting cross-OECD report which clearly illustrates that adjustments to the national minimum wage take place within the context of tax and social transfer policies as well as the broader earnings, employment and economic impacts of such adjustments. It should be borne in mind that the national minimum wage in Ireland is relatively high by international standards, and the House will recall that this Government restored the national minimum wage to €8.65 per hour with effect from 1 July 2011. The most recent figures published by EUROSTAT show that Ireland's rate is the fifth highest among the 22 member states that have a national minimum wage. When the cost of living is taken into account, Ireland's rate is the sixth highest. Approximately 70,000 employees are on the national minimum wage. I assure Deputy Maloney that if an employer is found to be in breach of the National Minimum Wage Act and is not paying at least €8.65 per hour, that is an offence and will be investigated by the National Employment Rights Agency.  In reviewing the paper, it is important to bear in mind that the conclusions are based on data from 2013. As the House is aware, there have been significant positive developments in the performance of the economy overall and in tax and social policy protections for the most vulnerable in our society since then. In this context, 410,000 low-paid workers have been removed from the USC charge over successive budgets, and the Government will continue this policy of tax reductions for such workers in the next budget and subsequent budgets if we are given a mandate to do so. At the same time, the Government has introduced targeted welfare supports for people returning to work, and particularly for the low paid. I know those are measures that the Deputy supports. The Government will pay €30 a week to mothers or fathers returning to work from long-term unemployment in respect of each child for the first year, and €15 per week per child for the second year. This is a very important back-to-work dividend for families to ensure that work always pays.  For those trapped on rent supplement who cannot go back to work because they will lose their housing support, a new housing assistance payment is being rolled out. The assistance from the State will be based on how much one earns and not on one's employment status. The Department of Social Protection also supports low-income families in work through the family income supplement. These initiatives address issues identified in the paper, such as the fact that even at the bottom of the income ladder, taxes and social levies can strongly reduce take-home pay, and the size of the overall tax burden has implications for how well the national minimum wage supports low-wage workers and low-income families. In this regard, it is worth noting that Ireland ranks very favourably against other OECD countries in terms of the level of employee taxes and social contributions for those on the minimum wage. It also finds that when social benefits are included, the minimum wage in Ireland is particularly effective at moving minimum wage workers above the poverty line. In many ways, the report confirms the utility of the Government's twin-track approach in assisting those on low pay through reviews of the national minimum wage and pay restoration while also tackling the increased burden of taxation that resulted from managing ourselves out of the economic crisis. It identifies a potential issue for Ireland with regard to the net benefit to Irish workers on the minimum wage of any increase in the minimum wage. As I stated earlier, the data utilised are out of date, given the recent budgetary and social policy initiatives introduced by the Government. None the less, I have no doubt that this issue will be considered and fully explored by the Low Pay Commission in the coming months. As Deputy Maloney will be aware, the commission has been operating on an interim administrative basis since last February, and the Government yesterday approved the Bill to give it statutory effect. This will be published in the coming days. I look forward to the debate in the coming weeks in the House on the Low Pay Commission Bill, which will give statutory effect to that body.

I think he would share my view that the message from this House is one of solidarity with those on the minimum wage and who have difficulties in their day to day lives. I listened closely to what the Minister of State said and commend the speed with which he took action on the Low Pay Commission shortly after his appointment. That is very important. I think every Member of this House would oppose zero-hour contracts. I look forward to the legislation the Minister of State has had drafted on collective bargaining. In solidarity with those on the minimum wage and those whose pay is below that, it is important to recognise that, as law-makers, Members of this House have a special responsibility to support the sort of initiatives the Minister of State has taken and the new legislation that will come before the House because it will protect the most vulnerable in the workplace.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2015-05-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	326	The Cabinet approved the draft Bill to place the Low Pay Commission on a statutory footing. When I publish the Bill in the coming days, Deputy Maloney will be interested to see one of its key provisions is a legal requirement that the Low Pay Commission produce a report on, or before, 15 July each year. There is a compelling reason for providing in primary legislation that the report be returned to the Minister of the day by a particular date. That is designed to ensure it is provided well in advance of any budgetary, tax and social welfare changes the Departments of Finance and Social Protection might consider. We want to ensure that any changes recommended by the Low Pay Commission and, subsequently, adopted by Government would be positive and that they would not be nullified by any tax or social welfare changes in budgets. The national minimum wage rate has not been fundamentally reviewed since 2007. The rate was adjusted downwards by €1 - shamefully so - by the previous Government. We adjusted that and brought it up to €8.65 on election in 2011. It is better for society and the economy and makes good economic and business planning sense to ensure there are more frequent reviews of the national minimum wage. That is what the Low Pay Commission will do. It will also examine other issues related to low pay but its primary legislative function and exclusive focus over the past few months after it was set up on an interim basis was to examine the rate of the national minimum wage and whether that should be adjusted. I look forward to receiving the report of the Low Pay Commission very shortly. I have always supported frequent reviews of the minimum wage to try to take into account the changing economic circumstances annually to ensure that those whom we need to protect in this society, people on low pay and those in vulnerable situations, get the protection to which Deputy Maloney and I think they are entitled. In the next couple of days, I will publish legislation, which was approved by Cabinet last night, on collective bargaining and the reintroduction of a registered employment agreement system. I look forward to the debate on those Bills in the next few weeks. I intend that legislation will be enacted by the end of this Dáil session, by the middle or end of July. If we have any role, it should be to ensure an economic recovery that ensures the jobs we create are decent and sustainable. We want decent work and high standards in our society and economy.
