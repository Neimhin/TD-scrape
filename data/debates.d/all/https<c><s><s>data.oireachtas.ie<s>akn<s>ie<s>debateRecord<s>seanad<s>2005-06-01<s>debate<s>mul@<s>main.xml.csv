#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I propose an amendment to the Order of Business to the effect that No. 17, motion 12, in the name of my group should not be moved today, and that the two hours normally allocated for Fine Gael Private Members' business be given to the House to allow for statements by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for the elderly. Members of the House could then reply in the course of the debate. That would be more relevant today in terms of the controversy surrounding the nursing home issue.We are all exercised by the nursing home scandal. However, there is a greater scandal, namely, the failure on the part of public administration to adequately respond to these problems when they emerge. In November 2002 the Human Rights Commission submitted a lengthy report on this issue to the Department of Health and Children setting out particular concerns that it had regarding two health board areas. Eight months later the commission received a cursory reply. In July 2001, the former Senator, now Deputy O'Dowd, referred specifically in this House to the problem at the heart of the "Prime Time" investigation shown on Monday night. If there is a greater scandal in this area, it is the failure of the Department of Health and Children to respond to these problems when they emerged three and four years ago. Not only is there a culture of denial within that Department, there is a culture of cover-up.Ministers must take responsibility for the Departments for which they are in charge to this House and the Dáil. We already know, to our cost, of Ministers not reading reports. Neither the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, nor the then Minister of State with responsibility in this area read the Human Rights Commission report in 2002. No action was taken, which constitutes the greater scandal.What action is taken when Parliament has evidence and refers to these matters? The answer is nothing. This failure on the part of our public administration to respond to these crises as they emerge is an issue we must address. It is a scandal that it takes a television programme for us to respond to issues raised in this and the other House for the past four years while the Government has simply looked the other way and blamed and ditched officials at its call. That is wrong. That is the reason we need to debate this matter tonight and the reason our party will devote the two hours available to us to such a debate tonight.

He may prefer, however, to have it seconded by a Member within his party. If he agrees, I will second the motion.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	5	He has signalled that he will accept that offer. My colleagues join me in supporting this motion. It is an important issue and I congratulate Deputy Brian Hayes on taking this initiative. I do not believe there is any party division on this issue. This is a moment when the Seanad can respond directly and immediately. For the Fine Gael Party to cancel its long-standing commitment to this procedure and its existing motion and substitute it with a motion that will have more relevance to people in Ireland is something Members on all sides of the House can commend.It is right to draw the attention of the House and that of members of the public, if they become aware of this, to the fact that Seanad Éireann has pursued this matter consistently for a matter of four or five years but not much has been done. I understand complaints have been made by concerned relatives over a number of years but nothing has happened. At least eight complaints were made by relatives. Therefore, it is appropriate to deal with this matter and I second the motion.We should have a discussion on charities in light of the very sad emergence of fraud within the Christina Noble trust. Like many other Members of the House I heard her on radio today and she was absolutely heartbroken. She is a very remarkable woman who has given her life to looking after the interests of abandoned children and people in great difficulties, particularly young people in Asia. She has been betrayed by people within her organisation. She has also been let down by us because charities are not properly regulated. This entire area needs to be examined. People can set themselves up as charities quite easily. There is very little regulation. There is also the practice where nice, decent young people are hired to go out and harass people for money. Sometimes I meet eight different collections on my way between O'Connell Street and here. There should be some degree of regulation.I wish to inform the House that following my attempt to raise a matter on the Order of Business some weeks ago, I wrote to Senator O'Toole, who is our representative on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, asking that we invite the McCartney sisters and Robert McCartney's fiancée to give evidence to us.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I support fully the proposal by the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes. We would be well advised to deal with this matter on which I sympathise fully with him. I want to elaborate on it in terms of this country's incapacity to enforce the regulations it makes. The nursing homes have a peculiar history. Until 1998, all inspection reports were secret documents until the Freedom of Information Act was passed. No health board was ever prepared to make available to the public or to potential users of nursing homes any report it had on its files about the quality or otherwise of care. People had to essentially buy a pig in a poke and could not even see a record of what the health board knew at that stage.People around the country have complained about the quality of such care. This morning RTE said a bundle of documents had been released to it under the freedom of information legislation. We have a problem which the legitimate and respectable part of the nursing home business has been asking the Government to regulate for 18 months. It appears that yet another brief went unread in the Department of Health and Children.We heard of the revelation this morning that the Health and Safety Authority is of the view that the roadworks where the awful tragedy in County Meath occurred were in blatant breach of health and safety regulations. Do we enforce any regulations here?Last week there was a revelation in one of the newspapers that our drivers are among the least likely to be stopped for speeding or drink driving in most of the European Union. There is a fundamental issue for this country in terms of how it does its business. We are forever passing regulations. I fear we are awash with illegal dumps. We do not seem to have the will to address these issues.I would like the Minister responsible for the public service, the Minister for Finance, to come into the House to advise us what he proposes to do to ensure all the laws and regulations in place are enforced by proper resourcing and enforcement and that there will be no dilatory unwillingness to wait until people get around to doing it themselves. I would like the Minister to come to this House to discuss that with us.While that Minister is here, we might talk not about the EU constitution but about the extraordinary issues arising from the results of the referendum in France. Some 82% of working class people in France voted "No", according to the figures I read. That is an extraordinary percentage. We must be careful in this regard. The neo-liberal consensus, mostly a consensus among people who will not be affected by the negatives of neo-liberalism, is being challenged by those at the bottom of the income group most affected by the prescriptions of a form of international trade, which is essentially undermining the living standards of the bottom 25% of the whole of western society. If we continue to adhere to a consensus which ignores a quarter of the populations of the Union's member states, we will end up with further debacles like the one we had on Sunday and the one we will have today. I say that as one who seems to have returned to the side I have always been on regarding the EU, being on the wrong side of every treaty.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Will the Leader consider a proposal that the House would formally acknowledge in some way the 60th birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi who has been incarcerated for the past 15 years? What prompted me to raise this matter is the intention of Galway City Council to confer the freedom of the city of Galway on Aung San Suu Kyi following the example of Dublin some years ago. I understand a relative of Aung San Suu Kyi will be there to receive the conferral, which is to coincide with her birthday. My colleague, Senator Mansergh, and I have on many occasions engaged with the unofficial Burmese Government in exile on this issue over the past number of years. It is important in the context of human rights that the unacceptable incarceration of Aung San Suu Kyi should continue to be highlighted.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Hear, hear.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	14	This House is an ideal vehicle to do that. I would be grateful if the Leader might, in the context of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, initiate some process to acknowledge the occasion of Aung San Suu Kyi's birthday to give maximum effect to the publicity that hopefully would surround it.In the same vein, this House rightly condemned the imprisonment of a frontline defender who was coming to Ireland some weeks ago to receive an award. In recent days a representative of Médecins Sans Frontières was arrested by the Sudanese authorities on the basis that he refuses to disclose medical information contained in a report which was endorsed by the UN and by Kofi Annan outlining in great graphic detail the rape of several hundred Sudanese women and young girls. They have arrested this individual representing Médecins Sans Frontières on the basis that the report is false. This House having already expressed its outrage at the earlier incarceration should do so again. I would be grateful if the Leader would convey the outrage of the House at this representative’s arrest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and if he, in turn, would convey to the Sudanese authorities that it is unacceptable to arrest a representative of this aid organisation of the highest integrity.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	15	This House owes a debt of gratitude not only to the "Prime Time" programme but also to the High Court judge who refused an injunction to the owners of the nursing home involved. His decision did the country a great service. There has been significant media coverage of this issue in recent days but had the injunction been granted we would probably not be discussing it today.This House should co-operate fully if legislation to deal with this problem is expedited to pass before the summer recess. It is important that this happen because it is a shocking indictment of the system that the health board inspectors visited only 78 of the 430 private nursing homes last year. There are also 500 State-run hospitals. It is imperative to set up an independent inspectorate.While I accept that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power, is a sincere person, it is a bit rich for him to say that the inspection procedures were ridiculous. As Senator Brian Hayes said, the documentation reveals this situation was identified as ridiculous over many years. I hope this House will accelerate whatever legislation and action are required to deal with this issue which is a matter of concern to many people. We all empathise with the difficulties the people involved are experiencing.It may be desirable to offer tax incentives to encourage the development of private nursing homes but is the mercenary impulse driving out the social and caring dimension in them? That may be a corollary to tax incentives. We need to be careful and watch for this trend.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Senator Ryan struck a chord with me when he referred to compliance with legislation. We may not need to pass more legislation but to develop an attitude towards compliance. I support Senator Brian Hayes's proposal that we debate the nursing home scandal today because we can do something about this immediately.Our main effort, however, should be to encourage citizens to comply with the law. For example, the chairman of the National Safety Council said the number of arrests for road traffic offences had increased but the number of convictions had reduced. I am not sure of the reason for this but it seems possible to change attitudes.I was in France and Italy recently and noticed the number of motorcyclists there who do not wear helmets. Very few motorcyclists here do not wear them. We have managed to install a system such that people recognise and comply with that law. They are beginning to comply with the law on seat belts. We may have to change that law. They do not, however, comply with the law on speeding and drink-driving offences. The National Safety Council's report and proposals could be a worthy subject of debate.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I support Senator Norris's call for regulation and legislation of charities in view of the alleged misappropriation of funds from the Christina Noble Foundation. Various reports in 1990, 1996 and 2002 indicated the urgent need for regulation and legislation for 6,500 registered charities. Allegations of such a significant misappropriation of funds indicate an urgent need for control in this area.It is regrettable that the Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Noel Ahern, who has responsibility for this area, responded to this issue by saying it required major legislation which will not be ready till 2006 at the earliest. That is not good enough. Will the Leader request that the Minister of State reconsider that to protect the confidence of the generous public in charities?On a related matter, it is unacceptable that in rural towns, particularly on Fridays, pensioners who go to post offices and banks are intimidated by people collecting for charity. Nobody knows whether these are legitimate registered charities or whether the people do this for personal gain. This is an urgent matter and I ask the Leader to request the Minister of State to take immediate action on this phenomenon in rural towns.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I have an interest to declare in charities as chairman of the Ireland Fund, which is a charity. Together with other bodies in this field, it has pressed for some time for charitable legislation. All the major charities want legislation. The sooner it is put in place the better. None of what has happened detracts from the wonderful work done by Ms Noble. It is a great pity that any doubt should be cast on that work. People like her need the protection of regulations and control.While I agree there is a need for clear regulations in nursing homes, I also agree with those who say there is a need for enforcement of the regulations that exist. Given that the Health Service Executive pays for many of those services and enters into contracts, there should be pressure on it to ensure that the contracts include standards of care.I have inordinate respect and regard for the sisters of Robert McCartney who are tremendously courageous women. It would be an honour to have them in the House.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Will the Leader invite the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the House for a debate on waste management? This has become a major issue at local and national level. There have been many initiatives to educate people about their responsibilities but there is a great deal of illegal dumping on national primary and secondary routes, and county roads, as well as other locations in urban and rural areas. The cost of waste disposal is becoming a serious issue on which we urgently need a debate.We might include in that debate the introduction of subsidies for old age pensioners and families on low incomes for waste disposal because litter affects the local economy and environment and creates a public health hazard. It is important to debate this issue now because we have not debated it since we passed the Protection of the Environment Act almost two years ago.Like everybody else, I was dumbfounded by the situation RTE highlighted on Monday night. The station should be congratulated on the programme. The Government should oversee these nursing homes and ensure that regulation is in place to deal with the abuse shown on the programme.I wonder how many unfortunate elderly people were driven to an early grave by such abuse. This needs to be investigated. Everyone is sickened by the abuse shown on the programme. Ordinary decent people are infuriated by it. I support Senator Brian Hayes's call to adjourn our motion this evening and take this important issue because it concerns us all, particularly the elderly and most vulnerable.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I remind the House that the Chair has already ruled that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges can extend an invitation to anybody to address the House and it is a matter for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges only. The matter should be raised directly with the committee and not on the floor of the House. It would be appreciated if Senators would respect that ruling.

How can anybody at the stroke of a pen abolish such an area as an entity, and decree that a place of such long and honoured cultural heritage no longer exists? Many feel they are being called after a place in County Offaly, An Daingean. They do not want the name of any other town robbed for them.

We are also debating the Disability Bill. While these two matters are exercising public opinion another scandal is unfolding in regard to the lack of services being rolled out to those in the midlands and west for cancer treatment and BreastCheck. While the Minister and the Department of Health and Children have dropped the word "Hanly" the report appears to be implemented. I suggest the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children be invited to the House to discuss the health services. County hospitals such as Nenagh are being downgraded by stealth by the removal of services from rural Ireland. There is life outside the Pale but the Minister does not appear to recognise that. We need to have a discussion on health services for the people of rural Ireland, on the functions of the Health Service Executive and what has happened to the health boards. As these scandals are being debated, another scandal is unfolding. The health services should be debated as a matter of urgency.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I support what has been suggested by my party leader, Senator Brian Hayes, on the need to debate the nursing homes scandal this afternoon. It is the least we can do and is what the public would demand. When this issue is fully ventilated and dealt with, I would hope that between now and the recess we could have a broader debate on the issue of care of the elderly. This has been the subject of many reports but we need to seriously contemplate this crucial issue. The demographics are changing and the population is becoming elderly. In the future the issue of care of the elderly will be the biggest political issue here. The elderly may be out of political fashion today but we have a major responsibility to put in place systems and structures to ensure they are dealt with in a fair and reasonable fashion and can retire in comfort. Issues such as the carer's allowance, carer's benefit, nursing home subventions and so on need to be debated and addressed. I hope, once we have dealt thoroughly and openly with the current scandal, that we will look in a broader fashion at care of the elderly and their needs and the needs of those retiring. They have built up this country to what it is and we must be seen to respond to them.

It is unfortunate that the word "Hanly" has become a negative aspect of the health services given that there are so many positive elements in that document which could lead to a restructuring of the health services and put it on a solid footing. There are a couple of negative elements, for example, the proposed reduction in accident and emergency services at Nenagh and Ennis hospitals as part of a pilot programme. Clearly that is not acceptable to any of the politicians in that region. Ultimately I believe it will be changed. I would welcome the opportunity for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to come to the House and set the record straight. There is much public concern and, unfortunately, it is being generated by disingenuous organisations and groupings, particularly elements of the Opposition who have sought to make a political exercise out of this.

On the issue of the Irish language we have a set a non-political precedent in this House because both sides believe it is too important to be used as a political football. This debate is not just about placenames, it is about the Irish people's connection with landscapes and the anglicising of placenames and how we try to bring them back. There are other issues that must be brought into the debate, be it the Dingle issue regarding the branding of the tourism product or other issues in which local people must be involved. It is a debate for another time.A recent report has highlighted that a cost benefit analysis on a proposed cross-Border gas pipeline between Derry and Letterkenny has proved negative. Of course a cost benefit analysis would show red. That is the reason there are no cross-Border structure subventions under the peace and reconciliation fund, the International Fund for Ireland or INTERREG. Moneys are available to enable the Government provide funding to the north west.Senator Coonan referred to BreastCheck cancer services for women in the north west. This service is based on a cost benefit analysis but it should not be. The people in the north west pay the exact same taxes as people in other parts of the country and we should not be discriminated against. The provision of a service should not be based solely on economic reports based on mathematics. People are far more important.

I ask the spokespersons on health to please note they will be on duty tonight.Senator Brian Hayes raised the wider issue, one on which I have also been dwelling, of the tardiness of public administration in foreseeing things which can happen even when highlighted by debates in these Houses or by way of correspondence to newspapers. Account cannot be taken of everything but where significant issues emerge which are clearly damning and where abuse or neglect is the underlying cause, the general lack of response from both public administration and the political parties shows a culture of denial and inaction. Enough has happened in the past six to eight months for us to realise the enormity of the issue which should exercise the minds of those involved.Senator Norris seconded the proposal to amend the Order of Business for which I thank him. It is accepted. He asked for a debate on charities, which I will allow if time is available in the next three weeks.Senator Ryan said that until 1998, all inspection reports were secret documents until the Freedom of Information Act was passed. He questioned whether regulations are ever enforced and it is a question I often ask. More legislation is being passed and also more EU regulations but it is a question of enforcement.Senator Ryan also referred to the referendum in France and the one in the Netherlands being held today. He rightly said neo-liberalism is being confronted by the 25% of the population cohort at the lower income end of western society. In this context the House discussed pensions last week. I feel a little bit of a fraud talking about pensions because I have a pension which is guaranteed.Questions are being raised about the European Union. Senator Brian Hayes yesterday suggested we hold our fire until after the meeting of EU prime ministers in two weeks' time. It is a depressing situation and a way of dealing with it must be found.Senator Mooney asked the House to acknowledge in some way the birthday of Aung San Suu Kyi in the context of human rights. He asked that the House honour her by way of an all-party motion and I am confident if the Senator takes the lead in this matter, all party leaders will support it.Senator Mooney also referred to Paul Foreman, the representative of Médecins Sans Frontières who has been criticised and arrested by the Sudanese Government. He asked that the case be brought to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.Senator Finucane praised the High Court judge who refused an injunction to the owners of the nursing home involved in the "Prime Time" programme. The judge viewed the programme and gave his ruling that it should be screened. Senator Finucance said it is imperative that an independent inspectorate be set up. He questioned whether the tax incentives result in too much emphasis on monetary matters rather than on the social and caring role.Senator Quinn referred to issue of compliance with legislation. He supported Senator Ryan's point regarding the use of helmets by motor cyclists and referred also to the issues of speeding and drink driving. Much of this behaviour is a result of our history. For eight centuries we were fighting against those who made rules for our country. When we make our own rules the rebellious streak shows up.Senator Ulick Burke called for regulation and legislation of charities. He stated there are 6,500 registered charities and there is an urgent need for legislation. Yesterday, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, who has responsibility for this area stated that a wider consultative process had been engaged in. I will convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister of State. The Senator also referred to charity collectors outside post offices and banks on Friday mornings. I always ask to see the collector's permit and they usually show it. If they do not have a permit to show I do not contribute. If they have personal authorisation then they are entitled to collect.Senator Maurice Hayes declared his interest in this matter as chairman of the Ireland Fund. He said that all charities want legislation for the sector. Senator Bannon asked for a debate on waste management.Senator Coghlan is still hankering after Dingle and rightly so. He took exception to the name An Daingean on signposts.Senator Coonan asked for a debate on cancer treatment. I am sure the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children is well aware that life exists outside the Pale. She was in Athlone last weekend. However, inequality in cancer treatment exists.Senator Moylan took up the cause of the great clampers at Croke Park. Both he and I have our noses out of joint because of the results of the Offaly and Westmeath matches. The Senator also took exception to Daingean being downgraded so to speak. Many a fine Offaly person came from there. Senator Bradford supported Senator Brian Hayes and also believed we should have a broader debate on care for the elderly. Senator Dooley spoke of delivery of health services. He said that the name "Hanly" has come to be debased. The Senator believes that the proposed reductions in the accident and emergency service in Ennis should not proceed.Senator McHugh spoke about the Irish language and the connection between Irish people and their landscape. He also spoke about cancer treatment in Donegal. I agree with him and found it heart-rending to read the full-page report in The Irish Times last week. Some women admitted to volunteering for breast removal rather than make the bus journey for chemotherapy and radiation therapy twice or three times a week. I was very depressed for those women and I thank the Senator for raising the matter. We should try to have a debate on cancer care as soon as possible for which I know the Tánaiste would attend.Senator John Paul Phelan called on the Tánaiste to come to the House to discuss the Hanly report. I remember Senator Feeney speaking on the matter. Those on this side of the House never said that the report was dead.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Senator Brian Hayes has proposed an amendment to the Order of Business: "That No. 17, motion 12, should not be moved today, and that the two hours normally allocated for Fine Gael Private Members' business be given to the House to allow for statements by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for the elderly."
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I again welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, to the House. Yesterday I dealt with the issue of rights-based legislation. This morning I would like to deal with other issues, the first of which relates to consultation.The Government is frequently accused of not listening, a subject on which I would like to expand. During the preparation for the legislation, the Government facilitated extensive consultation with the Disability Legislation Consultation Group, chaired by the National Disability Authority. It comprises eight members representing more than 500 disability interest groups nationwide. As the Minister of State explained in his opening remarks yesterday, the DLCG met him. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights heard the views of more than 30 interest groups on the Bill last November. It received more than 40 submissions from the public. By any standards considerable consultation has taken place and as a result the Bill was fully reviewed in light of concerns expressed by DLCG and during its passage through the Dáil. Substantial amendments have been made and the Minister of State indicated that he might be in a position to accept more amendments in this House.While the Government proposed the option of an ombudsman, the appeals system was the preferred option. The complaints system has been simplified with greater emphasis placed on the review of the service statements. The implementation and progress on the legislation will be reviewed in five years. While it was suggested that this should be three years, to allow the legislation be fully implemented and fully assessed, many people in the disability sector regard five years as preferable. While one can always argue about how long it should be, in any event a timescale has been defined.Consultation is about listening. It falls to us to legislate. There is an opinion in some circles that the people who are consulted should be the legislators. In other words everything they recommend should be adopted. In some cases that is possible and in other cases it cannot be done. It is the job of the Government to legislate as appropriate.The experience definitely underlines that the Bill is necessary and needs to be disposed of by the Houses of the Oireachtas. Having listened to those with an interest in the outcome in various fora, the Government engaged in consultation and is satisfied that it has accommodated as far as possible the proposals made by the public, representative groups and Members of both Houses. A point must come at which the consultation ends, the Bill proceeds and the legislative process is disposed of. Consultation and amendment have continued during the process as the Minister of State has indicated. I believe the Taoiseach met the groups as recently as 25 May. I welcome that we have reached this juncture following an extensive consultation exercise.I would like to address the matter of funding. Again it is necessary to put certain facts on the record. An additional €205 million in current funding will enhance services for people with disabilities in 2005. As the Minister of State explained yesterday, €2.9 billion, representing 7.5% of gross current public expenditure, has been allocated this year. This is considerably more than the €800 million of public expenditure in 1995. We have seen a 3.5 fold increase in eight years, which by any standards is quite phenomenal. I fully accept that more remains to be done and that the situation is not perfect. However, a dramatic and welcome improvement has been made in the amount of money allocated to the sector.Figures have been given for the number of additional places for people with intellectual disability, and additional respite places, day care places, etc. Some €2 million has been allocated to meet costs associated with moving people to more appropriate placements. On physical and sensory disabilities, an additional sum of €15 million has been allocated. There are 60 new places for people with significant disabilities, more than 2,000 extra hours of home support and personal assistance, an additional funding of €3 million for aids and appliances, approximately 90 extra rehabilitative training places and additional funding to voluntary organisations. The record of funding exists. This is an important point that must be made quite strongly.We frequently equate resources with funding, but they are not the same. Sometimes we think of matters in simple monetary terms. The danger is that we neglect the question of the people involved. If we do not have properly-trained and experienced people — there is some evidence that we do not have the required numbers — it does not matter whether there is additional money, since the service will not be effective and funding alone will not suffice.We must be mindful not to get so far bound up in the issue of financial resources that we neglect human resources. The two are interlinked, but there must be an increasing emphasis on the quality of personnel in the service, their capacity to deliver and their professionalism in the specialist areas with which they deal. Extra funding will expand community-based adult mental health teams and provide additional community residential places, but it is not the whole story.I would like briefly to address some of the other criticisms that surfaced when the Bill was being discussed. One of them did so most recently this morning through some of the e-mail correspondence we received, to the effect that the Bill may be unconstitutional. In the first place, the Attorney General would not recommend legislation knowing it to be unconstitutional. However, it is not for us to determine the constitutionality or otherwise of the Bill. We can express a view on whether it is constitutional, which in my view it is. However, it is the job of the courts not the Oireachtas to determine constitutionality. This can be done by the President referring the Bill to the Supreme Court or by any group or citizen that considers it unconstitutional taking a court action.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Government did that recently.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	86	That is how the matter is disposed of. Another way is to suggest that the Bill contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights. Once again, the Attorney General would not advise the Government to initiate legislation and pilot it through these Houses if he considered it a breach of the convention. The same story applies; it is a case of legal challenge. If people believe it is a breach, they have recourse to the courts.The third, often repeated claim regarding the Bill is that it does not make it clear that services identified in the assessment of need for an individual must be provided within a reasonable and agreed period. In that context, I refer to sections 10 and 11, which provide that each person found to need disability-related services should be given a service statement setting out the health and educational services that can be provided. The service statement will set out the period within which those services will be provided, where appropriate.There are other points that need to be made, one of which concerns access. We have not gone nearly far enough regarding access for people with physical disabilities. In my own county of Kildare, the desk at the health board was two or three floors up in a building with a restricted lift; that is just not good enough. A health centre was built without specific access for people in wheelchairs; that is not good enough. There are swimming pool and sports facilities that people cannot access; that is not good enough.When I went to Luxembourg recently I was very taken by the fact that in one of the large public buildings I visited, there were wheelchairs inside the door. In other words, if someone arrived by car and needed a wheelchair, he or she would have it. That should be standard practice in Departments. We simply do not think about how it is to be restricted in sight or by having to use a wheelchair. In my local community in Newbridge, we have a very active access group. Some time ago it put public representatives in wheelchairs and let them try to get around the town, but it was just impossible.County councils make a great play of installing ramps and making footpaths accessible, but then the roads team comes along and carries out repairs that make it impossible to get onto the footpath. That is just not good enough these days, and we must have some regard to that practice.Senator Terry was correct in her comments on building regulations. There was a fair amount of hope in disability circles when the Part M regulations were introduced that many problems would be solved. It is quite apparent from some of the buildings that have been built since that the regulations are not being implemented as they should be.I am glad the Bill has been amended to make the literature easy to read. Legislation is by definition complex. It has to be so, since there is no alternative. Having said that, if one looks at some of the British legislation from the 1890s, one sees they were models of clarity in their use of language. We still need legislation that is fairly complex, but there should be some "translation service" to make it readily accessible to the ordinary citizen, particularly those with intellectual disabilities or even visual impairment, allowing them to read it easily.The 3% employment target is a matter of concern, and we must examine it. In county councils and local authorities there are great differences in the progress that has been made. It is not a very high threshold, and every Department and local authority should reach the mark for providing employment to people with disabilities. We have all met people who are eminently employable but have great difficulties in securing employment. On the other hand, we have such bodies as Care, which looks after people with intellectual disabilities in Kildare. It has been extremely successful in placing some of its clients in local communities and getting them jobs in shops and businesses. These are more fulfilling and fruitful jobs than those they had in some of the sheltered workshops which, although they did a good job at the time, are not an ideal situation now.We have made significant progress with this legislation. The Bill is badly needed and represents a vast improvement over the system that currently obtains. Despite that, it is not perfect, but if we wait for perfect legislation, nothing will get done, since the current systems will persist ad infinitum. The Bill improves the situation for disabled people, which is what legislation should do. The Minister has shown himself quite open, as he already did in the Dáil and, I am sure, will do so again.Where appropriate amendments must be made, he will make them. Judging from some of the literature we have received, one would think nothing had been done in the Dáil, yet there was a series of beneficial amendments. As I said at the start of this debate, I had serious reservations about this Bill, fewer after what happened in the Dáil, and fewer still after hearing the Minister of State speak yesterday. The Bill provides a legislative basis for the individual assessment of service delivery that is considerably more advanced than those in many other jurisdictions, something of which we should not lose sight.As I said, the legislation is only part of the story. We have heard a great deal about passing legislation which does not necessarily improve things. We need the will to do it. I am confident the will is there and applies across all sections of the two Houses to ensure people with disabilities have proper facilities, a good quality of life, and rights that improve their situation. This Bill has been introduced after an extensive period of consultation, debate and amendment. It provides a legislative basis for individual assessment of service delivery that puts Ireland in a position that will no doubt be studied and emulated abroad. It is not perfect, but it is an improvement, and as such I welcome the Bill.

It is clear from the provision of time yesterday, today and tomorrow that there will be such provision. That is very good.The Bill is a kind of dialectic. An earlier Bill had to be withdrawn because it was plainly unsatisfactory. I have no difficulty in agreeing with what was said by Senator Dardis in his reasonable speech. Other things may need to be tidied up and I understand from the Minister's speech that he is tabling further Government amendments. This Bill is in the process of being improved all the time and this Chamber will play a role in that.I am glad the Minister has accepted the idea of a review. I made this point in discussions with groups representing people with disabilities as I thought it was a sensible thing. They told me that they had already made a suggestion of three years, but the Minister suggested five years and they seemed to be quite comfortable with that.

As a former teacher, it seems to me that a continuous assessment would be a good idea. Having a review at the end of three or five years is not the best way to do it. A process of continuous assessment from the beginning gives a far better chance of reaching down into the consequences of the Bill and finding out what happens.Part 3 is the most significant element of the Bill, as it deals with access to services, public buildings and so on, as well as the sectoral plans. We must arrive at a situation where disability becomes a prime factor in Government policy and is factored into every Department. Someone in each Department should be charged with responsibility to enforce such a policy. Perhaps it should be the General Secretary.In a briefing Senator Quinn and I had with disability groups yesterday, we were told that €38 billion is spent on health services and people with disabilities get around 3% of that which is roughly proportional to their size. However, they made the point that they are excluded from many of the services provided for everybody else by virtue of their circumstances which could be remedied without a huge amount of expense. The Government has taken a practical view on this, which is understandable, but one which is open for us to challenge. Many people fear that a financial haemorrhage from a rights-based Bill could affect the Exchequer. They also fear that it would be left to the courts to deliver services.Many people talk about rights — I have been talking about them all of my life. I have come to the conclusion that rights are of no use unless one is in a position to exercise them. One can have theoretical rights, but unless there are practical mechanisms whereby one can obtain these rights, then they are of virtually no use at all.I was listening to the radio last night and there was a very good programme about an awards scheme that was won by a group from the west of Ireland. The scheme dealt with disability. The students got themselves into wheelchairs and went around the town with their companions. They were helped consistently by members of the public, but those people never spoke to the people in the wheelchair. They always spoke to the person who was with the person in the wheelchair. The young girl interviewed made the point that she had a problem with her legs and not with her brain. This is why people need consultation and the Government has gone some way to meeting that need.I listened to the programme "Outside the Box", presented by Olan McGowan who had an accident in his twenties and is now in a wheelchair. There was a discussion on disability and a woman representing the blind claimed that he should be able to play for Ireland or climb Kilimanjaro, only if it was made accessible. That is at the outer limit of political correctness and Mr. McGowan fortunately pointed out that we must live in the real world. We must attempt to imagine what the situation is like in human terms, so that we can be in a position to understand the desire for rights on the part of the disabled community. On the other hand, we also need to be realistic. The Government is moving to some extent in this direction.I have a document in front of me from the Disability Federation of Ireland, indicating that it is aware that the legislation is coming before the Seanad. The document states:If this legislation goes through without major changes, the DLCG and its member organisations will be left with no option but to reassess our future co-operation with the Government, Departments and agencies. We may also consider a nationwide campaign to alert the general public to the failure of the Government to meet our legislative needs.The federation feels that the Bill needs to focus on two matters to ensure that people have timely access to the necessary specialist services and to ensure that what Ireland has to offer becomes fully accessible to people with disabilities.We have not gone far enough in this Bill and I hope the Minister of State addresses some of the issues that have been brought to his attention by the Disability Federation of Ireland. He has included the Ombudsman in the Bill, but I am not sure if that is needed. It has been suggested to me that a disability commissioner is more appropriate. If the Minister of State accepted that, it would go a long way towards meeting the problems of the disabled community.

I am glad there will be a separate section in the Office of the Ombusdman. I understood from the speech by the Minister of State that it was all coming under the remit of the Ombudsman, who is already over-burdened. If the Minister of State can assure the House that there will be staffing and funding specifically dedicated to the issue, the Disability Federation of Ireland may well think that is a very good idea.The federation also states: "The value of the public investment is not around whether, for example, the wheelchair was purchased at the best possible price or terms, but by the measure of how it facilitates access for that individual". I do not see how the two are incompatible. It is a requirement of the Government to get the best deal if it is buying services with taxpayers' money. Senator Dardis mentioned a number of ways in which the Government has moved to meet some of these concerns and the DFI has accepted the changes.However, the Government's response to calls for the service preferences of the individual to be considered in the assessment process is that there will now be a requirement to "note the views" of the person being assessed. This is entirely ineffective. I have had my views noted until I am weary of expressing them but nothing is achieved.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	103	One of the difficulties of following Senator Norris is that he generally covers everything. In this instance, he has dealt with almost all the points I wished to make. However, I wish to concentrate on one particular issue. Only a certain amount can be achieved in the area of disability through legislation. A similar point was made in regard to another matter on the Order of Business. What is required is a mind set change. In this context, I am not sure the legislation is sufficiently positive. A great deal of it is concerned with solving problems rather than changing the mind set around disability.An example of a positive change is the ability awards that were awarded for the first time earlier this year. It was notable that they were called "ability" awards rather than the "disability" awards. These awards served to emphasise that people with disabilities have other abilities and that we should concentrate on the ability instead of the disability. As an employer for many years, I have encountered job applicants who are regarded as disabled and unable to perform certain tasks. I invariably find, however, that they will be able to perform some other task adequately. This is the mindset change that is required. We must concentrate on what people are able to do and must assist them in that regard.Some years ago, I encountered a young wheelchair-user in one of my stores and asked whether she needed assistance. She replied that everything was fine and that people were always willing to help if she needed assistance in reaching an item and so on. Upon meeting her again at the check-out some 20 minutes later, she asked me if I had heard the announcement about a car which was causing an obstruction. When she told me this was her car, I asked whether I could provide her with any assistance. She explained that just as she had been about to park her vehicle in the disabled space, another motorist had taken the spot. She had decided to park behind that vehicle and informed me she would be finished her shopping in approximately 20 minutes. This particular supermarket is close to the airport and she observed that the motorist may well have been on the way to catch a flight. That gentleman will never again park in a disabled parking space.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	105	It is great that she had such a positive attitude. I am sure the motorist who parked in the disabled space was shamed out of ever doing so again. Any anger he may have felt was surely deflated when the woman in the wheelchair finally returned to her vehicle. A positive development in the retail sector is the inclusion on the packaging of some products of information in braille, most notably those products that might be lethal if ingested, such as cleaning detergents and so on.There are some indications in the legislation that the correct approach is being taken. Moneys allocated in this area should be seen as an investment rather a cost. We must take a positive attitude in this regard. However, I am not sure the mind-set has changed all that much. In reading the scripts of the Dáil debates on the Bill, I noticed that Deputies concentrated to a significant extent on Parts 1 and 2 and not enough on Part 3.Senator Norris makes the case for a commissioner of disability whose job is to play a positive role rather than merely solve problems. The function of the Ombudsman is to settle complaints. The advice we have received is that those involved in the disability sector would like to see the appointment of a person who could take a positive role and attitude in safeguarding the rights of those with disabilities. The Irish language commissioner is a good example to the extent that it is a role which allows for a proactive approach in seeking opportunities to promote a particular cause. I accept the Minister of State's point that the Ombudsman can take a strong role in the area of disability. However, the function of that office is primarily to solve problems as they arise rather than to take a proactive and positive approach.Senator Dardis observed that we have had a national debate on disability which has been ongoing for several years. The views of those concerned have been listened to and progress has been made in many respects. However, there has been no closing of the gap between those who insist on rights-based legislation and those who contend that such is a step too far. It is a classic example of a problem wherein the heart leads in one direction while the head says something different. Nobody lacks sympathy for those with disabilities and nobody would seek to deny them their role as full citizens. However, there is a reasonable concern that an open book should not be left open which allows rights to be established for which the associated costs are inestimable. I understand the difficulty in this regard.Nobody would deny we have been unduly parsimonious in this respect in the past and that this has too often resulted in unfair discrimination against persons with disabilities. The Government has demonstrated recently — most notably in the relevant allocation in the budget — a recognition that we must do better in this area. The sums envisaged for the future are very generous when compared with what has been spent in the past. The Government and the vast majority of Irish people are convinced that far greater resources must be allocated in the future than has been heretofore to provide for the needs of persons with disabilities.Important advances have been made and the signs are positive. However, it is necessary to strike a balance in this area because we must not commit ourselves by law to do something which we may be unable to do in the future. I often have disagreements with the mandarins in the Department of Finance but I am inclined to believe they have got the better of the argument in this case. At any given moment, a state has a finite amount of money to spend and a not quite finite list of proposals on which to spend it. Getting the balance right between the two is the job of the Government. This is what we must do in this case in legislation.One area in which we can do something is in attempting to change minds and attitudes. We must adopt a "can do" approach rather than focussing on solving problems after they have arisen. I have always been impressed by the Oxfam maxim which observes that giving a man a fish will feed him for a day but teaching a man to fish will feed him for life. This is the approach we should take. It is a question of identifying and solving problems rather than considering this only as an issue of costs. In the past, a person with a mental disability was placed in a mental hospital for the remainder of their lives at significant cost to the State. We must find a positive attitude that sees beyond such persons' inability to lead a regular life and attempts to nurture the talents they possess so that they can make a success of their lives.There are some positive steps in that direction in the legislation. In is in this context that we will consider what improvements can be made on Committee Stage. The Department's position has changed significantly in the last number of years since the original and entirely unsatisfactory Bill was introduced. There are voices crying out to be heard and they have been heard to some degree. However, we can do much more in the future.Some years ago, a colleague of mine broke his shoulder in a skiing accident in Austria. I accompanied him to the hospital and found that the doctor behaved exactly as Senator Norris described in that he spoke to me rather than to the patient in the wheelchair. The doctor asked me what had happened and, after conferring with Jim, I explained the situation. I then relayed the information that the doctor had decided to test Jim's shoulder. The doctor, after taking hold and shaking Jim's shoulder, asked me if the problem had been ameliorated. Jim at that point asked me why the doctor did not speak to him rather than me. Here was a man with a broken shoulder who, because he sat in a wheelchair, was addressed as if he was also disabled in his mind. We are attempting, by means of the current legislation, to change this mindset. While this Bill will take us a number of steps in this direction, a longer step remains before we can say that people we once called "disabled" are actually "able". We must determine what they are able to do. If such people are nurtured, the country will reap the benefits.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I welcome the Minister of State to the House, congratulate him on bringing this important legislation before us, and thank him for the commitment and energy he has shown on this matter. I note from the correspondence I have received that he met with a number of organisations. Last week, I was honoured to meet with the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, and was impressed by its argument. I have been involved with and met the Irish Wheelchair Association members in Tuam on many occasions.Questions on the ring-fencing of funds arise in the context of this Bill. The Minister of State is attempting to address this issue and has made some changes following the debate in the Dáil. He said he is committed to further changes. It is important that whatever funding is made available will be ring-fenced for the area of disability rather than sought for other Departments or health matters. I support the objective of Tuam members of the Irish Wheelchair Association to prevent the treatment of people with disabilities as second class citizens. The right to an assessment of need must not be resource dependent. While the Minister of State has responded to this issue, the Government, hopefully by means of this Bill, should provide services sufficient to address needs.The DFI focused on the issues of timely access to certain specialist services and the opportunity for people with disabilities to make use of all this country has to offer. These human rights issues are as important as education or the matters we discussed with regard to the elderly. It is imperative that we address human rights. We should acknowledge and learn from past mistakes rather than continue to commit them. In 1997, a commitment was made in the programme for Government to ensure disability was placed on the agenda of every Department and public body, where it belongs. This remains the most significant challenge faced in Ireland.Senator Norris referred to value for money, which was one of the issues raised by the DFI. This is not about the purchase of a wheelchair at the lowest possible price but about access. We should remember what happened when Mr. Brian Crowley, MEP, was a Senator. Members will recall that the passage to the restaurant included a number of steps. We acted quickly to ensure that area and this Chamber were made wheelchair friendly. New elevators were installed and corridors widened. This is a positive example of the actions which should be taken in every public building. We are all aware of the issues that arise where local authorities, community halls and schools have not taken the appropriate action to satisfy the rights of people with disabilities.The Minister of State has expressed enthusiasm in addressing the issues which arise in the context of public transport and other services suchas employment, community participation, recreation, cultural activities, training and third-level education. The DFI noted that people with disabilities should not be denied funding from the public service expenditure of €38 billion and that legislation should provide a cornerstone for full inclusion. It was also noted that, rather than fear legal challenge, the public service should proactively design for the needs of disabled people. Regrettably, the areas of disability and education have involved extensive recourse to the courts.I commend the Minister of State on the progress made on this Bill. In the opinion of the DFI, the key issues have been reduced from ten to five. The Minister of State referred to these issues in his opening address. I welcome the suggestion that an ombudsman be created in this area. The role of a disability commissioner was compared to the positive actions taken by the language commissioner to ensure activities could be conducted through Irish. I will take the Minister of State's word that the Ombudsman is a better option.It is welcome that a review of the legislation will be conducted. Sectoral plans, which were discussed by the DFI, are important but unappreciated by local authorities, especially in the area of housing. During our debate on the rural housing guidelines, the Minister noted the reference to disability included in those guidelines thanks to the lobbying efforts of Councillor Nick Killeen and interested organisations. I hope that local authorities will pay heed to these guidelines when considering applications for planning permission.It is disappointing that no specific provision was made for employment. Cross-departmental policies, which are often referred to as "joined-up Government", would be welcome in this matter. The Irish Wheelchair Association in Tuam has stressed the need to include a requirement to provide services within a reasonable and agreed timeframe. The Minister of State addressed this matter. All Departments should have a clear statutory duty to formulate sectoral plans, in which regard I welcome the Minister of State's remarks. He had a meeting on 6 May at which he said the first four of the five key recommendations would be addressed in the overall strategy. The Taoiseach offered to have meetings with each of the relevant Ministers to discuss the plans and I understand they will take place. The Taoiseach's initiative is welcome.Senator Kett raised the issue of disability proofing which is a very useful place to start a discussion on the rights of the disabled. While the current period is one of intense activity as many organisations work to influence the final outcome of the Bill, my reading of the legislation and the Minister of State's address indicate we have come a long way towards creating very good provisions. There is an issue of access in the context of the layout of the Dáil and Seanad, in which context the Disability Federation of Ireland's slogan, "Access all areas", is a good one. To enact the slogan as policy will vindicate human rights.I have worries which relate not to the Bill but to the way in which we do our business. As a former teacher, I am aware that access to schools is an issue. I remain concerned that roads divide the campuses at many schools, a problem which is far too common in County Galway. All schools have the ambition to have a campus on one side of a road only. Were it not for the fact that we have special needs assistance at mainstream schools we could not provide education for young people with disabilities. I hope we can continue to promote such education, although we should be very clear that it costs money. While it sounds very simple to bring all elements of a school to a campus on one side of a road, it is an expensive process as the Minister of State knows.I referred earlier to local authorities, which have many new buildings accessible to all. Some older local authority buildings in too many counties, however, have very poor entrances and lack accessible lifts and toilets. There have been many campaigns on footpaths but while the attitude exists that someone should be there to help out, it would defeat the purpose of the Bill to adopt such a measure. We must ensure that campaigns of this type succeed. In Dublin and other cities, there has been a significant problem with access to taxi and bus transport. While there was a reluctance to provide accessible taxis and buses in the past, we have made some progress. I am not as happy about progress on rail transport. As a frequent train user, I am aware of a lack of access for the disabled. As Senator Kett knows, there are many small stations which are automated and at which one no longer buys tickets. They are not staffed by the number of personnel people might think. Disabled persons are not facilitated to embark and disembark from trains, which is disappointing.We have campaigned long and hard at parliamentary party level in Fianna Fáil on the grant for disabled drivers, in which I would like to see some changes. While many changes have been made to the grant process in the past, difficulties continue to be experienced with the type of grant available and excise duty. A clear scheme should be established to help those with disabilities which no longer puts so many rules and regulations in place that it is almost impossible for disabled people to obtain assistance.Senator Quinn referred to parking. I commend RTE, which has on many occasions sent reporters to parking areas in towns and cities to challenge people who have parked in spaces reserved for the disabled. Unfortunately, some people think that anyone can park in these slots. If we bear the policy in mind and remember Senator Quinn's remarks, people will eventually learn that there are certain spaces which are reserved by right for those with disability which should not be used by able-bodied people who wish to take the easy way out.People who have concerns about the Bill would do well to read the Minister of State's comments. Changes have been made to the legislation in the Dáil and Government amendments will be tabled, which is welcome. The Minister of State has met many organisations and it is a matter of regret that some have pulled out of talks. The decision was theirs to make. Those organisations which have stayed in talks have seen changes made. Lobbying on all sides in the Houses has ensured that real improvements will be made to the legislation. I wish the Minister well in the rest of the talks and with the Government amendments which have yet to come forward.The focus in the Bill is on the vindication of people's rights, to which end a great deal of money will be provided. I will make no apology for saying a great deal of funding is required in this area. The Minister of State is in a Department which has already set aside significant funding for child care, to which to his credit the Minister of State has given much of his time. I hope we will be able to find the money necessary to ensure the legislation before us is successful. I thank and congratulate the Minister of State for bringing the Bill to the House.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	107	As the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and almost half the Cabinet were in attendance at the launch of the Disability Bill, I felt genuinely that the Government at last meant business on a most important issue. Surely, it could not be just another orchestrated PR event to give false hope to people with disabilities and their families. They say a leopard never changes its spots. Despite some purgatory in Inchydoney and an attempt to reverse some of the cuts in last year's budget, the Government could not resist a stroke. As a result, the most vulnerable sections of the community must suffer disappointment having been promised so much with such fanfare just a short time ago in September 2004. The people who wrote the speeches the Taoiseach and Tánaiste made at the launch could not have read the Bill as their words bore no resemblance to those outlining its provisions.I was very disappointed by the Government guillotine on the debate on the Bill in the Dáil, as a result of which many amendments were not dealt with. It is not the way to behave in a parliamentary democracy and suggests an arrogance and complacency of which the public is only too well aware at this stage. The Minister of State said he believed he was introducing good legislation. While I do not suggest for a moment that some of the Bill's sections are not worthwhile, the Government seems to think it has a monopoly on wisdom in this area and is unwilling to accept contrary views from the Opposition benches or organisations representing people with disabilities.In recent correspondence with all Oireachtas Members, the Disability Federation of Ireland put forward five fundamental issues which remain to be addressed. First, there must be a clear and unequivocal right to an assessment of need which is not resource dependent. Second, the services identified in the assessment of need for an individual must be provided within a reasonable and agreed timeframe. Third, the Bill must provide for clear protection of disability specific resources. Fourth, the provision regarding sectoral plans must take account of the wider needs of people with disabilities. Fifth, each Department with relevant services must provide a sectoral plan and the Government must place a clear statutory duty on all Departments and public bodies to include people with disabilities in their plans and services, with appropriate monitoring and accountability.If we could make progress on these five points, this debate would be meaningful. It would improve the Bill significantly and lay the foundation for legislation which would genuinely give hope to people with disabilities and their families. It would also prove that the Oireachtas genuinely cares about disabled people and is prepared to take the necessary action which would improve their quality of life.If the Government should continue with its stonewalling tactics and state that there is no possibility of altering this flawed legislation, it will confirm that it has no interest in or intention of listening to people with disabilities. I welcome what the Minister of State said in his opening remarks last night about the five points to which I alluded. He said that people with disabilities and the DLCG met with the Taoiseach. However, the responses made to the five points were very milk and water ones. I hope the promised Government amendments in this regard will be stronger than was suggested by the Minister of State last night and will give teeth to what has been sought in the five points.I am pleased the Progressive Democrats spoke on the Bill. I welcome Senator Dardis's response. The party made little or no contribution on this important issue in the other House.For whom are public services — financed by taxes — designed? Are they for everyone or only those people who fit the narrow definition of what might be termed the "norm", those who fit into the mould? How this Bill is enacted will dictate what kind of society this is and how real is our commitment to inclusiveness. I am convinced the vast majority of people believe in empowering people with disabilities and providing the necessary resources to help them and their families have a better quality of life. This is what we should be united in providing through legislation. Sadly, the Bill excludes rather than includes the very people it would purport to protect.I read the Bill from beginning to end and the very complex language used made it difficult to understand. This point was also made by other speakers. In the past we often commented on the need for European legislation and treaties to use plain English but the language used in this Bill surpasses the bureaucratic speak of the EU itself. How are parents and ordinary people expected to understand sections of the Bill, when legal experts are on record as finding it difficult?It is the Government's duty and moral responsibility to ensure the delivery of quality services and remove the barriers that hamper full participation in society. We are prepared to engage in meaningful debate to ensure this legislation will provide the necessary support and quality services. However, the Minister of State must respond in kind, which has not been the case to date. We look forward to this on Committee Stage.If we lived in a country with no Exchequer surplus and an economy that was floundering, then some could say — without justification — that the Government could not afford accessible housing or respite and residential care for people with disabilities. However, this is not the case. The country is awash with money. The wealthiest people in the country avoid paying any taxes while at the same time elderly parents of children with disabilities worry and wonder what will happen to their children when they die. Many families of people with disabilities struggle. They are at risk of poverty and are under severe emotional and physical stress. For far too long we have consigned people with disabilities to a land that cannot afford or value them. It is time for this attitude to change. The barriers we place in front of people and the attitudes we have to their participation are more disabling than any impairments they may have.The right to assessment is referred to more than once in the Bill, which I welcome, but it is open to interpretation whether resource constraints will curtail the so-called right to assessment on which the Government appears to place such emphasis. Even if resources are provided for assessment, the services are dependent on the availability of resources and, therefore, there is no obligation to provide these services within a reasonable and agreed timeframe.I question the process, as outlined in the Bill, for the qualification and appointment of assessment officers by the Health Service Executive. Has any research been undertaken to provide information on how many assessment officers will be required? If designated funds are not provided to the HSE to appoint these officers, the number of assessments could be constrained. Is there a plan in place for the appointment of assessment officers and is there a sufficient number of qualified people in the State to become assessment officers? These questions deserve straight answers. We are at risk of placing another layer of bureaucracy into the process, which may take from the actual delivery of services.When and if an assessment of needs is carried out, the last thing a person wants to hear at that stage is that no resources are available to carry out the work. This would add insult to injury. Nobody expects all the work to be completed immediately following the assessment but at least people should be entitled to a timeframe and a reasonable estimate as to when the necessary service would be provided.Section 16 deals with appeals officers. Perhaps it would it be better if these officers were to be appointed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform rather that the Department of Health and Children. It is important that the appeals process would be seen as an independent one and the HSE and the Department of Health and Children are two sides of the one coin.Section 36, which deals with the sectoral plan of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, provides that it shall contain information concerning measures to be taken to ensure compliance with Part M of the building regulations 1997. It is an indictment of the Government since 1997 that it is looking at measures to be taken to ensure compliance with Part M. This sums up the priority that the parties in Government have assigned to people with disabilities and their families. Senator Tuffy, Senator Dardis and others also referred to this point. It is evident that the regulations are not being adhered to, which is outrageous given that it is now 2005.The basis on which this Bill was formulated was to take the courts out of the equation rather than address the needs of people with disabilities. We all have similar human rights and people with disabilities have the same rights as everyone else but they cannot exercise their rights and opportunities because of the obstacles put in their way. The Bill as it stands, will do nothing to remove these obstacles.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. I congratulate him, the Government and senior staff in the Department for bringing this detailed and complex legislation before the House. Having read and thought about the Bill many times I consider that we were right to delay it. There was no question of its being railroaded through. This could not have been done. If we had done so, we would not have considered all its aspects.I welcome the fact that the Bill was based on the framework of existing legislation, including the equality status legislation. Last year we discussed at length education for children with special educational needs. We analysed the educational assessment of such children and considered how we would devise a plan and how it would be implemented. This was to lead up to this major Bill. It had to be done.I welcomed the discussions on all the relevant issues and problems held by the vast and widely representative Disability Legislation Consultation Group. These included discussions among its own members and discussions with many Ministers, Ministers of State and senior officials. A sub-committee of the Cabinet sat to discuss the issues in question. I am very happy that these discussions were held. Interestingly, the Disability Legislation Consultation Group produced a document called Equal Citizens. I like this title. The document set out all the provisions that would be necessary for the legislation to work. Therefore, to suggest no groundwork was done before we began to prepare this Bill for discussion is incorrect.We have a good Bill to start with and discuss. Of course there are pitfalls therein. We met the Disability Federation of Ireland and noted that while it is not 100% happy with the legislation, it is happy that some amendments were made. It is more ready for discussion. The Government is a listening Government and the Taoiseach went so far as to launch the mainstreaming process last year. He ensured it would be the basis for this Bill.I am very pleased that the legislation is built on a good foundation and we are now ready to talk about the Bill proper. However, I am a little concerned over the definition of "disability". The Bill refers to those who have communication difficulties, mobility difficulties or language difficulties. I would have liked the Bill to have enlarged on this a wee bit. Where would the deaf or blind fit into this category? The definitions are not broad enough.Reference was made to an independent assessment and the making of an assessment regardless of resources. I hope assessors will not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach in their assessments and that these assessments will not be restricted so as to adhere to certain guidelines. I am very concerned over the assessors' brief.I am trying to think through how the passing on of the independent assessment to the liaison officer will work on the ground. I hope the service statement, which will be produced through the liaison process, will be created with a priority in mind and subject to a certain timescale. Who will be appointed as liaison officers? When will they be appointed and how will they work? Coming from an educational background, I am trying to understand how the process will work on the ground. Perhaps the Minister of State will refer to this in his reply.I welcome the statement that if the applicant is not satisfied with the independent assessment and with the services provided, he or she has a means of redress by making a complaint to the complaints officer. If this occurs, the complaints officer will try to mediate, if necessary. If this fails, the case will be passed to an appeals officer. It is great to have all these facilities on hand. It is reassuring for disabled persons that their disabilities are being acknowledged, and also reassuring for their families. The legislative provisions in this area serve as a great way forward. I hope the appeals officer, chief executive officer and perhaps the complaints officer can work out a schedule such that appeals can be analysed.New staff will be appointed as assessment officers, appeals officers, etc. What qualifications will assessment officers have? On educational assessments, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act made reference to educational psychologists. Will psychologists make assessments of need under the Disability Bill? If so, they will need a broad brief given the range of disabilities that exist. How will we be able to define the qualifications required of someone making an assessment?Educational psychologists will make assessments in respect of persons with special educational needs up to 18 years of age. Consider the case of persons with special educational needs who are older than this, who are in the education system and perhaps doing quite well but learning at a slower rate than others. When responsibility for the assessment of such persons is transferred to the Department of Health and Children and when they are placed in a different setting, continuity will be required in their education, regardless of the extent of this education. Some can do quite well, including remedial students or those with a reading age of eight or nine at the age of 18, but I would worry that their education or training would be stultified in some way if they were taken out of their existing environment and shifted to another. There should be continuity because relevant persons who are under 18 come under the remit of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act while those who are over 18 will be under the remit of the Disability Bill, when enacted. I am concerned about this because one month can make a difference to the way of life of a person in this category.I welcome the requirement for certain Ministers to create sectoral plans to facilitate access to employment for those with disabilities. These plans will be monitored. The Disability Federation of Ireland suggested that the feasibility of the plans on the ground be monitored. Timescales are very important regarding service statements and access to employment to ensure there will be no discrimination.It is rather interesting that there will be a new centre of excellence compelling architects to redesign buildings to make them more accessible. This is to be welcomed, as is the fact that the 3% employment target for recruiting people with disabilities into the public service will be maintained. This reinforces the point that we must have equality of opportunity and equal status for everyone. We must have equal status for everyone and this is the cornerstone of this legislation. The mainstreaming of public bodies and the sectoral plan with the various Departments are comprehensive initiatives. The granting of assessments is crucial for creating confidence with families who may have problems. Ideally such assessments should be granted quickly and their findings implemented within a reasonable timescale.I welcome this Bill. The National Disability Authority will monitor employment and accessibility. I was also gratified to see the Minister of State has introduced measures as regards rules for broadcasting. With so many different broadcasting organisations on air at present and with the push for tighter and tighter profit margins, I was glad to see the need for access being incorporated into the legislation. Access for people with disabilities might have been one variable that some broadcasters would have been happy to do away with in the rush to cut corners. It is vital this service is maintained.There are many measures in the Bill, but the overall thrust is very positive. I have no doubt that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and the Government are eager for reform and have committed themselves to this piece of legislation. It has been a long time coming but it was well worth the Minister of State's while to do all the homework to bring it to this stage. I wish him well in its implementation. Of course there are areas which we will never get right because there is such a variety of disabilities. However, there is general consensus that a good day's work has been done in bringing this Bill forward and that the necessary preparation has been done in advance. The Bill's provisions will help people in many different ways; for this reason it is worthy of a good discussion in the House today and also on Committee Stage.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	109	Those who have the good fortune not to suffer from a disability, in many cases, do not notice the phenomenon. For many able bodied people the first shock they receive as regards disability is when they try to wheel a buggy around a supermarket for the first time. That brings the realisation of how difficult it must be for somebody in a wheelchair when so many supermarkets and multiple stores decide that all children's clothes must be on the second or even the fifth floor. The lifts are normally so small that one cannot fit a buggy into them, not to mention a modern powered wheelchair. A point made to me vigorously by many people is that the regulations for access are based on the presumption that people use wheelchairs without their own power. The larger wheelchairs cannot get into, never mind turn around, in most so-called disability proofed areas, such as toilets.I am not criticising the fact that we have not yet caught up with a welcome improvement in the quality of life of people. If we do not listen to people who are suffering from or living with a disability and those who support them, we will get it wrong over and over again. I do not want to be too specific, but a person appeared in a class that I teach, some years ago, with a severe disability. If I had been consulted in advance by the parents and asked whether this student was able for the course, I would have said "No", based on my professional judgment. That person did extremely well and is highly successful, working in an area of chemical engineering. This is an illustration of my lack of knowledge and understanding and of the need never to underestimate what people with disabilities can do provided certain minimal facilities are made available to them.There was a considerable controversy in Cork some time ago where the city council was redoing Patrick Street and putting in specific serrated pavements so that people with sight disabilities could know when they were approaching pedestrian crossings. Somebody in the traffic department decided that if these parts of the pavement were left for people with disabilities to use at pedestrian crossings, cars would park there. They promptly stuck bollards in these places, with the result that people who were unsighted would move confidently onto the surface, listen for the signal showing the lights were in their favour and walk promptly into a bollard. It has taken enormous argument to try to resolve this issue, because people do not listen.The argument with Government that I keep hearing from people with disabilities is that it will not listen. There are also a number of more fundamental arguments. The central aspect of this Bill with which most people take issue, however, is the question of whether it is rights based. There is an argument about whether the right to assessment is an unqualified right. I do not believe it is. However, there is a more profound argument being advanced by the Government, that even if we accept that this is an area where resources have to be available, it would not serve any purpose. A number of issues have arisen in this regard. One of them raised by the Government concerns international best practice. It has cited studies carried out in a variety of countries which are much more advanced than Ireland. It states there is not a single model anywhere and none of them has the unqualified rights-based legislation people are talking about.However, the Government's own position on this is the basis for the argument in this country for rights-based legislation. The problem here is that people have seen a great many areas where a minuscule level of discretion has turned into an enormous gap in service; or even where people have rights and these were ignored. What would have happened if we did not have unequivocal legal advice about old people in nursing homes? The money would not have been refunded and an extraordinary injustice would have been perpetrated. The unfortunate experience of Irish people, whether they have disabilities, is that even with a guarantee of something one does not necessarily get it. The corollary of that is that if one qualifies something by not making it rights based or by having it resource linked, one is effectively telling people they have no guarantee at all to any access to service. That is the experience.Let us go through the list. Children have an unequivocal right to free primary education. We have managed to interpret that in a way which means that their unequivocal right to primary education is serviced by schools that, in many cases, the Health and Safety Authority regards as unsafe and many parents consider dangerous. We have qualified that right even where it exists. Therefore, our citizens do not trust the State to provide services it claims it is providing.There is the industrial inspectorate which is covered by rights-based legislation. Workers have a right to work in a safe environment, to a minimum wage and so on. However, the State's response to ensuring access to such rights is illustrated by the fact that in 1933 the State had 16 industrial inspectors and in 2005 it has 21. The State's response is to hold back the capacity of the citizen to seek its support to enforce existing rights. That is the reason our citizens do not trust the State any more. It is the reason, according to the Government's study, people here are uniquely seeking rights-based disability legislation, but I am not sure the seeking of such legislation is quite that unique. The matter may be to do with jurisprudence in other countries. However, that is the Government's argument.The reason people seek this legislation is that they do not trust the State because their experience is that of an appallingly poor Administration with letters being unanswered, requests not being responded to or ignored and issues being long fingered. That is the reason people want rights-based legislation. To put it mildly, it is disingenuous of the Government to launch into the usual arguments about litigation and the fact that lawyers get more money out of that process than the litigants. They do because often the families who go to court on behalf of people with various needs do not seek compensation for damages but the right to a service that is supposed to be provided for their children. If they did not have access to the courts, they would have even less of that right. If we were to follow through on the Government's logic on this matter, we might as well abolish the Constitution. Why should we give people unqualified rights under the Constitution on the basis that this only makes money for lawyers? That is the argument put forward by the Minister of State in his contribution. He said that "for every €1 given in settlement of legal cases paid out by the Department of Education and Science, €4 went to pay the fees of members of the legal profession". The reason they could go to court in the first place is that a constitutional guarantee exists.It is interesting that the great and the good here — in the personages of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and those who make long speeches — and the findings of a number of reviews have come down firmly against the idea of socio-economic rights. I find that astonishing because these groups are overwhelmingly dominated by people who have socio-economic rights. They are usually well off, well paid, secure in their employment, their old age and their housing because of their good fortune. They write reports about our Constitution to the effect that nobody should have those rights guaranteed in the Constitution but they have them guaranteed because of their class or good fortune. Why should people not have a right to shelter and a basic income? Why should people who are suffering from a disability not have a right to the necessary services to enable them to have a decent life? Some people get that by good fortune but apparently we are prepared to say that other people should do without it forever. That is the argument about socio-economic rights. We seek socio-economic rights for citizens, rights which most Members of both Houses of the Oireachtas take for granted. No Member of the Houses of the Oireachtas, irrespective of what happens to him or her, will sleep on the streets, ever have a major problem getting to a hospital, or suffer from poverty in old age. Apparently, to give that guarantee universally and constitutionally would somehow turn upside down our system of jurisprudence. That is what this legislation is about.We have reached a position where people, particularly people with disabilities in the case of this Bill, do not trust the State. That is a fundamental point. They have been let down time after time and know other people who have been let down. They know the services that are supposed to be guaranteed do not work. They are of the view that the least they can get, in the context of this legislation, as a base from which to start is a rights-based guarantee which they can exercise, if necessary and presumably reluctantly, through the courts.Nobody would dispute that there is much in the Bill that is most welcome, although I cannot believe it took eight years to draft many of its provisions. A Government that enjoyed eight years of the best economic performance, handed over to it by the best Government the country had in the past 20 years, could not get around to dealing with the issue of people with disabilities until late into its second and final term. It finally has a shot at it now, although it has had a succession of shots. The Minister of State is positively eloquent about the levels of consultation but he then tells us, having had all that consultation, that he had to introduce a large number of amendments because the Government got it so wrong. Does the Government listen? Some of the amendments introduced by the Minister of State in the Dáil are astonishing. I read his script, and I am careful to read such scripts, and regarding the amendments introduced in the Dáil, there is reference to the definition of "substantial restriction to ensure certainty". Could the Government not have got an agreed definition before it started this process? Why did people in Opposition and in lobby groups have to shout so loudly to get that?There is reference to the operation of the Bill being reviewed within five years. Why will that be necessary? Does the Government not understand that people were wary and did not trust it because of previous experience? There is a long list of such references but it is astonishing that it took another lobby, after years of lobbying, to get the Government to introduce what appear to be eminently reasonable amendments. That is the nub of this issue. To whom is the Government listening?Behind all the good intentions, and I accept the good intentions of many people in Government — there is no one in Government against people with disabilities — there are two issues. The first of these is the extraordinary reluctance of the Department of Finance to envisage any kind of rights-based social provision. The history of that Department, and I have only read some aspects of the history by Professor Ronan Fanning, is of profound conservatism. There is the interesting information it fed to the Government in the 1950s about the imminent collapse of the welfare state in Britain which had only been introduced in 1945, yet the Department was prophesying its imminent collapse by the 1950s. That is the ethos of that Department. I heard a senior official say that cutting taxes is always a good thing. If one believes that the job of a Department of Finance is always to cut taxes, if one gets a chance to do so, how could one reconcile that with a commitment to a set of rights properly set down and a commitment to fund those rights?One can imagine the shock and horror in the Department of Finance at the idea that Labour and Fine Gael have in common, one of the many ideas we have in common,——
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	110	The parties have very little in common.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	111	——namely, to enshrine a commitment to ODA in legislation to guarantee what the Taoiseach promised in New York. That is what rights-based legislation means. It means we are saying this is a right with which we will not tamper because it is fundamental. Nobody believes a word one says when one can make a promise like that to the poor of the world only to let them down on the basis of that we are getting too rich too quickly. Why would people with disabilities believe differently?I will not rehearse the further issues raised by the disability legislation consultation group except to say that for those who do not share my direct involvement with people with disabilities they seem to be eminently reasonable requests. Everybody talks about resources but the relevant term here may be described as "Bertiespeak", if the Cathaoirleach will excuse the expression. On the one hand, people are guaranteed resources but on the other hand, section 5(4) states:In determining the appropriate allocation under subsections (2) or (3) in a financial year, the Minister or specified body concerned shall ensure that the amount remaining after the allocation is not less than the amount that is required, having regard, inter alia, to(a) the extent of the Minister’s or the specified body’s other obligations in that year,One must have regard to one's other obligations, which of course means that it will not be done. In the priorities of the Department of Finance, what may be described as "productive expenditure" comes before unproductive expenditure. Building roads is regarded as productive, investment in education is regarded as a social service. I have often asked the Department of Finance to explain on what part of education we could avoid spending money without reducing the country's productive capacity.The fundamental issue is that we decide either that there is a community in our society of people with disabilities who are entitled to a full share in the life this country can offer, or there is a group for whom we will do our best with plenty of rhetorical flourishes but with no guarantee that our best will be anything near their minimum requirements.There is much rhetoric about public buildings and access. I hope, therefore, when I return here after the summer recess that the engineering block, where many Senators have their offices, will be accessible to people in wheelchairs. At present it is an obstacle course. I would not ask a person with a serious mobility disability to come anywhere near it. I do not know who designed it, when it was planned or how it was built but it is not of the standard people are entitled to expect today.
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I thank the Minister of State and his senior officials for their attendance in the House. I commend him on his great patience and fortitude in this matter. He met many groups on many occasions and endeavoured in every way possible to make this Bill acceptable to everyone, particularly those whom it concerns directly. The Minister of State inherited this task from his predecessor, Deputy O'Dea. I was at the launch of this Bill some time ago.It may be asked if the Bill should have orginated from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Its implementation generally falls under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children. That, however, is irrelevant because it is the Government that has initiated the Bill and each Department had a say in that process.Has the Minister of State met any group which is happy that the Dáil passed the Bill last week? In this context I welcome the commitment by Minister of State and the Taoiseach to accepting amendments in the Seanad. This is important because otherwise we would have no role in this Bill. I know from my experience in Government that if the Bill was tabled close to the recess and the Dáil was already in recess, it would be impractical to accept amendments in this House.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this unique Bill which has the power to change fundamentally the way in which services are delivered throughout this State. The Bill has wide-ranging implications for all Departments which is evident in the inclusive way in which it was prepared.Significant debate has surrounded the Bill and the amendments brought forward represent a way of enhancing it. People with disabilities do not participate on a level pitch in our society. The Bill is part of a framework of measures which supports social inclusion. It is designed to ensure participation by people with disabilities in everyday life. It is a major, though long overdue, step in the development of services for people with disabilities.The implementation of this legislation has the potential to change radically how we treat and value people with disabilities. The consultation process attendant on the Bill exemplifies the way in which this Government listens. We have accommodated the changes to the Bill to address the concerns of the disability legislation consultation group.The Minister of State and the Taoiseach are active in ensuring that the needs of all interested groups are met. The Taoiseach met the DLCG last week when he agreed to consider several issues of concern to the group. The Government is committed to bringing forward several amendments to address as many of these proposals as possible.In the 2005 budget the Government made addressing the needs of the disability sector a clear political focus. The Minister for Finance ensured that the Bill is framed so that resources and positive measures can be focused on people with disabilities who are most in need of services. In the Estimates for 2005, published last November, the Minister announced an additional €290 million, or an 11 % increase in spending on services for people with disabilities, bringing the total to €2.8 billion overall, or three times the 1997 figure. The budget went further, including an additional €70 million current and €60 million capital expenditure for disability services in the health area.More significantly, the budget announced the provision of a special disability multi-annual package of €900 million for the period 2006-09, dedicated to the delivery of high priority disability services. This is a unique Government commitment. I welcome this and commend the Minister on ensuring that this funding has been ringfenced exclusively for disability services.The Bill makes several provisions for the allocation of resources for services. It sets out new rights for people with disabilities and places several obligations on public bodies in respect of them. These rights and obligations are not absolute but are subject to various conditions, and exceptions may be made in some cases.People with disabilities will be entitled to have their health and educational needs assessed, to have individual service statements drawn up setting out what services they will receive and to access independent complaints and appeals machinery. I am particularly pleased that there is now a clear further commitment to the 3% employment quota but this percentage is too low. There should be an effort in the Bill to raise this to at least an aspirational 5%. That should be the minimum not the maximum percentage in the public service. There are plenty of roles, opportunities and jobs available. It is essential to give people with disabilities these opportunities.This is much easier now, given the standard of new buildings and in the context of decentralisation. New buildings will be fully equipped and designed to ensure full accessibility for those with disabilities which will enable us to realise the minimum quota of 3%, but I strongly recommend increasing that to 5%. While general unemployment is running at less than 4.5%, estimates of unemployment among people with disabilities start at 60%. Therefore, there is much room for improvement.A number of key changes to the Bill have addressed the concerns of groups representing people with disabilities. In response to calls for a review process the Government is committed to review the legislation after five years. This timeframe allows all those involved to fully assess the positive implications of the Bill. It is important that a full review of the legislation takes place on a rolling basis. Many criticisms have been made of the Bill but hopefully they will be resolved before it is finalised and I hope we end up with the best possible legislation. Ultimately, the Government may decide to recommend to the President that she refer the Bill to the Supreme Court. That is an option the Government may wish to take to ensure it is constitutional.In order to take account of concerns about the wider needs of people with disabilities, there is a broadening of the sectoral plan of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to specifically include housing and accommodation. I listened to my local Shannonside Radio today where people telephoned in and said that deliberations on the Bill had been completed in the Lower House. I reiterate the point made in the House yesterday by the Minister of State when he clearly stated that arising from the consultation that has taken place, he has open mind in this regard, as has the Taoiseach and the Government. The Minister of State mentioned ten key areas of concern for the DLCG and those will be considered in the light of the proposals put forward in this debate.I have attended public meetings for many years as a member and chairman of the Western Health Board, Member of this House and as a member of Roscommon County Council and have heard many views expressed on a rights-based Bill and rights-based legislation. I wish to make a point in advance of the holding of a general election within the next two years. Politically, if not for the good sound reasons that it is right, it is essential for any Government to satisfy the needs of such a powerful and influential group as the disabled and all the organisations that represent them. Given that up to 400,000 people have forms of disability, it is essential that the Bill is accepted by the vast majority of those involved.At my constituency clinic last Friday I met a group called Brainwave, the Irish Epilepsy Association. It has made a detailed submission which I will send to the Minister of State. It makes the point that its members are not recognised in the Bill to the extent that there are different degrees of epilepsy and that the definition in the Bill is too narrow and inconsistent with other legislation. The definition of "disability" in the Equal Status Act 2000 is much more inclusive. By contrast, the definition in the Bill would exclude many people with disabilities who require services. For example, because epilepsy is not a permanent disability, people with epilepsy would no longer be defined as people with a disability. Therefore, they would be denied entitlements and access to services which they hold. These include disability allowance, occupational therapy and supported employment services. Perhaps the Minister of State would look at the submission and respond to it in the context of the Bill.The Irish Epilepsy Association maintains that the Bill has the potential to undermine section 4 of the Equal Status Act. I would like to hear the views of the Minister of State on that issue.The DLCG has proposed that the implementation of the legislation is reviewed after three years. This provision is not provided for in the Bill. I understand the Minister of State has indicated that the legislation would be reviewed after five years.

These are the concerns people have and they are being expressed to us. The submission by Brainwave, the Irish Epilepsy Association states:We believe we have a great opportunity to ensure that people with disabilities have the services and supports to enable them to participate fully in Irish society by enacting rights based disability legislation. However the Bill will not achieve that goal as it is fundamentally flawed and needs to be amended.We would be grateful if you could respond to this letter. In particular, we would appreciate if you would bring these views and concerns to the attention of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and the Government in general. We would also encourage you to raise these issues during the debate on the Bill in the Oireachtas and at parliamentary party meetings.That is what I am doing on behalf of Rebecca Leavy, community resource officer of Brainwave, the Irish Epilepsy Association. I have not outlined all the points raised by the association but perhaps the Minister of State's excellent and well-qualified public servants would prepare a response to the points made before Committee Stage.Eight people are on a waiting list for personal assistants in parts of County Roscommon. A Bill will mean nothing to them unless they are provided with these services. The personal assistant service is a marvellous development. It has empowered people with disabilities, particularly those with physical disabilities and confined to wheelchairs, who have been given freedom of movement by the assistance of their personal assistants. I wish to place on record the appreciation of the State to those who are prepared to work as personal assistants. They have enormous responsibilities which should be recognised.I have before me a submission from Councillor Molly Buckley, executive chairperson——

I am sure the Minister of State has received this submission. There must be a clear and unequivocal right to an assessment of need which must not be resource dependent. The services identified in the assessment of need for an individual must be provided within a reasonable and agreed timeframe. The Bill must provide for clear protection of disability specific resources. Provision has been made for that.The provisions regarding sectoral plans must take account of the wider needs of people with disabilities. Each Department with relevant services must provide a sectoral plan. So far as I am aware that issue was agreed and the Taoiseach and the Minister have discussed the sectoral plans for each Department. The Bill must provide for a clear statutory duty on all Departments and public bodies to include people with disabilities in their plans and services with appropriate monitoring and accountability.The Irish Wheelchair Association has in the past pledged services in a voluntary and professional manner for people with disabilities. Before there was a Disability Bill the association was in existence and has been supported by the public. As Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, the Minister of State was responsible for providing fishing stands for the disabled on the River Suck. That was a clear indication of his commitment to this area before he took on this portfolio. These fishing stands were well-designed for wheelchair bound people at Cuisle on the banks of the river. It is a clear indication of a commitment that has assisted so many to enjoy fishing. He has done much good work in that regard and it should be recognised. Given that the Minister of State has been elected on many occasions to Galway West and other constituencies prior to that and has great experience of public life, I have no doubt he will do his utmost to satisfy all the aspects of the representations made. I am sure the Department is inundated with representations.The Irish Wheelchair Association asks what is meant by the term "right-based". Without question, people with disabilities do not participate in Irish society on a level playing field. To do this would require many things to be done, including the provision of adequate services, education, employment opportunities, accessible built environment and transport infrastructure. This submission by the Irish Wheelchair Association was made in February 2005. I have attended many meetings. I would like a situation where I will be receiving positive e-mails. I received an e-mail today from another group, which is not too happy about the situation. The group is called EMBRACE, Promoting the Rights of People With Disabilities, and is based in Fairyville Lawn, the Lough, Cork. I asked for up-to-date views from all the groups. I have received only one reply. I have not been inundated with individual representations but rather representations from groups representing people with disabilities. Progress has been made over the years. Our slogan of, "A lot done, more to do", still stands in this regard. The EMBRACE e-mail states:Dear Senator Leyden,Thank you for your e-mail in relation to the Disability Bill 2004. What a sad day for all of us to see such a shameful piece of legislation passed by Dáil Éireann on May 26th last.This is typical of the reaction being expressed to me. I do not think the group is aware that the Minister of State is prepared to accept amendments in the House. I will make this e-mail available to the Minister of State.I am delighted to have had the opportunity to contribute to this Bill. I look forward to the amendments which the Minister of State has proposed on Committee Stage the week after next. When he studies all the submissions made I am confident he will do his utmost to ensure they are met in so far as is practicable in the circumstances. The Government can be proud that at least it is tackling this issue. I do not know of any other Government or any other party in Government that is prepared to put forward a better Bill than is being proposed by the Minister of State. I challenge anyone else to produce a Private Members' Bill to see how it compares with this Bill.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and his officials to the House. I thank him for staying for the Second Stage contributions from all sides of the House. I am aware of the effort devoted to this Bill in the other House by Deputy Stanton and other Deputies and the Minister of State.To take up Senator Leyden's challenge, I do not think it is a question of one Bill competing against another, but of getting it right this time. As other speakers have said, this Bill has been eight years in gestation. This House now has an opportunity to deal with it as conclusively as possible and to ensure the best possible deal for disabled people in this country.The Fine Gael spokesperson, Senator Terry, will circulate 100 amendments on Committee Stage and realistically, much of the work will be done then. As the Minister of State is a former Senator, he will be aware that Committee Stage in the Seanad is very different to Committee Stage in the other House, primarily because it is held as a plenary session whereas Committee Stage in the Dáil is made up of the principal spokespersons and the Minister.This House is a great fount of wisdom on this issue. Some Members have served time on health boards and are long-standing constituency politicians. Committee Stage will take place in two weeks' time and will provide an opportunity to tease out many of these issues in greater detail. The Minister of State will be aware of the long-standing tradition in this House that where ideas are brought forward on Committee Stage, the Government will consider them. He has already mooted his willingness to do so which is to be welcomed.Many of the critical amendments proposed in the other House were not accepted by the Government so I hope it will use this opportunity to have another look at this Bill in order to improve it to ensure we all support it. It is not a case that we wish to vote against the Bill but we are forced into doing so because of the caveats that currently exist in the legislation.Senator Leyden referred to whether or not the President should send this Bill to the Supreme Court, but this is a failure on our part to take responsibility for legislation. The President has the right to do that but it is also clear in the Constitution that the Oireachtas cannot enact legislation which it regards as repugnant to the Constitution. The reading of Bunreacht na hÉireann and case law leads to the conclusion that the Houses of the Oireachtas cannot pass a Bill which they regard as being repugnant to the Constitution. The right of access to the courts in Article 34.1 of the Constitution was vindicated in the 1966 case, Macauley v. the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights enshrines the right of access to the courts within a reasonable timeframe.If this House is of the view that this Bill puts limits on the two key rights of access to the courts and a reasonable timeframe within which the courts can determine matters, we are duty bound to oppose the Bill and not leave it to the President to refer the Bill to the Supreme Court. I ask the Government to consider this matter between now and Committee Stage. Both the Department of the Taoiseach and the Minister of State's Department are continuing to discuss these matters with the lobby groups. This House is genuinely concerned to make the best possible use of its time to ensure the Bill is a framework for the rights of disabled people.Last Thursday a large group from all over the country took to the streets on the day the Bill was being voted on in the Dáil. This does not bode well for the manner in which the Government has presented this matter. This Bill is the third separate opportunity for a legislative initiative which the Government has had in the past four years. It has been dealt with by three different Ministers. There is still a significant body of opinion within those who represent people with disabilities that this Bill does not contain the legislative provision required which it can support. I take my lead in this area from people who have a disability or who represent people with disabilities. As Senator Ryan said, for people who do not have a disability or are not close to someone who has, we must seriously consider the genuine concerns of people about this Bill. We must make the best possible fist of it.What is the automatic guaranteed legal right that must be furnished to a person where a child born to that person presents with some form of disability? We are all aware of cases where a child is born with a clear disability. The first question the parents will ask is, "What next? "Whatare the life expectations and chances for my child?"
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Before the sos I made the point that we have an opportunity to make the Bill more rights-based. The key issue affecting parents when a disabled child is born is having a guarantee about the kind of services that child will need. In recent years we have seen tremendous advances made by disabled people as a result of new treatments and the intensity of one-to-one educational opportunities, etc. As these are citizens of a republic whose journey through life is made more difficult as a result of their condition, we have an obligation to ensure that the Bill takes a rights-based approach and that these people are given every opportunity to fulfil their lives.As politicians, we should lead by example. Very few disabled people are involved in representative politics. I can think of Brian Crowley, MEP, and Anna Fenlon from our party in Wexford. Political parties have not done enough to bring people into the mainstream and make the environment accessible despite the significant advances that have been made. Having people like Brian Crowley, MEP, in politics shows how the issue can become mainstream. All political parties have a responsibility to do much more in terms of making our meetings more accessible and selecting candidates in that area to ensure that not only is the focus not lost but also that they fully contribute to decision making at the highest level.I am sceptical of any Minister who proposes a multi-agency response. When a number of Departments are responsible for an issue, none of them takes responsibility. The issue is shunted from Department to Department. I believe in the notion of having a single Minister as the lead Minister in respect of answering questions in the other House and being the firm advocate for policy in an area. The Government's intentions were good when seven or eight Ministers came together to make the announcement last September. However, because of the difficulty of public administration we need one person to take responsibility. This was the case when the then Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Mervyn Taylor, took responsibility for the issue of equality and major advances in that area were made under both Governments between 1992 and 1997. A multi-agency or interdepartmental response means that nobody takes responsibility for anything.While I have read the sections of the Bill that deal with the sectoral plans, without having one Cabinet Minister to take responsibility we will not make the kind of advance we should. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, who is present, works in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is logical to ask whether this is a health issue and that the Department of Health and Children should take the lead rather than the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. In saying this, I do not denigrate in any way the work done by the Minister of State and his officials to date. However, we need to find a more appropriate location for the Bill in the relevant Department.While the sectoral plans as outlined in sections 32 to 37 are fine in themselves, they are premised on resources being made available from the Department of Finance. As other colleagues have said, based on the historical record of that Department I would have concerns over the commitment that has been made. The Government does not want an open chequebook and citizens need to be confronted with the fundamental costs involved in genuinely addressing this area. However, if anything, we need an open chequebook policy as we are trying to make such rapid progress in a very short period to make improvements for people who have been utterly disenfranchised over the years. We will return to this matter on Committee Stage, but I am critical of the way in which many of the provisions of the Bill are so completely dependent on a financial envelope from the Department of Finance. A Cabinet Minister with full responsibility for this area could do considerably more than can be done by sharing responsibilities over several separate Departments, which is a recipe for disaster.I agree with the notion of disability proofing, which should be applied in the Office of the Attorney General. Other similar proofing also takes place in that office. As legislators we need to continually proof all legislation to ensure that we do not place additional barriers on people with a disability. Recently the Taoiseach hinted at doing so in his discussions with the lobby groups in this area. If the Minister of State is prepared to move such an amendment in this House, he will find support. Ultimately, our obligation is to ensure that every opportunity is given to those with a disability. In this regard disability-proofing would be a minimum requirement. I hope the Minister of State will table a Committee Stage amendment in this respect. We clearly do not support the Bill as it stands since the Government has not adopted rights-based legislation. I once again remind colleagues that, when we decide on this on Second Stage and then Committee Stage, we cannot abdicate our responsibility to the President and ask her to decide for us whether the Bill is constitutional. We are obliged as Members of the Oireachtas not to pass laws repugnant to the Constitution. There is an absolute guarantee in Bunreacht na hÉireann regarding access to the courts. In addition, under the European Convention on Human Rights, there is an absolute requirement that courts make decisions in a timely fashion. We must be mindful of those two guarantees when we make our decision on Second Stage.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	123	If I were not involved in politics but active exclusively in the area of disability as the parent of a child with special needs, which I am, I would have great difficulty supporting this Bill in its current form. However, I understand the difficulty in which the Government has found itself in recent years. I record my appreciation, and that of others in a position similar to my own who may not belong to any lobby groups but are parents, of the sincerity with which the Government, from the Taoiseach down, has approached this very complex issue. In its original form, the Bill was withdrawn three years ago, and the fact that it has gone through several manifestations to arrive with us today is a firm indication of the Government's commitment to wrestle with this problem and put forward solutions.I have the greatest sympathy with those who do not understand, or do not wish to understand, how the Government works and the manner in which finance is dispersed to various Departments. For them, it is a simple matter of black and white. They are involved in the disability area as disabled persons or as parents of disabled people. As citizens they look at the Constitution and, when the Government says it cannot do something, ask why it cannot provide enough resources to address the issue once and for all. Why can the Government, notwithstanding its own commitments, not decide that it will give a right to that section of the population who, in spite of their disability, are citizens in the fullest sense of the word? That has been the basis of much of the criticism of the Bill.As a politician, I have tried to explain to people that I do not believe it possible for any Administration — and I say this about my distinguished colleague on the other side — to give a blank cheque to any sector of society. It has become something of a negative slogan used by the Minister and others in defending the Bill, that they will introduce and implement the measures in so far as resources allow. However, I suggest that behind that bland, somewhat clichéd term, which is used across the whole panoply of Government and not simply regarding this Bill, there lies a very deep commitment on the part of the Government, from the Taoiseach down. He has stated publicly that the issue is to be addressed in a fair, equitable and honest manner. Those are the broad strokes of my approach to this Bill.I would be grateful for some clarification of section 11 when we discuss the Bill on Committee Stage. I understand that, even as we speak, the Government is engaged in consultations regarding possible amendments that will be tabled in this House which might help advance issues that continue to be raised by a group of people outside who, if I may be blunt, are very angry. The Minister needs no reminding of this fact. I hope those amendments and that ongoing consultative process will help alleviate the pain these people feel and address in as practical a manner as possible, within the context of the Bill, the issues that have been raised. One relates to the question of the timeframe within which any assessments will be carried out and the consequent recommendations implemented.On the question of access, if I were in a wheelchair in this city, I would also be very angry. I remember a group of people representing the Independent Action Group campaigning outside the gates of this building for better access to taxis and public services. That was three or four years ago. I am pleased that at least some action came as a consequence. Politicians in this House were rightly angry at what they saw as further neglect of a very important group of people in our society. Efforts continue to be taken to introduce more user-friendly taxis, buses and trains, and I applaud the Government for having provided the resources to Iarnród Éireann and CIE as a corporate body. They are gradually increasing the number of wheelchair-friendly buses in this city and other towns and cities across the country.The criticism has been that the process is too slow. When I asked the question, the Irish Wheelchair Association said that things were happening but it could be 2015 before services in this country were complete. This is 2005, and perhaps the Minister of State might comment in that regard. It is once again a matter of resources. Time and again, when it comes to the controversial issues of this Bill, it comes back to the question of resources. I am a committed Government supporter and know the Taoiseach well enough to be able to state that he is pained and deeply involved emotionally in this argument. I have no doubts regarding his credibility and commitment. However, ultimately it is about resources. We are unquestionably a wealthy country, but sometimes I get fed up hearing people tell us how wealthy we are when I see the disadvantage around us in certain parts of the country. This section of our people is crying out for more money and, in many cases, money would solve the problems.Section 34(b), regarding the sectoral plan for the Minister for Transport, refers to “measures to be taken for the purpose of facilitating access by persons with disabilities to such services and the time within which such measures are to be taken”. That time element arises time and again in this Bill. I hope it will be addressed as far as possible in the consultative process under way.Part 4 refers to genetic testing. Fifteen years ago, when our daughter Siobhán was born across the road in Holles Street, she spent three weeks in a special baby care unit because they did not know what was wrong with her. All sorts of internal tests were carried out, and Members will appreciate the trauma that my wife in particular was going through at that time while we waited to find out exactly what was wrong. Along with staff in the hospital we knew that something was wrong. Eventually, they sent a blood sample to London on the basis that, having eliminated all other tests, the condition might be genetic. In London they carried out a genetic test and discovered that she had a condition known as Prader-Willi syndrome, named after two Swiss professors who identified in 1959 a deletion of chromosome 15 which in essence is an eating disorder. It is also a mild mental and physical handicap — estimated at approximately 5% to 10% — and it affects boys more than girls. This syndrome can lead to a variety of disabilities but, in our case, the eating disorder means that the chemical messages to our daughter's brain are scrambled to the point where unlike you and I, she does not have the capacity to know when she is full. Consequently, she must be watched and monitored on a regular basis. It usually falls to mothers to do this although fathers make a modest contribution. At 15 years of age, she currently weighs 22 stone. In the future she could develop life threatening conditions such as diabetes but she is perfectly healthy now. She goes to the gym, she swims, she rides horses and is in a special needs class. I am grateful to successive Ministers for Education and Science who, from the time it became apparent that there was a need in Drumshanbo for special provisions, have responded magnificently at primary and secondary level.I put this on the record because it informs people of a rare condition, but also because our concern is with what will happen to Siobhán when she leaves school at 18. There are not sufficient respite care facilities in the north west. There is a desperate need for such teenage children to have some form of respite on a one-to-one basis. There is no point in putting her in with a group of similar minded special needs children or young adults because she has special dietary needs. That is a resource issue. I do not wish to attract an emotional response, but I want to give an insight into our particular experience. We are blessed. She is the most beautiful daughter and we are very proud of her.I am pleased to learn that most genetic testing now takes place in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children in Crumlin, so one does not have to wait as long for results. There is a very experienced team in Tallaght, led by Professor Hoey, that has a very specific expertise on Prader-Willi sufferers. The support services are there and the State is doing a good job in that regard.To return to another special interest of mine, section 53 refers to section 19 of the Broadcasting Act 2001. I welcome the commitments contained in this section. It states that the commission shall make rules requiring each broadcaster to take specified steps to promote the understanding and enjoyment, by persons who are deaf or have a hearing impairment, and persons who are blind or partially sighted, of programmes transmitted on any broadcasting services provided by him or her. I want to place my appreciation of RTE on the record, although I declare an interest as I receive part of my annual income from RTE. The station initiated subtitling on all of its programmes. At a recent presentation to an Oireachtas committee, it was claimed that it was the only national television broadcaster that was doing so. This Bill should legally oblige TV3 and other national and regional stations to do the same. It is important that local radio stations look at the content of the Bill to see how they could implement measures to help people who are impaired in some way. As a broadcaster, I learned how important radio was to the lives of disabled people, particularly the blind. Broadcasters have a responsibility in this area. Wherever it is possible, they should reach out to this section of the community.Despite the fact that I have reservations, I welcome this Bill as a very significant advance in addressing an issue that has exercised the minds of this party over a number of years. This is not a culmination of that process, but a major step along the way. The people out there who are feeling angry, disenfranchised and disillusioned will soon feel this Bill will be of real practical help to them if the resources are provided.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I compliment the chairperson of the Irish Wheelchair Association, who brought many people in wheelchairs to the House to protest against the inadequacies in the current Bill.The Bill before us today, anticipated as a beacon of hope by our disabled citizens, is a major disappointment and has extinguished the light of that anticipation. The inalienable rights of all our citizens are enshrined in the Constitution. These rights are not quantified, they are not exclusive and they should certainly not be limited to the able-bodied or able-minded. By definition, facilities for the disabled are not a privilege but a right and the Government must be the guardian and facilitator of the provision of this right. This Bill is a very grudging concession to that obligation.The disabled should never have been treated as second-class citizens without a voice but this has been the reality. However, they are no longer prepared to accept such discrimination. This was made quite clear at last Thursday's protest outside the gates of Leinster House, when wheelchair power made its presence felt and these Irish citizens demanded to be heard. In 2002, there were more than 360,000 people with disabilities in Ireland, representative of 10% of the population compared with an average of 12% for EU countries. Northern Ireland had an estimated 17.4% of the adult population with disabilities, with 3.5% of the child population in the province disabled. The difference is that there are more up-to-date statistics in Northern Ireland, the UK and other EU countries.Disability in a person means a substantial restriction in his or her capacity to participate in economic, social and cultural life on account of an enduring physical, sensory, learning, mental or emotional impairment. The important point is that disability is not a choice, but a state that is outside the control of the sufferer. We must see beyond the disability to the fellow human being who is entitled to the benefits of normal existence and the protection of human rights. These rights include the right to a job, to education, to health services, the right to access essential services, transport and buildings. Such rights are taken for granted by able-bodied people. When will the casual expectation of norms such as these be also the preserve of the disabled? When will all our citizens be treated equally? This is the nub of the matter and the source of many grievances in regard to the Bill.Even though more than 500,000 people expressed concern and despite Fine Gael's criticism of the guillotining of more than 100 amendments by the Government, the Bill passed all Stages in the Dáil, leading to the protest outside Leinster House last Thursday. The Bill was published on 21 September 2004, with real activity only commencing in April 2005 when the Government announced its amendments. We have waited some years for it to come before the Seanad but, despite the Government's assurances that this is good legislation, it is clear that it is open to improvement and that the Government must be equally open to such alterations.The Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, contends that in order to be comprehensive, the Bill must focus on two matters. First, is the need to ensure people have timely access to the necessary specialist services and, second, is the need to ensure over time that what Ireland has to offer becomes fully and equally accessible to people with disabilities. The Government stated in its 1997 programme for Government that it was "committed to ensuring that disability is placed where it belongs, on the agenda of every Government Department and public body". The programme for Government further states: "We recognise that disability is one of the most important social issues facing Ireland today".However, in the eight years since these fine sentiments were expressed, little practical action has been taken. For example, although the Irish Wheelchair Association recognises that some effort has been made, it argues that the Government has no real concept of how the flaws in this Bill will ensure that those with disabilities continue to be treated as second-class citizens. It has been claimed that fear is driving the Government's approach to this legislation. This fear translates into a perception among the parliamentary parties, particularly Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, that disabled people will bleed the public purse dry, while simultaneously having public services delivered from the Four Courts.Unless the Minister of State has lost the plot, he must be aware this is not the case. Disabled people have only one agenda, which is to achieve their status as equal citizens in an equal manner. Who would wish to deprive them of that? Who is to refuse them that equality through the denial of direct or indirect provision? Will the Minister of State refuse to ensure this equality and allow his actions to speak for themselves to the detriment of some 10% of our citizens? It is an ill-advised person who would do so.How far have we gone in our commitment to inclusiveness? Is it something to which the Government merely pays lip-service or will it allow this Bill to make a real difference? The mere fact that we are debating the Bill at all sends the message that we have a long way to go. Is this not an issue about which there should be real unity among us and a consensus to do all in our legislative control to bring about essential equality without dissension?We must recognise and accept the unequivocal right of all to an assessment of need which is not resource-dependent. The services identified in the assessment must be provided within a reasonable and agreed timeframe and the Bill must provide for clear protection of disability-specific resources. The provision regarding sectoral plans must take account of the wider needs of people with disabilities. Each Department must provide a sectoral plan and attain the inclusiveness of involvement and provision committed to eight years ago in the 1997 programme for Government. Moreover, the Bill must provide for a clear statutory duty on all Departments and public bodies to include people with disabilities in their plans and services.To date, the debate has focussed on the search for rights and fears about public services being delivered through the courts. However, it is essential that we keep the concept of human rights beyond disability firmly in our minds. This Bill could and must ensure that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past. It should be part of a framework of measures that aims to support social inclusion and participation of the disabled in everyday life. One can only imagine what it is to have one's life controlled and defined by disability. Perhaps it is the arrogant disregard and casual acceptance of our abilities that makes it hard for us to appreciate and to strive to eliminate the problems of others.It is unquestionably the case that the Bill is not the panacea for the ills and difficulties that beset the disabled in this country. This is a crying shame. It is an indictment of the Government but it is also an indictment of all the able-bodied citizens who are prepared to let the old status quo persist in regard to those less fortunate than themselves. This Bill and the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 are the two vehicles on which the hopes of the disabled are pinned for the immediate future.Opposition by groups representing people with disabilities led to the withdrawal of the Disability Bill 2001. If the Government digs in its heals with regard to the obvious failings of the current legislation, it is incumbent on all of us to force its amendment or withdrawal. At the very least, it must be taken apart and reassembled. Senator Brian Hayes observed that the President may have a role to play if the Bill is guillotined in the Seanad in the same manner as it was guillotined through the Dáil.Enable Ireland is concerned that the definition of disability is narrow and aimed at excluding a large number of people from receiving an assessment and services. A person who does not come under this definition is given the option of complaint but without essential appeal. In its submission to the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, the Disability Legislation Consultation Group, DLCG, sets out ten major areas of concern in regard to the Bill and emphasises its standpoint that people with disabilities are members of the public.Viewed like this, all perceptions of the difference and separation of able-bodied and disabled go out the window and raise again the question of the appalling condescension of legislation such as this. Unless we overcome the "them and us" mentality and legislate for all citizens, regardless of status, equality will never be achieved and terrible injustices will continue.The DLCG's submission went on to state that the Bill requires major reconsideration in order to bring the needs of those members of the public who have disabilities into the centre of public policy and public service delivery. The DLCG envisages two possible scenarios for the disabled if this legislation is enacted. People with disabilities will either be fully welcomed into Irish society, with all the challenges that brings to the public services, or they will continue as outsiders. The outcome rests with the Government and with the Minister of State. I hope he will accept in this House some of the amendments tabled by Fine Gael in the Dáil and will allow the Bill to go back to that House for proper amendment. Otherwise, as Senator Brian Hayes observed, the only option remaining is that we ask the President to review the legislation, as she has done in the past. President McAleese is an active President and I am confident she will have an input into this legislation before it is enacted.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	127	While I share Senator Bannon's objectives, I do not share his opinion of this Bill. We are all committed to normalising as much as possible the lives of people with disabilities by enabling them to play as full a part in society as their capacities permit. These capacities should not be underestimated or obstructed by statutory barriers. People should not believe that they cannot cross a certain threshold to their development. I approach these issues with optimism. All public bodies, including those engaged in the development of services, must strive to ensure all citizens are normalised and treated equally.Certain logical consequences ensue from this. One cannot demand to be treated the same as every other citizen while also arguing that resources should be allocated without regard to others' needs. The phrase in the Long Title, "consistent with the resources available", is a wise provision and one which I support. To do otherwise is to advance the proposition that resources are infinite. We are all aware that they are finite and that hard choices must be faced. Judgments must be made by means of the political process rather than the courts. We must recognise the needs of handicapped people and their salience to society. They will be demeaned if they are not given every possible assistance to express their own views. They are now represented by strong lobby groups and have the power and strength to play a role. They ought not be put into a ring-fenced ghetto where they are fed on money and services. We should take a more inclusive view of their role in society.If no regard is shown for resources or if these are ring-fenced, the distortion of other services is threatened. Recently, I witnessed an example of this in Northern Ireland, where an unintended consequence of the assertion of the rights of children with certain degrees of handicap to care assistants was that the education board had to lay off school patrolmen and dinner ladies and close libraries. Resource allocation, which is a function of the democratic process, must be examined in the round. People may, if they dislike a certain policy, vote against a Government. This is not a matter for the courts, partly because judges do not have any money.I look forward to discussing this Bill in more detail on Committee Stage. The provision in section 8(5) that assessments be made without cost is a potential hostage to fortune. I understand that the implication is that people should not be refused a service due to lack of precedent. A cost element is involved if required services may only be provided outside the State. Provision cannot be made in this State for certain types of handicap because it may not be economic to do so for one or two people. The necessity to send people outside the State should be implicit in the legislation.I take it that the provision in section 21 for the prescription of qualifications means that the assessors mentioned in section 10 will be appropriately qualified, whether as doctors, physiotherapists or educational psychologists. Section 11(7) makes reference to a lack of resources within a financial year. I hope it is understood that some people may need lifetime care rather than have to apply anew every year. Assessments should involve a commitment to make care available for as long as it is needed.The reference to search warrants in section 23 strikes me as draconian. I wonder why this measure was included in a Bill such as this. The powers in question seem to be more suitable to the Criminal Assets Bureau.The Defence Forces and the Garda are excluded from the provisions of the Bill. While I wonder why this is so, firemen might also be excluded. Certain positions in both forces require a level of physical fitness but many others do not. An increasing number of jobs within the Defence Forces and the Garda are being civilianised. Fulfilment of the duties of telephone assistant or office worker does not require hard physical labour. It would be worthwhile to clarify whether such work is carried out by civil servants and therefore subject to enforcement under this legislation.I welcome the provision for a centre of design excellence and the arrangements which may be made between it and other institutions. This centre should be situated in an existing school of architecture so that the wheel is not reinvented. It should be part of the mainstream rather than involve a small group of people who think great thoughts. Designers of houses, public buildings and methods of access should refer to the centre's ideas when making plans.More is needed than the arrangements of Departments. Culture must change and society shift the way in which it relates to people with handicaps. People must be assumed capable of action rather than doubted. They will be capable if they are provided with opportunities. I welcome that the Bill draws attention to the necessity for sectoral plans. I appeal to disabled persons' representative groups which are dissatisfied to work towards improving matters. My basic point is that it is a distortion of the notion of equality and normalisation to ring-fence money to make applications come through the courts. It would be wise in light of references which have been made if the President were to refer the legislation to the Supreme Court. To avoid endless litigation, it would be prudent to examine the provisions in the Bill to ensure they accord with the State's obligations under various human rights laws and the rights of the people concerned. I welcome the Bill and look forward to considering it further on Committee Stage.

I cannot but remark on the body language of the Minister of State which is indicative of many of the sentiments behind the legislation. The Minister of State's comment last week in the Dáil that there was no opportunity to change disability legislation indicates it was resource-based from the start. The Government has little interest in a rights-based approach. If the Minister of State had his way, he would not have introduced the legislation in its current form. His consultation with groups in County Galway and elsewhere indicated his preference for a genuinely rights-based Bill, but we are not getting one.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	134	We must give credit to Senator Mooney who stated in the House today that, as a parent, he was not happy with the Bill. He said that if he were outside politics, he would not accept its provisions. Senator Mooney's contribution took great courage. Many Dáil and Seanad Members have communicated over the past ten years with various representative groups in the disabilities sectors and none could in conscience say they could not have a rights-based Bill. Politics, legislative imperatives and procedure, however, have taken their toll.While everyone agrees legislation must take resources into account, the Government has adopted as a scare tactic the argument that a rights-based Bill would lead to a rush to the courts. Can the Minister of State tell the House why, if the Government believes the legislation to be free of warts, it is necessary to block access to the courts? As there would be no rush to the courts if the legislation was adequate, why is the Government's fear such as to demand a caveat which prevents court access? If I received a legitimate answer, I would change my mind on certain issues. I would appreciate a meaningful response from the Minister of State when he winds up the Second Stage debate.The Government has no interest in rights-based legislation and we have seen no courage or imagination from the Minister of State. Even if he wanted to, it seems his senior colleagues would not allow the Minister of State to amend the fundamentally flawed Disability Bill. All representative bodies in the disabilities sector have said the Bill was flawed from its inception. Having engaged in years of consultation, which continues, the sector sought meaningful legislation. The 2001 Bill was withdrawn with the Taoiseach's promise that it would be changed meaningfully but nothing has happened in the meantime. When I heard someone remark on the sincerity of the Taoiseach in this context, I recalled his statements after the Special Olympics to the effect that it was a wonderful occasion for all, especially the disabled participants. He stated clearly that he would prioritise their needs and provide funding to create access. One must consider the sincerity of his statements in light of the Bill before the House.Every provision in the Bill is qualified by reference to the availability of resources. The Bill employs the terms "should", "might" and "could" which constitute an opt-out clause. At the launch of the legislation, the Taoiseach, in the presence of the Tánaiste, indicated that no other country would have such up-to-date legislation or provide for such a response to people with disability. That the statement is true is clear from the comments of representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association that no other country would enact legislation which denies the right of people with disabilities to access services and qualifies its every provision.The Bill must be a terrible kick in the teeth to the individuals, families and groups who worked so hard for people with disabilities. One must ask why so many have walked away from the consultation process being overseen by the DLCG. They realised the legislation was flawed and did not want to participate any further in the process. The other groups have remained in the process in the hope that some small crumbs might fall to them by way of amendments. Those hopes must be viewed in the context of the Minister of State's contention that there will be no fundamental change to the core principles of the legislation. Why spend three days discussing the Bill when we know few significant and worthwhile amendments will be made to it?The Disability Bill 2004 is a pale shadow of the legislation the Taoiseach promised when he was forced to withdraw the 2001 Bill after the 2003 Special Olympics. He said clearly that we would enact better legislation than any other country but we will have to wait and see. The Bill is designed to prevent further judicial intervention other than on a point of law. Why was it necessary to introduce that? I accept that the O'Donoghue and Jamie Sinnott cases frightened everybody. The courts made right decisions in those cases. Those who drew up the legislation had one thing in mind — to ensure there would no longer be access to the courts. I agree it is a waste of resources going through that process. The Constitution entitles people to have recourse to the courts as a last resort. If the legislation is, as has been claimed, the best in the world, why was it necessary to prevent access to the courts?The Minister of State referred to value for money and cost in regard to the legislation. I urge him to examine the bureaucratic process the legislation will put in place that will include appeals officers, assessment officers, liaison officers and a plethora of support staff. Has the expenditure on staff been costed? How many people will be recruited and will it be done on the basis of county, population or representative group? Rather than put in place a structure with so many financial demands in terms of resourcing, would it not be better if the system were simplified and people were entitled to services as of right? That would eliminate the need for the employment of so many additional staff.Nothing in the legislation indicates the process will be in any way independent. It reminds me of what happened in the Department of Agriculture and Food. I do not wish to draw a general analogy other than in regard to the appeals process. A former Minister for Agriculture and Food set up an appeals mechanism based on appeals officers who are employed by the Department. It is proposed to adopt a similar procedure here in that the people adjudicating on the appeals will be employed by the HSE. It is not the case that I do not trust them to give a professional judgment, however it is unlikely that they would overturn a decision based on a report drawn up by their colleagues.We all perhaps fall a little short of the yardstick of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. His body language is enough to signify his sufferance in listening to us. I have seen this attitude before from the Minister of State. I will note it and let it pass.

I would have continued to do so were it not for the arrogance of the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey.Perhaps the Minister of State will agree to tell us how many people will be employed? I may be incorrect in suggesting it will be hundreds. I am open to correction on the number of liaison officers, complaints officers and appeals officers and the corresponding support staff that will be required.The Bill contains the type of provisions that are either unnecessary or irrelevant to the needs of people with disability. If disabled people cannot access services and a large bureaucracy were in operation they would have good reason to be aggrieved. When the Bill is stripped down, its principal purpose is to refuse disabled people rights or to severely limit the circumstances in which meaningful rights are granted, rather than actually giving rights to people with disabilities.The Bill aims to confer one right on people with disabilities — the right in certain circumstances to an assessment of their health or educational needs. Arising from such an assessment a person may get a statement of the services to which they might be entitled if they are eligible for these services and provided it is practicable and affordable by the Exchequer. There are many qualifying clauses on the rights that are specified which provide an opt-out for the Minister and Government of the day. It is time for the Minister of State to agree to amend those provisions to verify that an assessment will be given, and that the needs identified will be resourced whether they are in the area of health or education.Constituents of mine in County Galway have a three year old child who is profoundly handicapped. The mother gave up her job for three years to care for her child. The father gives as much time as is available to him in support of his child. They applied in the usual way to the local HSE office for funding for a place for their child in the education system. The family lives on the border of counties Galway and Roscommon. The most convenient location for a service to be provided to them is Roscommon town. The service providers in County Galway stated that its allocation, which had only recently been received, would be taken up by the provision of services to children over 12 years of age and that nobody within the county aged under 12 would get a placement in the coming year without additional funding being made available to the HSE. If the Minister of State can live with that, so be it. In this instance, there is no place for a child of three and a half years of age to go to obtain any assistance because the resources are not available. There is a turf war over who will have responsibility for the provision of the necessary resources in counties Galway and Roscommon.I have no reason to believe this legislation will provide the necessary funding because it is qualified according to the availability of resources. If such circumstances are to continue, the eight young people under 12 years who are on the waiting list in County Galway will have to live without any support services. Their parents will have to continue as they are and stay out of work to maintain their children in their homes. If the Minister of State is to preside over legislation that will allow this to continue, be it in respect of health or education, he should note that all the platitudes in the Bill will come to naught. He is not prepared to change the legislation regardless of the pleas of so many bodies that have suffered at the coalface over the years in terms of consultation and the provision of resources.

#BrendanDaly	unknown-#BrendanDaly-party	unknown-#BrendanDaly-dob	unknown-#BrendanDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I welcome the Minister of State and compliment him on the considerable volume of work and time he has put into preparing this legislation. He took over from the former Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, who was also involved in legislating in this area. The original Bill was introduced by former Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Mary Wallace. We appreciate her introducing it to deal with this vital issue.By any comparison, the Bill is very comprehensive. There are in excess of seven Parts and 58 sections. It deals with very specific issues. If I had a criticism of the Bill — I do not disagree totally with Senator Ulick Burke in some respects — it would be that it is cumbersome and involves many people doing work that should be done in another way. Nearly every Senator, including the Acting Chairman, could put forward views on how this issue might be dealt with. I believed it might be possible to establish a semi-State organisation or body, such as those involved in food safety and other health and safety issues, which would be given the power and budget to deal with the issues the Bill addresses. At present, there are various Ministers and Departments involved.The Bill underlines the importance of the financial commitment the Government is making in this area. I have had some discussions with organisations that deal with people with disabilities. I appreciate the invaluable work such organisations are doing and I appreciate their care of and dedication and attention to people with disabilities. I refer especially to carers looking after people with disabilities, many of whom have considerable problems, some of which legislation will never address.This Bill presents an opportunity to put on record our appreciation for the various organisations and individuals working with people with disabilities. I refer in particular to their families, who are going through traumatic times and, in some respects, face a very bleak and threatening future. I say this because many people with disabilities have a longer lifespan that they used to, thus putting considerable pressure on their carers, particularly elderly people, who worry about what will happen to their children when they are no longer able to take care of them.This issue is above and beyond party-political issues and contentious issues that might arise in consultations between the Department and disability organisations. I hope this legislation will put an end to the disagreement that has been evident in the consultation process for many years.Many of us who have been Members for quite a while have always been very wary of getting involved in court cases because we all know the courts are very expensive places in which to settle grievances. For many years, politicians have advised people, in so far as possible, to try to reach agreement without necessitating litigation. Litigation is very expensive and time-consuming and is not sometimes not very productive.The amount of work done by the Government in preparing this Bill demonstrates a very serious commitment, both legislative and financial, to coming to grips with one of the major issues requiring attention. I am a little surprised by the attacks that have been made on the legislation. I read some of the speeches made last night. The Minister of State gave a very detailed, comprehensive assessment of the legislation and therefore it is not necessary for us to outline every detail of every section. In some of the speeches of the Opposition Members, I could not find any meaningful proposal to amend the Bill that should be promoted by the Minister and supported by this side of the House. The speeches were mainly a continuation of the criticisms to the effect that the Bill should be rights based. I will not elaborate on this as it has been dealt with adequately by other speakers, particularly Senator Maurice Hayes, who put his case very clearly. Given his experience in other jurisdictions, I could not put the case more clearly than he did.It is important to note that in this legislation, we are not only dealing with issues associated with access to buildings and opportunities for employment in the public service but also with basic issues such as the provision of services and the need to ensure people are satisfied with their assessment of need.I partly agree with Senator Ulick Burke that bureaucracy may result from so many people having an influence in the decision-making process. In our efforts to get this legislation right, we should endeavour to use existing resources to the benefit of people with disabilities and their families. We should avoid unnecessary bureaucracy in so far as we can.I am aware that provisions for appeals officers and other personnel in this area are included in the legislation at the direct request of some of the disability organisations. It was not merely the decision of the Government to make such provisions. The decision was made after consultation with the disability organisations, which felt it important that there be an appeals mechanism in place for those who are not satisfied with the outcome of their assessment. Those representing people with disabilities have been pressing for a provision of that kind in the legislation.It is difficult to divorce some of the other legislation we discussed in this House from the Bill. The special educational needs Bill was considered a few months ago and many of the issues raised in that have a bearing on this legislation. This is why I believe it might be better to have a single semi-State body to take care of all the areas involved because it so wide and complex and covers so many Departments.There will always be occasion for maintaining that it is necessary that legislation of this kind contain various provisions, to the extent that it would never be enacted. In the circumstance it has been a major achievement of the Minister of State in getting the legislation to this Stage. I compliment him and the Government on this and also on the spending initiatives of almost €3 billion that have been put in place, with ongoing commitments to ensure there is multi-annual investment. The Minister of State mentioned a figure of around €900 million per annum. These are substantial sums.In making such provision it is important to ensure, as far as possible, that the financing and funding is directed to the areas that most need them and that duplication and bureaucracy are avoided. In some respects I foresee the possibility of some duplication over what is being proposed, both in terms of the education Act of 2003 and this Bill. Before the legislation is finally passed, it would be useful if the Minister of State considered whether it would be possible to correlate more fully the activities of both Departments responsible in order to enhance co-operation and consultation between them and also with the representative organisations for people with disabilities. This would facilitate the best possible results from the legislation.Government guarantees are very important. I do not wish to be confrontational but I recall that solemen commitments were given in the past by a Labour Party-Fine Gael coalition Government to provide £25 million for people with disabilities. That never materialised and ultimately, some £4 million was spent.Given the enthusiasm we saw from the Labour Party at the weekend, I would remind its members of the time Labour Party Ministers stood on the steps of Government Buildings and walked out of the Government they shared with Fine Gael because they could not agree on policies or on issues. Not much has changed since that time. If the mad rush of enthusiasm for a new partnership with Fine Gael displayed by some members of the Labour Party, though not all, is an indicator for the future, they should be reminded of past events and the attitude of the late Frank Cluskey when he walked out of Government. At the time Labour Party Ministers said they could no longer work with Fine Gael. Current party members should not forget that.We should also not allow the Labour Party to forget that it made promises in this area which it did not honour or respect. Party members should therefore be slow to come into the Houses of the Oireachtas to criticise what the Government is now doing. They do not have a proud record in this area.The Minister of State referred to the necessity for training and employment. Will he indicate the number of people with disabilities who are currently unemployed? Will he also indicate the number of public authorities and State bodies that have not fully committed to the objectives, as set out for them in the legislation, to provide employment for people with disabilities? Greater attention must be paid to the whole training and employment area. The legislation should be used, in particular, to expend substantial funding, especially in the technology training of people with disabilities, where there are far greater opportunities for employment than in the past.I am also anxious to see some funding put into research. I do not mean research on the type of access to public buildings and so forth but rather inquiries into some of the causes of disabilities, which seem to be occurring at an ever increasing and alarming rate. I was recently taken aback in a discussion with people in west Clare to hear of the escalating numbers of people with disabilities in particular parts of the country, especially in that region. In this regard, I am particularly conscious of the work that is being done by carers' associations and other organisations in west Clare who are still seeking some basic facilities.Mention is made in the legislation of early intervention. This is very important, but it is also crucial that when needs are identified and quantified, remedies are available. Very often they are not. That is why in some of the other Bills that came before the House reference was made to a necessity to increase the intake into the colleges of the skilled personnel required to deal with some of the people who do not have a service at present. While it is fine to have such provisions in the Bill, unless the necessary skilled personnel are available, especially to provide the expert advice that families need, particularly in the early days of disability detection, then much of the legislation being put in place will be in vain. It is important over the coming years not only to devote resources to these areas but also to provide funding to encourage people to become involved in the relevant professional areas to be highlighted in the assessments of people with disabilities.I again refer to the organisations involved in this area such as the health boards and local authorities. It is crucial when the legislation is finalised that the Minister of State accelerates the important work that needs to be done, especially as regards access to buildings. There is no reason — engineering, structural or otherwise — why access to public buildings cannot be improved. We as public representatives get more complaints about this than anything else. I deplore the attitude of certain individuals who, at the last election, attended meetings of children and adults with disabilities and made false promises on the basis of using particular circumstances to gain electoral support. This is deplorable conduct and we saw a good deal of that in my constituency during the last election campaign.This is a good Bill. It has been worked on diligently and thoughtfully by the Minister of State. I compliment Deputy Fahey on getting the legislation to this Stage. I hope it will be successful and, above all, that it will have an impact on the lives of people disabilities and their families, for many years.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I welcome this opportunity to contribute to this important Bill. I wish to refer to 1997, although I will not use the example of that year as a watershed for a political debate, or 1996 when I became involved in debates on the issue of disabilities through my involvement in the community development sector.People with disabilities were targeted as an category in respect of which there was a need for redress, a change in legislation and a change in the types of services, if any, offered to them. At that time, as representatives from Border areas will be aware, many programmes, specifically the Programme for Peace and Reconciliation, were in place. That programme was supported by ADM-CPA. Many people working in funding agencies used criteria which highlighted that funding was needed for grassroots community support, not only for people with disabilities but for ex-prisoners and women. At that time women were targeted as a group who were marginalised and disadvantaged. They were granted disadvantaged status in terms of funding on a cross-Border basis. Other groups included Travellers, the unemployed, youth groups, and young people in general.Such groups were identified through debate for which I compliment the role of the Community Workers Co-Operative which was heavily involved in identifying such target groups. There was real debate, effort and significant time and commitment devoted to identifying how services could be mainstreamed to facilitate disadvantaged groups and how people on the margin could be brought into society. "Social inclusion" were the buzz words at that time and they are still used.Much has happened since 1996 and the debate on this issue has moved forward. I will use the example of Travellers to illustrate how the debate has evolved. Many people would disagree with the concept of giving Travellers special disadvantaged status simply because they are Travellers. There is the question of the individuality of Travellers as an ethnic group. However, giving a group disadvantaged status can be dangerous in that it can label people and compartmentalise groups. In trying to include people in that sense, one can end up excluding them. In certain instances that happened. Where estates were given disadvantaged status, people started to label them and if crime levels were high in such estates they were branded in a negative way.The debate has evolved since 1996. I wish to concentrate on the debate because that is what is important as opposed to the political gamesmanship. The debate has evolved to the extent that people, such as disability groups, do not want to be compartmentalised. From people I know who work with people with disabilities and from people with disabilities, with a number of whom I have a close relationship, they do not want to be compartmentalised and classified as a people with disabilities. They do not want to be faced with a situation where special funding is set aside or sanctioned or special privilege is given to the group of which they are a part simply because they cannot mobilise themselves in the same way as the Acting Chairman or me. The debate has gone beyond that point.The Bill is about the issue of disabilities but it is essentially about providing equality, access and justice to people with disabilities. It is not only about sanctioning on budget day moneys to be set aside for people with disabilities. That is not a measure that sits comfortably with me or with many people involved. I am even finding it difficult to pronounce the word "comfortably" for which I apologise.We need to examine our mindset as legislators and in terms of the way we treat, view and categorise the person in a wheelchair we meet on the street or the person in a special unit for people with disabilities. From my knowledge of this area, there are two points to note. One is that a person with a disability living in an independent living centre does not want sympathy. If one were to express sympathy to a person in such a centre, that person would react in disgust. People with disabilities do not want sympathy to the effect that one asks them how they are doing or whether they will be able to manage. They do not want to be treated like imbeciles or juveniles. That is the first important point. People with disabilities are human beings and equal to myself, the Acting Chairman and every other person. That is the message we need to get across today.The second important point to note is that people may make a stereotypical comment that many people with disabilities come across as being angry. There are many angry people with disabilities, and some of them are extremely angry. They can exercise their anger at any given time. If one works closely enough with them, one could feel the brunt of this anger. However, nine out of ten times that anger is not expressed as a result of their disability, although part of it will be and like anybody else they can be angry depending on their mood or state of mind. The anger felt by people with disability is based on the lack of services and access available to them. It may come down to the simple matter of the provision of an appropriate footpath or means by which they can get into town for a pint. We cannot over-emphasise the difficulty faced by a person in a wheelchair who may live a mile from a pub. The social and recreational life of that person is severely restricted. Such restriction can start with that person being in a bed in a centre for independent living and not being able to get out of it because he or she requires a personal assistant who is not available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. That is his first obstacle.This man I speak of is a good friend of mine. The second obstacle, if he can summon somebody to help him get out of bed, is to call a taxi. Certain urban councils have done great work in making grants available for wheelchair accessible taxis but at peak time on a Saturday night they are hard to come by. It takes a taxi driver a long time to help a person with a disability in and out of his or her cab. When one is in the business of making money one does not have time to waste. This is not a criticism of the taxi drivers.The next obstacle this man meets is use of the telephone. Some people with disabilities cannot use a telephone. I have contacted people in O2 and Vodaphone to ask them to look at ways to adapt mobile telephones. For those of us with no disability it is easy to carry our telephones around and hold them to our ears. Speaker telephone is an option but there are people who cannot hold a telephone. Some effort must be made to fit telephones into wheelchairs or otherwise help people with disabilities to communicate.Returning to my example, the gentleman in question cannot get a taxi and decides to go to the pub alone. He must travel on a footpath that may not be passable, or onto which he may not be able to drive his motorised wheelchair. Traffic poses a problem as do crossing the road, access to toilets and returning home. There are numerous problems for a person simply trying to go out for a pint.If that person has such a problem going out for a pint on a Saturday night, what sort of obstacles does he encounter in accessing services, job opportunities, training opportunities, other social and recreational outlets and participating in the civic responsibilities of his community? We take these matters for granted.We can get into a car and go wherever we want at any time because access is not a problem. There are more cars than people. Access to services and people is easy. We politicians make ourselves available to people all the time and there are people who can come to us. The main problem in this Bill is that it is impossible for us to quantify the difficulties encountered by people with disabilities.If a sum of up to €300 million was set aside in a special budget for people with disabilities it would be throwing money at a problem. This is not a question of money; it is a question of individual rights because people with disabilities are the same as the rest of us. Many are smarter and more street-wise than us. We have the disability of being unable to come to terms with people with disabilities. We should put up our hands and say we have this problem. We cannot understand what it is to be without choice.If I may digress somewhat, one of the arguments in the debate on suicide is that young people have too much choice. Perhaps they do. I know I do. People without disabilities have so much choice they do not know what to do. There is so much we can do during the day, so much entertainment is available, so many challenges are open to us, and we have many options to choose from for a weekend. We have choice at home and abroad. People with disabilities do not have choice. They are limited in what they can do, when, how and with whom.People in the Disability Federation of Ireland say that assessment of need, whether in terms of health or services, should not be resource dependent. That is the key issue to highlight in respect of this Bill. The Disability Federation of Ireland states:—The services identified in the assessment of need for an individual must be provided within a reasonable and agreed timeframe;—The Bill must provide for clear protection of disability specific resources;—The provisions regarding Sectoral Plans must take account of the wider needs of people with disabilities. Each Government Department with relevant services must provide a Sectoral Plan.Monaghan County Council and Donegal County Council do not meet their public service obligation to make 4% of their jobs available to people with disabilities. I name those counties because Donegal was at the bottom of the list and Monaghan was on the list. I doubt there is a local authority in Ireland that meets the 4% criterion. If there is no sectoral plan and there are no monitoring bodies to deal with this matter it will not be implemented.Thirty years ago people saw council workers with their shovels every two miles along an old country road cleaning siocs and drains. Now they look around and see only one digger or one man and a shovel. One does not see council workers on the ground. They are all indoors, doing office jobs, sitting at desks. A person with a disability can sit at a desk. Many people with disabilities are qualified and well-motivated enough to be pen-pushers in any local authority. They can do as much pen-pushing as the next man or woman.My party opposes the Bill on the grounds that those involved in the disability movement do not feel it is right. We must change the mindset by which we compartmentalise people with disabilities. We must constantly remind ourselves how difficult it is for a 42 year old man to go for a pint on a Saturday night. If it is difficult to go for a pint it is extremely difficult to attend a training course or take up a job. It is difficult to go on a training course and become competent and later discover there is discrimination in regard to employment. St. Thomas Aquinas said: "Never let the perfect be the enemy of the good." People with disabilities are not looking for perfection, they are looking for their rights. We should try to look at the good and examine our conscience in regard to the Disability Bill and provide for some of the issues highlighted here.
#KieranPhelan	unknown-#KieranPhelan-party	unknown-#KieranPhelan-dob	unknown-#KieranPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	174	I am happy to have the opportunity to speak on the Disability Bill. I have listened carefully to much of what has been said in the other House and since the debate commenced here. It has been very informative and many Members of both Houses have given constructive views on the Bill. I am sure the Minister of State will take many of these practical suggestions on board.The Disability Bill is detailed and comprehensive. It has been under preparation for some time and there has been widespread consultation with all the various interested parties in bringing about its publication. It has been criticised by various sectors and we have heard some of that same criticism here today. When all is said and done, it has to be recognised that this Disability Bill is a major step forward for disabled people and their families.I wish to congratulate a number of Ministers who were involved in the Bill's preparation. I congratulate the then Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mary Wallace, the Minister for Defence, who was then Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, as well as the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey. The Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, must be congratulated for presenting the Bill to the House and explaining the detailed provisions and implications of what is proposed to Deputies, Senators and the wider public. I wish him well in his ongoing work in ensuring this important Bill becomes law.As other speakers have said, this Bill has to be put in context. It is but one part of the overall national disability strategy which was published last year. The Disability Bill is part of a much larger framework of measures which it is hoped will create greater social inclusion. The other elements of this overall strategy include the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004, the Employment Equality Act 1998, the Equal Status Act 2000, the Equality Act 2004 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. Further to those items of legislation my constituency colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, announced the provision of a special disability multi-annual investment programme for disability support services. For the coming years, 2006-09, a package of €900 million has been dedicated and I commend the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, for this significant allocation of funding. When speaking in the other House, my colleague, Deputy Moloney, highlighted this matter as a great step forward for the entire disability sector. It is worth noting that the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, recognised the need for multi-annual funding for people with disabilities and particular groups.There is no doubt about the commitment of the Government in dealing with the entire disability sector. If one wishes to measure its commitment to dealing with disability issues, it is possible to do so by looking at the level of funding that has been allocated by the Government to address the issue. The multi-annual funding is the only way forward to ensure the disability sector is best provided for. This is a positive step on which the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Cowen, should be complimented.All of us have read the various submissions from the disability groups and representative bodies for those in the disability sector. I have been impressed by their passion and commitment to some of the most vulnerable in society. I am not alone in saying we have been inundated with representations from such groups. I reassure these people and these groups that the Government is proud of what has been done but we all agree that much more needs to be done in the area of helping the disability sector. I compliment the chief executive officer of the DFI who has worked hard and whose views have been balanced and fair. We have all met him in recent weeks.I welcome sections 7 and 9 which provide for the inclusion of assessment officers. This is set out in detail and I am delighted with the provisions. A consistent criticism I have heard from people with disabilities or groups representing them was that they felt marginalised and left out because there was no specific appeals mechanism for them. While there was an appeals procedure in place disabled people or their representative groups will be happy with the new set up proposed in the Bill. It is my hope that the introduction of these assessment officers will make the whole process of getting what each individual is entitled to much easier for the most vulnerable members of society.The Disability Legislation Consultation Group put forward a number of key requests. It sought the right to an assessment that would not be resource dependent. It is clear from the Minister of State's contribution last night that the Bill provides a right to an independent assessment to a benchmark standard with access to redress. The Minister of State explained that this assessment will be undertaken without regard to the cost of or the capacity to provide any service identified in the assessment. I am happy with this assurance.The group sought that the Bill would require the provision of all assessed services needs within a reasonable and agreed timeframe. I am pleased the Bill addresses that concern in that it will, when enacted, impose significant new requirements on Ministers and the Health Service Executive in regard to service provision and transparency in regard to funding. The group requested also that the various Departments would prepare a sectoral plan. From my understanding of the Bill there is provision for six sectoral plans which will deal with services for those with disabilities. In his contribution last night the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, pointed out that other public bodies are already obliged under the Bill to make their services accessible by next year.In the past, Governments of all persuasions have allowed problems in the disability sector to be unresolved. We should be realistic in our criticisms of the problems we face. It would be wrong not to recognise the positive aspects of what the Government is doing. For the first time, the Government is putting in place a firm financial programme and a national disability strategy to establish proper disability services.I compliment the Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, for this substantial commitment from the Exchequer. Under the provisions of the Bill, Ministers will be required for the first time to make explicit plans regarding the amount of money they will allocate each year from their own budgets to ensure that the provisions of the Bill are implemented.The overall national disability strategy which includes the Disability Bill and the multi-annual investment programme announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, provide a strong basis for moving forward and getting some progress on the existing problems that confront people with disabilities. I hope the Bill will help those who work with people with disabilities. My wife works with disabled people in St. Anne's in Roscrea. It is a tough job.I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, and his officials well in the ongoing work on the Bill. I appreciate he has put a very significant amount of work into it in recent months. When enacted I have no doubt it will contribute greatly to the lives of our disabled citizens and those of their families and friends.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill. Like all Members, I have received a large volume of correspondence on this issue. I concede I am not an expert on the proposals but we must ensure that at the end of the parliamentary process we will pass a Bill of which we can all be proud and which will have a positive impact on the lives of the tens of thousands of people across the island of Ireland who suffer from various disabilities.It is important to stress there will be no political gain for any side arising from this debate and nor should we seek such a gain. In the past decades since the issues of disability and disability rights have come to the fore, every Government and political party has been guilty by omission in not providing resources and guilty of lack of attention. We all have a political duty to try to redress the balance to ensure that the disabled in our community are given a fair crack of the whip.The concept of republicanism is often debated in this House and elsewhere. It is a word that has been debased by others. If we wish to have a true republic and ensure that all citizens of the Republic have equal access to services, equal opportunity in life and equal chances to succeed, then this legislation is a core of that argument. If this is to be truly an Irish Republic, we must ensure the Disability Bill offers a real opportunity and way forward to those people who are meant to benefit from it.I fully accept the Minister of State and his colleagues in Government want this Bill to work. There is no point in being in Government or in bringing forward legislation if one does not expect it to work. However, the Minister of State knows as well as I that grave doubt exists among many of the disabled people and among many of the groups advocating their rights about the long-term impact of this legislation. Would we be having this debate in the weeks following the Special Olympics when probably for the first time in the history of the State the country as a whole concentrated on the role of the disabled and their achievements? I think we would be treading with more caution because the public would expect more from us and from this legislation.If resources were open-ended and if we were guaranteed the Celtic tiger would continue roaring into the next decade and into the future, we would not need to be worried about legislation because the rising tide would lift all boats. However, it must be accepted that the Government purse strings will tighten again when the Celtic tiger will not roar as strongly as it did for the last five or six years. Unless the maximum guarantees are included in this legislation, the weakest in society such as the disabled may well suffer. This has been the history of the response of all Governments to marginalised people. When the time for cutbacks comes, those people who cannot speak loudest, suffer. This is the reason so many groups representing the disabled are concerned about this legislation which they regard as not sufficiently rights-based. It is so dependent on resources which may become scarce again, they are genuinely fearful that no matter what are the political intentions of the Government and Taoiseach, without stronger guarantees it all may come to naught. This is a genuine worry for us all.The case for the legislation not being rights-based has been made by a number of people. I listened to the Minister of State's contribution yesterday and a very balanced contribution this morning by Senator Dardis. The Minister of State argues that no other country offers such a rights-based approach. I accept this may be the case. I listened with interest to the debate on the situation in South Africa where the apparent rights-based legislation does not work in practice. The challenge for politicians is to put in place a Bill which will be a world leader. Just because these proposals have not been implemented elsewhere does not mean we cannot be the pioneers of rights-based legislation. It would be admirable if the Government and the Members of the Oireachtas lived up to their names as republicans and enacted legislation which would result in Ireland being the best place in the world to live if one was disabled. We should aspire to this.This legislation will be an improvement but the message from those who know best, the disabled, their supporters and representatives, is that there is a long way to go. In the course of his contribution the Minister of State outlined possible Government amendments which would be welcome. The issue which keeps returning is that of rights-based rather than resource-based legislation. We have been politically unable to satisfy the call from the disabled groups and their representatives. This is to be regretted and something upon which the Minister of State must further reflect.The Minister of State correctly said the Bill is part of a broader strategy. It is a major piece of a jigsaw. I welcome the other parts of the strategy such as the Bill to amend the Comhairle Act 2000 and the six sectoral plans. I acknowledge the 2004 budget allowed for a major financial blueprint by way of the multi-annual investment programme which any fair-minded person would welcome as a major step forward. We await with interest to see how these sectoral plans work and the difference they will make. As work progresses towards the next budget and the next Finance Bill, we look forward to seeing the continuation of the investment programme. I hope to see a clearer picture in the near future and a clearer picture of how Departments will spend the additional welcome moneys.Those of us who were members of local authorities and who were dealing on an almost daily basis with issues such as disabled person's grants note with anxiety and disappointment that regardless of legislation, sectoral plans and multi-annual investment programmes, we receive correspondence from constituents who are refused a disabled person's grant because of lack of funding at local authority level. This type of issue is the proof of the pudding. Can those issues be addressed and resolved? This is the political challenge. What recourse to further adjudication or further assessment will be available when such applications are rejected by a Government body. As the Government attempts to make further progress on reaching the target of 4% of disabled persons employed in the public service, we should meet the representatives of the Departments of Finance, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, and the various employer groups to see if we can introduce a meaningful incentive for private sector employers to increase their intake of disabled employees. While it may not be possible or constitutionally appropriate to apply a 4% minimum on private employers, tens of thousands of admirably suitable disabled persons are available and we should give a genuine incentive to employers to look with absolute favour on those people. The Government is examining the issue of tax reliefs and incentives, which are now generally regarded as being negative terms. However, if we could use any kind of tax relief, incentive or other approach to encourage private sector employers to employ disabled persons it would represent a meaningful step forward.On Committee Stage I am sure we will reflect in much greater depth on the issues concerning the disability groups and those they represent. We cannot get away from the issue of rights-based versus resource-based legislation, which appears to be the sticking point. When the Minister of State with responsibility for this area in the previous Government, Deputy Mary Wallace, introduced her legislation it was met with great disappointment and was subsequently withdrawn, which apparently resulted, perhaps unfairly, in her political demotion. As a result of that episode and the ongoing dialogue involving the Government and the interdepartmental committee, it was expected that all the issues would be addressed in the Bill before the House. The message we are getting on this side of the House — I am sure the same is true for backbenchers on the Government side — is that all the issues have not been addressed.I ask the Minister of State to keep listening. The groups for whom this Bill is designed to provide support and encouragement deserve no less than him listening to their concerns on an ongoing basis. While we are nearing the end of the legislative stage, it is not too late to introduce meaningful amendments. In his contribution the Minister of State mentioned five issues that had been raised with him and the Taoiseach and which were agreed to be considered including the following: the need to provide for a face-to-face interview to review each applicant's service statement; additional powers for the complaints officer, which would allow him or her to recommend the timing of the service or assessment; and to review concerns about the wording of section 5(4). At a minimum I hope the Minister of State will table amendments in that regard.While I recognise that the Disability Bill is a first step, I reiterate the point I am hearing from constituents and others that it is not enough. It provides hope and comes from a political desire on the part of all of us to give people meaningful help. However, it does not provide the guarantees required. For all of the good points and glories of this country, we have never given sufficient recognition or support to its disabled community. We have an opportunity to redress that matter. We are taking some positive steps in this legislation but not enough. I hope the Minister of State will try to offer a little more as it would make a significant difference to those most affected.

#KateWalsh	unknown-#KateWalsh-party	unknown-#KateWalsh-dob	unknown-#KateWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I appreciate these few minutes to speak on this very important Bill. Meeting the needs of people with disabilities and their families is an important part of my work as a public representative and is certainly a part of my work that I take most seriously. I want to address two specific points, the labelling of people with disabilities and the issue of access.On the first issue, I know much of the Dáil debate focused on the definition of disability. While I do not want to get into the technicalities, people with disabilities must not be labelled, intentionally or unintentionally. Unfortunately, we need to focus attention on the marginalisation of some people with disabilities within all areas of Irish life. This includes the issue of inappropriate labelling. Labels can create expectations that are based on our previous experiences, hearsay, or what we were taught. The problem is that these expectations can be wrong. Labels make people think that persons thus labelled are the same. Not all people labelled "disabled" are the same. Not all people labelled "blind" or "deaf" are the same. They are not all the same and they have very specific talents, circumstances and needs, which we should not forget during our discussion on the Bill.I refer Members to the early sections of Part 3. Last night the Minister of State said the Government is satisfied that the Bill creates significant new requirements on public bodies in terms of accessibility of buildings, and service and information. I hope these move from being requirements to being a reality as soon as possible. This morning Senator Dardis outlined some problems with access to buildings in Kildare, of which I am aware. In as far as is possible people with disabilities should have access to the same places to which the rest us want to go. We should make whatever changes are necessary in terms of infrastructure, ramps, lifts, doors, etc. While I know progress has been made, we need to keep our eye on the topic.Regarding the Bill in general, I want to commend the contributions of the representative groups. The legislation has benefited from their input. I also want to thank the Minister of State and his Department for the broad consultation process that was held. Given the tireless and brilliant work done by support groups and families — we owe them due regard — I am happy the Bill has been shaped by their needs.
#MichaelBrennan	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-party	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-dob	unknown-#MichaelBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I thank Senator Kate Walsh for sharing her time. I am pleased to make a contribution to this debate. I welcome the excellent and thought-provoking contributions made in the House thus far. In introducing the Bill to the House last night, the Minister of State said it would significantly advance the position of people with disabilities and would be instrumental in sustaining progress in the longer term. I support the Minister of State and his Department in their efforts to make this happen.I would like to concentrate on the issue of consultation. Support groups, voluntary groups and family representative groups play an immense role in society supporting and advising those with disabilities and their families. I express my appreciation for all the work done by these groups. The Bill before us was rightly the subject of intensive consultations with interested groups. The National Disability Authority brought together a group representative of people with disabilities, their families and carers, and service providers in the sector. This was done on foot of a request from the then Minister of State at the Department in April 2002 and is to be commended. The Bill has been improved as a result of the process. The disability legislation consultation group has provided meaningful and important input at national level on the sector, for which work I thank it.Some of the media coverage gives the impression that the Bill was drafted to the exclusion of representative groups, that it has not been shaped by their contributions and that groups were not listened to. This is simply not the case. In the first instance, not only senior departmental officials but also Ministers had regular contact with the DLCG. That important process has been ongoing for two and a half years or more. It was crucial that those in the Department get a real and detailed understanding of the issues that concern the representative groups. I am glad that such ongoing contact, together with the DLCG document, Equal Citizens, allowed the Department to gain that understanding.Second, contrary to some claims, the Bill takes account of proposals in the Equal Citizens document and other submissions, for example, the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities, the mainstream service provision, the right of redress, transparency regarding related services and the right to an independent assessment of need. Those are just some of the examples of the great benefit of contributions from representative groups and the responsiveness of the Department in taking account of them. We must remember all that was done before the Bill was even initiated in Dáil Éireann.Third, meetings and consultations continued between representative groups and the relevant Departments and committees. The Minister is to be commended for his work to accommodate changes to the Bill to address the concerns of the DLCG and others to the greatest possible extent. Throughout the legislative process, the proposed changes were accommodated by Government amendments and I commend all involved in this. I hope that if further amendments come to light while the Bill is before the Houses, they will also be taken into consideration.The Bill is a positive action measure, being made up of several distinct initiatives. On their own, the provisions may not look radical but taken together, they will over time lead to a sustained improvement in the lives of people with disabilities. There remain issues regarding definitions, access and resources but these have been spelt out in the House over the last few days.The majority of the various cases currently before the courts deal with children with autism. The legal costs associated with those cases will be substantial and an ordeal for the families involved. Could they be dealt with under the Bill once passed by the Oireachtas? That might be a more suitable, fairer and more cost-effective way to meet people's needs.In conclusion, I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, along with his predecessors, Deputies O'Dea and Mary Wallace, and the full Cabinet for introducing this Bill on the basis of the programme for Government. I wish the Minister every success.

I congratulate him on successfully steering this legislation through the other House and on to the Seanad. I also acknowledge a colleague from County Cavan, Councillor Peter McVitty, and his party in the Gallery, and welcome them to Dublin and the Seanad.The Disability Bill 2004 is very important. Once enacted, it will significantly advance the position of people with disabilities and be instrumental in sustaining progress into the long term. The Bill is one element of the national disability strategy, which the Taoiseach launched in September 2004. The strategy has three other elements, namely, the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004, six outline sectoral plans and a multi-annual investment programme for high-priority disability support services. The strategy represents a Government commitment to a significant development in policy and provision for people with disabilities, something that has been growing in recent years.People's minds have been more focused on disability and people with disabilities since the Special Olympics in 2003. We saw at first hand what can be achieved for and by people with physical and intellectual disabilities when resources are provided and people power and volunteerism get behind them. Among the established building blocks of the strategy are the strong anti-discrimination framework of employment equality and equal status legislation, the policy of mainstreaming services for those with disabilities, and a significant increase in investment in disability services over recent years. That framework is supported by an infrastructure comprising the Equality Authority, the Equality Tribunal, the National Disability Authority and Comhairle, which together have a positive influence on equality, service development and delivery and practices and attitudes generally.The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 is another important development, which has put in place a strong framework for the transformation of special needs education policy in this country. Last July, the Act created rights for children with special educational needs to an educational assessment, to the development of an individual education plan and to the delivery of education services on foot of that plan. I welcome the fact that this year, €2.9 billion, representing almost 7.5% of gross current public expenditure on services, will be spent in that way. That figure does not take account of income support and other services provided through the Department of Social and Family Affairs. Nor does it take account of the fact that many people with a disability participate in or benefit from mainstream public service programmes and services. The figure of €2.9 billion compares with expenditure of almost €0.8 billion in 1997. My colleague on the other side of the House, Senator McHugh, said he did not want to discuss what happened in 1997. The fact that this represents a 350% increase in spending since then tells me why.The Government has guaranteed a multi-annual investment programme totalling over €900 million, comprising capital and current funding for high-priority disability support services over the years 2006 to 2009. That funding focuses mainly on the health and education sectors and will enhance service levels where most necessary. The Bill already places an obligation on all public bodies to facilitate access to services by people with disabilities as far as practicable. That covers buildings, services and information. Disability is also one of the nine grounds under the equality legislation.I would like to address the issue of transport. The Department of Transport published the outline sectoral plan for transport as part of the national disability strategy launched by the Taoiseach in September 2004. The Department is committed to the comprehensive development of accessible public transport for people with mobility and sensory impairments. In addressing the issue of transport accessibility, the Department uses the term "accessible transport for the mobility and sensory impaired" to refer to people with physical, sensory, learning — Senator Coonan should listen to that word — and cognitive difficulties, and others whose access to traditional public transport services and infrastructure——

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I welcome the opportunity to address the Seanad on this sensitive issue. Like other Members and the public in general, I was extremely disturbed by the findings of "Prime Time" last Monday. It is outrageous that older people should be subjected to the type of environment portrayed in the programme and I am pleased that the Health Service Executive has reached agreement with the owners of the home to bring much-needed improvement into the operation of the facility.The Health Service Executive, northern area, has assigned a director of nursing and senior nursing staff to ensure the delivery of the highest standard of patient care in Leas Cross on a 24 hour basis. A clinical governance steering committee is being established. This will be multidisciplinary and will also involve a representative of the residents' families and an independent expert. The steering committee will oversee implementation of all recommendations as above. An independent inquiry team is being established to investigate all areas of concern. The HSE, northern area, will be exploring all options regarding the future management of the home.The agreement reached yesterday between the HSE and the home ensured that a director of nursing from the HSE began work in the home today. I have asked the HSE for a report on the latest position on the home, including the steps being taken to improve the unit. I have also received a commitment from Mr. Michael Walsh, chief executive of the HSE, northern area, that I will receive a progress report in one month's time on the operation of the action plan.In addition to my meeting yesterday with the HSE, I wrote to the Garda Commissioner and requested that gardaí meet with the HSE as a matter of urgency to discuss any issues that might be followed up by them. I hope there will be a visible and significant improvement in the welfare of the residents of Leas Cross and a happier future for them and their families.It has been the policy of successive Governments to maintain older people in dignity in their own homes for as long as possible, and to provide high-quality, long-term residential care for older people when this is no longer possible. It is internationally recognised that only 5% of the older population will need long-term care. However, people are now living longer lives and though most are leading healthy independent lives, the number in need of long-term care is increasing. There is demand on public long-stay places and there is a growing reliance on using private nursing home places. Many homes provide excellent nursing and care support for their residents and will continue to do so.The nursing home sector is governed by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and subsequent regulations. The Nursing Home (Care and Welfare) Regulations 1993 set out the standards to which the private nursing home sector must adhere for the purpose of registration under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990. The regulations only apply to the private nursing home sector and do not cover public long-stay facilities for older people. However, there was a commitment in the health strategy document, Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You, to extend the role of the social services inspectorate to other social services, including residential services for older people. The social services inspectorate will be established on a statutory basis and will be totally independent of the Health Service Executive. Its work will cover both public and private nursing homes and the Bill will be published later this year to put it on a statutory basis.The Department of Health and Children is reviewing urgently the operation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Home Regulations 1993 to strengthen the powers available to the Health Service Executive. This will be a wide-ranging review which will have the rights and welfare of the resident as the centre of its work. It will update the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the regulations so any issues regarding employment law, training of staff and so on are reflected in the new legislation. I intend to publish the Bill this year so we can have an open debate that will include all interested parties on a new environment for patients in nursing homes.Information is one of the most critical issues to be covered by the Bill. It is simply not satisfactory for people not to have comprehensive information easily available on services provided in nursing homes. The new Bill will include a clear statement on easy access by the public to inspectors' reports on nursing homes. The HSE will be developing a common national approach to the inspection of nursing homes. This work will be significantly helped by the fact that the HSE is a national agency and can implement a common policy more easily than heretofore when we had ten health boards and the Eastern Region Health Authority. The work of the HSE can complement the social services inspectorate when it is established on a statutory basis and common standards of inspection are applied.The Government's commitment to the development of a comprehensive range of services for older people can clearly be demonstrated by outlining the resources made available in recent years for service developments. Since 1997 additional spending on health care services is in excess of €302 million. In 2005 alone, it is estimated that €1,068 million will be spent on care of older people. This funding will be used for a variety of services including the nursing home subvention scheme, home care grants, home help service, an elder abuse programme and support to voluntary organisations. The Health Service Executive has piloted home care grant schemes as an alternative to long-term residential care to assist older people living at home. Older people who are being discharged from acute hospitals and those living in the community are being targeted under these schemes.In the HSE, eastern regional area, people have been discharged from acute hospitals under the Slán Abhaile and Home First pilot projects. These programmes aim to prevent the inappropriate placement of older people in long-term care settings, including private nursing homes, by facilitating older people who wish to go home following treatment in an acute hospital with the necessary home support services; to provide a timely and well-planned discharge to older people in hospital, thus reducing the number of days spent in hospital following treatment; to prevent unnecessary re-admission to hospital; to support vulnerable older people to remain living at home; and to support families who are caring for vulnerable older relatives at home. In the HSE, southern area, a similar project called Curam has been piloted, while the Choice programme in the HSE, north-west area, also provides such a scheme. The development of a national home care grant scheme is in keeping with a key recommendation in the O'Shea report on the nursing home subvention scheme which recommended that the health services develop a home-based subvention scheme for older people as an alternative to long-term residential care. Funding of €2 million has been allocated to the HSE in 2005 to develop the scheme further.There have been improvements in recent years in developing telephone supports for older people who may feel defenceless. The senior helpline, telephone 1850 440 444, was established with the support of the health boards in 1998 and has received in excess of 10,000 calls from lonely older people nationwide since 1999. The service is confidential and non-directive and is available throughout the State for the price of a local telephone call. The HSE indicates that there are now some 300 volunteers working from nine centres across the country. These are all older people who have gone through the rigorous training which is provided in conjunction with the health authorities.Since 2004, the Department has allocated funding totalling €72,800 for a promotion campaign aimed at raising awareness of the telephone number of the senior helpline. The HSE informs me that this telephone number was circulated to all doctors' surgeries in the State. In County Meath, the Summerhill Active Retirement Association received national lottery funding totalling €15,000 in 2003 to produce a booklet and promote the senior helpline. In December 2003, the HSE supported an independent evaluation of the helpline. This was carried out by Dr. Eamon O'Shea of the National University of Ireland, Galway and launched by the President, Mrs. Mary McAleese, who is patron of the helpline, in 2004.The HSE supports the implementation of the recommendations of the evaluation and this implementation is now well advanced. The senior helpline has responded to issues of elder abuse since its foundation. Volunteers have received specialised training, funded by the former health boards and provided by health service professionals specialising in the area of elder abuse, to enable them to deal with calls of this nature. Approximately 5% of calls in 2004 related to elder abuse. These callers establish a relationship of trust over a period of time with the older volunteers who take their calls and are often unable to seek external or professional intervention until they feel secure in discussing their situation.The senior helpline has expanded in recent years and three new centres are preparing to come on line later this year. In addition, the Department of Health and Children, through the HSE, has agreed to support further expansion of the helpline hours. Later this summer the service will also operate in the afternoons, expanding from a morning and evening service. Each senior helpline centre provides support materials for volunteers, with key contact details of health services appropriate to dealing with elder abuse situations where the caller wishes for such an intervention.The Government is fully committed to developing the services needed to tackle the problem of elder abuse. In 2003 we established the elder abuse national implementation group to oversee the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report, Protecting our Future —  Report of the Working Group on Elder Abuse, which was commissioned by the Government. Funding of €0.8 million was provided in 2003, €0.75 million in 2004 and a further €0.9 million in 2005 to continue with the implementation of these recommendations.Elder abuse is a complex issue and difficult to define precisely. It may involve financial, physical or sexual abuse, or it may arise due to inadequacy of care. It is defined in the report as "a single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person or violates their human and civil rights". It is hoped this report, in commencing with a definition of elder abuse, will give older people who feel they are the subject of abuse in any form the confidence to report their anxieties, as appropriate, to a social worker, public health nurse, garda or any professional or care worker.It is important that the issue of elder abuse be placed in the wider context of health and social care services for older people. As recommended in the report, multidisciplinary steering committees are being established at HSE area level to provide a common response to elder abuse throughout the State. The primary role of the steering committees is to plan, co-ordinate, support, monitor and evaluate an approach suitable to that particular HSE area. The report recommends that a clear policy on elder abuse be formulated and implemented at all levels of governance within the health, social and protection services in Ireland. The committees are in the process of developing clear policies and guidelines for the protection of vulnerable adults following wide consultations with staff. Their work is progressed through subgroups on legal aspects, policy and procedures and training.The HSE continues to provide and develop multidisciplinary training for internal and external staff as recommended in the report. The issue of elder abuse is being incorporated into professional training courses including gerontology courses. A number of research projects are ongoing, including the examination and review of medication for older persons in continuing care settings.In regard to the funding of long-term care, the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, which was commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, examined issues surrounding the financing of long-term care. A working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs has been established following the publication of the report. The objective of this group is to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care, taking account of the Mercer report, the views of the consultation that was undertaken on that report and the review of the nursing home subvention scheme by Professor Eamon O'Shea.The group has been requested to report to both the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Tánaiste by the middle of 2005. Following this process, it is the intention that there will be discussions with relevant interest groups. In the interim, work has been carried out in a number of HSE areas on developing standards for residential care for older people. In addition, the Irish Health Services Accreditation Board has commenced work on examining the development of accreditation standards for residential care for older people, both public and private. In this regard, it is developing a pilot programme which includes both public long-stay units and private nursing homes.It will be clear to Members from what I have outlined that the Government's commitment to older people cannot be denied. We acknowledge that we must continue to develop legislation in this area to meet the growing demand for services and that we cannot be complacent about this. This Government and its predecessor can be proud of their record to date but there is no room for complacency and we must continue with our efforts.

His claims regarding the Government's commitment to older people bear no relation to the truth in this matter. Once again, the Government has been found wanting and the fire brigade syndrome is in evidence. Instead of taking charge and being proactive as it should be, the Government merely reacts to crises. The purpose of any Government is to govern but there is little evidence of that. It is ironic that just as the examination of the Travers report by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children is being finalised, another scandal is already brewing regarding care of the elderly in private nursing homes.This situation was highlighted by Monday night's "Prime Time". However, the issue was only brought to light because of the ongoing work of a former Member of this House, Deputy O'Dowd, over seven years. He was blocked at every opportunity in his endeavours and his task made as difficult as possible, but he persisted in highlighting the issue and eventually got a result. It is even more amazing when one considers that there have been successive Ministers of State at the Department of Health and Children with devolved powers and sole responsibility for the welfare of the elderly. Why do these Ministries exist? Ministers of State presided over the fiasco of the illegal nursing home charges and now we are confronted with this situation.What other scandals regarding the elderly will break over the next few months or years? Why are junior Ministers with responsibility for the elderly unable to supervise effectively or prevent these events from happening despite having devolved powers? Why does the Government continue to depend on Opposition Deputies and the media to bring matters to their attention before finally taking action?The Minister of State's reaction to this matter was appalling. He discussed legislation that will be brought forward in autumn. Last Christmas, we sat extra days so that legislation on the illegal nursing home charges could be introduced. This Government has no problem in taking money from the elderly. However, we are told that it will be autumn before legislation to protect them will be introduced. Clear indications of Opposition willingness to take a shorter summer recess have not been matched.Media reports of this story are difficult to believe. In early 2000, it was reported that the prescription of one nursing home resident had not been renewed since 1999. We hear of cases where patients receive baths or showers every ten days. Food was cleared from dinner plates and kept for use in soup or stews the following day. Some of the information contained in the inspection reports on private nursing homes over the past five years was only recently released under the Freedom of Information Act. The Government, possibly because of these reports, sought to curtail this Act. Deputy O'Dowd found it difficult to do his work because of restrictions to requests under the Act and the shortage of staff in the Information Commissioner's office.The reaction to this matter contrasts starkly with the Government's introduction of flawed legislation to this House last Christmas. This legislation, which sought to take money from the elderly, was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court. It is amazing that the Government will not take up the offer to sit later this summer so that legislation may be enacted. While some may say that the Government is full of hot air, it is rapidly running out of steam. Despite being in its ninth year of power, it has failed to keep legislation up to date. A revolution has occurred since 1990.It is also amazing that advance notice of inspections is given to nursing homes. The inspectorate does not employ the legal minimum number of inspectors. It does not have power to shut down the worst offenders but must follow a lengthy legal process. Situations such as Leas Cross arose because of the inaction of this Government. Some 44 further incidents occurred in the few hundred nursing homes throughout the country.The Government has not taken cognisance of the fact that the population is aging. A number of public beds, including 147 long-stay beds, have been closed in the western area, which has put greater pressure on the private sector and forced more people into private nursing homes. The Government bears direct responsibility for this. It has made numerous commitments in this area, including the national health strategy in 2001, An Agreed Programme for Government in June 2002 and the Sustaining Progress programme since 2003. However, it has failed to introduce clear guidelines on standards of care. The national standards which were promised in 2001 have not yet been introduced. Nursing home inspectors continue to work within limited guidelines. The reinforcement of standards of care lacks uniformity across the voluntary, statutory and private sectors. The current regulations on private nursing homes is based upon the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the amendment to that Act passed in 2001. Power was not given to the inspectorate to close nursing homes.The changes made by the Government to the rules for requests under the Freedom of Information Act have a direct impact on these matters. Deputy O'Dowd found that he was impeded when making his request. If a front bench Deputy has difficulty in obtaining information on nursing homes, what hopes have the elderly and their families of getting the information they require?The Minister of State raised the issue of elderly abuse, which includes physical, psychological, financial, material and sexual forms of abuse, discrimination, neglect and acts of omission. In 1998, a working group was set up to investigate this issue and a report was commissioned. The group did not report until November 2002, when numerous recommendations were made. Unsurprisingly for this Government, few of these have been implemented. Recommended funding was in the region of €4.5 million per year but the Minister of State admits that €800,000 was provided in 2003, €750,000 in 2004 and €900,000 in 2005. Contrast these figures with the €60 million that was squandered on e-voting. I am unsure of the exact figures regarding the facility at Punchestown.The Seanad has no problem in sitting longer hours in order to pass legislation. This case has been a time bomb waiting to explode. We should not wait until autumn to bring in legislation.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I welcome the Minister of State to this House and thank him for putting his statement on record. It was important that my party gave up its allocated time for Private Members' business in order that this two hour debate is held and Members have the opportunity to put their views of this matter on record.I fundamentally disagree with the Minister of State's assessment of the situation. It is wrong that a Bill will be published later this year without a timeframe in terms of the implementation of an independent inspectorate. We should urgently revisit the matter because it is not the response that the country awaits. Political responsibility is needed.This is not the first time we have learned of these matters. In December 2002, the National Council on Ageing and Older People called for an independent inspectorate. In February 2001, my party brought a Private Members motion before the Dáil which called for an independent inspectorate but was voted down by the Government. In July 2001, the then Senator O'Dowd stated in this House:Senators might find it hard to believe that there is a nursing home in the North Eastern Health Board region that gets its patients up at 5.30 a.m., but it is true. The reason they are out of bed at that hour is that there are several high dependent patients there and there is inadequate staff to go in at 8 o'clock to get them dressed and ready for breakfast.In March 2002, the then Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Dr. Moffatt, said that no arrangements are in place for an independent inspectorate but that it was "planned to rectify this by expanding the role of the social services inspectorate to cover extended care facilities for older people." That was not done. In April 2003, a report from the Human Rights Commission was clear on similar problems which occurred in two places. A cursory reply was received eight months after sending the report to the Department of Health and Children but no action was taken. In December 2004, Deputy Seán Ryan was shot down when he called for an independent inspectorate.I put these matters on record because political responsibility should be taken. I am not aware of every problem which exists in the Department, although some were exposed in the Travers report. It is not good enough that politicians can hang senior civil servants out to dry while saving their own scalps. Nor is it good enough that three Ministers of State with specific responsibilities in the area have failed since 2000 to act to create an independent inspectorate and a more rigorous interim system of investigation to bridge the gap between the proposed statutory mechanism and the current ad hoc regime. Who takes responsibility for the failure? Is it the fault of senior civil servants? Will another assistant secretary have to pack his bags to be hived off to the Higher Education Authority? The matter goes to the heart of Government.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The key issue is a systematic cover up at the heart of our Government because Ministers do not want to take responsibility. Civil servants may have been blamed and shunted off to other public agencies, but political truths are being brought home at the Department of Health and Children and to those with political responsibility in the Houses of the Oireachtas for decisions taken.There is a question mark over the people to whom we are providing tax breaks to run nursing homes. Is it right and proper that someone who has made two large tax settlements with the Revenue Commissioners in recent years has been given the responsibility through a tax break to operate a nursing home facility? Our priorities are completely wrong in an area in which policy is being driven by a base profit motive. It is one of the reasons we must get to the root of the matter.The most important reason to establish an independent inspectorate immediately is not necessarily to deal with the cases highlighted by "Prime Time" but to address the vast majority of public and private nursing homes which do good work in the community. As they need an independent inspectorate to vindicate their good names, we need legislation now rather than at the end of the year.

It was only decided to take the business this morning. I welcome the opportunity to address the nursing homes issue and thank Senator Brian Hayes for putting it on the agenda by giving up his party's Private Members' time. The debate is timely for it is right to strike while the iron is hot. Sadly, the iron is a very hot one in this instance.The story outlined in the "Prime Time" investigation on Monday night was shocking, outrageous and appalling. Viewers could not believe their eyes. As I watched the programme with my 19 year old daughter, there were times when I had a tear in my eye. I told her that I could imagine, given my upset and shock despite not currently having a relative in a nursing home — though I have had in the past — what people with elderly family members in nursing homes were feeling as they watched. I thought of the kind of night they would have when they went to bed. I was terribly touched and affected by the programme.I record my congratulations to the "Prime Time" team and the programme's investigative journalist. It is not the first time they have been congratulated in the House nor will it be the last. It is wonderful to have the service they provide. I record also the appreciation of all Members for Mr. Justice Frank Clarke who did not issue a blocking injunction against the programme. As he rightly pointed out, the programme raised matters of great public importance. If it were not for Mr. Justice Clarke's actions, the Seanad would not be taking statements on the matter as Members would not have seen the programme. I look forward to Mr. Justice Clarke's final report which is due to be published on 8 June.The most shocking aspect of the programme were the allegations that patients were receiving substandard care. While we saw graphic footage, it should be remembered that the actions are alleged. We saw that bedding was not changed when patients had wet it, while a particular patient was forced to take his medication. The most appalling aspect of forcing the patient to take his medicine was the bullying to the effect that he would have to go to hospital if he refused to co-operate. When the patient used strong language, I commended him as it was exactly what I would have done.Where a family had paid for a night assistant for an elderly relative, no one was sitting in with the lady in question at night. When the investigator asked if the relatives knew this was happening, the answer was "No, and nobody will tell us". It was an example of fraud. The nursing home in question took money from a family and provided nothing in return. I am glad the Minister of State has brought the matter to the attention of the Garda.Unfortunately, as a result of the broadcast, the entire nursing home sector has come under fire. We must remember that not all the apples are bad. The great majority of nursing home care is delivered effectively, caringly and compassionately in what are often very difficult circumstances. We all know people with family members who suffer from Alzheimer's disease, incontinence or other serious complaints which affect elderly people and who receive excellent care and attention in long-stay nursing homes. We take our hats off to such professionally and compassionately staffed homes.I am glad to say Leas Cross has agreed the HSE can intervene.

#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Today, the HSE appointed a director of nursing at the home. Quite frankly, I did not see the matter as one of agreement as the nursing home had no choice in the matter. It is only my opinion. As the HSE has also deployed senior nursing staff, it is hoped that conditions will improve. There is an onus on An Bord Altranais to consider the matter and examine the footage we saw the other night in light of the fitness to practice of the nurses involved. While care workers are not covered by the fitness to practice regulations laid down by the Houses of the Oireachtas, the behaviour of nurses involved in these matters should be examined.I agree that it is necessary to create an independent inspectorate and that an inspector should not have to give warning of a visit. The only way we can get a true picture of conditions in a nursing home is if an inspector can simply arrive at a nursing home, knock on the door and say he or she is there to inspect a facility, warts and all. I was glad to hear the Taoiseach say yesterday that the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 was insufficient and would be reviewed as a matter of urgency. Today's newspapers indicate senior civil servants consider the current legislation and regulations to have been drawn up for a different era. Who could have envisaged we would have the number of private nursing homes we have seen established over the past five or six years? The legislation cannot be rushed and must be carefully considered. We all remember when only a few short months ago——

I remind the Opposition of the Rostrevor nursing home on the south side of Dublin. This case was much publicised in recent months. The High Court decided the health board did not have the right to close this nursing home. Appalling actions also took place in that nursing home and the law could do nothing about it. That is why we should not rush this legislation. Let us——

There cannot be a knee-jerk reaction every time something happens. This nursing home is one of a few bad apples but, as I pointed out, there are excellent nursing home facilities doing a wonderful job.Nursing home developments receive significant tax breaks from the State. I am in favour of this approach, particularly given that we have an aging population. There is a great need for more facilities, especially modern facilities. Developers and management of nursing homes should be mindful of the benefits they receive from taxpayers. These facilities should be run in a manner that is acceptable to all. Mismanagement and mistreatment of patients should be dealt with severely. We should consider the withdrawal of tax breaks when a nursing home is run in the despicable manner which we recently witnessed on the RTE documentary. Benefits should be withdrawn. No more than taking money from patients' relatives, this would amount to some type of fraud. I would not be in favour of allowing people such generous tax breaks if they were found guilty of wrongdoing.I am delighted the Minister of State referred in his speech to the issues currently being debated and discussed. As members of the National Economic and Social Forum, Senator Kate Walsh and I sit on a sub-committee which was set up to look after services for the elderly. We have looked at nursing homes, long-stay care for patients and acute hospitals. A high proportion of patients are being left in acute hospitals. I am delighted that the Slán Abhaile programme is providing for a significant number of those people to be sent home with grants and other supports to allow for care in the community. It is clear that people would prefer to stay at home to access care. We should put whatever financial resources that are available into keeping people at home. Everybody would benefit from that, not only older people but the children who will have their grandparent or other older relative around while they are growing up, which is a great benefit.I thought this debate was on the nursing home issue and I confined my remarks to this area. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children is just finishing a six to seven week examination of the Travers report on which it will publish a report next week. I say to Opposition Senators that if they had read——

However, I should not be surprised.The Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, is an old friend of mine and a fellow countyman. I am sure he was celebrating like I was on Sunday night. He was given a script which has nothing to do with the issue. There is a list in here about the wonderful things that are being done for the elderly. The fundamental issue is how it is possible——

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	244	How is it possible to have a nursing home carry on like that without anybody taking action to stop it until a television programme is made? That is the issue. The rest of what is in the script is very important but it does not have anything to do with the issue we are discussing. The television programme did no more than make visual in one specific case what we all should have known and did know — if we did not want to deny it — for the past 20 years.In 1984, RTE produced a television programme called "Public Account" which recounted horrific stories of nursing homes. Now we know what happened in 2001, 2002 and 2003. We know what the Human Rights Commission said and we also know the grand way in which the Department of Health and Children has consistently treated anybody who tried to get it to do anything. It made the Ombudsman wait for nearly a year when he compiled his report some time ago on families being made to pay for elderly relatives in nursing homes. The suggestion that this is a horrible story that nobody knew anything about, or somehow that it is the Opposition's fault that nothing was done about it, is quite extraordinary. Why was the problem ignored?I am sick of people claiming to be the Minister for Health and Children who deliberately leave unread any brief which gives them anything other than glory, which would mean they would have to take hard decisions to make people accountable and take responsibility. It is a problem that Fianna Fáil has in particular and the Progressive Democrats are catching it, which is that Government is about glory not about responsibility. If nursing homes are badly run, it is the Government's fault. If people in nursing homes are ripped off, it is the fault of the Government and the Minister. There is no way out of that. If people do not wish to take responsibility they should go and allow those of us who do to take responsibility. The Government parties have lost the will to take the blame or the responsibility for anything.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	246	The Tánaiste went missing for two days on this issue. If €100 million extra were being spent on residential care for the elderly, would one expect the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, to be wheeled out on "Morning Ireland" on Tuesday morning to explain it? We would have the Tánaiste demanding half an hour to herself to announce the good news. When there was a difficult issue, the poor Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power, whom I like and respect, was wheeled out while the Tánaiste, who told us she is brave, went missing. That is what I call ducking responsibility. In recent months the Tánaiste told us how brave she is. This was her responsibility, as she wants the glory for it. Why is our inspection system timid, slow, late and impotent? I do not know but there are only two conclusions I can make. One points to a level of administrative incompetence that defies description and the other to a reluctance to confront the issue because of the possible implications for the public purse. If it is believed that it will cost too much to rectify the problem, thus implying we will leave old people at risk of being left to sleep all night in their own urine, then our priorities, as articulated by Government, are entirely wrong.We were able to set up quickly a private system to inspect our guesthouses. The former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, did so in six months and removed responsibility in this regard from Bord Fáilte. There were no complex issues or problems to be addressed. Guesthouses now have to meet the standards that have been set. The new system was established in no time at all. We have a food safety authority whose representatives can walk into any restaurant at any time without notice and exercise the power to close it down if it is not cleaned up after having been deemed filthy. The authority does not have to go to court to achieve this.I am told that reasonable levels of nursing, physical and medical care are available in a limited number of premises, which number fewer than the number of guesthouses. I am told the problem is complex. It is complex because the Government does not want to address it, for whatever reason, presumably because it is afraid it will be left with another bill. The only logical assumption I can make is that the limited money the Government believes is at its disposal would be wasted on the elderly because there would be no votes in addressing the issue. Another conclusion is that the Government is in cahoots with the owners of the nursing homes and does not want to embarrass them. I do not want to go down that road.The second issue to be addressed in determining why circumstances are as they are is secrecy. Until 1998, health boards were allegedly inspecting nursing homes and keeping the reports secret. It was a matter of national policy that no health board would disclose the report of any inspector of any nursing home. After the enactment of the Freedom of Information Act, reports were disclosed but the Government decided to make it difficult to obtain them. There has been a dramatic drop since the Information Commissioner imposed draconian charges on those obtaining information. The health authority can say it will not publish the inspectors' reports and a considerable sum must be paid to appeal every decision.Information, limited and bad as it was, was available and the Government decided to make it harder to obtain it. That is not its fault either. It is not its fault that it had five opportunities and ignored them. It is not its fault that it ignored the Human Rights Commission and that it wrote a script for a Minister of State that does not even address the problem. It is not its fault that people do not know what is going on.This is not a debate about a particular nursing home but about a system under which we do not really want to enforce the law. We do not want laws that are powerful or people to take them seriously. I am becoming entirely sick of a succession of examples that are arising in this regard. On issues affecting immigrant workers, we do not do anything unless there is a complaint by people who cannot speak English. On planning enforcement, we all know how few planning enforcement orders are issued around the country. For a long time the Health and Safety Authority did not do anything until somebody was killed because it did not believe in being too rigorous. We have a list of such examples. The fundamental problem, of which the nursing home abuse is a particularly revolting symptom, is systematic indifference to making the laws of the land apply to those who are rich and powerful. This is true of most nursing home owners.It is quite extraordinary that the body representing legitimate, good nursing home owners expressed its total frustration on the radio over the fact that it could not get the Government to take action. It wants action. Has the Government, which preaches about the need to reduce regulation, decided its ideology has carried it so far it does not want to introduce any regulation in this area? I do not know. How does one follow the logic of a Government that states it can regulate guesthouses, restaurants and Chinese takeaways at 2 a.m. but cannot regulate the places in which old people have to live? It is not a question of money or complexity but of political priorities.The Government says the legislation is complex. I guarantee that I and my Labour Party colleagues in this House will introduce a Bill before the House rises for the summer to deal with this issue if the Government cannot do so. I will offer it to the Government and it can deal with it. The problem is not very complex; it is simply a matter or rewriting some sections of existing legislation and specifying in some detail, or giving the Minister the authority to specify in some detail, those provisions that need to be specified. The only reason the Government will not do so is because it will not remove any legislation from its legislative programme, thus implying the elderly must wait.I agree with Senator Feeney and others that the vast majority of nursing homes are of an excellent standard. I do not know this but believe it and make an act of faith by trusting in the common decency of most of the people who run such facilities. When I go into a restaurant I do not have to depend on my belief in the common decency of the people who run it because I know there is a food safety authority with clout and the capacity to close it down. This has the wonderful effect of concentrating people's minds. We agree such regulation should apply to restaurants and, as I stated, Chinese takeaways at 2 a.m., yet we cannot find a place in a crowded legislative schedule to achieve this for our old people, even though the organisation representing most of the nursing homes asked the Government to do so and although representative after representative has called repeatedly for an inspectorate since 1984. It is 18 months since the representative organisation asked for this measure.This issue is not solely about the Leas Cross nursing home, horrific as the abuse that took place there may be, but about why the system could be as it is. How could we have created an inspection regime under which inspectors must phone institutions to state when they will be making their inspections? One can only conclude it is a deliberate ploy to give people a chance to put their affairs in order. This is not how inspections should be carried out. Imagine what would happen if an inspector phoned a restaurant to state he would be inspecting it the following Thursday. It would be spotless. This bears no consideration at all.There is a fundamental requirement for legislation that gives the power to set standards, inspect institutions and close them down if necessary. It should make it perfectly clear that the State has an explicit power and right to close down institutions that are not up to standard, just as it can do in respect of a restaurant or guesthouse. Such legislation is urgent and should be backed up by the necessary resources to ensure that every nursing home can be inspected frequently and without notice at various hours of the day and night. Thus, we will really know what is happening therein. When such legislation is enacted, I will not have to make acts of faith in human nature and will know what I believe to be the case, namely, that the majority of nursing homes are run by good people who care. Until we enact it, we are not only letting down old people but also those who run good nursing homes around the country.

I thank the Fine Gael group for making available its Private Members' time to deal with this issue. It is a very serious issue and not a political football. Before I left my office to come to the Chamber, I noticed many files. If I had wanted to bring the set of files on the underwhelming performance of previous Administrations, I could have done so. I did not do so, however, because I want to talk about the revelations contained in the programme on Monday night.Perhaps this debate could focus more on ways to improve the circumstances that obtain rather than on what could have or should have been done in the past. There is collective responsibility throughout the Houses of the Oireachtas and in all parties. There are many reasons for failure but no excuses. If we could focus on conceptualising ways to improve this situation in the best possible and most efficient manner we would be better served than through playing political football, hamming on this issue or repeatedly going back over the past. However, the statistics show that this Administration and the one immediately preceding it did more for the elderly than any other Government in the history of the State. That is a fact.The elderly are the most important section of our society. When the great history books are written at the turn of the next century, if the names of any of the political entities in these Houses are remembered it will only be because of the elderly of today and in the future. These are the people who laid the foundations that allowed the birth of a Celtic tiger or an environment where an economy such as today's could thrive.As a result everything that can be done for the elderly should be done. If that means sacrificing services for the young and healthy in other age groups, then it should be done willingly, and to that end we should be prepared to make that sacrifice.I watched Monday night's "Prime Time" programme. It was the first one of these investigative programmes I had seen and it was excellent. I am delighted the national broadcaster is putting its funds to such positive use, helping us to get to the root of many of the problems that still exist. It was a very good, courageous and pioneering programme. We need more of this kind of programming and I look forward to the next one and the subsequent debates in this House about the issues they bring to our attention on which we are not focusing enough time. That has to be positive. It is not political football, but politics and democracy at work in a positive way.As Senator Feeney has said, what the programme showed was appalling. I do not believe anybody would like to stand over it. I do not want to be facetious, but I immediately thought that my 11 month old son will have to face a codicil in my will to ensure he is not going to put me into any home.We have an aging population, with about 11.3% over the age of 65. The Central Statistics Office predicts that by 2030 that percentage will have more than doubled to 24%. A great many things must be done in terms of helping to alleviate such problems and to ensure they do not happen again. Everything possible must be done for the elderly, so they get the care they deserve and need.Both the Minister of State and Senator Feeney alluded to the fact that most of us would like to be cared for in our own homes in old age. I like to think that is the direction in which we could go. Senator Feeney has mentioned some of the many schemes already in operation in this regard. I would like to see those further expanded, so anybody who has a condition which can be cared for at home should be provided for. The necessary financial arrangements or grant schemes should be put in place to encourage this approach. If tax incentives or other schemes are needed, these should be put in place. For those who cannot afford such arrangements there should be some waiver schemes whereby through State intervention this facility may be offered.Obviously, everybody cannot be cared for at home. Some conditions require long-term residential care in nursing homes. I agree with much of what Senator Ryan had to say on the specific issue. Perhaps none of us could have expected that there would have been abuses as shown on television last Monday. I was shocked. I am sure that every self-respecting person was shocked that people abused their positions in the manner they did and perpetrated the types of mistreatment that were shown. It is completely unacceptable. Now that we know about it, however, there is a clear need for an independent inspectorate. We do not need one that phones in advance to say in effect, "Listen, we are going to call around tomorrow, so get the house in order." Can the House imagine if gardaí were to phone the local publican to alert him or her that they would be visiting at a particular time? That is not realistic and we cannot have that approach.Senator Ryan referred to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. Having worked in the food industry I am aware of an organisation called the European Food and Safety Inspection Service, EFSIS. If one is lucky enough to get a contract to supply Tesco or whatever it is an essential prerequisite to have the EFSIS standard. Its inspectors carry out audits, uninvited, whenever they want at whatever time of the day, and have access to everything. That is in private industry. It might be hard to believe, but it does happen.We need a similar type of system for nursing homes. As many people have said, the vast majority give excellent care and stick closely to the regulations. Many relations of mine have been cared for extremely well in a host of nursing homes throughout this country. However, it is reasonable to assume that the Leas Cross nursing home is not an isolated incident and that there are others. Therefore, following on from the "Prime Time" investigative programme there needs to be an urgent review of all nursing homes in the country.I welcome the fact that the HSE has established an independent inquiry team to investigate all areas of concern in line with the Department of Health and Children's policy document, Trust in Care. I also welcome the fact that it has put in the necessary nursing staff and made the changes at Leas Cross.It is safe to assume, however, that this is not an isolated incident. I therefore appeal to the Minister of State to use all the resources within his good offices to carry out an investigation at all nursing homes in advance of the introduction of an inspectorate. The legislation will be very welcome when it comes and is needed as a matter of urgency. Obviously, there are realities to be addressed and the parliamentary draftsmen have to put things together in a particular manner. The Minister of State is fully committed to bringing that legislation forward as a matter of urgency and I look forward to it very much.There is no doubt that every self-respecting citizen was appalled by what Monday night's programme revealed. I do not believe any Member of this House could have imagined the type of things that were going on in that particular nursing home and it is unacceptable. This issue should not be made into a political football, however. It is not a political issue. It is one which all self-respecting public representatives and citizens should engage in to proactively conceptualise ways in which the situation may be improved quickly, rather than people trying to score cheap political points, two years from a general election.

It took a great deal of technical ingenuity using a small camera, whether in a tie pin or whatever. The visual image was very clear. The sound was also quite good. It was remarkable. That is what I call real investigative journalism. We sometimes hear people talk about investigative journalism and really what they mean is snooping into the sex lives of pop stars and so on. I do not regard that as investigative journalism, but I regard this programme as good investigative journalism because it highlighted a situation which needs to be addressed and brought it to the attention of the public and the Government.I learned a great deal from the programme. I have had elderly relatives and connections in homes. My aunt, whom I absolutely adored, went into the Alexandra Guild House. It nearly closed but with the assistance of colleagues here I managed to put forward a programme to rescue it. Some 30 old ladies were given the stability of continuing to live there. It is a wonderful place. They do their own home baking. The staff absolutely adore their patients. It was a home in the sense of being a place where a community lived. I enjoyed going there. However, I know that people are afraid of the idea of a nursing home because they fear the sinister elements surrounding such homes. My aunt lived to the age of 103. She had very little wrong with her until, at the age of 102, she fell and broke her hip. She was transferred to a State facility. I do not want to completely blame the people there because they are under great pressure but my aunt almost immediately developed a bed sore. It was only when she got back to the Alexandra Guild House that the staff there cured it.I believe people develop such sores because there is such pressure on the nursing profession that they are not able to do what they are required to do. Elderly people can be quite intractable sometimes. Many of the people in these homes are confused and a little contrary. The nurses should turn such patients every three hours and so on but with the pressure they are under they do not do so, and I am sure about that.In light of my experience, I agree it is important to inspect private nursing homes because this is to where our attention has been drawn but it is unacceptable that there is no inspection of the State nursing homes and there should be. In the case of private nursing homes, inspections are supposed to be carried out twice a year but they are not.Some time ago I raised a matter on the Adjournment brought to my attention by a person in my neighbourhood who cherished his mother who was put into St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park. Her son complained about the conditions in that hospital. I wrote a snotty letter to the director of that hospital and I got a snotty letter back and, as often happens in my life, that was the beginning of a friendship. The director said that if I was so interested in this issue, I should show some realism and come out to see the staff there. I said "What a good idea, I will". I went out and had a look and I have to say I admire the medical professionals, the nurses, the physiotherapists, the occupational therapists and so on who work in these disastrous conditions. They are absolutely awful. In one place there were leaks from a converted swimming pool. There was one lavatory for two wards. In such circumstances, how can facilities be kept clean? In those circumstances, I pity the staff as much as the patients. Some of the patients were quite happy and they were looked after as well as possible but some of them were clearly distressed.As a friend of James Joyce, an old lady whom I knew in Zurich said to me, "David, age is a cage; it is not always attractive". One is very lucky if, like my aunt, one keeps physically well, mentally alert and emotionally balanced. Many people do not. They are confused, feel threatened and think they are not able to afford to stay in these places. They are worried about their meals and their families. I know of cases where one can visit a patient and ten minutes later receive a call in one's car — as was the case with another relative of mine — to inquire why one had not been in to see that person in a fortnight. These people are confused and difficult. They need our care as much as possible.There are not enough inspectors and they do not have proper powers. What is the point in inspecting if there is nothing one can do? The only point of having inspectors is if they are able to impose a sanction. The two sanctions that should be available are the power to close a nursing home or the power to impose a fine. Some of these places can well afford to pay such a fine. I read in a newspaper today that Leas Cross was doing all right. It made a profit of something like €60,000 and last year it made a profit of €500,000 on foot of a grant.I listened to a radio programme yesterday and was interested to hear a woman who rang in who was a member of the staff of that nursing home. She said she was horrified by the programme. Maybe I am gullible but I believed her. She said she was in a different unit and absolutely loved her elderly patients. She sounded sincere. It may be that even within that nursing home there are different levels of care.I mentioned the problem of bed sores which I also mentioned the other day. I thought that developing a bed sore was inevitable after a certain age but this is not the case if a patient is turned in bed and so on. A connection of mine, a Hungarian lady, got one of these awful things and I thought it was inevitable but it was not. We need to make some further degree of investment in this area to protect people whose number we may, if we are lucky, join and we will expect our successors in this House to look after our interests.I noticed one of the rather unpleasant nurses who was pushing his fingers into a patient's face, shouting at her and making inappropriate remarks and so on — his behaviour was not such that it could be described as criminal, it just seemed to be terribly unpleasant — but he was continually referred to as a Filipino. That is not fair because there are many wonderful, kind, gentle and good Filipino nurses. Our hospital system would be swept away without them.

I am glad to have this opportunity to discuss this awful issue. I thank the Minister of State for facilitating this debate at such short notice and for listening to such an array of abuse which is most offensive.I could nearly cry when I think back on that programme the other night. I do not want to make a political football out of this issue. I do not want Members to barrack each other across the floor of the House as to how good Members opposite would have been in dealing with this issue if they had been on this side of the House and how bad Members on this side are because we did not do the job we should have done.We should be all singing the one tune in regard to this issue. This is a dreadful situation. All of us who saw that programme were shocked. We heard of the litany of suffering those elderly people had to endure. I was shocked and mesmerised looking at the screen when I saw a patient's bed sores, a carer putting his hand into the face of a patient and compelling her to take her tablets on another occasion, and, when an elderly lady called for attention, the carer was sleeping in a chair. That was shocking. This nursing home was run as a commercial outfit. These patients were not treated as people in the eyes of the owners of this nursing home. That shocked me all the more.We should have had regulations in place. We are all wrong in that regard. I was a Member of this House when the Members opposite were in Government and the need to update the regulations and the nursing Act of 1990 did not arise. We all are guilty of that. The Members opposite should not give us the line that they are better than us. I am here to make sure that this will never happen again.

I ask that proper training be provided for carers who work in these nursing homes. If I had my way nobody would be cared for in nursing homes. I would follow the line of extending the home grants, the home help service and provide extra support for voluntary organisations. That would be my choice. I would not like to see any member of my family going into a nursing home because I do not know how many more nursing homes there are like the one that has been described. I have visited fine nursing homes and met many excellent, caring and sensitive staff there. This programme shocked me. While the Minister of State should initiate the necessary legislation, regardless of when it appears, the message is out. We have seen how people running a nursing home abused their position.I am pleased there are such fine investigative journalists who conducted these interviews under intense pressure and worked to elderly the elderly people's point of view. We can thank the media for presenting this story, which will not happen again. We are aware of the problem and we will remedy the situation. We do not need any lectures to tell us how to do it. The Minister of State has heard the contributions made tonight and will be receptive to the points made. The Government will implement whatever measures are necessary to ensure that elderly people can live in an independent and dignified way.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and thank him for coming at such short notice to respond to these statements. I appreciate the chance to make some points arising from the exposé aired on television on Monday last. There is no doubting the strength of the reaction among the public, the media and in both Houses of the Oireachtas.I wish to add my voice to the expressions of shock, anger and dismay at the images of abuse of elderly people, shown on our televisions. No one should attempt to play down the disturbing nature of this issue. While we were rightly shocked at what we saw, I was not shocked at the debate on standards in nursing homes. I do not usually find it useful to rehash old statements, but on 15 April 2003 I said: "To maintain high standards of care in residential homes, an even more rigorous inspection system is essential". The wider issue of care for the elderly was debated that night.The makers of Monday's programme will receive plaudits from all sources for the exposé but I was more shocked at being presented with the video images than at the fact that this type of abhorrent behaviour can happen. It happens across the world. When I made that statement two years ago I feared that this type of abuse was possible and probable, and may always be. That may not sound right but international surveys unfortunately show that 4% of residents in institutions are subject to abuse. I am not defending or condoning this but being honest and balanced.In response to my contribution that day, the then Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly stated that I had, "made a number of suggestions that should be considered. These matters are under consideration". This matter is under consideration again today, in the shadow of horrific evidence.Amid the outcry, we must look at who is responsible for what we saw on Monday night. Comments were made earlier to the effect that the Tánaiste had gone missing. The Tánaiste did not go missing. With all due respect to the Minister of State, we do not want micro-management at all times. People have responsibilities and should be allowed to speak at appropriate times. A Minister should not have to deal with every issue that arises in his or her Department.In the first instance, responsibility for the ill-treatment of elderly citizens lies with the so-called carers in the home in question. Untrained staff were left to their own devices and the possibility of this type of unacceptable behaviour occurring is high. There may be little we in this House can do to address this directly.Responsibility also lies with the management and owners of residential homes. When they accept patients from trusting families, they have a serious duty to ensure that residents in their care are treated to the highest standards. When the law is broken in this regard, it is imperative that there is an inspection system whereby the full rigours of that law are implemented. This is integral to deterring other unscrupulous individuals from perpetuating ill-treatment of older people.A measure of responsibility lies with attending medical staff also. I hope that any general practitioner or nurse who tended to an older person would be able to identify any evidence of ill-treatment, and to act on that evidence through the relevant authorities. That responsibility should be supported in legislation.It is a sad reality of modern society that families do not always treat their older members with the respect they deserve. If that is the case, families of patients must also take responsibility for allowing their loved ones reside in sometimes less than suitable conditions. I do not refer to any family of those persons depicted in Monday's programme. However, we must discuss this issue honestly and openly. Therefore, responsibility must be apportioned wherever it should lie.Our national broadcaster has provided a public service in many ways, for many years. The programmes it continues to make are of the highest standards and have helped to bring issues to the heart of public debate and the top of political agendas. I am concerned, however, when there is any suggestion of a lack of balance in reporting.There are many fine residential homes, public and private. Many fine staff and management run these homes. We should keep this in mind. No one can defend the behaviour revealed on Monday night. Training, standards and inspection must be looked at anew. We must do everything in our power to protect those whose capacity to protect themselves is reduced.Responsibility for abuse of any individual lies with the abuser in the first instance, and this House has a role in making sure that the required legislation is in place to make it possible to deal with such individuals. No one should underestimate what we saw and I am not trying to play it down but we all have responsibilities. I mentioned this two years ago. Perhaps I should have mentioned it every day since. When we speak of responsibilities we must be clear about what we mean. The issue of abuse of the elderly and ageism is changing dramatically because of the way our society has evolved.We all have much to learn and have many questions to ask. I hope the outcome of this programme will be a debate that will result in the necessary legislation being brought forward to support the Minister of State in his responsibilities and those administering nursing homes to care for the patient and the elderly and to give that the highest priority if we value society the way we should.

I did not come in here to make political capital out of this scandal but given the number of footballs kicked about here this evening, one would think the debate was being held on a soccer pitch rather than in the Seanad. I was disappointed that in her contribution Senator Ormonde could not, for political reasons, pay tribute to Deputy O'Dowd who was responsible for the programme, aired on Monday night, which has unveiled a litany of abuse. It was he who conducted most of the research and was credited as having done so and he deserves all our praise. I also salute all those involved in the programme.Senator Feeney's closing remarks were disappointing. Deputy O'Dowd has been a Member of the other House for the past three years and was a Member of this House for five years. During those eight years he has campaigned on this issue and has done more as an Opposition Member for people in nursing homes than have all the Government Deputies and Senators in a period of unprecedented economic opportunity.I join with colleagues who have expressed the view that an independent inspector be introduced for public and private nursing homes. Senator Norris was correct in emphasising that public facilities should also be inspected and must not be excluded, although it should be pointed out that there are many involved in the nursing home structure who own and operate fine premises on which the country depends and we should not tar everyone with the same brush. However, following on from the scenes on our television screens on Monday night it is clear that urgent action in this area is needed. An appropriate inspectorate should be established and I urge the Government to ensure that the necessary legislation is introduced as soon as possible and is not allowed drag on over the next few months.I thank the Government side of the House for providing the opportunity to hold this debate. Given that the demographic profile of the country is ageing, there is a need for the establishment of more nursing homes. For that reason I support many of the initiatives introduced by the Government such as tax incentives for those who wish to build them. It is clear there is a need for extra places, especially in view of the exorbitant rates charged by the home featured in the television programme screened on Monday night and in other homes throughout the country.I cannot share Senator Ormonde's view on nursing homes. There are some people who, through no fault of their own or their families, have to be catered for in them. I would like to think that the day will not come when I have to go to a nursing home but who can tell the future.

Senator Ormonde's suggestion does not bear any resemblance to reality nor did many of her other suggestions.Senator Browne raised an important issue about whether homes should be classified as hospitals or commercial enterprises. That should be addressed. The Government should have acted three years ago when the Human Rights Commission issued its report and uncovered some of what we saw on our television screens on Monday night. If I am accused of making a political football out of it, so be itbut it is my job as an Opposition spokesperson to highlight these issues inside and outside the House. The Government was negligent in not acting on the commission's report.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I thank Senator Phelan for sharing his time. Now is the time for measured words. The Government has got many things right when it comes to care of the elderly. In my local town there is a public nursing home, Plunkett Home, which it is a joy to visit. Family members live in the community. However, there are cases where the Government has not got it right. We waited a full year for a physiotherapist to be stationed in Plunkett Home in Boyle with the result that the elderly in the home were without physiotherapy for a year and a half. That was a case of negligence.There are instances where nursing homes cannot employ somebody or where nobody wants to locate in an area full time. These situations should not be allowed to continue for such a long period. If the elderly have to go without physiotherapy for a year and a half it is systematically robbing them of their integrity and their health. While the Government has got much right in this area there are instances where it has got it wrong.There are times when somebody should say we did not ensure the right procedures were followed. For example, what is the position of health boards? There are individuals in executive positions in the health boards who should ensure proper procedures are in place and that there are proper inspections. Will anybody in the health boards have to apologise or be sacked? No, because a cosy cartel has been created that is more important than the politicians. As politicians we can shout, as can the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children but these individuals know they are safe in their positions, where the benchmarking awards apply, which I welcome. However, these people must ensure they put in an honest day's work for an honest day's pay. We have created many positions of title but no responsibility. Perhaps, it is time to look at many of these positions. Clearly, the health boards need to be looked at.Many would not be in nursing homes were it not for cutbacks in home help. Every day I, along with other politicians on both sides of the House, try to get extra home help. If home help cannot be secured the elderly have to go into a public hospital or a public or private nursing home. These are areas where we can make a difference.As a restaurateur I find it hard to believe that while environment health officers have the powers of inspection and can close down a business if one's kitchen is a little dirty, there is no knock-on effect on some of the poor unfortunate elderly who have been systematically humiliated, as we saw in the television programme on Monday night. Sometimes the power of the media can be more important than the power of politicians. In this instance the media has instilled a sense of fear in those who want to go into a nursing home. Even those of us at a young age are beginning to ask who will look after us.Perhaps it is time to look at the family unit. We may have become very selfish. Instead of putting our elderly parents into nursing homes we should perhaps consider looking after them at home. This situation has created a sense of anxiety and disbelief. This has been a very important lesson which should not be regarded as a political football. The Government has take some action but on this occasion it could do better.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Power. He is a man who calls it as he sees it which is what is required in this situation. Undoubtedly this is a litmus test for how we care for the most vulnerable, the young and the aged, in our society. Unfortunately, there have been serious failures in that regard in the specific case of Leas Cross. As was stated by Senator Feeney and endorsed by Senator Ryan and others, the majority of nursing homes are extremely well run and managed to quite a high standard, as should be the case.The Acting Chairman will be familiar with New Ross. I was the founding chairman of the community hospital there which the Minister of State visited not so long ago. I have an insight into the process. We recruited a psychiatric nurse from a neighbouring hospital who took on the position of administrator. He turned out to be excellent. He put very good management procedures in place, recruited good staff and today, 15 years later, it is now run to a very good standard with its own hospice unit, and provides respite care and a step-down facility for the health board. The community is very proud of the hospital. The person we recruited was not in a position to find a career path within the health board system. He is now the manager of the newest major hospital in Dublin. Others were recruited internationally and failed to stay the course and he is now in charge of that hospital.Coming from a business background I am convinced that whether it is a business operation, a hospital or the public service, one is dependent on good quality management. Unfortunately, Leas Cross did not have this and obviously did not have sufficiently caring nursing staff to attain the high standards necessary in this area.It must be acknowledged that a systems failure existed within the Department which it would be wrong to understate. Unfortunately, this comes on the heels of other systems failures. The programme "States of Fear" dealt with historical issues within educational institutions and the Morris tribunal report highlights serious public service flaws. The time has come to examine the issue. The vast majority of public servants have made a significant contribution to all aspects of society and particularly to economic development. They should not be dragged down by a not insignificant minority who simply are not performing. I know how difficult it is to deal politically with issues such as this because politics often depends on people. I know of instances at local government level where councillors critical of the lack of performance of individuals and of the systems were subsequently boycotted by that system which refused to deal with them. This is unacceptable in a democracy and should not be allowed to continue.In this regard I listened with interest to Senator Feighan. On the question of the introduction of benchmarking it is only right and proper that people in the public service would be appropriately paid for their responsibilities and for their performance. If there is to be a successor to the last benchmarking I hope it will be performance-based.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	270	No system should pay people who do not perform. I know that within the public service there are people who have opted out for whatever reason, such as disappointment over not being promoted or a lack of motivation. One of the great problems in the public service is the security of jobs for life. This should not be the situation. People should be paid and their jobs should be dependent on economic issues and on continuing to perform. Many safeguards are in place to ensure this is not abused by employers in the private sector. Perhaps the time has come to do likewise in the public service.The Lindsay tribunal dealt with the HIV scandal. Of all the tribunals and scandals in this country over the last decades, without any shadow of a doubt, this was certainly the most significant and the worst. Nobody has been held to account and nobody is in jail because of it. People cannot be insulated.My argument was unwittingly underscored by Senator O'Toole when he referred to benchmarking as almost akin to visiting the ATM. The only difference between it and you and I visiting the ATM is the arrival of the bank statement which shows a deposit must be made subsequently to meet the money extracted. In this instance the money is coming out of the taxpayers' pockets. The system needs the introduction of some reality. We owe this to ourselves and to people within the public service who are performing exceptionally well; these people could in the private sector achieve much more enhanced economic benefit for themselves but are committed to public service.Perhaps the time has come to establish a ministry of modernisation of the public service. One of the first places to start might be in the Department of Health and Children where some significant problems exist. I am aware that I have been critical in my comments but it needs to be said. I am glad the debate tonight has not divided along party political lines but instead the subject has been dealt with constructively. The Department has Ministers in whom I have the utmost confidence when it comes to dealing with the issues in the best interests of society, the public at large and the public service. I wish them well.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I wish to share my time with Senators Cummins and Finucane.I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I watched the programme with shock as did everybody else. It was particularly shocking because I knew one of the families involved but I never realised the experience they went through and the conditions under which their mother lived in the nursing home and subsequently died as a result of the lack of good care which she should have received there.We have all let down those elderly people who have suffered in the Leas Cross nursing home or who are suffering in other nursing homes. We can be sure the same type of behaviour is happening in other nursing homes. I hang my head in shame at the thought that I would be responsible in any way for allowing an elderly person to be cared for in such a situation. If we cannot look after our elderly people in a proper fashion we should hang our heads in shame. These are the elderly people who worked in this country during very difficult times and the least they deserve now is to be cared for in their old age at a time when our country is doing really well and when many of us have money in our pockets. It is to all our shame that they should have been put into such a vulnerable position. It is urgent that we put measures in place to ensure this practice ceases and never happens again.I worked in a nursing home for a short time and saw at first hand how vulnerable and totally dependent on carers many of these people are. As some of them are bedridden and may have Alzheimer's disease, they are like babies. We all know the care babies need. Many of the elderly people in our nursing homes also need that type of care. They should not be put into situations where they can be abused as we saw on television on Monday night. I agree with many of the speakers who said that many elderly people do not need to be in nursing homes. I take this opportunity to ask the Government to give people the resources to be able to stay in their own homes. They should be given additional home-help care and the disabled person's grant, and contributions should be made to voluntary organisations to allow them stay in their homes.I compliment and commend Deputy O'Dowd for the work he has done. I also compliment RTE. It is another reflection on how we do our business here and on how the Government does its business that we need to react to programmes on television. On many occasions the "Prime Time" programme has highlighted dreadful problems in our society and we react — as we must react. However, the same issues are raised by individual Senators and Deputies in these Houses and we fail to get the responses. We raise many other issues here such as children who are in poverty and hungry without getting a response. Let us not wait for any more "Prime Time" programmes to deal with these issues. I want the issue tackled quickly to ensure our elderly people are protected.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	272	On Monday night I was in my mother's home with my brother helping her into bed as we normally do. Although she is 88 and barely healthy enough to live independently at home, thank God she is doing so. My brother and I went into the living room and watched the television until she settled down and went to sleep. I was appalled as was everybody who saw the programme. The practices we saw during the programme were disgusting, degrading and dangerous. We would all ask whether these practices are also going on in other nursing homes. While we can all say we believe the vast majority of nursing homes are excellent, we have very little proof.At a minimum we immediately need to establish an independent inspectorate to investigate all nursing homes on a regular basis. At present, reports are only given to the owners of premises after inspection. This practice must change so residents in such homes and their families also get a copy of the report. I hope we will urgently introduce legislation prior to the summer break. It does not require rocket science to amend the Health (Nursing Homes) Act to introduce the provisions required to assist our elderly population. These are the people who put so much into the country and helped create the Celtic tiger.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I welcome this discussion. This morning I acknowledged the role of the High Court judge who refused the owners of the Leas Cross nursing home an injunction and allowed the "Prime Time" programme to be broadcast. By doing so he has done a great service to the nation in highlighting the issue. I agree that many nursing homes are run very efficiently. A brother-in-law of mine contracted multiple sclerosis at a young age and subsequently died. He spent time in a private nursing home where I witnessed the care he was given in difficult times. It would be wrong to tarnish all nursing homes.However, from what I have seen in the newspapers and on the television programme, this nursing home appears to be state-of-the-art and ultra modern. It was opened by the Taoiseach in 1997 and more recently an extension was opened by Deputy Wright. While clearly it is very modern, the modern veneer on the outside belied what went on inside. The programme seemed to resonate with many people on the issue of how we care for the elderly. It is on how we care for the elderly that we can be assessed. People are living longer and the Minister of State said it is internationally recognised that only 5% of the older population will need long-term care in private nursing homes. Modern buildings are being constructed in many cases with tax incentives. I wonder whether the sense of caring and the social dimension in those private nursing homes is being acknowledged or whether the bottom line is of paramount importance.In my area in the mid-western region, few patients receive subventions from the Health Service Executive to go into private nursing homes, so most patients are private patients. However, in this case approximately 80% of the residents were public patients.I was interested in what Senator Jim Walsh said earlier about the Health Service Executive and I wonder what research the executive does before placing people in such homes. There is pressure for step-down facilities owing to the problems in hospitals who do not have places for elderly patients. However, a hospital should not resolve a problem it has without being satisfied about the step-down facilities available. This is why it is critical to have an independent inspectorate. If we go into the summer recess without doing something constructive in this area we would deserve to be castigated by the people. Traditionally when we go into summer recess the attitude of journalists is,"They're off". However, we should be ashamed of ourselves if we do not move amendments to the existing legislation, if that is what is required, and fail to put a framework in place. The Minister of State has said he is to have a meeting with the committee, which is to report in the middle of June. I have tried to be constructive in this discussion. One could be very critical of some of the things happening, having listened to Senator Minihan detail what happened in 2003. I wonder whether the then Minister of State, Deputy Callely, was listening at all at the time. This is something that has not suddenly materialised. We should have known it was imminent. If there were problems in the past, they were highlighted.We should sit up and take notice. If there is one message for the future, it is that we should not need a "Prime Time" programme to take action regarding such situations. If one is running a health service effectively, especially with the new Health Service Executive, one should take timely remedial action. We should not need that type of programme to highlight this issue. We should be thankful that it was on, but in future, we should not be reacting to "bushfires" in the Health Service Executive and trying to extinguish them.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	276	——but those speakers who came afterwards made amends. Reference was made to the Tánaiste, and some criticism was expressed about her not getting involved in it. I was given responsibility for services for older people, and I cannot see anything wrong with the Tánaiste allowing me to deal with the issue.It was brought to my attention towards the end of last week that it was intended to show this programme. I did not see it until Monday night, like everyone else, and on foot of that we decided to take action. My biggest concern, having seen it, was to ensure that the other residents should get some comfort, giving them the option of moving. That is what we decided. Earlier we had sought to take charge of the nursing home, but that was not possible until yesterday. We have put in place an agreement whereby we will run the nursing home. I have asked the HSE to give me a report on all its dealings with the home. I hope to have that within a day or two and to receive a report after a month to see how the new scheme is operating.Senator Norris always provides some food for thought in his contributions, and today was no different. He mentioned the necessity, when bringing about change, that inspectors have powers to impose sanctions. Most Members referred to that in their contributions, although perhaps not in the same way. However, I feel there is general agreement in the area. Yesterday the Taoiseach gave a commitment in the Dáil that we will be introducing an independent inspectorate. That will be put in place early in the autumn. We are reviewing the Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 and the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993. It is clear from having watched the programme last Monday that there are several gaps in the legislation and regulations must be tightened regarding training and staff requirements. We will focus on those areas to bring about the necessary changes. I do not claim we are more compassionate, understanding or more caring in Fianna Fáil than those in the Labour Party or Fine Gael. We would all have been surprised at what we saw that evening.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	278	There is a certain understanding and realisation that there is an issue regarding elder abuse, the vast majority of which, unfortunately, takes place in people's own homes. We are aware that the issue exists, but it came as a terrible surprise to people to see the type of abuse that went on in that home. We must be honest and say that, while there are gaps in the legislation, if people want to abuse old people, it is impossible for us to prevent it. If they are bad enough and want to do it, no matter what legislation is in place, they will do it. When I saw that person I wondered, if they did that to an older person in the company of a third party, what he might do when alone.It is obvious that the inspectorate we had in place was not working. We will give the new inspectorate the powers to deal with such situations. We will put that in place in the autumn. In the meantime, I will meet regularly with the HSE, and I hope it will devote more resources to that area until such time as the independent inspectorate is put in place.I thank Members once again for their contributions. In fairness to nursing homes, from our experience of visiting family and friends in them, we would have a different view and experience from what we saw on Monday night. The vast majority of nursing home staff would themselves have been disgusted that a nursing home should cast such a cloud over others throughout the country. I know it is their wish and desire that we make the necessary changes to legislation and regulations to ensure it is easier to identify which homes are providing the high standards we all require and that the older people of the country deserve.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I thank the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, for attending the House and taking this motion regarding the EU directive on the restriction of hazardous substances in electrical equipment. It has annoyed me for quite some time. It is known as the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, which is known as the WEEE directive, an unusual name, but it has serious consequences regarding the recycling of electronic waste, with particular reference to the position of electronic retail outlets and computer companies.The proposed statutory instrument, the draft waste management regulation 2005, highlights the storage of such waste and raises a worry for small retailers and computer companies regarding their role in such proposals. If, as those retailers believe, they will be expected to turn their premises into mini-civic amenities to take back fridges, washing machines, small appliances and batteries, their position would be unsustainable.Fridges are one of the largest, most unwieldy and space-filling electrical appliances. They contain a great many gases that are very dangerous to the environment. The EU code regarding fridges as hazardous waste is 16/02/11. For retailers to act as storage or transfer stations for this waste would require an EPA waste management licence and a special bonded area for the storage of hazardous waste. The cost of such insurance would cripple any small business and I have spoken to owners of businesses who are extremely concerned about this. They would also be obliged to seek planning permission for the change of use and the handling and storage of this type of waste.Under the current draft regulations, the retailers could become responsible for the movement of the waste from their shops to a civic amenity site. It is not possible for them to move the waste from their shops, which are covered under the waste collection permit regulation. It would also be necessary to seek a permit for the transportation of this to a civic amenity site. Who would be responsible for the delivery of waste to such a site? This might require public and employers' liability insurance but we all know that insurance costs a fortune. A vehicle necessary to transport the waste would require hazardous waste and chemical insurance. The cost of such insurance would be at least six times the rate of the normal insurance. The Minister is well aware of the cost of insurance for dealing with hazardous waste.Small traders are under enough financial pressure as they have had to deal with competition from the UK, while margins are being reduced and costs are increasing. I know this from talking to friends in the business. The greatest cause for concern among electrical and computer retailers is that there has been no consultation with them on who is ultimately responsible for hazardous waste. Suppliers have set up WEEE Ireland and expect retailers to carry the cost of collecting their waste. In their opinion, the responsibility lies with the producer and it is very unrealistic to leave the retailer as the donkey in the middle and expect him or her to carry the cost of tidying up the producer's mess.I ask the Minister to give an assurance that the small retailer will not be expected to carry the can, following the enactment of legislation on electronic and electrical waste. This is a simple and logical request and I hope he can provide clarification on the matter. I understand that the British Government has postponed legislation as it wishes to see which way the rest of Europe will jump on this directive.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I fully support everything Senator Bannon said. Big retail store such as Woodie's are now branching into electrical goods. I resent that because it is unfair to the small trader. If this directive is brought in as planned, it will wipe out small traders because huge multinationals will come in that have already been involved in the electrical wholesale business. It is grossly unfair as the directive would wipe out smaller businesses. I do not know why the Minister is raising his eyes to heaven. Those involved would have to bring in storage facilities, increase insurance liability and deal with other risks as well. Exceptions to the directive should be made for the smaller trader, unless Fianna Fáil is in favour of big multinational companies from abroad taking over the country.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I am grateful to Senator Bannon for raising this issue. If I rose my eyes to heaven, it is because of the amount of mythology that has been peddled in recent times by sectors of the retail trade. They are not helping their case. I wish to nail a couple of the lies that have been told, although not by the Senators.Retailers will not need a waste licence. I met with the retailers and with the producers and they know that is the case. They will not need bonded storage areas nor will they need transportation certificates. Finally, they will not need planning permission.The directive, which came into effect on 13 February 2003, is based on the well-established concept of producer responsibility whereby producers of goods and materials are required to take responsibility for the environmental impact of goods and services which they place on the market.The concept imposes responsibilities on all stakeholders in the chain. It is dependent on the shared acceptance of their various responsibilities by producers, distributors and retailers, as well as central and local government. For these reasons, I have been anxious to ensure that the detailed implementation arrangements reflect the consensus view among the various stakeholders on what will work most effectively and equitably.The draft regulations, including draft implementing regulations, which I published in April 2005, were the result of a two-year process during which the various sectoral interests worked together on the WEEE Ireland taskforce. Groups that suggest there has been no consultation are misleading the public. The consultation process, which followed the publication of the draft regulations, has crystallised some outstanding areas of disagreement between producers and retailers, especially regarding the apportionment of costs between them. There are intensive ongoing discussions between the producers and the retailers and distributors and my Department is helping to facilitate these. The outcome of this process, along with the various submissions received will all be considered before the final implementing arrangements are made.The obligations proposed to be imposed on retailers are consistent with the WEEE directive. The provisions in the regulations are a direct transposition of the directive. Retailers are responsible for allowing a one-for-one take-back of old equipment when selling new equipment. They are then entitled to deposit such waste in collection facilities free of charge, which in our case will usually be a civic amenity site. It is only at this point that the responsibility of the producers kicks in, and they must finance the collection, treatment, recovery and disposal of the WEEE from the collection facilities.There has been wild speculation about the burdens imposed on distributors and retailers. Suggestions that retailers will require waste permits or planning permission for their premises to allow involvement in WEEE schemes are not true. There will, however, be a straightforward registration system which will cost €20. A similar case pertains on the issue of retailers' responsibilities for costs. In fact, the WEEE directive is entirely silent on the costs incurred by the retailers in collecting, storing and transporting the material to the collection points. The provisions in our draft regulations are consistent with both the spirit and letter of the directive in this regard.Individual retailers, in their price negotiations with the producers who supply them, may well seek contributions towards these costs, or individual producers may well offer such contributions as sales incentives. This is part of the normal commercial negotiation process and it would be unwise for me to interfere with it.My concern is to ensure that the requirements of the directive are respected, including the availability of free take-back to the consumer and I can assure the Senators that this will be the case. We have a collective responsibility to deal with this issue. I have established a working group, consisting of representatives of the lead authority in each waste management region, to work with retailers and producers in developing pragmatic strategies for effective implementation of the directive.The draft regulations that were debated yesterday at a meeting of Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government provide for the insertion of enabling provisions into the Waste Management Act 1996 which will allow the Minister to make detailed implementing regulations for the operation of take-back arrangements applying to WEEE.People think that we can put off the day when we must face up to our responsibilities. We have environmental responsibilities and I intend meeting them. Far too often, Ireland is before the courts in Europe because we are not meeting our responsibilities. There is no reason to follow the bad example of one or two other countries that are seeking derogations. There has been a series of ongoing negotiations with retailers and producers and we have listened to their concerns. In this instance, however, one particular group is not helping its cause by making extraordinary claims which are entirely unfounded.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I understand the concerns of those in the electrical retail business. When the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 was being debated in this House, I asked a question in regard to the burning of bushes, hedge trimmings and other debris on farmland. The Minister's predecessor assured me at that time that farmers would not be affected and could continue to burn bushes and so on as long as they did not burn any tyres or plastic at the same time. However, the situation now is that nobody can burn anything. In this context, I understand the concerns of retailers about the directive on electronic waste. The Minister has mentioned a registration fee of €20. There is significant doubt in this regard and I ask the Minister to clarify the situation.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I fully accept the Senator's bona fides in this matter. It is unusual that we should have this exchange but I welcome it. The reality is that the retailers have been at the negotiating table and I have listened to their concerns. Ironically, some on the other side of this debate are arguing that I am too much in favour of the retailers. It seems I must be somewhere in the middle. There is no doubt that small retailers are worried about some of the inaccurate information they have received.This matter has been the subject of unnecessary concern. The reverse logistics system means that a fridge can be collected when a new one is delivered. The old appliance can then be deposited in the nearest civic centre or another location which provides suitable storage. Electrical retailers already store materials on their existing premises. The concerns expressed by some parties in this regard seem to be a case of crying wolf and they will do their cause no good by so doing.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I welcome the Minister to the House and assure him that I have far more modest needs than my colleagues before me. All I seek is a new science laboratory for St. Macdara's College in Templeogue in my constituency. I am sure his counterpart in the Department of Education and Science has informed the Minister that an application for an additional science laboratory has been submitted by the school in question and County Dublin VEC in 2002, 2003 and 2004. This school caters for almost 800 pupils and serves the Tallaght and Templeogue areas.The accommodation currently includes three science laboratories and the inspector for science subjects wrote to the principal recently outlining his full support for the school's request for an additional laboratory. In a letter to the Department of Education of Science, the inspector stated in regard to his report on the school's facilities: "I would be grateful if you would bring the contents of the report to the attention of the relevant staff, including any recommendations requiring development, in the context of school development planning".The Minister is aware that the Department of Education and Science takes a decision each summer in connection with the summer works scheme. The decision in respect of 2005 will be made soon and I make my pitch for the school in that context. One of the arguments the school management makes is that all first year students study science and there are severe space limitations in this regard. All the school management proposes is that an existing classroom should simply be transformed into a science laboratory.The school authorities have asked me to point out that the task force on physical sciences, which issued a report some years ago, made clear recommendations in regard to science in terms of increasing the financial envelope for science subjects. The money is clearly needed now rather than tomorrow. Clear recommendations were also made in regard to improving the standing of physics within the school system. I have been asked to put on the record of the House that the additional laboratory which is sought would go some way towards meeting all the school's needs in terms of science facilities. The inspector is on record in correspondence as seeking this requirement.I ask the Government and the Minister for Education and Science in particular to comply with this basic and straightforward request. The school has sought this facility for the last three years and it is long overdue. I expect the Minister will tell me it is in the programme for this year.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I wish I could do so. Perhaps I might have been able to oblige if the school in question had applied for consideration under this year's programme. Unfortunately, it apparently neglected to do so. However, I thank the Senator for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline details of the funding allocated to St. Macdara's College to improve its accommodation, and to outline the process under which the school can obtain further funding.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of under-investment in this area as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth. Nevertheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a sincere determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.We have progressively increased funding for the school modernisation programme in recent years to achieve our goal. An aggregate total of almost €2 billion has been allocated for this purpose since 1998, the largest investment programme in the history of the State. Since the beginning of the year the Department of Education and Science has made a number of announcements relating to the schools building and modernisation programme. This year alone, €270 million will be allocated to primary schools and a further €223 million to post-primary schools for building works. This represents an increase of 14% on the 2004 allocation.The programmes supported will include the following: 141 major building projects already on site and a further 28 due to commence in the coming weeks; 122 major school building projects countrywide which will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005; 192 primary schools which have been invited to take part in the small and rural schools initiative; up to 120 schools which have been given approval to rent temporary premises pending delivery of a permanent solution to their long-term accommodation needs; 43 schools which have been authorised to commence architectural planning of their major projects and 124 which have been approved to progress through the architectural planning process; and 590 schools which were given approval to complete essential small-scale projects, such as that to which the Senator refers, under the summer works scheme.I am pleased to inform the Senator that St. Macdara's College is included in the latter category in respect of the funding it has secured to upgrade its gas system at an estimated cost of €66,000. It was not possible, however, to provide funding for a science room in St. Macdara's College in 2004 when the school applied for it under the summer works programme because of the need to progress other higher priority projects first. As I have just outlined, with the extra funding provided for the summer works scheme in 2005, the school's application for upgrading of its gas systems was successful. Regrettably, however, the school did not apply for a science room under the 2005 summer works scheme.Should the school apply for a science room under the 2006 summer works scheme, details of which will be announced later this year, the Minister for Education and Science assures me that every consideration will be given to its application. I thank the Senator for raising this matter and I will bring his concerns to the attention of the Minister.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The school authorities have expressed some concern as to the role of County Dublin VEC in respect of the application. They were of the view that the application was supported by the VEC. I will relay this matter urgently to the school authorities.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I wish to make the case that a boys' national school in Tullow, Scoil Phádraig Naofa, should be granted disadvantaged status. When the Minister for Education and Science announced a recent allocation of resource teachers, the boys' national school received half the allocation of the neighbouring school. The Minister is aware of Tullow because he represents the adjoining constituency. This town has two national schools, for boys and girls, respectively, which are located close together and are attended by children of the same families. For some reason, the girls' national school is disadvantaged whereas the boys' school is not. This has a significant effect in that the girls' national school has an extra teacher and twice as many resource teaching hours. I am sure that further anomalies exist to lend the girls' school an advantage.I ask the Minister to take the sensible step of giving disadvantaged status to the boys' school because the students of both schools come from the same families and face similar social problems. Failing this, I ask him to take the interim measure of doubling the allocation of resource teaching hours for the boys' school. As a review on the disadvantaged status of schools is ongoing, it may be impossible at present to confer disadvantaged status.Action should be taken because the current unusual situation is to the disadvantage of the boys' school. Many education reports indicate that boys encounter more significant learning difficulties than girls. This highlights the urgent need for the boys' school to receive the resources required to raise it to the same level as the girls' school.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2005-06-01 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I acknowledge Senator Browne's concerns on this issue. Like him, I am occasionally mystified as to how the status of adjacent schools which are attended by the same families may be determined in slightly different fashions. I thank the Senator for affording me this opportunity to outline to the House the position of the Department of Education and Science concerning the allocation of disadvantaged status and, in particular, Scoil Phádraig Naofa, Tullow, County Carlow.The new action plan for educational inclusion launched by the Department earlier this week provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme which will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis starting in the next school year and will involve an additional annual investment of €40 million upon full implementation. It will also involve the provision of some 300 additional posts across the education system.A key element of this new action plan is the better identification of levels of disadvantage in our schools, which will result in improved targeting of resources at those most in need. The first stage of the identification process, which is being conducted on behalf of the Department of Education and Science by the Educational Research Centre in Drumcondra, is already under way. Questionnaires have been issued to all mainstream primary schools under this process and these were due for return at close of business yesterday. Analysis by the centre of the responses will commence presently. The identification process is being supported by an advisory group which includes representatives from the INTO and the Irish Primary Principals Network.Participation by schools in the new school support programme will be based upon the results of the identification process. The number of primary schools to be involved will be approximately 600, comprising 300 urban or town schools and 300 rural schools. In addition, supports will continue to be provided for primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.The school to which the Senator refers is included in the urban dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break programme which was introduced in 2001 and benefits from supplementary funding to provide additional educational supports for the children concerned. The school was not considered eligible for additional teaching staff based on the levels of concentration of at risk pupils within the school in the year 2000. The position on the school's participation in the new initiative will be determined following completion of the identification process which is now under way. I thank the Senator once again for raising this matter in the House, given that the school in question is almost lucky enough to fall within my constituency.

Perhaps he will share his local knowledge of the area with the Minister for Education and Science. The situation may look reasonable on paper but the reality differs.
