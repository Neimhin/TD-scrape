#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	I was in London three weeks ago with my colleagues, Deputy Donnelly and Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and we met representatives from the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and from an all-party committee in Westminster. It is fair to say that our take-away was that it is pretty shambolic over there, which is not news to us, but it is against that backdrop I wish again to ask the Minister to outline the contingencies and supports she is putting in place to safeguard Irish SMEs and in particular exporting businesses in view of a potential hard Brexit, which may eventually arise.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Extensive work has been ongoing in my Department to prepare for all Brexit eventualities. This includes both research and the development of specific supports. Officials of my Department have had discussions with senior officials from DG Competition on the potential and the real difficulties encountered by Irish businesses as a result of the UK's decision to leave the EU. In November 2017, the then Tánaiste met Commissioner Vestager and the issue of state aid was discussed. An outcome from this meeting was the establishment of a working group comprising representatives from DG Competition, the Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Enterprise Ireland and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The objective of the group is to scope and design schemes to support enterprises impacted by Brexit in line with current applicable state aid rules. Should issues arise that require an approach that does not fit within the existing state aid rules, they will be raised as part of the working group discussions. The work of the group has already commenced and it is due to have its third meeting in February 2018. In between these meetings, there has been engagement on specific issues to continue to progress matters. A rescue and restructuring, R&R, scheme was approved by the Commission in late November 2017. This scheme has been put in place as it was considered prudent to have contingency measures in place so that we can respond swiftly to changing circumstances if necessary. A Brexit loan scheme was announced in budget 2018. This will provide affordable working capital financing to eligible businesses that are either currently impacted by Brexit, or will be in the future. The recent signing of the counter guarantee means the €23 million Exchequer funding, comprising €14 million from my Department and €9 million from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, can be leveraged to provide a €300 million fund from the European Commission and the European Investment Band, EIB, Group through its InnovFin loan guarantee scheme. The scheme will be open to businesses of fewer than 500 employees, which can demonstrate that they are significantly exposed to the impact, or potential impact, of Brexit. They must be a viable business, doing business in Ireland, and they must have a business development strategy demonstrating that they plan to innovate or adapt in response to Brexit. The agencies of my Department are also fully engaged in preparing for Brexit. Enterprise Ireland's, EI, #PrepareforBrexit communications campaign, featuring the Brexit SME scorecard, was launched last March. The scorecard is an interactive online platform which can be used by all Irish companies to self-assess their exposure to Brexit. EI has introduced a Be Prepared Grant which offers up to €5,000 for exporting client companies to conduct further research and use external expertise to develop a Brexit action plan. The funding to local enterprise offices has been increased by 22% and they, with InterTrade Ireland, are offering a range of Brexit focused supports to companies, including those engaged in cross-Border trade with Northern Ireland. This work, along with market developments as a result of Brexit, and ongoing engagement with the business community, will inform further discussions with the Commission. I will be maintaining a strong focus on the SME sector and will consider the development of further initiatives to support business as required.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	We are aware of the Brexit loan scheme and the fact that there was a number of new staff hires within the agencies and that took longer than it should have taken. In addition, the generating of awareness and preparedness of the SME sector has been poor. InterTradeIreland tells us that 19 out of 20 SMEs do not have a plan to deal with Brexit. That really is a shocking statistic, in particular coming from a reputable organisation such as InterTradeIreland. I wish to focus on the state aid rules. The Minister has outlined the rescue and restructuring scheme. She said that everything she is doing is within the existing state aid rules. What I have asked previously and what I ask again now is whether the Minister cannot lobby and petition DG Competition to change the state aid rules. That was previously done following the collapse in 2008 where the ceiling of €200,000 was raised to €500,000 and that was complemented by an enterprise stabilisation fund. Has the Minister engaged in any attempt to build support for that from her ministerial colleagues across Europe and will she specifically put changing state aid rules on the agenda rather than coming up with new schemes within the existing structure? The business representative organisations such as ISME, the SFA, IBEC and people who represent producers all say they want state aid rules to change to allow for a higher ceiling.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	My Department is engaging with officials in DG Competition. They are putting the case forward and outlining the difficulties Brexit will present for businesses in this country. With regard to the lack of preparedness of businesses, the Deputy is correct. In a survey carried out last year, it was found that 16% of businesses had a plan and that the rest did not. Through Enterprise Ireland, there has been a significant public campaign advising businesses to prepare themselves for Brexit, identify the risks and mitigate against them. There is a €5,000 grant for which Enterprise Ireland clients can apply to assist in examining their risks. As public representatives, we need to encourage businesses to avail themselves of the supports that exist. I am very conscious that businesses need to be ready for Brexit.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	I do not mean to minimise the issue but it will require more than a hashtag to prepare for Brexit. Let us not boil it all down to a simple hashtag. As I asked the Minister's predecessor, can she give us a firm commitment today that she will put the changing of state aid rules and increasing the ceiling to a sum in the region of €500,000 on the agenda for the next EU Competitiveness Council meeting? Will she raise it specifically? That is a very straightforward question. On Brexit, a number of reports were commissioned by the Department and the Minister's predecessor. One was entitled Sectoral Implications Arising from Brexit: Most Exposed Sectors. The Revenue Commissioners published a report that was leaked and on which there was much public commentary. When I previously raised the issue of the first report, I was told an analysis is due to be concluded by the end of the year, that being the end of 2017. All this is against a backdrop of businesses not being properly prepared. In the interest of transparency, informing debate and allowing businesses to prepare themselves, will the Minister publish the reports? Will she give us a commitment that they will be published as soon as possible?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	A number of reports are being prepared on the impact of Brexit on businesses and the Irish economy. They will be published in the coming weeks. I have not read the full report yet but it will be published in the next week. Actually, I believe we are publishing it next week. Regarding the European Union, my officials are speaking continually to EU officials and we are certainly making the case for state aid in the form of supports for Irish businesses that are being affected by Brexit. There is a range of supports, including the Brexit SME scorecard, currently on offer to businesses. A representative of a business rang me two days ago stating it is getting worried about Brexit. I said that was fine as there are plenty of supports available that should be sought. The company did not actually know about them. We need to get the message out. As Brexit approaches, it is beginning to dawn on businesses that they really need to get involved.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	I wish to ask the Minister about the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE. As she is probably aware, many people have serious concerns about it and its workings. Pending the establishment of a new agency to replace what I believe is a non-functioning one, how will the Minister ensure that white-collar criminality is investigated and that those responsible are prosecuted until the new agency is up and running?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	On 2 November last year, the Government published a suite of measures aimed at enhancing corporate governance, increasing transparency and strengthening Ireland's response to white-collar crime. The implementation of these measures is progressing across three Departments, namely, the Departments of Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Justice and Equality and Finance. With regard to my Department, since that publication was launched work on the development of the legislative framework for the establishment of the ODCE as an agency has commenced. It is expected that the general scheme of a Bill to give effect to this decision will be published by the second quarter of 2018, with publication of the Bill by the fourth quarter of 2018. The Companies (Statutory Audits) Bill was published on 6 November 2017. The Second Stage debate on that Bill took place on 23 January 2018 and Committee Stage is scheduled for 21 February 2018. The Company Law Review Group has submitted its report on corporate governance. This is currently being examined with a view to further enhancing the corporate governance provisions of the Companies Act 2014. The public consultation to seek views from stakeholders to inform the transposition of the shareholders' rights directive commenced ahead of schedule, with responses due back by 9 February 2018. In parallel with the implementation of these measures, the ODCE has played and continues to play a vital role in undertaking its statutory functions, as set out in the Companies Act 2014. The ODCE annual report for 2016 points to a number of key successes during the year, as follows: following the examination of reports submitted to the office by liquidators of insolvent companies, 90 company directors were restricted and 11 disqualified by the High Court; in keeping with the ongoing strategic shift towards the investigation of more serious indications of wrongdoing, five investigation files were submitted to the DPP; as an alternative to formal enforcement actions, cautions were issued to a total of 61 companies; 108 directions were issued to relevant parties requiring them to comply with their statutory obligations under company law; and the securing of the rectification on a non-statutory basis, of suspected infringements of the Companies Act 2014, in regard to directors' loans in 60 cases, to an aggregate value of €17 million approximately.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 In terms of prosecutions, the Director of Corporate Enforcement is only statutorily empowered to initiate summary prosecutions, that is, prosecutions of relatively minor offences in the District Court. More serious alleged breaches of company law are prosecuted on indictment in the Circuit Court and only the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, can direct that charges be preferred on indictment. The ODCE has also been successful in recent high-profile white-collar crime prosecutions. In 2014, two individuals were convicted for the giving of unlawful financial assistance by Anglo Irish Bank for the purchase of its own shares. In 2016, an individual was convicted for fraudulent trading on foot of a plea of guilty. Also in 2016, another individual was convicted for failing to maintain a licensed bank's register of loans to directors on foot of a plea of guilty. In 2017, a person was arrested and charged with fraudulent trading based on an invoice discounting fraud and entered a plea of guilty.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	I look forward to reading the full response that will be placed on the record. I am really disappointed with the response the Minister read out because this issue is not being dealt with as urgently as necessary. The questions over the current agency are very worrying. I refer to the botched Seán FitzPatrick investigation, the total absence of prosecutions and convictions for two years, the handing back of funding and the lack of staff in the agency. Last week at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Business, Enterprise and Innovation, there was a vote against my proposal to invite the director in to answer questions. Legal worries were cited in the response to our invitation. As the record will show, clear guidelines could have been laid down to prevent any discussion of Anglo Irish Bank. Unrelated questions on why the ODCE is failing in its mandate could have been asked at a meeting of the committee. The ODCE has not been before a committee in the Oireachtas for a full eight years. The report compiled about the botched Seán FitzPatrick trial is secret. How are we supposed to find out what is going on in the ODCE? It is crazy. The tracker mortgage scandal highlights continued total disregard for corporate law. We learned from the finance committee yesterday that KBC Bank is still overcharging nearly 2,500 customers on tracker mortgages. That is no wonder because investigations into, and prosecutions of, white-collar crime in this country are a joke.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	I will try to address just some of the issues the Deputy raised. He raised quite a number of them. The funding allocation for the ODCE for 2017 was €4.895 million, with an outturn or expenditure of €3 million. The funding allocation is €5 million for 2018. Therefore, there is a considerable increase. A significant element of the ODCE's annual funding allocation includes a non-pay allocation for possible legal costs. Therefore, there is a reserve for legal costs. These costs and their timing are difficult to forecast as the office cannot be sure of the timing of the cases or their outcome in terms of costs. While it is entirely prudent that provision continue to be made to meet legal costs, there will always be uncertainty over the amount of costs and their timing. Therefore, there is potential for under-expenditure. The Deputy mentioned the case of Anglo Irish Bank. I agree it was not well handled but, having said that, the current director was not in office at the time. The ODCE has been considerably strengthened since the time in question in terms of funding, staff and the skill mix.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	The Minister mentioned funding allocations. My concern, however, is that money allocated recently has not been spent. It has been sent back to the Department. Perhaps the Minister will answer some specific questions. When does she anticipate the report on the ODCE and the botched Seán FitzPatrick investigation will be published? The Minister was not in her current role last June when the report landed in the Department. Surely it cannot take this long to write a report on that investigation.Has the Minister met the director recently to monitor what is going on and to ensure another trial does not collapse? Will she commit that the new agency that will replace the ODCE, Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, will be more accountable to the Oireachtas because, as I have outlined, the current system of accountability is not working? The last time the ODCE was before an Oireachtas committee was in January 2010, a full eight years ago. Such a level of accountability and lack of oversight is unacceptable. Has the Minister figures on how many prosecutions led to convictions in 2017, considering none was achieved in the previous two years?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	An account of the report into Judge Aylmer's ruling will be published. However, we had to go to court to get permission to do that. We are in that process.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	Is there a timeframe for this?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I do not believe it will take that long. I outlined several prosecutions and issues which the ODCE addressed in 2017. It has improved considerably since 2012 and is doing a good job. In 2017, a person was arrested and charged with fraudulent trading based on an invoice discounting fraud and entered a plea of guilty. In 2016, an individual was convicted for failing to maintain a licensed bank's register of loans to directors on foot of a plea of guilty and another individual was convicted for fraudulent trading on foot of a plea of guilty. In terms of prosecutions, the Director of Corporate Enforcement is only statutorily empowered to initiate summary prosecutions. More serious alleged breaches of company law are prosecuted on indictment in the Circuit Court and only the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, can direct that charges be preferred on indictment. The ODCE is doing good work. I want to put it into an independent agency which will mean it can go to the marketplace to attract the sets of technical skills it needs, such as forensic accountants.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	This question requests an update on the allocation of funding for the programme of research in third level institutions. Ireland's ranking in the 2017 Bloomberg innovation index fell. Any underfunding of third level research will ultimately erode our competitiveness. Will the Minister of State give me an update on this?
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	The 2018 allocation to the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, is €14.3 million. A portion of the 2018 PRTLI allocation for 2018 will be used to part-pay outstanding bills for PRTLI cycle 5 projects. There were 33 projects funded in cycle 5, with the final two completed in mid-2017. The Department is now in the final stages of addressing the remaining payments associated with cycle 5 of PRTLI. A further portion of the 2018 PRTLI allocation will be used to commence a postgraduate programme funding of both PhD and research masters, as per the action in Innovation 2020 to increase postgraduate researcher enrolments in disciplines aligned to enterprise and national needs. This new postgraduate programme will be administered by Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, and will fund postgraduate researcher enrolments in disciplines under its remit. SFI has already announced initial calls associated with this programme in 2018 and expects to issue further calls relating to awards in 2019 and beyond. The Department and its agencies are important funders of research with expenditure of approximately €426 million in 2017. This accounts for more than half of total Government investment in research and development. SFI funds a significant amount of oriented basic research that is scientifically excellent in line with the Government's 14 national research priority areas. A recent analysis of SFI's portfolio of funded projects shows that approximately 80% of its funding, €140 million per annum, is committed to oriented basic research projects with the other 20% in the more applied space. As an additional support to drive basic research in Ireland, Innovation 2020 is committed to the development of a competitive fund to support qualified researchers to undertake project-based frontier basic research. In 2017, the Irish Research Council, an agency of the Department of Education and Skills, launched the frontier research programme, Laureate, with initial funding of €2.5 million. Funding is awarded based on the excellence of the research proposals and assessed through a rigorous and international peer-review process.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	Trade unionists, employers and business representative associations state our economic recovery, prosperity and well-being will be put at risk if we do not adequately resource third level funding. Since 2016, there has been a 52% cut in research funding. We need to call the Government to account on this. A fall from €30.4 million to €14 million is a drastic cut. This is against the backdrop of a high point several years ago when almost €58 million was made available to research programmes. Can the Minister of State give more research funding to third level institutions? All third level institutions tell us we must invest more in research. If we are not at the cutting edge or forefront of research, we will lose our competitiveness.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	It would be remiss of me not to agree with the Deputy on this. I believe we should be investing more in research and development. The difficulty is we have come from a tight fiscal space and five years of recession. It is always difficult to decide on which areas to place funding to boost the economy or deliver sustainability. While the 2018 allocation of €14 million is small compared with other years, as the Deputy knows there are historical liabilities with cycle 5, which are close to being paid down in full. This comes to €10 million to the HEA, Higher Education Authority. In line with the specific action of Innovation 2020, a successor to cycle 5 is being scoped out through Science Foundation Ireland. The Government is aware of that driving innovation, research and development is of paramount importance with the advancement of technology over the next 20 years. However, in 2008 public expenditure in research funding peaked at €930 million but it was substantially cut through the years, even when Fianna Fáil was in government. While the public will want investment in housing, education, health and so forth, we must also be a driving force in innovation. It would be difficult for me not to agree with the Deputy on that.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I am sure the point is not lost on the Minister of State that there are hundreds of Irish researchers actively working overseas, particularly in the UK, who, if they were funded properly in this country, would move back. That is a huge resource we are missing here and we are at a loss because of it. Previously, research funding was allocated through a five-year model. It is now changed to a year-on-year model. I think the Minister of State will agree it is crazy that research funding will only be provided year-on-year rather than over a five-year horizon.If people are to commit to engaging in research over a significant period, it flies in the face of common sense to try to plan and run research on a 12-month basis. Could the Minister of State reverse the decision to move from the five-year model to a year-on-year system?
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	In the context of the Deputy's first question, what he says is correct regarding researchers and developers overseas. However, based on the amount of money we put into research and development in Ireland, it is fair to say that we have outstanding research centres - 17 in total. We had the ability and funding to open three research centres last year, within a very tight fiscal space, bringing the number up from 14 to 17. A number of our research centres in universities, institutes of technology, multinationals and FDI companies are regarded as some of the best in the world. On the Deputy's second question, I can inform him that the Minister and I are making a case. I have grave difficulty with funding from year to year and I would prefer set-down projects based over a period of years whereby we would know where we to invest the money and would have the money to do it across the five-year cycle. I assure the Deputy that the Minister and I are making a case within the Department.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I want to raise the very serious case of the illegal super-exploitation of workers by a contractor, Kwik Structures. The contractor is involved in student accommodation at Grangegorman, Blackpitts and Boland's Mill, where the main contractor is BAM. I understand that Kwik Structures is due to start work at the national children's hospital site shortly - again, in conjunction with BAM. Kwik Structures is paying significantly below sectoral employment order, SEO, rates, is not providing workers with payslips and has not registered its workers with the construction workers' pension scheme.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I thank the Deputy for his question. I am answering on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, who has responsibility in this area but who is away on a trade mission. My Department is unaware of any alleged dispute at the company referred to by the Deputy. Having made inquiries, it would appear that the issues in question have not been brought to the attention of the relevant industrial relations-employments rights bodies, that is, the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Labour Court. I can, therefore, only address the issues raised relating to the alleged breaches of employment law in a very general way. In terms of the rates of payment agreed by the parties to the SEO for the construction sector that was adopted in law in October 2017, these apply to every worker of the class, type or group in the economic sector to which the order applies. Equally, the terms and conditions relating to any sick pay scheme or pension scheme set out under the SEO are applicable. This applies to the employers of workers regardless of whether the employer is an agency or a construction firm by virtue of section 6 of the Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Act 2012. In the event of a dispute as to the rates that should apply and to whom, the order sets out the dispute resolution procedure that applies. Essentially, this provides that in the first instance efforts should be made at local level to reach a resolution by giving notice in writing to the employer. Failing a resolution at this point, a complaint may be made to a WRC adjudication officer. In the case of an individual dispute, the outcome of the adjudication hearing can be appealed by either party to the Labour Court. In the case of a collective dispute, if the issue remains unresolved locally, it will be referred to the conciliation service of the WRC. If the issue remains unresolved after conciliation, it will be referred to the Labour Court for investigation and recommendation. Regarding the other issue specifically referred to by the Deputy, it is the case that employees are entitled, in accordance with the Payment of Wages Act 1991, to receive payslips. In the event that an employee believes that his or her rights may have been contravened and would like to seek redress, the WRC is the appropriate body to contact as a first step. The WRC provides an information service on the obligations of employers and the employment rights of employees at its website www.workplacerelations.ie. It also operates a lo-call information line, on 1890 80 80 90, which provides information to both employers and employees. I ask the Deputy to bring this information to the attention of the employees at the company in this instance and to encourage the employees at the company to avail of the extensive services provided by the WRC.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	The workers in question are now getting organised and taking all the appropriate action. The conditions they face are horrific and similar to those relating to slavery. The conditions in question are primarily focused on migrant workers. Previously, it appears to have primarily involved Polish workers but it now relates to Romanian workers. However, Irish workers are also exploited and stand in solidarity with their workmates. The workers are not receiving SEO rates. They are receiving flat rates that are significantly lower than SEO rates. They are not receiving payslips and have not received them over an extended period. There are other layers of exploitation on top of that. For example, workers have been pressured to rent at extortionate rates from a foreman and when they leave that accommodation, they are told that there is no more work for them. The situation is horrific. Will the Minister agree to talk to her colleagues and try to get a labour inspectorate team sent in to investigate the situation?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	As I indicated earlier, I am not familiar with the details of this dispute but I encourage the employees to bring it to the attention of the WRC in the first instance. I ask them to make contact with the WRC because they have rights. This type of behaviour should not be happening and the WRC is there to deal with those kind of issues because we do not want to see any employee victimised or treated unfairly. I ask the Deputy to advise the workers to make contact with the WRC.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I think the workers will contact the WRC very shortly if they have not already done so. I draw attention to the fact that the company is due to start work on a publicly-funded project relating to the new national children's hospital. Obviously, if what I am saying is accurate, and I very much believe it is, it would be completely inappropriate for such exploitation to be happening. It is inappropriate for it to happen anywhere but particularly so with a publicly-funded project. The other issue is that there appears to be quite widespread defrauding of Revenue as a way of bulking up the net pay the workers receive. The workers are given very large travel and subsistence allowances that are not subject to tax in order to increase their net pay but in an illegal fashion that may have resulted in a loss of millions of euro to Revenue in recent years. 
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	I agree with the Deputy that the exploitation of workers is wrong and should not be happening. I can only say that there is a very strong and robust system in place through the WRC. I strongly urge the workers to make contact with the commission.

We have our own tradition with the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society and the credit union movement in particular. I recently asked a series of questions about the kind of supports we give co-operatives and whether the 31 local enterprise offices, Enterprise Ireland and other organisations could do more to promote the co-operative ideal and encourage more startups.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. The co-operative model is one of a number of legal options available to those considering establishing themselves in business. The different models have their own distinct characteristics. It is, of course, up to each individual operation to choose the model that best suits the nature of the business and the desired ethos of the entity. The Department does not promote one business model over another. My Department's role is to facilitate the development of co-operatives rather than actively encourage or promote them. My responsibility lies in the legislative provision for co-operatives in general. Any initiatives to facilitate or promote the development of co-operatives in particular sectors, for example, child care, education, housing, energy retrofitting or environmental protection, would be a matter for my colleagues in the relevant Departments. My Department supports co-operatives in the same way it supports other enterprises.My Department provides a range of grants and funding streams for ambitious start-ups, principally through the local enterprise offices, LEOs. The 31 LEOs are located throughout the country and provide a range of supports for the micro and small business sector. As the first stop shop for providing advice and guidance, financial assistance and other supports to those wishing to start or grow their own business, the LEOs provide a sign-posting service to all relevant State supports and offer direct grant aid to micro-enterprises, which have ten employees or fewer, in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sector which, over time, have the potential to develop into strong export entities. They offer soft supports in the form of training and mentoring and assist with loan applications to Microfinance Ireland. Enterprise Ireland has a number of targeted supports for start-ups, including co-operative start-ups, that have global ambition, the potential to scale and meet Enterprise Ireland's eligibility criteria. Enterprise Ireland supports enterprises in regional and rural areas to start, innovate and remain competitive in international markets now and into the future. Supports include competitive feasibility funding, mentoring grants and innovation vouchers.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 I believe that we also need to support co-operatives by having a modern legislative framework under which they can operate. In July 2014, the Friendly Societies and Industrial and Provident Societies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014 came into effect with the aim of easing the regulatory burden on co-operative societies, making it easier to start up and run a co-operative as an alternative form of enterprise organisation. It addressed particular problems that were identified in the co-operative sector. However, I recognise that there is a need for a full root and branch review of the existing legislative framework that has evolved in a piecemeal fashion over the last century. To this end, my Department held a public consultation on the proposed legislative reform between 1 November 2016 and 31 January 2017 and replies received on foot of that consultation are currently being considered. The objective of this exercise is to consolidate and modernise the existing legislation to ensure appropriate simplification and an effective legislative framework suitable for the diverse range of businesses using the co-operative model in Ireland. In addition, the Registry of Friendly Societies is currently engaged in a modernisation programme to be completed later this year, involving a complete overhaul of its IT system. Completion of the project will result in a more user-friendly experience for co-operatives and for members of the public when they interact with the registry.

Given the changes happening with international tax policy at European level and so on, is it something that the Minister should perhaps look at? I know she has had distinguished service in the sector in the past. Should we look at it to promote it actively? For example, I know when the Minister answered a question about the 31 LEOs some time ago, there was not specific information about, for example, how many co-operatives were helped over the last four or five years and particularly in 2017. Similarly, with Enterprise Ireland, in regional development and rural areas with high unemployment, how many co-operatives were assisted? If policy changed, would the Minister consider having a co-operative unit within the Department, within Enterprise Ireland or within the LEOs to promote it actively? What steps could the Government take to assist the credit union movement with developments in finance?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	I am a huge advocate for the co-operative movement, as the Deputy knows. I worked in the credit union movement, which is one of the greatest co-operative movements across the country. Responsibility for that lies with the Department of Finance. I am responsible for the legislation but we support co-operative movements as businesses through LEOs and through Enterprise Ireland. Supports do exist. I will get the Deputy the information about how many co-operatives have received help. If he wants to come to talk to us about this, I would be happy to sit down and have a conversation with him about the co-operative sector. I believe co-operatives do wonderful work in this country when supported. They take up the slack when other businesses might not want to. They provide a good service. There is a voluntary board and while people working in it get their wages, it is not for profit. I think it is a great principle but my role as Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation relates to legislation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	Does the Minister think there should be other changes to facilitate the development of co-operatives? For example, I think the minimum number of members required is seven. Could that be reduced? Could there be a lower number for a group of people who want to start in a co-operative way? Are there changes we could make, while I know this goes into other territory relating to the Finance Act, to the Companies Acts, for example, to facilitate the development of co-operatives? I think many people were shocked at a report published in The Irish Independent recently about the credit union movement and warnings about what could happen to it. As the Minister knows better than anyone, the credit union movement has consolidated immensely over recent years. Many unions have joined together and so on. There seems to be a necessity for the Government to give the credit union movement additional powers, particularly relating to housing finance, to become a key actor in the housing area. It could also give additional powers to support small and medium enterprises, given that there are 12,000 to 15,000 volunteers and workers in the credit union movement, the members of which have immense assets of between €12 billion and €14 billion which could be used in the housing industry, for example.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	The credit unions, which I am very familiar with, are regulated by the Central Bank. That proposal can go to the Minister for Finance. There is a need for a full root and branch review of the existing legislative framework that has evolved in a piecemeal fashion over the last century. That is the Friendly Societies and Industrial and Provident Societies (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2014, which came into effect. The legislation needs to be tidied up since there are many different Acts. My Department held a public consultation on the proposed legislative reform between 1 November 2016 and 31 January 2017. Replies received on foot of that consultation are currently being considered. It is anticipated that the legislative review will result in the modernisation of areas including corporate governance, shares, membership and other regulatory matters. That is currently being examined and we will hopefully bring legislation forward at some stage in the future. I am happy to engage with the Deputy on that.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I remind Deputies before we move on to Other Questions that the time slots are 30 seconds to introduce, two minutes for the Minister to reply, one minute for a supplementary from the Deputy, a reply from the Minister, and a final chance for a supplementary. I will be very strict on those times because I have allowed them to go way over the time for Other Questions. To accommodate as many Deputies as possible, I will stick strictly to times, so when the Minister comes to the end of her time, I will say that the rest of the reply is in the Official Report, and I will ask Deputies to give way when their one minute is up.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	I have submitted this question to seek more information about the operation of the regional enterprise development fund, principally to establish how it is operating and, in particular, what types of projects are eligible under the fund.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Enterprise Ireland regional enterprise development fund, REDF, launched in May 2017, is a €60 million competitive fund aimed at supporting significant regional initiatives that will build on sectoral strengths and improve enterprise capability across the regions. The REDF is intended to support the ambition, goals and implementation of the regional action plans for jobs. REDF funding is being made available over the period 2017 to 2020 under two competitive calls. The first call under the REDF concluded in August last year and in December I announced an allocation of €30.5 million in funding across 21 successful projects from all over the country. Four are in the northern and western region, 11 are in the southern region and six are in the eastern and midlands region. I intend to launch a second competitive call under the fund in March of this year for the remainder of the €60 million. With regard to the type of projects that may be eligible for support, there are four streams under the fund reflecting variations in scale and focus for project applications, as follows. Stream one is to support major regional, multi-regional or national sectoral initiatives with grants of €2 million up to €5 million per project in funding towards capital and current costs. Stream two is to support significant county, regional or multi-regional sectoral and-or enterprise initiatives with grants of €250,000 up to €2 million per project in funding towards capital and current costs. Stream three is for local and community enterprise projects, with grants of €50,000 up to €250,000 per project in funding towards capital and current costs. Stream four is to support significant industry clustering initiatives with grants of €50,000 up to €250,000 per project in funding towards current costs.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
All projects will have to demonstrate and will be evaluated against the following criteria: impacts and value for money, collaboration and participation, viability and sustainability, building regional strengths and significance for innovation and capability building. In order to ensure a balanced regional spread, Enterprise Ireland has targeted €2 million to be allocated for the best ranked projects across the eight nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, NUTS III, regions which have attained a minimum score of 60% or higher in the evaluation process, over the two calls. Full details are currently available in the Scheme Document on the Enterprise Ireland website at www.enterprise-ireland.com.

It is interesting that there were 11 successful applicants in the southern region. There were four in the north west and six in the eastern region.Has the Minister thought about bringing in changes to make the scheme more accessible to applicants? The aviation and aerospace industry is of huge importance to the mid-west region, including where I come from in County Clare, Shannon, Limerick and north Tipperary. In Shannon alone, there are 40 different companies engaged in many different areas of aviation, including leasing, maintenance and aircraft recycling, etc. They employ 1,600 people. Have companies in the Shannon area drawn down this fund?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	There were two successful applications in the mid-west region. Emerald Aero Cluster Group was the successful applicant under call one of stream four. Stream four is to support significant industry clustering initiatives with grants of €50,000 to €250,000 per project. Emerald Aero Cluster Group is a cluster of 14 indigenous manufacturing companies brought together with the specific purpose of increasing aerospace manufacturing export revenues for members and aerospace business for the Republic of Ireland. That is hugely important for that industry. The Irish Bioeconomy Foundation was approved for funding under the REDF within stream one. Stream one is to support major regional, multi-regional or national sectoral initiatives and grants of €2 million to €5 million per project in funding towards capital and current costs. The project is located on the former Lisheen mine site which went into a planned close phase in late-2015 with the loss of 200 jobs. They are two very worthwhile projects that have been supported in the area.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	No.

It is a competitive process but there are some who did not receive funding. There are other initiatives and ideas that have yet to come forward for the second tranche of the funding. I encourage applicants to consider coming forward under the second call which I will launch in the springtime. All successful applicants under the first call can receive specific feedback on their submissions from Enterprise Ireland and can identify with Enterprise Ireland where they could alter or improve in order to resubmit for the next call as appropriate. Unsuccessful projects that alter and improve their applications following consultation with Enterprise Ireland's regional team and others may submit a new application. The second call will fund projects from the remaining balance of the €60 million of the budget that is available. Call two is a competitive process and not all applications can be successful. They need to engage with Enterprise Ireland because this is a really good fund that helps bring companies, local authorities and State agencies together. If they work in a collaborative way, it certainly improves their chances of getting funding.

It is wonderful to see her, as a Border Minister, in the position. Will the Minister make a statement on the number of new jobs that have been created by IDA Ireland over the past 12 months, the measures being taken to attract companies to each of the counties, Cavan and Monaghan, and the success it has had within the strategy for each county?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	I thank the Deputy for her question and for her good wishes. As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and as a Deputy from Cavan-Monaghan, this topic is very close to my heart. Regional development is a key priority of mine and I am focused on increasing investment in every county in Ireland. IDA Ireland shares this objective and I am pleased that its results for 2017 show that half of all jobs created last year were for locations outside Dublin. Every region in Ireland, including the Border region, posted net gains in jobs last year and there are now over 122,000 people employed across 649 firms in IDA Ireland client companies outside of Dublin. I look forward to working closely with the agency and across Government to grow those numbers further in 2018. More generally, the north-east-north-west regional action plan for jobs is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region, including in Cavan and Monaghan. Sectors targeted as part of the plan include the region’s traditional strengths such as agrifood, manufacturing and engineering, and tourism, including active promotion of the Lakelands region. The core objective of the plan is to see a further 28,000 people at work in the region by 2020 and to reduce the unemployment rate to within one percentage point of the State average. The efforts by the stakeholders involved in the plan are paying off with 12,000 additional jobs in the Border region since the regional initiative was launched in November 2015. This represents good progress towards the target of 28,000 jobs for the region by 2020. I am also pleased that live register numbers for Counties Cavan and Monaghan have fallen by over 15% in the past 12 months. However, despite this progress, there are some regions that lag behind, particularly in terms of attracting foreign direct investment, FDI, and there is obviously more work to be done in the Border area. In 2017, there were 12 IDA Ireland client companies employing a total of 1,305 people in Cavan and Monaghan. It is a priority for me as Minister and IDA Ireland to grow these numbers in the coming years and the agency has committed to increasing investment in each region in Ireland, including in the Border region, by 30% to 40% by 2019.
#NiamhSmyth	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-party	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-dob	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	Of the 507 visits nationwide in 2017, Cavan and Monaghan had four visits. In 2018, there will be three IDA Ireland visits to the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. Dublin had 247 visits. The Minister referred to regional balance and I hope she will aim to correct the current imbalance. There seems to be a disproportionate concentration in non-rural areas and the more urban areas, which confirms a skewed Government policy. With the national planning framework coming down the tracks and Brexit looming, counties like Cavan and Monaghan need to see the disproportionate focus on urban areas refocused on more regional areas and concentrated on areas like Cavan and Monaghan.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	IDA Ireland has a dedicated regional manager for the north-east-north-west region and has an office in the Cavan Innovation and Technology Centre. As part of its strategy to encourage investment to the area, the agency is focusing on sectors including agrifood, manufacturing, tourism, internationally traded services and clean tech. IDA Ireland also regularly engages with key stakeholders on the ground in Cavan and Monaghan, including with local authorities, public bodies, the education sector and companies from both its own client base and the indigenous sector. IDA Ireland owns lands in both Cavan and Monaghan that are currently available for investment. I am pleased in this regard that IDA Ireland is finalising a concept master plan for the IDA Ireland business park in Monaghan and is also progressing with a proposed joint initiative with Monaghan County Council regarding possible planning permission for technology units on the park to assist with marketing the location. It is important to emphasise that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. 
#NiamhSmyth	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-party	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-dob	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	The figures are crucial to all of this. I accept it is before the Minister's time, but hopefully with the Minister in the position now, as a Border Minister, she will be able to deliver. The facts are that in 2012 Dublin had a huge number of visits and we had three; in 2013, we had two; in 2014, we had one; in 2015, we had none; and in 2016, we had two. In 2012, Monaghan had no visits; in 2013, it had one; in 2014, it had none; in 2015, it had two; and in 2016, it had two. I ask the Minister to ensure that in 2018 and 2019, the national planning framework increases those numbers. We have two vacant sites. There is one in Cavan and I appreciate the Minister has appointed somebody with responsibility for the region. There is also a vacant site in Monaghan. Since the beginning of my time on Cavan County Council in 2009, there was a constant battle with IDA Ireland to make Cavan and Monaghan places that are exemplary in attracting new businesses.I ask that the site visits for 2018 and thereafter increase from the abysmal figures I have just mentioned.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	I agree with the Deputy about the number of visits to Cavan and Monaghan. I want to support Cavan and Monaghan, but I also want to support the Border region in every way I can. There will certainly be a strong focus on job creation in the region. Last week, I met the CEs of Monaghan, Cavan, Louth and Meath county councils along with senior officials from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and my Department to establish ways in which we can work collaboratively to attract FDI because we have a lot to offer. I also want to support indigenous industry and look at how the four counties can work together to attract funding through the regional development fund. I have had that meeting and I intend to meet the CEs in the north-west region to see how we can shine a light on the Border region which, I accept, is lagging behind. The Deputy can rest assured that I have been doing everything I can to increase job creation in the area.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	My question is on the same theme as Deputy Smyth's. I ask the Minister to address the glaring anomaly over which IDA Ireland and by extension the Minister are presiding, with the imbalance in IDA Ireland's site visits to Dublin compared with those outside Dublin. It is simply not acceptable and feeds into the two-tier recovery the country is experiencing.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. IDA Ireland is leading our efforts to attract even more foreign direct investment to regional areas. The agency continues to work towards key development targets set out in its 2015-19 strategy, including increasing investment by 30% to 40% in every region. Since the launch of that strategy, half of all jobs created by its client companies have been based outside Dublin. To quantify the extent of this impressive result, it means that just under 30,000 jobs have been created in the regions in three years. Moreover, the agency's 2017 results showed that every region posted net gains in jobs last year. This shows that real progress is being made towards increasing the regional spread of FDI throughout the country. Site visits represent an important tool through which investors can be encouraged to invest in regional areas and IDA Ireland always does its utmost to ensure that investors consider all potential locations when visiting Ireland. Ensuring that there are properties available for potential multinational investors is a key component of that approach. If there were no available properties in the regions, IDA Ireland-owned or otherwise, it would significantly diminish the agency’s capacity to attract and win new investments there. Overseas firms need to know that there are suitable sites and facilities in an area before they make a decision to invest.  I stress that the portfolio of properties held by IDA Ireland depends on the level of demand from investor companies and that the agency also helps to provide property solutions for Enterprise Ireland clients whenever possible. The objective is always to ensure that companies - small or large, indigenous or multinational - are connected with the right property in the right location so that the business concerned can thrive and jobs can be created.  In that context, we should not lose sight of the fact that FDI only forms one part of investment in regional locations. Indigenous enterprise also helps to drive employment growth across Ireland. All Departments and the State’s enterprise agencies work together constantly to help foster and support Irish companies wherever they can.  IDA Ireland has a property portfolio so that it can readily help potential job-creators find a suitable place in which to do business. The availability of these properties is key to our ongoing efforts to attract more firms to this country. The underlying objective though is always to match companies with these sites and properties so jobs and economic opportunities can be created.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	As the Minister knows, last night we debated a motion on broadband. The shambles of the broadband roll-out is impacting on balanced regional development and the location of business. It is feeding into a wider concern about the unravelling of services in rural areas. IDA Ireland is also complicit with those in government in this agenda which is seen as an attack on rural Ireland. In 2017, there were 682 site visits, 47% of which were in Dublin. Almost 80% of all site visits were to Dublin, Galway, Limerick or Cork. At the other end of the scale is the Minister's constituency, as outlined by Deputy Smyth, where there was one visit in Monaghan and two in Cavan. Donegal had two; Laois had four; Leitrim had five; Longford had seven; Mayo had seven; Monaghan had one; Roscommon had three; Wexford had three; Wicklow had two; and Cavan had two. I am becoming worn out from raising the issue. We are banging our heads against the wall here.

It competes in a very competitive global market. To get some of those companies to come to Ireland is quite an achievement. IDA Ireland is focused on the regions and is doing its utmost to increase regional investment. The goal is to increase investment in every region by 2019 by 30% to 40%. For example, Northern Trust was expanding its operations in Limerick last year, creating 500 new jobs. Many new investments are from existing IDA Ireland clients. It is not all about site visits. It is about supporting existing clients to increase employment. That is the case as it stands. It is doing everything. I am from a rural area and will focus on the regions.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	IDA Ireland is offering the excuse that it cannot go into the boardrooms of potential investors in this country and direct them to come to a specific location. It picks up the representatives of the company when they come to Ireland and brings them to their stated preferred location. IDA Ireland needs to do better. While it can bring them to their preferred stated location, it should offer them alternative site visits in the counties I have named which are receiving very few site visits. It is not rocket science. At this stage we are all worn out from the excuse that IDA Ireland cannot direct where companies locate in Ireland. It must do better and the Minister should instruct it to do better.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	Most of the companies seeking to locate in this country carry out their own assessments first. That is why sometimes people may be talking down regions, which is not a good idea because that negativity can influence companies' decisions. IDA Ireland is committed to the regions. It has informed me that it is doing everything it can to increase investment across the regions. The Deputy can rest assured that I will ensure the regions receive the attention and particularly those which have lagged behind. The Border region is one that has lagged behind as have parts of the midlands. The south east and the south west have done particularly well, which is partly down to the collaborative way the people in those areas have presented the benefits of doing business. There are also many clusters there. Where there is business, it brings business. We need to work more collaboratively in the areas that have not got investment. I will certainly be focusing on them.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	Do the WRC inspectors have the training they need to carry out inspections on fishing vessels? I ask the Minister to make a statement on the matter.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 39 together. I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which I am addressing on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Breen, who is out of the country. Lead policy responsibility for the fishing sector rests with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. While the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, are under the remit of my Department, they are independent in the conduct of their statutory functions. The WRC's responsibilities relate to the enforcement of the Employment Permits Acts and employment rights legislation generally, including minimum wage legislation. By the end of 2017, 95% of the target fleet had been inspected. The HSA is the enforcement agency under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and conducts inspections under health and safety regulations at all places of work, including fishing vessels while docked in harbour. It does not carry out inspections of fishing vessels at sea even when operating in Irish territorial waters. The Marine Survey Office, under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, has lead responsibility for fishing vessel safety, security and living and working conditions for the crew on board seagoing vessels. It is responsible for enforcing legislation in this context for seafarers and fishing vessel crew. Regarding the recent unfortunate accident involving a non-EEA national on a fishing vessel, it is my understanding that the HSA is conducting an investigation into the circumstances in line with its remit under workplace health and safety legislation. On the separate issue raised by the Deputy of adequate training for WRC inspectors to carry out inspections on fishing vessels, nine inspectors as well as a regional manager of the WRC completed comprehensive training in this regard. It was delivered by Bord Iascaigh Mhara on safety at sea and sea survival techniques, including firefighting and first aid. This training was a prerequisite for the deployment of WRC inspectors to onboard inspections and operations at ports and landing places because the WRC, like the HSA, does not undertake inspections at sea.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	If the Minister will excuse a poor pun, there seems to be something a little bit fishy here. Nine WRC inspectors have received training, but the following are facts. One organiser with the International Transport Workers Federation, ITF, which is a trade union-based organisation that has one organiser, has detected 202 contraventions in the wake of the scandal unearthed by The Guardian about the treatment of non-EU migrant fishers, yet nine WRC inspectors have only issued 112 contravention notices between them. That is only slightly more than half. These figures do not add up. Something is wrong, and the Minister might be able to locate for me in her reply what the problem might be.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	Of the fleet, 95% - 165 vessels - has been inspected. This entailed 239 inspections. There are 181 whitefish vessels of over 15 m in length, but only 174 of these are operational. On this basis, 95% of the target fleet had been inspected by the end of 2017. The objective of WRC inspections is to determine compliance with a range of employment rights, entitlements and obligations, including those relating to minimum wage rates, the payment of wages, employment records and terms of employment, as well as to work with employers in order to address compliance issues, including the payment of unpaid wages arising from contraventions. The enforcement of hours of work and rest requirements in the fishing industry is undertaken by authorised officers of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. WRC inspectors enforce the Employment Permits Acts and, in the fishing industry, the atypical working permission scheme, which regulates and controls the employment of non-EEA nationals within the State.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	The Minister made my argument for me. I do not know whether she is aware that the majority of the 95% of inspections-----
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	-----were carried out - if I could have a bit of quiet on my left - on foot of abuses reported by the ITF, as opposed to WRC inspectors. Unlike in other jurisdictions, however, union people have been frozen out of the follow-up process. The record of the WRC inspectorate in bringing successful prosecutions has been poor. There has only been one successful prosecution in an industry where, as the world and its wife know, abuses are rife. The €6,300 in unpaid wages that has been recouped for workers cheated out of their pay is a tiny fraction of the reality. In July, the WRC told the Oireachtas joint committee that it was reducing the numbers devoted to the fishing industry. Has that happened? Given the scale of the instances mentioned, does the Minister see the case for a dedicated and trained inspectorate, not just for fishing, but for all maritime cases that arise?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	To reiterate, 95% of the fleet has been inspected and good work has been done. The WRC acts independently of my office. There are processes for employees to report situations to the WRC, which will be followed up on and checked.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	Coming from a Border county, the Minister knows the potential difficulty that Brexit poses for employment and the economy in Border counties if it does not work out well. That is even more so the case in County Donegal, which is probably the most exposed region of Europe to Brexit and therefore needs every prioritisation from the Government in order to address that situation.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	We might get through two further questions if we stick within the time limits.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	I thank Deputy McConalogue for raising this issue. He is right, in that I am conscious of the challenges that Brexit will present in the Border region. I appreciate the importance of ensuring that Irish businesses, including those located in Donegal, are best able to withstand the pressures that Brexit may exert. That is why additional financial resources have been secured to support the strategic response to Brexit by our enterprise agencies, including IDA Ireland. Brexit, or more particularly the response to the challenges that it presents, is a key factor in shaping IDA Ireland's strategy and operations. This includes the agency's approach to regional development, finance, planning, marketing and promotional activities. The IDA has established a specific Brexit committee to oversee its response to the opportunities and challenges arising from the UK's exit from the EU. The agency also has a clear Brexit plan, including one-to-one investor engagements and public relations and media campaigns. I am conscious of the particular trade implications that Brexit may have for Border counties such as Donegal, where 12 IDA client companies employing 3,389 people are based. I am pleased that the level of employment by multinationals in the county has increased by 52% since 2012. Enterprise Ireland has also grown its jobs numbers in the county, with 3,552 people now employed in client companies of Enterprise Ireland in Donegal, up from 3,420 last year. Enterprise Ireland and the IDA maintain constant engagement with their clients in Donegal to encourage them to grow jobs and investments there even further. The local enterprise offices and InterTradeIreland are also working hard to mitigate against the impacts of Brexit. More broadly, the north east-north west Action Plan for Jobs is the key policy response for supporting employment growth in the Border region, including Donegal.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 I am pleased that good progress is being made under the plan, with 12,000 more people in work in the region since its launch in early 2015. Key to supporting the regional action plans is Enterprise Ireland's €60 million regional enterprise development fund, which provides financial support for regional projects. Last December, I announced the results of the first call under this fund, with 21 projects across all regions receiving a total of €30.5 million. The second call will be announced in March. Three projects in the Border region secured funding under the first call, including a digital innovation hub in Donegal. The implications of the Brexit vote and the challenges and opportunities that the decision poses for all Irish regions, including the Border, continue to be considered by all regional Action Plan for Jobs implementation committees and are a focus of all the enterprise agencies under my Department's remit.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	I thank the Minister for her response. That there are more than 3,000 IDA client company jobs in Letterkenny shows what a good place Donegal can be in which to do business.It is a phenomenal number of jobs in IDA-supported companies, and those companies have been growing in recent years. They include SITA, Pramerica, Optum and Kirchoff, to name a small number of those which are continuing to employ many people. In many cases they are increasing employment numbers. The problem has been with new client companies coming to the area. Those that come can prosper but the Minister must ensure that through work with IDA Ireland and agencies, we can see new client companies come in that can build and grow into the future. Until the end of last year, there were only two new client visits to the county from a total of over 600 nationally. That is simply not good enough and the Minister must address it. Will the Minister take action to engage with IDA Ireland to try to ensure this can be improved drastically?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	It is important to remember that site visit activity does not necessarily reflect investment potential. At least 70% of all new foreign direct investment comes from existing IDA Ireland client companies. Donegal is now home to 12 IDA Ireland companies, employing 3,389 people. If one comes from Cavan and Monaghan, like Deputy Brendan Smith and me, one would be very envious. The figure for employment is a 52% increase since 2012. Recent investments announced from IDA Ireland companies based in Donegal included the opening of a new SITA premises in Letterkenny; Optibelt Urethane Belting Limited moving to a new premises in Letterkenny, with associated capital investment of €7.7 million over five years; and the expansion of Pramerica, with the creation of 330 new jobs. As the Deputy states, two site visits took place in Donegal. IDA Ireland continues to do its utmost to encourage clients to locate in areas most in need of investment. I am very conscious that the Border region is lagging behind other regions. I will certainly work closely with IDA Ireland to ensure a focus on the Border region, which will see the most impact from Brexit. I am very conscious of that.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	The Minister is correct as SITA, Optibelt and Pramerica all have fine new premises. They are growing the work force and have tremendous workers and executives, driving those companies forward with the assistance of IDA Ireland. The Minister correctly points out that 70% of additional workers and employment comes from existing companies. Those companies would not be in Donegal if they had not come a number of years ago. They are doing very well and it shows they can thrive. Letterkenny is a great town and Donegal is a great place to work. We also need to see throughput and a new pipeline of companies but that is simply not happening. It is where the Government is falling down. If we want to see new companies growing into the future, they must come in the first place and there must be site visits. That is not happening and as I said two from 682 site visits last year went to Donegal. Of the total, 80% of visits went to Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway. We need to see this addressed and I ask the Minister to ensure there is prioritisation, particularly in light of Brexit, in attracting new companies as well as supporting those who are there already.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I said earlier that many companies looking at Ireland for potential investment do much of the research themselves. They have looked at the different areas and they want to see what suits them best. I assure the Deputy that IDA Ireland is doing everything it can to get investors into the regions. It has a target of between 30% and 40% of all investment being in the regions. I am very conscious of the Border region, as I mentioned. I recently met with personnel dealing with Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath, in the north-east region of our regional action plan. I intend to meet personnel from Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim in the coming weeks to see how we can work together. Officials from my Department, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland attended the meeting and I intend to do the same with the upcoming meeting very shortly.

Effectively, it was to phase out flat-rate charges and encourage greater recycling. I understand that the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission has since conducted a study on the waste collection market. Will the Minister give an overview of the study and assure the House that there is effective competition in that market?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. Policy responsibility for the waste sector lies with the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. On 4 July 2017, a motion was passed by Dáil Éireann that called on the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to ask the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, to report on the operation of the household waste collection market. Following a formal request on 25 September from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the then Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, in accordance with section 10(4) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014, requested the CCPC to carry out a study on the operation of the household waste collection market. The study will assess the household waste collection market and make recommendations, as appropriate. It will assess the nature and scale of consumer and operator issues in the household waste collection market and consider if the introduction of an enhanced regulatory regime could efficiently address these issues in the short and long term. It will include the following elements: research on current issues in the waste sector, an economic assessment of the household waste collection market and an overview of waste collection in other countries. I understand this exercise is still under way and it is anticipated that the report will be finalised over the coming months. The issue of publication will be considered at that stage.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	I do not mean to be disrespectful to the Minister by saying she did not tell me anything I really did not know. It is like a history lesson. I am well aware that the request came in September. In a previous reply from the Minister, Deputy Naughten, he indicated that the report from the commission would be available in early 2018. This does very little to alleviate concerns that people have about proper competition in the market. With the change in the pricing regime, there is no easy clarity for consumers as different companies charge different rates. It might be so much per kilo, a flat rate and so much per kilo or a flat rate with top-ups and so forth. There is no transparent pricing regime operated by all companies. It is the reason we are asking for this to be done in a timely fashion. This debate started before the summer of last year. The request to the commission to conduct the study only came about in September but it should be fast-tracked and made available as quickly as possible.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is the statutory independent body responsible for the enforcement of domestic and European Union competition law in the State. Section 9(5) of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act provides that the CCPC is independent in the performance of its functions. As Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, I have no direct function in such matters. It is doing its work. It carried out a number of public consultations and it has conducted desk-based research. It has requested information from domestic operators, commissioned consumer research and engaged with other national competition agencies on how waste markets operate in those jurisdictions. I understand the CCPC will issue a public consultation shortly to collect information on the household waste collection market and gather the views of stakeholders. It is working very hard on the matter. I will raise the Deputy's concerns with the commission.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	I would appreciate it if the Minister could relay to the commission our concerns that this should be done in a timely manner. There is no obvious competition in the market and prices are not transparent. I live in a Dublin suburb and I can see competition in providing broadband, estate agent services and energy suppliers. Nobody is knocking on my door asking me if I want to change my waste collection company. It is simply not happening. The anecdotal evidence is in abundance that there is not significant competition in this market.Before the commission can finish its full report, I believe an interim report, particularly on the Dublin market, would be very useful at this stage.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	I agree with the Deputy that competition is good for business and the consumer. The authority is an independent body under my remit, and I will certainly raise his concerns with it.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	We have time to take one more question if the Deputy forgoes his right to introduce it and I will allow him one supplementary question.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	My Department has had extensive engagement with businesses to understand what they need to help them adapt to the challenges posed by Brexit, and to provide support for diversification, development and innovation. My Department is putting in place a package of measures that will allow us to respond to the needs of businesses including a Brexit loan scheme to provide affordable financing to Irish firms impacted by Brexit - the scheme aims to make up to €300 million available to businesses with less than 500 employees at a proposed interest rate of approximately 4%; and developing proposals for a longer-term loan scheme together with a new business advisory hub service which would focus on business development to allow enterprises to position themselves for a post-Brexit environment. In addition, the EU Commission has approved a rescue and restructuring scheme and the scheme can be drawn on in exceptional circumstances for a company severely affected by Brexit. The Action Plan for Jobs will continue to act as an effective lever for driving reforms that enhance the competitiveness of Irish firms, increase jobs and grow the resilience of our economy in the context of Brexit.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	I accept that there are time constraints but perhaps the Minister will come back to me with a fuller response. The question is about our preparedness for Brexit. The Minister can revert to me on the number of be prepared grants and Brexit readiness vouchers that have been given. How many Brexit scorecards have been filled out to date by companies and is the Minister satisfied that the uptake is sufficient? Does the Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland, ITI, have sufficient staff and is funding now in place for each of those bodies?
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	87	Additional resources have been provided to Enterprise Ireland and ITI to deal with Brexit. There are many supports available, especially through Enterprise Ireland. I encourage companies to engage with Enterprise Ireland and their local enterprise offices. Workshops are taking place across the country and there is a huge awareness campaign on the challenges facing companies due to Brexit. I ask companies to identify the risks that Brexit will present for them and to mitigate those risks.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	Séamus Pattison was a champion of working people and an outstanding parliamentarian. Following in the footsteps of his distinguished father James, or Jimmy, Pattison, he distinguished himself as a trade unionist, local representative and on the national and international stage. Séamus won his first general election in 1961. His opponents said at the time that it was an accident. Séamus appeared to have a great number of accidents, winning 12 general elections in succession. He was an unequalled constituency worker, working from his base at 6 Upper New Street in Kilkenny. No hour was too late and no day was off limits for his constituents and their issues. In the days before constituency secretaries, his beloved mother worked full time, taking the queries and answering the telephone. I said yesterday that Séamus was one of a select band of parliamentarians. He knew every Deputy, as he had encountered all of them, from the first to the 30th Dáil. At local level, Séamus had a significant public role. He was a proud member of Kilkenny Corporation and Kilkenny County Council for a remarkable 33 years. He was mayor of his native city on three occasions and twice served as chairman of Kilkenny County Council. It is fitting and appropriate, therefore, that Séamus was made a freeman of the borough city of Kilkenny in 2008. It was my great joy to attend that momentous occasion. His career was remarkable. He was a Member of the European Parliament, a member of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, a member of the former British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, Minister of State at the then Department of Social Welfare and a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, but his greatest honour took place in 1997 when he was unanimously elected to the high office of Ceann Comhairle. My personal memories of Séamus are many and varied, but all pleasant and good. I remember his wise counsel and calm reason. He was always loyal to the cause of labour and always intelligent, insightful and clear of thought. I acknowledge the presence of his brother and sister-in-law in the Distinguished Visitors Gallery today. In recent times Séamus's illness took its toll, but it did not take his dignity, charm or mischievousness. At his funeral yesterday I recounted my last meeting with Séamus when, from his wheelchair, he beckoned me closer. His whispered into my ear: "If you need me to stand, I'll win again." I have no doubt that he would. Ní bheidh a leithéid ann arís.

I also extend my condolences to Deputy Howlin, his colleagues in the Labour Party and all his friends. Séamus Pattison epitomised the spirit of public service that has been the hallmark of our democracy since Independence. He served for an extraordinary 46 years in this House, winning 12 elections in a row. He served as a Minister of State in the early 1980s and also as a Member of the European Parliament for Leinster. However, he said his proudest moment in his political career was the day he was elected Ceann Comhairle in 1997. I am told he was more than a match for the Deputies and only ever made one mistake when he was in the Chair, when he once called on the former Deputy Mae Sexton to speak and accidentally referred to her as Mae West. As a former Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, I am very aware of the formidable work he did as Minister of State in the then Department of Social Welfare in the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government led by Garret FitzGerald in the 1980s. He believed that we were compassionate but complacent when it came to the issue of eliminating poverty. He was determined to identify the root causes and to try to eliminate them. We continue that work today. One of the reasons Séamus Pattison was so respected by the people of Carlow and Kilkenny was that he was always accessible as a public representative. He liked to tell stories about how constituents would sometimes call around to him on Christmas Day. As a Deputy, a Minister, Ceann Comhairle and father of the House, he served this country with distinction.We thank him and his family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	Ar mo shon féin agus ar son Pháirtí Fhianna Fáil, déanaim comhbhrón le muintir Séamus Pattison faoina bhás. Polaiteoir den scoth ab ea é. D'oibrigh sé go dian dícheallach le fada an lá. Fear macánta, cneasta ab ea é chomh maith. I extend genuine sympathies on my behalf and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party to the family of Séamus Pattison, including his brothers Joseph, Michael and Monsignor Francis Pattison, and his other relatives, on the loss of such an esteemed family member and colleague. As eloquently articulated by the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Howlin, Séamus Pattison was, without question, an exceptional politician with an extensive career in local government and national and European politics. In many respects, he was regarded as a father of the Dáil for many years, mentoring many younger Deputies who were on the way up. Perhaps he could have mentored a few more from time to time. My fellow party leaders will understand what I mean by that. He was a man who understood public service and was generous in offering advice and support. On his passing, we should perhaps reflect on his time in the House. When blood pressures rose in the Dáil and people became angry or there were the usual outbursts, he was unflappable, in particular during his time as Ceann Comhairle. He had an innate understanding that that is what people do in the House from time to time and he would chair proceedings with his normal, calm demeanour and wider sense of perspective, understanding the big picture. Séamus Pattison served the people of Carlow-Kilkenny for over 46 years in different capacities, which is an extraordinary length of service. He espoused the values of the Labour Party in a very distinguished way and, in particular, as Minister of State for Social Protection from 1983 to 1987. I remember how pleased he was when he introduced the former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to the Oireachtas in November 1998 after the Good Friday Agreement was signed. Those were heady days when there was a real sense of achievement and breakthrough. His sense of social duty and his commitment to people on the ground never left him and he made an indelible imprint on Irish politics. This is the second occasion on which I have heard the anecdote regarding his willingness to run again for the Labour Party. That summed up one of his enduring characteristics: a great and consistent sense of humour. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

Chuir mise aithne air sa Dáil thar na blianta. Duine lách, macánta agus béasach ab ea é agus duine a bhí sásta, agus é sa Chathaoir, ligean den díospóireacht nuair a raibh gá leis sin. Tá an ceart acu siúd a labhair romham gur bhain sé sult as an Dáil. Thuig sé cé chomh tábhachtach is a bhí sé a bheith anseo agus cuidigh sé le daoine ó gach páirtí a bhí nua sa phost. Bhí an onóir tuillte aige nuair a ainmnigh muintir Chill Chainnigh é mar saorfhear den chathair. Bheadh sé tuillte ag aon duine tar éis an oiread sin ama a bheith caite aige nó aici i mbun seirbhíse don phobal, agus sin go díreach a thug Séamus faoi. Dar ndóigh, bhí tréimhse fada aige. Luaigh daoine eile cé chomh fada is a bhí sé sa Dáil agus ar chomhairle nó ar bhardas Chill Chainnigh. Ní dhéanfaidh mé athrá air sin. Ba chara linn ar fad sa Teach seo é agus ní namhaid. Ní raibh raic riamh idir mise agus é ach ba mhinic a bhí sé ina mholtóir ar an raic a bhí idir mise agus daoine eile ar an taobh eile den Teach. Is cuimhin liom go háirithe ceann amháin de na heachtraí sin. Bhí mé agus an t-iarAire, an tUasal Martin Cullen, ag screadaíl i gcoinne a chéile. Bhí Séamus sa Chathaoir agus an t-aon rud a dúirt sé ná, "Now, Deputies." Ba leor sin chun ciúnas a chur orainn nó ar a laghad go bhfeicfiimis ar an méid a bhí ar siúl againn agus go ndíreoimis ar an díospóireacht seachas a bheith ag tarraingt as a chéile. Tá súil agam go mbeidh cuimhní maithe againne ar fad a bhí aithne againn air agus ag a mhuintir. Guím suaimhneas síoraí air. Tá cara caillte ag an Dáil.

I first got to know Séamie in the early or mid-1980s. We sometimes had different views on things. I was a member of the Labour left co-operative, which had a particular view about the development of the party, but I always found Séamie to be extremely supportive, kind and sincere and I was very proud to stand beside him as a candidate for the first time in 1989. Many new young Labour Deputies were elected to the House in the famous Labour class of 1992 and we found Séamie to again be very supportive. He was a mentor and at meetings and in committees, he was quiet, self-deprecating at times, very witty and extremely helpful. We had the same experience during his time as Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle. He took particular care to ensure that all backbenchers who wanted to make contributions on the Order of Business would be accommodated, a tradition I am glad is being continued by the current Leas-Cheann Comhairle. As Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Séamus represented the Oireachtas and the country with enormous distinction with foreign visitors and when he represented us abroad. That he spent 46 years as a Member of the Dáil and the Pattison family spent seven decades representing Kilkenny city and county and County Carlow is a truly remarkable achievement. In the case of Séamus, it arose from his absolute devotion and fabulous work as a servant of his native city and the people of Kilkenny and Carlow. I will always remember him as a kind and gentle man who upheld the best traditions of Irish life. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

Jackie Healy-Rae, the late father of my colleagues, Deputies Danny and Michael Healy-Rae, was great friends with Séamus Pattison and regarded him as fair, honest and at all times a decent man. Séamus Pattison worked very hard for many decades and was returned 12 times to the Dáil, which is a remarkable achievement. He was a man of the people and very dedicated to his duty as a public representative. This morning, I spoke to Mr. John O'Connor from Cahir, who was his driver for many years and in recent times. At Mr. Pattison's funeral, Mr. O'Connor told me that he was very dedicated to his constituents and his line of duty. I agree with all that was said about his time as Ceann Comhairle. I was not a Member of the Dáil at the time but he was fair and very equal. I wonder what he would think of the current system involving bingo cards but sin scéal eile. He was very supportive of the Labour Party organisation and its rural members. He recently came to Ardfinnan, in my county, to launch a book written by Dr. Anthony O'Halloran and we had a great night. He was in ill health at the time but, despite that, he still attended. He saw it as his duty to support Labour Party members in the constituency. Coming from a family of four, his chosen career was public service and he did the State a great service.

Coming from the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, he was a man who treated everybody the very same. No matter what party one was from, it made no difference to Séamus Pattison. Whether he was an MEP or a Minister of State, he always looked forward to coming home to look after his constituents. As the Taoiseach said, Christmas Day or St. Stephen's Day, Monday or Tuesday, it made no difference to Séamus Pattison. He left a huge mark in the constituency over many years. Reference was made to the fact that he won 12 elections in a row, which in itself is an outstanding achievement. Politics is the poorer for his passing. I pass on my regards to his family who are in the Visitors Gallery.

I can only describe Séamus Pattison as a gentleman, a statesman and a proud Kilkenny man. There is great sadness as we gather here today to recall and celebrate the life of Séamus Pattison as a Member of this House for many years. He was a former Ceann Comhairle, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, a Minister of State, a Member of the European Parliament and the Council of Europe and, of course, a Member of this House from 1961 to 2007. Déanaim mo chomhbhrón le teaghlach Séamus Pattison, go háirithe Joe, atá anseo inniu, agus Carmel, bean chéile Joe. Séamus Pattison served as a Member of Dáil Éireann for 46 years and eight months; he has the fifth longest service by anyone in the House. He devoted his life to public service and the betterment of his constituency and the communities of his counties and the State. Séamus Pattison was held in the highest respect by all who knew him. He was highly regarded by the Members of the House but particularly by the staff of the House for whom he had tremendous regard. He held the offices of Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle with distinction, fairness and impartiality. He had a unique style that was referred to earlier, which endeared him to all sides of the House. If we want to pay tribute to Séamus in the years ahead, when the Ceann Comhairle or I say "Now, now Deputies", I hope they will respond as they did for Séamus. Séamus Pattison worked closely with Deputies from all parties in the House and he was a true gentleman of utmost character and regard. He respected everyone he encountered in his political career. He leaves a legacy that in many ways may never be equalled. His legacy is one to be extremely proud of, but his own modesty would never allow praise or accolades of any nature, such was his unassuming character. Today, we honour a life given graciously and without hesitation to public service, to the people of his county and to the people of his country. His life was devoted to helping others. That was the career of Séamus Pattison. Ar dheis lámh Dé go raibh a anam

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	The revelations by Martin Wall on Monday in The Irish Times, following the release of correspondence between the Government and the HSE through a freedom of information request, confirms what I have said for some time, that, in essence, there was a fundamental lack of transparency at the heart of the process for providing money for health in 2018. There is a clear attempt by the Government to cover up the truth on the challenges facing the health services in 2018. The Government published a spending plan for health in the full knowledge that it will not be sufficient. I am not talking about the usual toing and froing or the arguments and counter arguments between the Government and the HSE but clearly there has been an attempt to paper over the gaps and to hide the truth from the public. The attempt to paper over the disagreement was made by putting in a figure of €346 million in value for money savings. We now know, however, that in the days after the publication of the plan, the HSE director general said that the targets will not be realised. This was subsequently revealed by The Irish Times also. The correspondence shows that there was an understanding, or that assumptions were made, to keep off the books potentially hundreds of millions of euro in other risks. For example, there was no provision for pay pressures, €68 million of which was in the earlier draft. Was this a reference to the employees of hospices and disability organisations who had balloted for strike action and who have been denied their fair pay by the Government? The Government also instructed the HSE not to include any sum in the plan to deal with a carryover of its financial deficit from 2017. The director general of the HSE has estimated other significant challenges facing the HSE, but the Government clearly wanted the financial difficulties played down in the published service plan. Departmental correspondence states:The financial challenges need to be addressed only once (in the financial section?). Details on the assumptions and arrangements to address financial challenge should be contained in the letter accompanying the NSP [national service plan] rather than included in the main document.Decoded, the HSE is being told to bury the negative stuff as effectively as it can, and not to put it upfront because the public might see it too clearly. There are also revelations about Sláintecare. The Taoiseach has repeatedly said that the Government is committed to Sláintecare but the HSE director general has said the plan is challenging because he would have to develop the service plan "in the absence of an agreed implementation plan and transition funding for Sláintecare". A sum of €3 billion was supposed to have been provided. The HSE director general was told by the Department that he was "overly focused" on a transition fund as it has not been approved yet. Clearly, this reveals a fundamental lack of commitment to the implementation of Sláintecare. There is much more in this correspondence. The HSE pointed out that the plan would be challenging in terms of "performance and protecting patient safety". The Department's response was to warn the HSE that it was using "unacceptable language". Why has the Government gone to such lengths to prevent the truth from coming out and to prevent the HSE from telling it as it is with regard to the challenges facing the health services in 2018?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	99	As I have said before in this House, the 2018 national service plan sets out a budget of almost €15 billion for the HSE. This is the largest budget for our public health service since the foundation of the State and it represents an increase of more than €600 million on 2017. This is a substantial increase in funding levels. This comes on top of a health service that was already well funded. When the total amount of health spend is divided by the number of people in the country, Ireland is among the top five countries in the world for health spend per head, and by some estimates Ireland is perhaps in the top one or two.That comes after a period that included a recession and during which spending was above the average in the western world. The HSE produced its service plan in consultation with the Department of Health. The plan was approved by the HSE's leadership team in accordance with the law. It was noted by the Cabinet in December before publication. A number of measures and actions are under way to begin the process of turning the Sláintecare proposals into an implementation plan. As the Deputy is aware, the report of the all-party committee sets out a shared vision for our health service. It is a plan for a plan. It calls for an implementation plan and that is being worked on by the Minister for Health. We hope to have it ready in the next couple of months. We have also completed the capacity review, which will feed into the ten-year infrastructure investment plan that is to be published in the next couple of weeks. A group has been established to look into the separation of public and private practice, as recommended in the Sláintecare report, and is meeting under the chairmanship of Dr. Donal de Buitléir. In addition, we have taken some steps towards the implementation of some of the things that are called for in the plan, such as the extension of the GP visit card scheme and reductions in prescription charges and in the cost of the drug payment scheme. All of these real and concrete actions are provided for in the budget. I have often heard Deputy Micheál Martin calling for an honest debate about health care and health funding. I agree that we should have an honest debate. Fundamentally, if we are serious about facilitating real improvements in our health service, we all need to acknowledge the false proposition that is always put forward that there is somehow a direct connection between money and resources, on the one hand, and outcomes for patients, on the other. We know it is not the case that there is such a connection. The Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service's report on the funding of our hospitals shows that in one year when there was no increase in funding for hospitals, activity increased by 7%, and that in another year when there was an increase in funding for hospitals, activity decreased. If we want to have an honest debate about a health service that works and provides patients with the standard of care and the outcomes they deserve, we need to get away from the false analysis that there is a direct connection between money and resources, on the one hand, and patient outcomes and services, on the other. I would mention as evidence of my contention that it is a very indirect connection, at best, the fact that we spend so much but do not get the return we need. It seems to me that the difficulty we have had for many years with the running of our health service is that rather than trying to manage health services within an ever-expanding budget, as other agencies do, the HSE does something very different - it monetises every problem and passes it on to the Department of Health in the full knowledge that those documents will either be released under freedom of information or will be leaked, usually to the journalist Deputy Micheál Martin mentioned.

He did not answer the basic question I asked. Why did the Government edit the HSE's drafts of the service plan so heavily? Why did it say that the language was unacceptable and that the HSE was being too negative? The Government wanted to put a gloss and a spin on it to hide the truth from the public. In the weeks running up to Christmas, the Department had grave concern about what the HSE intended to say in the 2018 service plan. It was adamant that details of assumptions which underpin the health budget for 2018 - for example, no provision was being made in the financial figures for up to €68 million in potential pay pressures, or a potential charge of €170 million - would be left out of the publicly released plan and referred to in private correspondence only. The Government wanted to keep stuff private to hide it from the public.

They believe that they have been forced to take this action by the State's failure to protect them from their exposure to toxic chemicals during their service, which led to serious, chronic and fatal illnesses, including cancer. While those cases will ultimately be dealt with by the courts, that does not prevent the State from taking action. As early as the 1990s, numerous State-commissioned reports highlighted health and safety concerns about chemical exposure at Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel, but no action was taken at the time. In fact, these reports mysteriously disappeared or were ordered to be shredded. Even after litigation commenced in 2013, basic health and safety precautions were not implemented at Baldonnel. It appears it was only after the Health and Safety Authority conducted an inspection in 2016 that personnel were provided with basic precautions like personal protection equipment such as gloves and overalls. Hundreds, if not thousands, of personnel who have passed through Baldonnel may be suffering from chronic and even fatal illnesses as a result of exposure to toxic chemicals during their service. There is also a possibility that family members have been affected, as evidence suggests that there is a higher rate of a variety of health conditions among spouses and children, including stillbirths and miscarriages. The Government has taken no action to find out the extent of this scandal or to ascertain how many people might be suffering as a result of it. Instead, it is fighting tooth and nail through the courts to force sick people to take gruelling journeys in search of justice. By comparison, the Australian Government has set up a board of inquiry to conduct a thorough investigation into similar matters. It commissioned a survey of health outcomes for the relevant personnel and their families and put in place a health care system for those who were affected. As the Taoiseach knows, a protected disclosure from one of the whistleblowers was recently released publicly. It makes for harrowing reading. It lists 56 deaths of former serving Air Corps personnel at an average age of 48. All of the cases listed relate specifically to people who died before they reached the age of 66. The disclosure is based on research done by the whistleblower in the absence of any State-funded investigation into these matters, but it is by no means exhaustive. I believe another number of deaths have been identified since it was published. It is clear that successive Governments have failed in their duty of care to the men and women who served in the Air Corps. This Government has an opportunity to do the right thing. We do not want to be here in ten years' time with a higher death toll, having failed to address this scandal. Has the Taoiseach read the disclosure? Has he responded to the whistleblower in question? Does he accept that the time has come to order a full inquiry into these matters?

While I have absolutely no doubt that the serious ill-health suffered by some former members of the Air Corps is real, it has not been proven whether this array of illnesses could be caused by chemical exposure. Obviously, these cases will be heard in the courts, which will hear all the evidence and, on that basis, make a determination on the claim or allegation that all of these illnesses were caused by chemical exposure. I think that is the right way for this to proceed. The health and well-being of men and women of the Air Corps are, of course, matters of huge concern and interest for the Government.The Minister of State has ensured that allegations relating to exposure to chemical and toxic substances while working in Baldonnell were independently reviewed. Before considering any further steps, the Minister of State has asked those who made the disclosures for their views. He is examining options for next steps in the process in light of the views he has received from those who made the allegations in the context of ongoing litigation. The independent report considers the Defence Forces' health and safety regime and its current policy and application. In respect of historic matters, as litigation had commenced before protected disclosures were made, the report states that the courts are now the most appropriate forum for such matters to be assessed and are the best place to assess all the evidence. Although the report finds that the Defence Forces' regime appears to be capable of meeting the statutory requirements, it makes a number of observations, including in respect of documentation, health surveillance and exposure monitoring. It also observes that the Health and Safety Authority is the appropriate statutory body to deal with such allegations. Separately, and in parallel to this independent review, following an inspection in 2016, the Air Corps has continued to work with the Health and Safety Authority to improve its health and safety regime. It should be noted that there is a significant overlap between the recommendations of the HSA and those of the independent reviewer. The military authorities have informed the Minister of State that the HSA has formally noted the high level of co-operation received from the Air Corps and the considerable progress made to date by the Defence Forces towards the implementation of safety management systems for the control of hazardous substances.

However, what the Taoiseach has just read out does not in any way address the legacy of bad management and a bad health and safety record there. I do not know if the Taoiseach remembers that he is also Minister for Defence. He has a direct responsibility to look into these matters. He is also a medical doctor and will understand the list of illnesses that has been provided to his Minister of State, which includes very serious and often fatal conditions, as the other disclosure indicated. We do not know how many people have been exposed in an unprotected way because nobody has carried out a survey. The Australians did not wait for the courts to adjudicate fully, they acted immediately. There is a list of chemicals, albeit a partial one, which was given to Deputy Lisa Chambers. How many of the people involved have been exposed? As the Taoiseach is aware, if a doctor does not know what people have been exposed to, he cannot help, diagnose, prescribe or direct medical procedures. This is about saving lives. Will the Taoiseach act now not in respect of the specific cases but on the legacy of all of those who are suffering in the general public?

The Government has delegated responsibility for defence matters to the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, whom I fully trust to deal with this issue appropriately. I am a medical doctor and have seen the list of illnesses that these former members of the Air Corps and their families have suffered. It is a very long and extensive list of illnesses, including the most common illnesses which most people may encounter, namely, cancer, cardiovascular disease, suicide and miscarriages by their partners. As a medical doctor, it is not possible for me to say if exposure to chemicals caused all or any of these illnesses because they are commonplace in the community at large. If it was one specific illness resulting from a known chemical that caused such an illness, that would be one thing. These are not the allegations that are being made, however. There is litigation before the courts, which are best placed to assess the evidence and see whether the allegations are supported by it.

In short, Sarah is a victim of rape who was refused morning-after contraception and ended up having to go to Britain for a late abortion at great expense and trauma. In the context of a debate about unrestricted access to abortion up to 12 weeks versus restrictions, I think the interview should be required listening for everybody in the Cabinet and all other Members of the Dáil. It gets to the heart of the experience of many women in this country regarding contraception and abortion. Sarah's experience is particularly harrowing. She was violated by a so-called friend, dismissed by a garda when she went to report the matter and disbelieved by a pharmacist. Her experience of the search for emergency contraception is mirrored by multiple accounts from women over many years. This has been raised in parliamentary questions for years, including by me in 2015, in the context of how medically unnecessary it is and also how it acts as a barrier to access. Now we have seen the consequences of this. Sarah said she was asked a series of invasive questions by a pharmacist, who said she did not believe her and did not give her access to the medication. Some, including the Tánaiste and other Deputies, are proposing to give the same powers to doctors by introducing a rape ground within abortion legislation. The joint committee proved that this will not and cannot work for precisely the reasons Sarah experienced. Would the Taoiseach agree that it is ignorant and irresponsible of the Tánaiste and others like him to ignore that committee's research and to try to pretend that what they are proposing, which just ignores reality, can work? This case to which I refer concerns a woman in the Tánaiste's native city. Sarah's testimony on the radio was very brave. There are a few things people should listen to before we legislate down the road on this issue. Sarah said, "I am against forced pregnancy." She said she was a living, breathing human being playing a role in society while the foetus was a potential human being. In other words, the rights of the person who is pregnant should trump other rights. She said we need to respect women to make these decisions, not to judge about good and bad abortions. Would the Taoiseach agree that this interview underlines that access must be based on the person who is affected making the decision, not an arbitrator, the doctor, the State or whoever else? If we do not legislate for abortion up to 12 weeks on request, the abortion trail will continue and women like Sarah will continue to be counselled by taxi drivers in London, telling them to lie down in the back of the taxi. Do we want that to continue to be the case? Is the Taoiseach going to lift the requirement for a consultation for emergency contraception and make it available over the counter, thereby ensuring that women will not have to endure the type of questioning to which I refer? Is the whole Government going to listen to the lessons of Sarah's story and unite behind the committee's recommendations for unrestricted access?

I certainly pay tribute to and have a lot of respect for people who are willing to share their personal stories of adversity when it comes to sexual violence and crisis pregnancies. In respect of whether any medicine is available over the counter, that is not a decision for the Government, nor should it be. That decision is made by a body called the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA. It decides whether a medicine should be available over the counter on patient safety grounds. There are some medicines which, if used inappropriately or if taken by a patient who has other illnesses or perhaps allergies, can cause enormous harm. If something is not available over the counter and a prescription-only medicine, it is thus for good scientific and medical reasons. I would not like it to be the case that politicians or people in this House were to take that power away from medical experts and into their own hands under any circumstances. We will not be doing that. As I said in recent days, the all-party Oireachtas committee did not pluck its proposals out of thin air. It considered the evidence very carefully and reached conclusions. Those conclusions, certainly to me and, I think, most Members, make a lot of sense. We risk re-victimising women if in some way we ask them to prove to their doctors or whoever else that they were victims of sexual violence. I certainly would not like that to be our law. It is, however, important to recognise that Article 43.3.3° - the eighth amendment - is a feature of our Constitution and it will not be possible for this House to legislate for lawful termination of pregnancies in any circumstance if it remains in place. There is a two-step process here.The first step involves the referendum passing, which would untie the hands of this Oireachtas to change the law, and the second step is for this Oireachtas to change the law, as it should, based on the evidence and based on public opinion.  Fundamentally, this means not trusting politicians but rather trusting women and their doctors. We should trust women in the first 12 weeks of their pregnancy to decide what is best for them and whether or not they want to continue that pregnancy beyond 12 weeks, and trusting doctors to allow it on medical grounds.

The first issue is that Sarah was not asked if she had allergies. She was asked about her sex life. That is the reality of it. The morning after pill is safer than paracetamol or Nurofen. One can go to the counter and get it without any questioning. Someone can give advice as to its safety, but this is different, because women are actually being interrogated. Can the Taoiseach imagine this happening in a small town or village? This incident occurred in a major retail chain. The process in question adds to the cost, because once a woman has a consultation, the price of the medication goes up. This is another barrier to access for poorer or vulnerable younger women. In Boots in Cork city centre, it costs €60, while on the Lower Kilmacud Road in Stillorgan it costs €15.50. These are the variations. Women are actually looking up maps on the Internet to see where they can get the morning after pill. That is a ludicrous situation in this day and age.  On the substantive issue of abortion, it will be up to the public to decide to repeal the eighth amendment but only this Dáil can legislate for abortion. I hope it listens to the public and what it is saying, because the public are ahead of the politicians.

If there was any inappropriate or invasive questioning, it will be able to take that issue further. However, it is relatively standard practice that when somebody requests emergency contraception, a practitioner would try to give advice on contraception more broadly. For example, it may be the correct choice for an individual at a particular point in time but it may also be advisable that she goes on more regular contraception. Sometimes pharmacists and doctors will offer people advice in that area. Certainly that should not happen in an invasive way or take the form of an interrogation. It should always be respectful, seeking information only. If the woman the Deputy mentioned feels that she was treated badly by a pharmacist or by a doctor, I would encourage her to make a complaint.

Following his speech, he faced questions from the leader of the Greens-European Free Alliance, Philippe Lamberts, who told him that Ireland was the worst country for tackling climate change in Europe and was very likely to miss its 2020 targets, which might potentially cost this State €400 million. In reply to his questions, the Taoiseach agreed that Ireland is laggardly when it comes to climate change and he said that he wanted to see the electrification of our railways. I live in the constituency of Cork South West, where for up to 150 km there is absolutely no rail, which puts huge pressure on our depleted roads. In the mid-1850s, there was rail from Cork through Innishannon, Bandon to Clonakilty, Skibbereen through Ballydehob, and all the way to Schull and Mizen Head, and on the north side through Dunmanway and Drimoleague to Bantry. Remember that this was the 1850s, and it allowed people to both travel and do business throughout west Cork but now, 168 years later, we have nothing. Will the Taoiseach sanction a study on how we can bring rail back to west Cork, if only as far as Bandon, to start once again opening up west Cork as a place where strong business can be done? The pressure on our roads due to a lack of rail or any type of proper public transport means that the roads throughout Cork South West are in a depleted state. Representatives have pleaded time and time again for money to be spent on the roads in west Cork. The bypass in Bandon remains unfinished, and has been for decades now. Innishannon is a bottleneck for workers and all drivers who try to come and go through it in the morning and evenings. Long-suffering drivers might have to stay behind vehicles from Clonakilty to Skibbereen for 50 minutes, a journey which should take 25 minutes. The sheer frustration for long-suffering motorists is palpable in what we are led to believe is a modern era.  In my 32 years of driving, the biggest job carried out and completed on the N71 road has been the Skibbereen bypass in 2003, all of 15 years ago. All other moneys to west Cork have been for simple repairs, which have left a lot to be desired. I ask the Taoiseach to work with me and my colleagues in Cork South West to find the funding from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohue's Department and to work with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, to carry out proper works on west Cork roads, to create passing bays on our N71 and the R586 from Bandon through Ballineen, Dunmanway, Drimoleague to Bantry and to allow bypasses in Innishannon and Bandon to be completed simply to put west Cork on a level playing pitch with other counties. Over the past 18 years proper works could have been carried out on west Cork roads by two of the Taoiseach's predecessors, but this did not happen. The Taoiseach has a chance to bring rail and a proper road structure to west Cork. Will he do this?

We have 2020 targets, which are going to be very difficult to meet, and 2030 targets which may be somewhat more realistic to meet. We should not forget the ways in which Ireland is different from other countries. We had a lost decade, ten years during which we were not able to afford investment in public transport, new energy and other things. That is changing now, and the ten-year investment plan in infrastructure will have a huge section on climate change and will outline some of the things we intend to do in those areas. We also have a very different economy. Many countries are achieving their climate change reduction targets because heavy industry is dying out and they are able to close down heavy polluting industries. We never had those industries in the first place. We have a lot of agriculture, which produces a lot of emissions. However, the emissions produced from agriculture are lower relative to the amount of food we produce than is the case in other countries. We have to bear in mind that we achieve nothing by displacing production from Ireland to another country. The Deputy mentioned money from the Minister, Deputy Donohue's Department. Money does not come from the Minister's Department but rather from the people. It comes from the taxpayer and the taxes that are paid by hard-working people and businesses all over the country, including in Cork. Given that it is the people's money, we have to make decisions on how it is best spent, and when it comes to transport investment, in some parts of the country that will mean investment in roads. In other parts of the country, it will mean investment in public transport and railways. It is not feasible, realistic, affordable or honest to say that we can do both in all areas. We have to make decisions as to the parts of the country in which it makes sense to invest in buses and rail and the parts of the country in which it makes sense to improve our road network. It is impossible to do both-----

I would expect that the kind of investment we are going to see in the next number of decades will be based around buses, public transport and railways in our cities rather than in roads. Outside our cities, in more rural areas, there will be massive investment in our roadways. That is what makes the most sense. The biggest road project completed in the past two years was the Gort-Tuam motorway, which I turned the sod on and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport opened only a few months ago. That is part of a new motorway network that will connect Galway to Limerick, as it does already, and then on to Cork via the M20. What makes sense in terms of transport planning is investment in the roads between the cities and in rural areas but within the cities not spending any more money on building new roads because that will not solve the traffic problems. The money in the cities will be spent on buses and railways.

The people of Cork South West have been taxpayers for many, many decades and have got absolutely nothing back when the amount of tax they have paid for their roads is taken into consideration. I do not believe that the Taoiseach fully realises the crisis that has hit west Cork roads. In the leading article in the Southern Star newspaper in west Cork last week, it was reported that in 2015 there were claims by motorists for damage to vehicles from bad roads in County Cork amounting to a total of €30,000. In 2016, the figures obtained show that this had increased to €46,000 in one year. I have no doubt that the figures, when released, for 2017 and 2018 will show a dramatic increase because roads are continuing to deteriorate.Up to 80% do not claim for damage done to their cars. Last week, the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, made €417 million available nationally, €44 million of which will come to Cork county but it is estimated that County Cork will need over €500 million to bring the roads up to an acceptable standard. What was given by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is less than 10% of what is required. This is a genuine crisis throughout rural Ireland and west Cork and I call on the Taoiseach again to examine it as a matter of real urgency and to increase the funding made available to the local authority.

To a certain extent, therefore, local authorities can raise revenue and spend it on the roads or other priorities if they wish to do so and there is also funding from central Government. While the roads budget was reduced significantly as a consequence of the economic crisis and the recession, we have been in a position in recent years to increase funding for national, rural, regional and local roads. That will continue, but it will not be possible to do everything in one year.

One involves the introduction of injection centres in Dublin, and the other relates to the publication of a drugs strategy. Everyone in this House would unite around the common cause to tackle this issue because it has destroyed many families and communities, particularly those who have become addicted, and also led to a spiral in gangland crime. The Government needs a cohesive, concerted plan on how to tackle the increased availability and use of heroin and other illicit drugs across cities and also in towns in rural Ireland. Anyone who read this morning's Irish Examiner would be aware of the harrowing account of the Kidney family in Bandon, County Cork, in which Mrs. Kidney tells the story of losing her three sons through heroin addiction over the past three years. It was shocking and deeply sad for the family but also revealing in terms of the prevalence of the heroin scourge the length and breadth of the country. There is a need to go back to the original initiatives taken in the late 1990s and early 2000s with local drugs task forces, which worked on a community integrated basis to deal with the issue in all its aspects and at all levels. I ask the Taoiseach to indicate to me the actions that have been taken following the publication of the national drugs strategy in that regard.

I launched it with the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, and the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, only a few months ago. The Minister reports on a quarterly basis as to the particular actions that have been completed, the ones that are in train and those yet to be commenced. There is specific mention of injection centres. The legislation on that is done and there will need to be planning permission for a centre. I understand three centres have been proposed but I am not sure which one will be selected. The Minister will set up an independent group to choose one and it will need planning permission. I met the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, to discuss drugs and drugs-related issues last week. In addition to that, she has appointed a working group to consider decriminalisation, which is one of the proposals in the drugs strategy.

In November of last year, the Taoiseach was quoted as saying that Ireland will not join a European army, yet that is exactly what he is agreeing to in this instance. To quote someone else, if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is obviously a duck. When will the Taoiseach extract Ireland from the anti-neutrality commitment to partake in EU battle groups? When will the debate on the motion happen or is it the case that he will wait for the Defence (Amendment) Bill?

Part of the strategy that is published is to keep legislation up to date to deal with emerging trends. The Taoiseach will have seen the article in The Sunday Business Post by journalist Susan Mitchell over the weekend on the explosion in the amount of prescription drugs used in Ireland. There has been a phenomenal increase in some instances. Prescriptions for Valium alone increased from 54,000 over a decade. A number of particular drugs - opioids, "benzoids" and sleeping tablets - have caused huge problems in other jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, where it now regards prescription drugs as one of the over-arching most important health issues being faced by many communities there. In regard to tackling the issue of prescription drugs being abused, what particular measures does the Taoiseach propose? Does he have legislative or any other measures to tackle this situation before it gets out of hand here as it has done in other jurisdictions?

There is nothing indicated on the clár and, as he is aware, the Department of Finance is talking about diverting €1.5 billion from the Strategic Investment Fund and €0.5 billion a year from people's taxation, to which the Taoiseach referred earlier, into such a fund from 2019. We heard earlier from the leader of Fianna Fáil about the huge gap that we know exists in the health budget for 2018. We have the ongoing disaster in housing and we have a very large national debt, one of the highest in the OECD. Already, €14 billion or €15 billion has been set aside by the NTMA for the genesis of a future wealth fund. Is that something we should be talking about at all? As I put to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, last week, using one of his own favourite words, is it not bonkers to be talking about a rainy day fund when it is raining already for many of our citizens?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	157	On the legislation, the vehicle to set it up is the National Asset Management Agency (Amendment) Bill, which was in committee in January. I strongly agree with the establishment of a rainy day fund. What I never want to see happen again is for us to repeat the mistakes of the past. When an economy is growing and going relatively well, it makes sense to first balance the books, run a surplus and then put some of that surplus aside for a period so that when there is a downturn, and it is always the case that there will be a downturn at some point in the future, we will never again have to do what happened in this country five or six years ago. We never want to be in a situation ever again where we have to cut people's pay, pensions, welfare benefits and employment in the public sector. It terrifies me how often I come into this House and hear from all sides proposals to repeat the mistakes of the past-----

I beg to differ having checked it before I came to the House. The important thing is investment in rail, which Deputy Collins raised a minute ago in reference to lines which were closed half a century or a century ago. We read now that our railways are under threat again in Limerick, Waterford and along the Nenagh-Ballybrophy line. There are eight stations involved there, which means eight derelict or semi-derelict buildings, many of which are listed. We cannot allow this haemorrhage to take place. The Taoiseach mentioned money and the HSE and it is not all about that. Iarnród Éireann should be compelled to carry out a feasibility study and change the timetables so that services run at times suited to the demands of passengers, including business people. Instead, services are being run into the ground with buses being put on half the time. When that happens, there is no rail trip to record in the statistics. I ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to engage with transport stakeholders to rejuvenate these services rather than to scrap them.

Given the fact that none was closed during a very dark period for our country economically, we do not propose to do so into the future. A lot of studies have been done already, in case the Deputy has not read them yet.

No one expects any line to cover its capital costs of constructing rails, stations and trains but we want to get to a point where the fares paid by passengers at least cover the running costs, which is not the case for the vast majority of railway lines.
#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	175	On 18 January, Nicole Fox Fenton, affectionately known to her family as "Coco", died by suicide. Nicole was 21 and had her whole life in front of her. Nicole's mother, Jackie, has given me permission to speak today about her beautiful daughter. Nicole was bullied to death, not only online but in reality and in her daily life. Bullying is poisoning virtual reality and driving some young people to utter despair. Nicole's death is not the first and it probably will not be the last. What is the Government doing to address bullying, in particular of young people?

Indeed, the promise covered cases in which payments were held up for one reason or another and a consensus was arrived at that two thirds of outstanding payments would be made until the problems were sorted out. However, where commonage was burned in Kerry, some farmers received no payments at all for Christmas. They have no other income. In the fullness of time, they will win their battle because their commonage was burned from outside. They had nothing to do with the burning of the commonage. I ask the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to intervene to ensure these farmers get fair play. It is wrong to take their whole payment from them. They were told they would get payments in 2018. That is totally wrong.

Let me tell the House, and Members who have been here for many years will realise, that what I was doing is established practice, irrespective of cards or no cards. In regard to the cards, it is a pilot scheme until Easter, when it will be reviewed. Today, the reason I had to suspend had nothing to do with cards - absolutely nothing. If there is a related question, then it is custom and practice that it is taken. It was not a question of me showing favouritism to anybody.

It is absolutely outrageous. They fought a fire to keep it out of their land. The fire brigade was fighting with them. It was coming in to them. They failed to keep it out. It came into their land and burned their land, and now their payments are stopped. It is outrageous.

I ask the Taoiseach to use his offices and work with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We had this matter before the agriculture committee last week. It is essential that these farmers get a prompt answer and that fairness is brought to the system. I note the Taoiseach looked over his shoulder when the question was first raised and I presume that was to see if the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine was around. I know he is in Strasbourg today so he cannot be here but I would point out he is never here for this particular section.

I could count on one hand the number of times the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has been here. The Taoiseach might raise that with him to try to ensure there is better attendance.

The National Office for Suicide Prevention is rolling out the Connecting for Life strategy in every county. It is an association between the local authorities, the Garda Síochána and the HSE. Thankfully, the register of suicides in this country is going the right way and, while it is not where we want it to be, the numbers are dropping. There were 399 deaths by suicide last year. Funding has increased to €13 million this year for that office and we will continue to invest heavily in this area as we see results.

As I said, the school has duly opened, the patron has purchased a site and planning permission has been granted by Kildare County Council but we are facing a situation in which 231 students applied for places in September 2017 and 111 were turned away. There is a primary school, Naas community national school, co-located on the same temporary accommodation. If this continues, by 2020 we will have 800 students in temporary accommodation that was created for 500. We urgently need the tender to be issued.

Last Wednesday, I asked the Taoiseach about the programme for Government in relation to health, specifically about the orthopaedic units in Merlin Park. I acknowledged that the Taoiseach was a busy man and I gave him the opportunity to return to me with an answer or get the Minister, Deputy Harris, to do so. The leaks in the roof have been repaired and the hospital is currently waiting for a risk assessment to be conducted. Hundreds of orthopaedic operations have been cancelled and we are still unable to find out what is going on. Will the Taoiseach please sort this matter out and have the two units open as soon as possible?

He assures me that the HSE is committed to ensuring that a full elective orthopaedic service is restored in Merlin Park. In September 2017, the leaks in the roof of the building which houses the orthopaedic theatres occurred, necessitating the closure of both. There has been a full repair to the membrane of the roof which is required to secure the integrity of the building and these works are now complete. The theatres, notwithstanding the roof repair, date from the 1950s and do not meet current clinical standards. An independent clinical assessment has been undertaken to assess the feasibility of returning these theatres to use. The Saolta University Health Care Group management team has advised that the best way to restore effective capacity at Merlin Park is through the provision of two modular theatres on the Merlin Park site. The tender process for these modular units is at its final stages and it is expected that a contract will be awarded in the coming weeks.

We know how important are community gardaí in tackling rural crime. In Cavan-Monaghan, the number of community gardaí has fallen by almost 80% in the last seven years. The area now has only two officially appointed community gardaí, which is one of the lowest levels in the country. Will the Government comment on how it intends to establish community gardaí in the region once again?

I am concerned about the autonomy the universities already have and how some of them are exercising it. Is the Minister aware of an independent audit report into the University of Limerick that was published at the weekend? It accused representatives of the university of misleading the Committee of Public Accounts, the Comptroller and Auditor General, the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority. What action does the Government propose to take regarding the conclusions reached in that report?

The investigator has done the work and the university is in the process of acting on the recommendations. I gather some issues continue be examined by the investigators and we are yet to hear from them but the university is in the process of responding to the investigation report.

The programme for Government gives a commitment to double funding and advance the rural walks scheme. The Ó Suilleabháin Beara walk from west Cork to Leitrim was already developed and landowners are maintaining it. It is working. However, there is a group in the middle, in the Muskerry area, which is locked out. The scheme was closed while it was developing its walkway. Landowners to their north and west are able to access the scheme but these people are locked out. Other communities also wish to bring tourism into their areas by reusing abandoned railways and so on. What will happen in respect of reopening these schemes for rural walks and when will it happen?

I find the Ó Suilleabháin Beara story very compelling. I walked it with one of our former colleagues, former Deputy Áine Collins, and I provided funding for a bridge along the walkway. The issue of greenways is an infrastructure funding matter. I am confident that money would be provided for additional greenways and rural walkways in the ten year investment plan once it is published.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	There are people in the Gallery today from the Irish MPS Society who suffer from the condition Morquio. They were here some months ago when we raised the issue of a drug called Vimizim with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, who unfortunately is in a committee today. Only three children in the country use this drug. The matter was before a special health committee about three weeks ago, where it was discussed, but we do not know its decision. This weekend is the last weekend that the company is prepared to continue to give the drug to the children. When one is dealing with orphan drugs, and they are being put through trials, one is dealing with a very small number of people who need it. It is not as though there are hundreds of others to whom it can be sold. A better type of approval process for orphan drugs is needed. I appeal to the Taoiseach to see if something can be done to try to get answers from this group so that people know what is happening, and I ask for more transparency in the process generally, but particularly in the case of Vimizim.

The Taoiseach was in Limerick on 27 January when he announced and, I hope, confirmed, the construction of a motorway known as the M20 between Cork and Limerick. At a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport on Wednesday, 31 January, I asked a straight question of officials from Transport Infrastructure Ireland relating to the route of the M20. I hope that what the Taoiseach promised in Limerick will get through to the officials, who would not give me a guarantee that the route would be confined to running adjacent to Mallow, Buttevant, Charleville and on to Croom or that this was going to be the confined study route. Will the Taoiseach make a statement on this issue in this Chamber?

It is vital that towns such as Charleville and Buttevant should be bypassed. A different route would still have to bypass those towns and would not make sense.

It speaks of measures to revitalise all Ireland in order that benefits are felt in all communities. Villages are a top priority for the new dedicated Minister. It goes on to refer to supporting a post office network renewal process.When will the McKinsey report, being undertaken by An Post in term of rural post offices, be finished? As of yesterday, An Post was not in a position to put a timeframe on it? What will the Government do, given it seems the Minister has no statutory function in deciding what post office closes or opens? It would be different for Garda stations, as we know from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. I want to know what is going to happen. In my constituency, we have Ballygawley and, most recently, Easkey, but there are ones in every constituency and county that effectively are on death row with people wondering whether their local service will close.

In November last, the then Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, who had responsibility for the arts, Deputy Humphreys, announced a series of measures that the Minister and her Department believed would do just that. These consisted of a series of workshops on governance for board members and senior staff. I do not know what world the Fine Gael Ministers live in but those who exploit workers are not swayed by workshops and PowerPoint presentations. We need a coercive element to change a culture of exploitation and harassment. That is why we want to tie the allocation of funds to the arts sector to that sector's compliance with the law. I fail to see how anyone can object to a Bill that requires a sector to simply comply with the law. This Bill will also make all arts funding over €100,000 subject to the oversight of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts. Last year, the Arts Council issued over €86 million in funds to arts bodies. Obviously, the Oireachtas needs to know exactly what that money is spent on. We are not proposing that the Oireachtas would dictate what projects the Arts Council would fund - that is entirely a matter for the Arts Council - but we have a responsibility to ensure there is transparency and good governance and that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts can scrutinise how public money is spent. Finally, far too often now in the public sector, because of money being allocated through grants and because of outsourcing, there are significant amounts of money which are outside the purview of both the Comptroller and Auditor General's office and the Committee of Public Accounts. Moreover, Accounting Officers, as in Secretaries General, are not accountable for the spend of that money to those bodies to the extent that they should be. This Bill deals with one sector, which is the arts sector. We are asking the Government to support the Bill.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	279	In the past few months, a number of women have stood up and identified sexual harassment and bullying at the highest reaches of the cultural institutions. It takes great strength and confidence to do that because in Ireland, normally, when one speaks out, it means career suicide. These women have done a massive service to people everywhere and we applaud them. It is amazing that it took them to go to the national newspapers to achieve justice and to protect them from harassment and bullying. It shows that there is a clear problem that the laws and the regulations in this country are not working. On each occasion, the relevant Ministers have hidden behind employment law, highlighting it and stating there are regulatory bodies, such as the Workplace Relations Commission, to deal with this problem. That argument misses the point. The arts sector does not operate the same as other employment sectors. It is hammered with precarious working conditions and these precarious working conditions are accentuating the power differentials between management and employees which, in my view, is leading in certain cases to a septic culture of abuse. Irish Equity recently released a survey of the theatre sector. It found that 60% of those surveyed stated that they were bullied and 75% of those people stated they did not report it as they feared it would jeopardise their employment. These are shocking figures. They are all the more shocking given that the Government is one of the main investors and funders of that sector. The Government has even more of a responsibility to ensure that the funding is being spent properly and fairly and is creating a workplace that is free from bullying etc. I understand that Ms Karan O'Loughlin of Irish Equity met the Arts Council in 2016 with some of these details. She put it to the Arts Council that it needed to be part of the solution to these problems. I understand, from what Ms O'Loughlin has said, that the Arts Council stated at that stage that it was none of its business and it did not have a role in this regard. It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that wherever people work in any sector is a harassment and bullying-free zone. That is really important. All this legislation seeks to do is to tie the investment the State makes in these theatre groups etc. to fulfilling their responsibility to workers and for workers' rights. It is as simple as that. I urge the Government to support it.

This is one on which we will be looking for the Taoiseach's support, and, hopefully, we will move as a Private Members' motion. The purpose of the Bill is to protect workers during a red alert weather warning. This Bill will amend the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 to provide for the safety of employees during certain severe weather warnings issued by Met Éireann. It will also provide for the protection of public safety and the safety of rescue service personnel during such a weather warning and provide for related matters. In the event of a status red severe weather warning, under the Bill all employees in places of employment subject to the alert are to stay away from their place of work until the alert ends and they would be paid as if it was a normal working day. As the Taoiseach will be aware, during ex-Hurricane Ophelia we saw some businesses put their employees lives at risk by insisting they work only to send them home just as the storm reached its maximum strength. Under this Bill, this would no longer happen as businesses will have a statutory obligation to close and ensure that workers do not lose pay as a result. I was taken at the time when the Taoiseach personally gave great leadership during that storm and appealed to people to stay at home, but what about those workers who were then told by their employers that they should come in and had to face the storm and the bad weather and take their lives in their hands to go to work, as I stated, only to be sent home? This will be used, obviously, in very rare circumstances, only if there is a red alert weather warning. If the Taoiseach, Met Éireann and those in leadership are saying it is not safe to travel, then it is not safe to travel. It is as simple as that. One cannot then have employers telling employees to come to work unnecessarily. There are, as I stated, provisions for emergency personnel and all of that would have to be taken into account. I would ask the Taoiseach and the Government to reflect on this Bill. It is one that we want to see pass through this House as quickly as possible, and we will consider moving as a Private Members' motion in due course.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	285	The aim of the Bill is to provide for the safety of employees during certain red alert severe weather warnings issued by Met Éireann, to enhance public safety and to ensure the safety of rescue service personnel during such a severe weather warning. In the immediate aftermath of Storm Ophelia, the Taoiseach rightly acknowledged that there was significant confusion regarding what actions private sector businesses and the self-employed should take when an extreme weather warning was declared. There was a clear mechanism in place for closing schools and public offices and emergency services and local authorities responded to the crisis as best they could at the time but we, as legislators, must now take measures to guide employers, protect workers and strengthen the power of emergency services in the case of future extreme weather warnings.Three people lost their lives in Storm Ophelia, one of whom was a constituent of mine, and I extend my condolences to the families of those who so tragically lost their lives during that storm. Our Bill would introduce new statutory guidelines for private sector employers and self-employed persons in the event of an extreme weather warning, putting workers' safety front and centre. Storm Ophelia was the worst storm to hit Ireland in almost 50 years. Almost 300,000 homes were left without power, and despite the stark warnings and tragic deaths on the day, we still had incidents of reckless behaviour in Louth, Galway and Kerry. This Bill seeks to impose penalties on those who would put lives in danger through reckless behaviour when an extreme weather warning has been enacted. It also seeks to give An Garda Síochána enhanced powers to pursue such behaviour under the law. I believe the legislation would prevent tragedies during future extreme weather events so I ask that it be supported.

The programme implementation board chaired by Michael Stone is overseeing the implementation of actions recommended in the Mulvey report for the social and economic regeneration of the north-east inner city and will shortly publish its 2017 report, including comprehensive details of spending to date. The board, which comprises representatives from the community and business sectors and the main Government Departments and agencies, has met every month since it was established last June. The chairman of the board is reporting regularly to the oversight group of senior officials chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. The group has met five times since its first meeting last May. This is to ensure continued strong engagement across all Government Departments and agencies and to deal with any structural barriers and issues highlighted by the board. My Department is represented on the programme implementation board and remains actively involved with the work of the board and the local programme office. This work seeks to bring a transformational change to an area that has struggled with deprivation for many generations. Families have also been devastated by the impact of drugs and the accompanying and associated violence. First and foremost, the aim is to make the area safe for families living in the community and for people working there, supporting the work of the local gardaí with additional measures such as expanding CCTV coverage, refurbishing Fitzgibbon Street Garda station and targeting street dealing through a new dedicated outreach programme. The board is working with local employers to maximise employment opportunities for local people through small business and big new developments. This week, for example, a forum took place in the area with more than 20 local businesses to identify their skills needs that might be met from the local community. A new local two-week construction skills preparation course has led to local employment for 70% of the participants. Generating ambition and facilitating greater opportunities for young people is also vital. Big employers in the area have offered to provide work experience opportunities to people and the board is working with the local schools to ensure this happens. It is also important to improve the look and feel of the area to help build a sense of community pride and involvement. Working with Dublin City Council, the board has targeted a number of works. This has already delivered improvements to street lighting, railway bridges, road surfacing, shopfronts and derelict buildings. Another objective is to create an integrated system of local social services for vulnerable families and to support children. Analysis is being carried out on the existing service provision for children, young people and families. It is essential that the community knows what services are available and how to access them and that statutory and voluntary services work effectively together. Among other activities, Government has invested in restorative practice, youth leadership programmes and increased counselling for young people. I will continue to ensure that ministerial oversight and support of this initiative is provided through the Cabinet committee system.

Last week's murder of a man off North Strand Road, the fourteenth in the feud, has again brought into sharp focus the urgency of this work. This shooting took place in a densely populated part of the city already suffering significant and embedded social and economic challenges. Successive Governments have thus far failed to address and reverse the historical underinvestment that has led to these challenges, which is one of the reasons the board was set up. I am told the board is due to publish its 2017 report. I do not know whether the Taoiseach has any indication at this stage as to when the report will be published in order that the public can get a full look at the progress to date and its commitments to work into the future, as well as the Taoiseach's own commitment. Will the Taoiseach revisit the north-east inner city strategy and review the outcomes to date of the Mulvey report recommendations to ensure they are fit for purpose and flexible enough to deal with outstanding issues? On a separate but connected point, has consideration been given to replicate this model and this approach on the south side of the city, another area affected by part of this ongoing feud and a very similar area in terms of its make-up and lack of investment? Will the Taoiseach consider this? I only received last week figures relating to the number of gardaí in one of these inner city areas. The commitment is there to address this matter, but there are 47 fewer gardaí in Kevin Street Garda station than there were in 2010, half the number of inspectors and six fewer sergeants. An urgency is needed not just in respect of the board, but right across all the areas and agencies that are feeding into the implementation board.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	I, too, commend the progress that has been made because I know there was a genuine cross-party, all-of-House view that this task force had to succeed and that all necessary resources should be committed on an ongoing basis and beyond the length of any particular Dáil in order that we might make social change a reality for a community that has suffered a great deal. However, it is true to say the ongoing Hutch-Kinahan fued, so-called, is an extraordinary problem overshadowing potential progress. To quote the chair of the programme implementation board, Michael Stone, "I have... met with many people who are just trying to get on with their lives and whose wish it is to live in a safe environment with decent opportunities for them and their families." It is extraordinary and quite shocking that a family is being targeted to the point of extinction. I would welcome a particular response regarding the determination of Government to tackle what is the most serious criminal issue affecting any community in this country. As I said, I am very aware of the significant progress made to date by An Garda Síochána and I hope all resources will be made available to it to bring its endeavours to a successful conclusion. I wish to raise one other point on a more positive side of this matter. I read that a proposal has been floated to establish a Riverdance academy and cultural centre in the north inner city. I do not know whether the Taoiseach is familiar with it. It is being promoted by the creators of Riverdance, Moya Doherty and John McColgan. I know they have had meetings with the north inner city task force. It would be such a positive thing in the north inner city to have established there a cultural centre with such international acclaim. Has the Taoiseach had sight of any proposals in this regard, and would he support any proposals to achieve this?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	293	The problems and issues that have emerged in the Dublin north inner city area reflect the criminal manifestation, with the appalling murders of so many people, and it has had an impact on the community, families and particularly young people. There is a prevalence of gangs who influence the behaviours of young people and perhaps affect their subsequent performance in school and school completion. In the past I asked for an assurance that the money being directed to the much needed projects in the north-east inner city would not be taken from other areas with significant needs, in other words that additional funding would be provided over and above the baseline funding. How much of the investment is new investment over and above the baseline? The deeper problem remains the decision to scrap local development activities, which were having a big impact. When I met the organisations more than a year ago they made the point that much of the infrastructure that had been built up in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with regard to community-based activities and area task forces, got disbanded. Research shows that targeted disadvantaged initiatives can have a big impact. We did introduce quite a number of them and they had an impact on literacy levels, numeracy levels and school retention. They worked best when linked to wider local development programmes at the time. The time has long arrived when we should empower new local task force structures to plan and tackle issues in our most disadvantaged communities. The centralisation and politicisation of the area is not working. It should not take major outbreaks of violence, such as those we have witnessed in the past year or two, for locally-led development planning to return. It is not just in the north inner city. It is in many disadvantaged communities throughout the country where, in many respects, the foundations put in were taken away too quickly. There was a political element to this back in 2011 and 2012, when certain politicians who came in felt there were too many people on these boards and local development groups whose political colour they did not like. I do not mean Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party. We heard references from people. The then Minister, Phil Hogan, in particular, had a bee in his bonnet about this, which is why the Leader project in rural Ireland was undermined. The same thing happened with local drug task forces and area development committees. A lot of damage was done and we are beginning to see some of the outcomes of this. We need to go back to the tried and trusted models that did work but that need consistency and sustainability over a long period of time.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	294	I echo the remarks of Deputy Howlin on the violence that has occurred in the north-east inner city and share his concern and horror at what has been going on in an attempt to eliminate an entire family. The people of the north-east inner city, like everyone else, just want to be able to live their lives and go to school, college and work and do not deserve to have this level of violence on their doorstep. In terms of recent investment, €21 million is being invested in the St. Mary's Mansions project, which is a great example of inner-city regeneration. There is a permanent Garda presence through the emergency response unit, and it engages regularly with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, who is a Deputy for the area as well as being the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform. A new community employment scheme has been established, which is specially targeting hard to reach unemployed people in the north-east inner city. As people are aware, there is a project board under the chairmanship of Michael Stone. There are no proposals at present to replicate this in any other neighbourhoods and it would be too soon to do so. We need the board to focus on getting the work done, and when it is done we can do an assessment as to whether it was effective, to what extent it was effective and what worked and what did not work. Only then would it be appropriate to consider whether it is a good idea to extend the same approach to other areas. I had the opportunity to visit the area in my official capacity as Taoiseach on three occasions in recent months and many times in my personal capacity being from not too far from there. I intend to pay another visit towards the end of this month. The structures include the north-east inner city programme implementation board, four subgroups, the north-east inner city programme office and community consultative events. The programme office has been established in the area and commenced work on a number of actions. As part of the process the board has established four dedicated subgroups dealing with crime and policing, maximising educational opportunities, training and employment opportunities and an integrated system of social services, and improvements to the physical infrastructure in the area. The first in a series of planned community events took place in October to ensure wider community involvement, participation and feedback on the various aspects of the initiative. With regard to funding, approximately €5 million was invested in 2016. This included an investment of €1 million in sports facilities and projects, €700,000 on local community projects targeting children and youth, €100,000 on drug-related projects and €3 million on physical improvement works, including roads, housing areas, parks lighting and refurbishment of the Sean McDermott swimming pool. The €22.5 million provided in 2017 was allocated to projects across four priority areas, which are those I mentioned earlier. These include CCTV, the construction skills course that I mentioned earlier and grants to local projects. This year, funding has been provided through the Minister, Deputy Ring, under the RAPID subhead, on the same basis as the previous year. This will provide an extra €2.5 million in capital and current funding being allocated to the board, including a pilot social employment scheme. It is fair to say some of this is money that might have been spent in any case had the board not been set up, but some of it is additional. I am not able to give an exact breakdown.

Following an invitation from Professor Klaus Schwab, I attended the 2018 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos from 24 to 26 January. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Pascal Donohoe, also attended as an invitee. This was my first time to participate in the annual meeting, the theme of which was creating a shared future in a fractured world.  I undertook a number of engagements and meetings during the visit to promote Ireland's international interests, in particular as a location for business and investment and to highlight Ireland’s place as an island at the centre of the world and at the heart of Europe. Throughout my visit, during my scheduled meetings with companies, my participation in formal World Economic Forum events and in a series of informal contacts, I discussed a range of important policy challenges for Ireland, the EU and the world. These included climate change, sustainable development, immigration, defence, security, international trade and taxation, as well as Ireland's perspective on Brexit and the future of Europe.  I attended an event hosted by Bill and Melinda Gates, which focused on the sustainable development goals, including issues such as gender equality, health promotion and poverty eradication. The guest of honour at that event was Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel prize winner and advocate for the education of women and girls. I had a number of pre-scheduled bilateral meetings with senior executives from multinational high-tech, pharmaceutical and financial services firms which between them employ over 12,000 people in Ireland, ranging from Facebook to Coca-Cola. Each of these companies was interested in Ireland’s perspective on Brexit and other global developments such as trade and international taxation, as well, of course, as providing me with an update on their operations in Ireland. On Thursday evening, I spoke at an IDA Ireland dinner for 60 senior executives of existing and prospective foreign direct investment client companies, which between them employ over 36,000 people in Ireland and 2.3 million globally. At the bilateral meetings and during the IDA dinner, I emphasised the strengths that underline Ireland's success in attracting foreign direct investment, which are talent, track record and our stable, transparent and competitive corporation tax regime. I also participated in two of the World Economic Forum’s formal events, including a panel discussion entitled "New Momentum for Europe" alongside the Prime Minister of Portugal, Mr. Costa, and the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Rutte, as well as a lunch event with political, academic and business leaders. Both events provided opportunities to outline Ireland's perspectives. The annual meeting is also an opportunity to engage on an impromptu basis with many people in leadership positions in politics, international development, civic society and business. Among others, I met informally with the Slovenian Prime Minister, Miro Cerar, President Macri of Argentina, Michel Barnier, former British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, Kofi Annan and Denis O’Brien. I also attended US President Trump's speech to close the meeting. Davos provides an exceptional opportunity to engage with the international press and highlight Ireland’s strengths as a location for inward investment.I undertook several media engagements with Irish and international media, including Bloomberg, Reuters, BBC and CNN. As is the case with all travel, my officials ensured that the costs were minimised and the best value for money pursued. The final cost for the visit and the delegation of six is not yet available, but full details will be published on my Department's website in early course. I am satisfied that my attendance at Davos was worthwhile, given the opportunities it offers to engage with so many decision makers, as well as supporting Industrial Development Agency, IDA, Ireland in its role in promoting the country as a location for investment.

During statements on the EU in the Dáil, he said it was important to remain vigilant to ensure that the commitments entered into in December's agreement would be delivered in full. Then, at the World Economic Forum at Davos, he reminded the British that commitments entered into in December on avoiding a hard border would be adhered to. The Taoiseach would appear to have significant concerns about the preparedness of the British to deliver on their commitments. That is a concern I am sure many of us share, especially given the litany of broken promises around the Good Friday Agreement. Has the Taoiseach sought additional assurances or guarantees from the British Government that this will not happen? Much of our economic future could be influenced by the decisions of the British and the EU and their approach to Brexit. While at Davos, the Taoiseach also called for a Norway-plus deal for Britain. It is clear from Michel Barnier's remarks in London that the EU still does not know what sort of relationship the British want with the EU after Brexit. Has either the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, spoken to either the British or to our EU partners on this proposed Norway-plus model? Can the Taoiseach share with us any responses that have been received? Is this approach supported by Michel Barnier? Has the Taoiseach acknowledged that his proposal would have to be a specific arrangement, as there is no precedent for this kind of relationship? The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement between the EU and Canada reduces tariffs but does little in the way of services. The EU-Norway arrangement allows Norway virtually full access to the Single Market, but Norway still has to abide by all EU rules and pay into the EU budget which, to my knowledge, is not an approach that the British would accept. If it is possible for the EU to construct special arrangements with Canada, Norway, Greenland and other countries, why can the Government not push for the North to have special designated status within the EU as a way of avoiding a hard economic border? As the Taoiseach already knows, the commitments contained in the joint report on the Irish Border and agreed by the EU and UK in December are due to be transposed into binding legal documents in the coming weeks. In this way, these commitments will be embedded in the withdrawal treatment covering Britain's departure from the EU next March. What steps is the Government taking to ensure that there is absolutely no ambiguity regarding the North in this codified text?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	298	The annual gathering at Davos, as a gathering of the world's global corporate and billionaire elite, always brings into fairly sharp focus the ever-growing, shocking and obscene levels of wealth inequality in our world. This year, Oxfam reported that the richest 1% have the same amount of wealth as 82% of the remainder of the world's population. It also pointed out there are now 2,000 billionaires and that their wealth increased by €762 billion last year. I repeat, that figure is their increase in wealth in one year. It is enough to wipe out global poverty seven times over. That is shocking and obscene enough. However, what is really shocking is that even this global elite hauled our Government and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, over the coals and slated them during a debate on corporate taxation and the role that tax evasion by the world's biggest multinationals plays in creating a race to the bottom which leads directly to that obscene and growing level of inequality. We were slated. Our reputation is in shreds. Joseph Stiglitz, CEOs and politicians from this global elite pointed the finger, rightly in my opinion, at Ireland, for its disgraceful role in spearheading the race to the bottom in respect of corporate tax. The position is such that 13 of the top 100 companies in Ireland pay an effective tax rate of less than 1%. In the case of Apple, the figure is 0.2%. We do nothing about this. Rather, we go to bat with Apple to defend its right not to pay €13 billion in tax and then claim that we are trying to address this problem as part of a global solution. Even the global elite does not believe us. Its members are slating us and our reputation is in shreds. Are they not right that Ireland has played a really rotten role in leading a global race to the bottom in respect of corporate tax and contributing to the shocking and obscene levels of wealth inequality in the world?

The Davos event is one which Taoisigh have been attending for 20 years. Over this time, the hype has escalated but the actual output is becoming less and less clear. It has become more and more of a repetitive ritual. It is necessary, but I am not sure that it changes a whole lot when it comes to global policy or the evolution thereof. Every year, the Taoiseach of the day meets a particular list of investors and does interviews with a particular list of news channels. It is important that, as a country, we do this. We have to be there. However, it is certainly reasonable to question the degree of attention paid to it and evaluate the outcomes more objectively than we have been doing to date. The issue of taxation, including proposals for digital taxation, arose on a number of occasions. Has the Government conducted or requested a specific impact study on such an initiative? I have asked about this before and I would be grateful for an answer. I know that the Taoiseach attended a session with Bill and Melinda Gates of the Gates Foundation. At the end of his reply, the Taoiseach indicated that he met a number of individuals. Did he meet those whose names he read out collectively or separately? What was the subject matter of the conversations where Ireland is concerned and, indeed, generally? Finally, I make the point that the Ireland is a small country. Its industrial policy from the late 1960s, based on open access to free markets, has fundamentally altered the trajectory of our economic development since that decade, when Taoiseach Seán Lemass began the opening up of our country. It seems that those who are advocating that we unilaterally change course have an obligation to come up with an alternative model, one that would have similar outcomes for the historic development of industry, both multinational and indigenous. We can certainly do better on the indigenous side. However, there is no doubt that no matter how many people find them disturbing, the policies - tax policies et alia - have had an impact on this country, to the benefit of many working people here. Many of the other countries who are complaining are themselves quite adept at organising situations whereby they gain advantage, in their national interest and in the interests of their citizens. I believe in a global approach to this. The global corporations have to pay more, and I would have much preferred it if the global elite did not turn on Ireland, but rather the corporations turned on themselves, and asked themselves some basic questions about what they can contribute globally. That is not restricted to their charitable foundations, and some of them have very good charitable foundations. Rather, this concerns the ways in which governments and the global corporations interact, in a globalised world which is different to that of previous decades.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	308	We get some of that in Tallaght. Not like in Davos though. The event consists of politicians prostrating themselves before the economic elite, doing business deals and demonstrating that they are safe pairs of hands for capitalism.In that respect, I am interested in what the Taoiseach discussed at the impromptu meeting he had with our 1%, Mr. Denis O'Brien, who was not there for no reason. He was there for economic reasons and to maximise profit through political influence. I return to the Oxfam report raised by Deputy Boyd Barrett. Has the Taoiseach read the report or the summary of it? How does he feel about a world that is so racked with inequality? In the last year, the top 1% got 82% of all the wealth generated and the bottom 50%, or 3.7 billion people, got nothing. There are over 2,000 billionaires, with two being created each day. Oxfam calculates that two thirds of those billionaires' wealth is the product of inheritance, monopoly and cronyism. How does the Taoiseach feel about the role Ireland plays in deepening inequality? That was exposed by what Joseph Stiglitz said at Davos on the role Ireland plays in a race to the bottom in terms of corporate tax, both in the headline rate and the effective rate. In 1980, total corporation profits were approximately €2 billion. They are approximately €7.5 billion now but the total amount of tax paid by corporations has only slightly increased. The responsibility for that lies with countries like Ireland which engage in tax haven behaviour and a race to the bottom in a programme of so-called tax competition, where the only winners are the big multinationals and the losers are public services in this country and in developing countries.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	309	With regard to the Taoiseach's visit, or should I say pilgrimage, to Davos, can he give a picture of his discussions on taxation and international tax regimes, particularly as regards the changes in US corporation tax, the fact that there is a major effort by the administration in the United States to repatriate profits to the US and the implications of that, if any? The Taoiseach reported that he met the heads of significant US corporations, many of which are major employers in Ireland employing hundreds of thousands of people. What is his impression of the new US corporation tax system and its likely impact on Ireland over the next few years? Second, I note that the Taoiseach had a meeting with Sheryl Sandberg, the boss of Facebook. One of the great changes in the democratic world over recent years has been the Trump-speak on social media coming from both the right and the ultra left, with personal trolling of many people involved in democratic politics. I do not believe Facebook is doing enough of what it has the capacity to do to try to reduce this destructive speech about democracies, both in Ireland and across the world. Extremes are being given free platforms by the social media companies. Can the Taoiseach tell us about his discussions with Ms Sandberg? We see the explanations in terms of hiring more people to monitor the hate speech, but there is a great deal of such speech, including in Ireland. It is extremely destructive, particularly for younger people, but also for the people who are doing this for the extremes of the right and the left. Did the Taoiseach manage to discuss that? The great German writer, Thomas Mann, used to write about people going to the Alps in the 19th century to find cures for tuberculosis, TB. Now it appears there are pilgrimages by leaders of democratic countries to seek some type of fortune from the über leaders of capitalism in its most modern forms, who have made extraordinary fortunes. Did the Taoiseach discuss with them the possibility of introducing a global financial transactions tax - it would have to be done on a global basis - so some of their profits can be redistributed to people across the world, particularly in less well off countries?

Has anything changed in the last ten years? Has the business model or economic model changed in any way? Have we learned anything from that crash? There appears to be a stock market bubble again and there is a property bubble in this country. Economic growth across the world is booming and the planet is cooking. Inequality was mentioned earlier. Has anything changed? Does the Taoiseach think we should have a slightly different message about what economics could and should be or what business model we wish to follow? Have we changed? Has anything been learned from the crash?

We are not negotiating bilaterally. The European Union and the United Kingdom are currently beginning negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and the transition period. Our objective is to ensure that the commitments and guarantees given in December are fully reflected in the withdrawal agreement, which is legally binding. In addition, we support a transition period of up to two years. That will give Irish people and Irish businesses a chance to adapt to any permanent changes that might take place as a result of Brexit. I did not call for a Norway plus plus model. I might have been reported in that way, but that is not what I said. I said that the UK-EU relationship is likely to be something different from the existing relationships. Norway is a small country and is not comparable with the United Kingdom. Canada might be a large country but it is on a different continent. Any new relationship between the UK and the EU is likely to be a bespoke one. It might have some similarities with other arrangements, but will not be identical to any of them. The UK Government's sub-committee on Brexit is meeting today and tomorrow to decide what future relationship it wants the UK to have with the European Union. I look forward to any clarity the UK Government can give us on what relationship it would like to have in the future. Davos is a very interesting gathering of political and business leaders. In addition, and I did not expect this, many of the people there were from the NGO sector and were activists. The first event I attended was a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation event at which the main speaker was Malala Yousafzai. I had a chance to speak with her. She is a major advocate for education for women and girls. Just last week the Government decided to double its commitment to the Global Partnership for Education, investing more in the education of girls and women around the world. We know this is a very effective anti-poverty and anti-radicalism measure. It was a pleasure to hear from her and to meet her. One of the main speakers at the lunch the next day was the executive director of Greenpeace. The One Foundation was represented there as well. I did not know that Greenpeace, the One Foundation and Nobel laureates formed part of the global elite, but if they do I am glad they were present and had an opportunity to engage with the business and political leaders who were also there. Deputy Martin is correct that it probably is over-hyped. It is definitely not a luxurious gathering. However, it is very useful, if only because it allows one, over the course of two days, to have an enormous number of formal and informal bilateral meetings and meetings in groups with Heads of State and Government and with business leaders as well as interactions with the media. If one were to try to organise those in the normal course of one's diary it would take many months to do so. The fact that everybody is gathered in the same location and that it works on a strict 29-minute meeting format allows one to do a huge amount that would otherwise take a very long time. For that reason alone, it is useful to attend it. An interesting point made during some of my engagements, in particular with NGOs, is the extent to which we are making enormous progress in meeting sustainable development goals and that the doom and gloom about the world is not borne out when one examines the facts and the progress we are making towards those goals. For example, the proportion of the world population who suffer from extreme poverty is rapidly falling. Some interesting information was produced on that issue. Measures being taken such as action against disease, whether HIV, vaccine programmes or the elimination of polio and smallpox, life expectancy and access to literacy and education are going in the right direction globally. It is a hard truth to hear for the hard left but it is interesting that groups such as international NGOs or the UN are pointing out the enormous progress being made in those areas and how much more we could do with additional effort. That gives much hope for the future, shows that the world is going in the right direction and that the naysayers do not speak for those who work on the front line tackling inequality, disease, poverty in the third world and helping those who are trying to get access to education.

It is expanding and will take on a few hundred extra people, in particular in East Wall. We discussed how more could be done to protect social media users, particularly children. There was a discussion with the US companies present on their perspectives on the tax changes that have been made in the United States. They had mixed views in that regard. Most welcomed the reduction in corporation tax and that they can repatriate profits to the US but, as some pointed out, some companies are worse off as a result of the changes because of the elimination of many exemptions and reliefs, which I did not expect to hear. They do not think it will have any impact on investment in Ireland but it may make future investment more attractive in the US than is currently the case. I was not present for discussion of a financial transaction tax. The Department of Finance is working on an impact study on digital taxation but it is difficult to carry out an impact study when there is no clear or definite proposal as to how a digital tax may work. Neither the OECD nor the European Union have produced such a proposal. To carry out an impact analysis on a proposal that does not yet exist is quite difficult. A feature of a digital tax that does not make sense is that the tax be applied at the point of sale. We do not do so for other industries. To take cars as an example, huge numbers of cars are made by Volkswagen in Germany and Renault in France and the profits those companies make are taxed in France and Germany, not the countries in which the cars are sold. I do not see why one would tax profits at point of sale in the digital industry but in other industries one would do the reverse.

As part of the modernisation of Government communications there is greater use of social media. Four campaigns undertaken by the strategic communications unit in 2017 had an informational video component which was promoted on social media including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter at a total cost of €21,895. It is not possible at this stage to give an overall budget figure for social media. Spend in this area is dictated by the scale, frequency and nature of campaigns. The use of social media, as with all media, plays an important role in communicating to our citizens the work of the Government and the services to which they are entitled. For example, a video explaining the extension of optical and dental treatment benefits to the self employed was viewed 283,370 times. There has since been a significant increase in optical and dental treatment benefit uptake, with approximately 227,000 claims made in November and December 2017 and €15 million of benefit paid. The use of social media forms part of the unit's work on priority cross-Government initiatives that impact on the lives of citizens for the better. Its focus is to streamline communications by working with other Departments to deliver on priority cross-Government campaigns.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	I did not realise we spent so long on the previous questions. The Taoiseach gave a very lengthy answer to them. What is the social media budget of the Department of the Taoiseach? In a reply given yesterday by the Taoiseach on a similar issue, he denied that he had any knowledge of market research being conducted by his Department. According to the Official Report, he said, "if any market research has been done, I have not seen it". I have since checked the record and it confirmed that on 22 November he had full knowledge of that research when he discussed it in the House. He was aware of its approach and gave a commitment at the time that it would be published and made available. According to the Supplementary Estimate he sought for his Department, the research was due to be paid for last year. Journalists were informed that the strategic communications unit made a presentation to Cabinet the week after the Dáil rose for Christmas. Why would the Taoiseach deny knowledge of something he had already discussed in detail and why was he so eager to distance himself from a unit he established, the head of which he chooses and for which he got €5 million to spend? The Taoiseach likes to present an image of candour during questions in the Dáil but this shows a very different approach. I remind him that he and the Secretary General of his Department justified this market research by saying it was designed to shape the Government's new advertising campaigns. These campaigns are under way but the promised publication of the research, which was to be the background to any campaign being initiated, has not occurred. When will that be done?  I am not against the Taoiseach using social media and nor is anyone else. The issue is whether public money is being used to promote the political work of the Taoiseach. He and his Secretary General assured Members that the public money being diverted to pay for advertising would solely address public information, which is the right thing to do. Promoting speeches and statements by the Taoiseach represents an unprecedented abuse of public money. I ask the Taoiseach to give us an assurance that he will instruct that no money is to be spent on advertising that does not clearly and solely concern objective public information.

Has an extra allocation of €900,000 been made to the Department of the Taoiseach for additional staff in the context of this communications campaign in addition to the €5 million added in the budget for this year? If one adds in the additional social media spend that the Taoiseach identified in terms of use of social media for messages and so on, it appears that it will now cost a minimum of €6 million this year to fund this unit which seems to many Members to be doing the kind of political messages for which political parties receive a political party and leader's allowance separate from administering Departments and the Government as a whole.

However, like Deputies Burton and Micheál Martin, the establishment of the strategic communications unit has raised questions for me about the use of spin over substance. What steps has the Taoiseach taken to ensure that the role of the strategic communications unit, including the increased use of social media, is open and transparent and that it is not used as a propaganda tool for the benefit of a political party or parties that are in government?

It is very much under the control of the Secretary General of my Department and the director of the unit. With regard to the specific point raised by Deputy Micheál Martin, I must have forgotten about it. I would not have put something on the record of the Dáil in November only to then deliberately seek to tell mistruths about it.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	328	I am bringing this matter to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, because a number of people in the film and theatre sector have raised with me the ongoing issue of the Garda vetting system's interaction with short-term arts projects. When efforts are being made to protect children who are involved in film and television productions, which often involve four-day or five-day projects, it is almost impossible to secure a vetting record at short notice. The managers and producers of shows in which children are involved as participants and as audience members have an obligation to ensure those children are protected. As the Minister of State will be aware, the nature of the culture, arts and entertainment business means that participants can drop out of a show and be substituted at short notice. I would like to put a question that has been raised with me to the Minister of State. How do directors and producers discharge their duties under the Children First Act 2015? I know he has said that the Garda National Vetting Bureau has a turnaround of approximately five days. I think we are all aware of the discussion that has taken place about this industry in the context of the revelations that have emerged in the Weinstein case and in other cases. Issues can arise when children are part of these productions. In some cases, this activity is extremely well organised and regulated. In other cases, particularly smaller productions featuring people at the start of their careers, there is no real structure that makes information and support available to those who are seeking to comply with child safety and protection requirements. I would like to hear from the Minister of State about the supports that are available to people in the arts, film and culture sector generally so that their organisations can know in advance what they need to do to ensure children working with them on various artistic projects - in film and theatre, for example - are safe. I have been informed that in a number of instances, producers have discovered after a short show, performance or project lasting less than a week that a performer or participant may have been known to the Garda. It is obvious that such a person would not be suitable to work with children. This is a very serious problem, although I am not aware of any serious incidents to date. I know there has been a tradition of guardians or chaperones working with children, particularly on bigger productions. Very often, one or both parents or a close relative is on site while a child participates in a particular performance, film or project. That is very good. People doing smaller productions or short projects do not seem to have an easy pathway to the Garda National Vetting Bureau. That is why I am asking the Minister of State to take this significant issue on board. Many people who work in this sector are very anxious to ensure children who are involved in it are properly protected.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan. I thank Deputy Burton for raising this important and interesting issue. As we all know, vetting in respect of certain employment is carried out by An Garda Síochána, primarily in accordance with the provisions of the National Vetting Bureau (Children and Vulnerable Persons) Act 2012. As the Deputy will appreciate, the primary purpose of these vetting arrangements is to seek to enhance the safety of children and vulnerable adults. In the previous Dáil, I was the Chairman of the committee that did pre-legislative scrutiny of this legislation. It was very interesting to see how it was supposed to operate. Vetting is vital work that must be carried out rigorously. In accordance with the 2012 Act, registered organisations must obtain vetting for people seeking employment and volunteers, where the relevant work or activities of the position sought involves regular access to children or vulnerable adults. It is important to highlight that the meaning of "relevant work" in the context of the Act covers "any work or activity which is carried out by a person, a necessary and regular part of which consists mainly of the person having access to, or contact with, children". The protection of children and vulnerable people is of the utmost importance. The Deputy has mentioned recent issues that have been highlighted in the press and elsewhere. Strict and sector-specific vetting requirements are set out in the 2012 Act, which details the various facilities, establishments and situations in which an individual carrying out relevant work, as defined in the Act, would require Garda vetting. The Deputy has asked specifically about the need to screen all staff who may come into contact with children in the arts and culture sector. The 2012 Act provides for a general obligation in the case of staff members for whom a necessary and regular part of their work consists mainly of their having access to children. I ask the Deputy to note that the Act includes as "relevant work" the provision of cultural activities to children, unless that "is merely incidental to the provision of" those activities to adults. For example, a person organising a one-off family arts event would not require Garda vetting, but a person employed to run a series of art workshops for children would need to be vetted. A question frequently arises about the duplication of vetting. This is of interest in the arts and culture sector, in which an individual may provide a service to several organisations. The Act provides for a degree of flexibility, which helps to decrease the administrative burden for relevant organisations. The 2012 Act provides for certain limited circumstances in which organisations can share a single vetting disclosure if this is agreed to by the vetting applicant. It also makes specific provision in respect of people who may be employed on a recurring but non-continuous basis. Having said that, we must always be careful to ensure vetting disclosures are up to date to take account of the most recently available information. The Garda authorities continue to engage with registered organisations to maintain standards and promote best practice in vetting.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	330	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.Is the Minister of State satisfied? In a certain sense, responsibility for this area really lies with the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and my original question was, in fact, to that Department although the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is answering it. I do not have a problem with that. Say a young person has just recently started his or her professional work having graduated from college and is now a film maker, is putting on shows or whatever. Inevitably, as an arts worker, that person is highly likely to be self-employed over a lengthy period. I am not aware that there is any general strong system of information that would seek to make him or her aware of responsibilities under the vetting legislation, for example in any curriculum of any third level college. People might start out, for instance, doing small productions, small films and so on. I think it really is necessary to have a system of strong communication. I know the Arts Council seeks to have general information for arts organisations in respect of their obligations over a range of things including, for instance, bullying and harassment. We have unfortunately heard of those kinds of cases in recent times in the Irish theatre. Would the Minister consider putting a broader campaign in place to advise parents whose children may become involved in this area? It is a very exciting thing for a child or maybe for the parent to do, to be involved in film and the arts. Particularly in the context of the Government spending a lot of money on strategic communications there ought to be plenty of budget available to do this.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	331	I will certainly pass on that particular comment to my colleague, the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. I am sure she will be interested in taking it on board. Obviously it is important that any information we can get out there should be put out there. In general terms, the processing system as we know it is working well. The vetting system is working well and the Garda authorities have said that the vast majority of vetting applications - in excess of 80% - are processed by the National Vetting Bureau in five working days, as the Deputy has said, or even fewer. This represents a very significant improvement in turnaround times in recent years. In mid 2013, an application for Garda vetting took an average of 14 weeks, as we can all recall. This improvement has come about because of the huge investment by Government and the Garda authorities in providing this service, including an increase of over 80% in staffing levels and the roll-out in 2016 of the eVetting system. The online processing of applications has streamlined the vetting process enormously and the eVetting system is available to all registered organisations. In certain circumstances, processing times for a given application can be longer, for example when additional inquiries may be needed or where there are errors in the application and so on. Delays can also occur in other aspects of the application process which are outside the control of the Garda authorities. I emphasise that the vetting process demands rigorous procedures to safeguard its integrity and to maintain the highest level of confidence by the public and organisations availing of the service. It is a very important service, as I am sure we all agree. The Deputy's main point is that more people need to be aware of their obligations under that service. I will certainly convey that request and the Deputy's message back to my colleagues.

The drug Vimizim is produced by BioMarin in its manufacturing operations in Shanbally, Co. Cork. It has been granted market authorisation in many countries worldwide for treatment of Morquio A syndrome. This is a rare, degenerative, potentially life threatening genetic condition that affects major organ systems in the body. It can substantially limit the quality of life of those affected and patients rarely live beyond the second or third decade of life. This drug, Vimizim, is the first and only enzyme replacement therapy designed to target the underlying cause of this disease, which currently affects only ten known patients in Ireland. As my colleague has said, one of these patients is an 11 year-old girl from my constituency, Carlow-Kilkenny, who has battled bravely to lead a robust and fun filled life despite this challenging medical condition. This little girl’s family were delighted when their daughter was one of two Irish children included in the trials for Vimizim which began in September 2011. I want to read a previous statement from her mother, who is in the Gallery, into the record:This is a progressive and damaging condition. I don't know how she will be without the medicine. It gives her stamina and energy and it is our only chance for her.Unfortunately this brave young girl could lose her access to this drug very shortly. The voluntary drug supply that has been given to her is being withdrawn next Friday. From next Friday, this child will not have this drug that has given her the quality of life of the last couple of years. The HSE drugs group has denied a number of applications for reimbursement. It has denied it twice so far. BioMarin submitted an application for reimbursement to the HSE in 2015. On 15 June 2017 it received a letter from the HSE confirming the decision not to reimburse the drug Vimizim in Ireland. The decision not to reimburse the drug on the grounds of insufficient clinical data and lack of value for money is surprising, given the nature of rare disease medicines and the acceptance of these in other countries. BioMarin met with the HSE again in July 2017 and resubmitted additional evidence and a new commercial offering for consideration at the HSE drugs group meeting on 18 September 2017. On 13 November 2017 while attending the HSE on another matter, BioMarin was informed that the HSE would not reimburse Vimizim for Irish patients. That was the second time. The negative feedback from the HSE for a second time was particularly unfortunate, given that the drug is currently available to children and adults with Morquio A syndrome in many countries following an assessment of the very same data. The drug is currently commercially available to patients in the United Kingdom, our next door neighbours, Northern Ireland which is joined to us, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, the Czech Republic, Hungary, countries in the Middle East, the Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, and the United States. BioMarin requested a meeting with the HSE again in December 2017 and agreed to submit a new application, which was due to be discussed at the HSE drugs group meeting on 18 January 2018, just a couple of weeks ago. However, since this date they have had no communication from the drugs group, which leaves both patients and the company in the dark as to whether the drug will be reimbursed or not. We understand from parliamentary questions, of which I submitted many, however, that the drug was discussed at this meeting. I know very well the Minister of State will state that responsibility for decisions on reimbursement is solely that of the HSE drugs group and he is bound by legislation not to intervene. Surely the Minister can contact the HSE drugs group directly on behalf of the young people who are here today, their families and the other eight known Irish people with this condition and demand that they urgently report on their most recent meeting of 18 January.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	335	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. It was raised this morning as well during Leaders Questions. I acknowledge the people in the Gallery who have more than a passing interest in this serious issue and in ensuring that we get a satisfactory outcome. Securing access to new and innovative medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Minister for Health and the Health Service Executive. However, these new products are often very expensive, with significant potential impact on the health service budget. The Oireachtas has put in place a robust legal framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. The Act specifies the criteria to be applied in the making of reimbursement decisions which include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE. In reaching its decision, the HSE will examine all the relevant evidence and will take into account such expert opinions and recommendations as are appropriate including from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE.This ensures that reimbursement decisions are made on objective scientific and economic grounds. The HSE has advised the Department that, following an intensive process, it has decided not to reimburse Vimizim, which is for the treatment of Morquio A syndrome. I appreciate that this condition is a serious one and that the families of children diagnosed with this illness are extremely anxious to obtain any treatment which they believe will alleviate its symptoms. The HSE drugs group, which reviewed the effectiveness of the drug, did not consider the evidence for its clinical benefit to be sufficiently strong in the context of the proposed cost and budget impact. The applicant company was notified on 7 November 2017 of the HSE’s decision not to add Vimizim to its reimbursement list. The HSE advised the company that it would be open to reviewing any additional clinical evidence if this becomes available. The company submitted a new application for reimbursement in December 2017. This was discussed at the January 2018 drugs group meeting and will be considered further by the HSE leadership in the coming weeks.
#BobbyAylward	unknown-#BobbyAylward-party	unknown-#BobbyAylward-dob	unknown-#BobbyAylward-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	336	The HSE drugs group, in its decision not to reimburse Vimizim, has on both occasions stated that there is a lack of clinical evidence on the effectiveness of the drug. They have acknowledged that the budget impact to cover the cost was relatively low. The drugs group itself agreed that cost was not an issue. When we talk about drugs we worry mostly about the cost. The drug is available in most of the European Union, including Northern Ireland, our neighbours, and is actually manufactured in Ireland. The manufacturing company applied again to the HSE drug group with new evidence late last year after the drug was rejected at the September meeting. This evidence was largely from the managed access agreement that the company are running in the UK, which the UK accepted. If the clinical evidence has proven acceptable in other countries and the HSE has acknowledged that the cost is not the primary barrier to reimbursement, then the drug should be made available to those who need it. In respect of the cost, there are figures in the public domain which indicate a very high costing for the use of the drug per patient. These figures are factually incorrect as we are dealing with a weight-based drug, which means that the publicly quoted amount is substantially higher than what the price per patient would be because they are small and the weight per patient means less cost. It is also worth bearing in mind that in the decision not to reimburse the drug the cost was not cited as a significant factor in the decision.  In respect of the managed access agreement, BioMarin has an arrangement in the UK with the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the NHS and the patient group where patients who suffer from Morquio A syndrome sign a contract which states they must attend all medical sessions and that, if after a year the medical records note that there has not been an improvement in their circumstances, they agree to come off the drug. In England, if the drug does not work, there is an agreement to stop using it if it is not having any effect. This has the benefit of ensuring that patients who do benefit from the drug can use it and that those who do not discontinue treatment, ultimately ensuring that the costs associated with the drug are solely associated with those patients who benefit from the drug. Clinicians who currently work in this space in Ireland have drawn up a similar guideline in Ireland and the patients are also willing to engage on this basis going forward.  In respect of the HSE drugs group challenges, the decision-making process is non-transparent which leaves the patients and the pharmaceutical company in the dark. The current nature of the drugs reimbursement process as a whole is unsustainable. There are problems associated with the quality adjusted life year based analysis for rare and orphan drugs.  There are two little girls looking down on the Minister of State here today. Next Friday, they will not have this drug, which has helped them over the past four years. Will the Minister of State please, on humanitarian grounds, bring this issue back to the task force and explain the situation? It will involve only a small cost to the taxpayers of this country.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	I assure the Deputy that I take very seriously my responsibilities in the Department of Health. Indeed, the Deputy takes his responsibilities very seriously, which includes being a representative for his constituents, as indeed does Deputy Martin Kenny. The Deputy makes a very good case, and I certainly will convey the very well presented and well-felt feelings for the two girls, his constituents, who are affected by this. As the Deputy and the House will appreciate, neither I nor the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, can tell the Department or the HSE what drugs to okay and what drugs to reject. There is a process in place as a result of the Health (Pricing and Supply of Drugs) Act 2013 which was passed in this House. The criteria is now set in law. It is a strict criteria because we cannot have a situation where drug companies can charge the State, funded by the working and contributing classes of this country, any price they want. There is no magic pot out there. We have to have a structure and there has to be a system in place. While that system is in place, I appreciate that there is a lot of anxiety on the part of the families now. My Department has written to the HSE and asked it to ensure that the care of these two people is paramount in all considerations, and that they will be contacted and kept informed of any decisions and assisted in any way possible. I will redouble those efforts, on behalf of my Department, and convey that to the HSE today, and I can assure the Deputy of that on foot of his request. I cannot go any further and give any confirmation at this stage as to what drugs will or will not be reimbursed by the State.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	Tá mé buíoch gur roghnaíodh an t-ábhar seo, a bhaineann le seirbhísí máithreachais in Ospidéal na hOllscoile, Leitir Ceanainn. I am appalled to say that this is not the first time I have raised this issue in this House. I refer to the fact that we have a maternity theatre suite in Letterkenny University Hospital that has never been commissioned. Indeed, there was widespread public anger when Senator Pádraig MacLochlainn and I revealed to the people of Donegal that the bespoke facility constructed in 2000 as part of the redevelopment of the hospital's renal dialysis block has never been used. Incredibly, when we pressed the management of Letterkenny University Hospital to explain the rationale behind this at a meeting, we were told that it was a resource issue. The necessary staffing was never put in place, and other resources were never provided, so therefore the theatre was never commissioned. It is almost two decades since this facility was built. Before I spoke, I thought about the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who has to make a decision on this matter. He was 14 years of age when former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern announced the new theatre in Letterkenny University Hospital. He was probably entering secondary school. Today, he is the Minister for Health, and over that whole period not one mother has had the benefit of the use of that theatre, on which the taxpayers of Donegal and elsewhere spent a large amount of money to create. Why is this happening and when will it be put right? It is my view that the problem is down to sheer incompetence on the part of successive governments. At worst, it amounts to neglect of a part of the country which has been neglected time and time again by successive governments. That is shameful, and a dereliction of the duties of those governments towards the people of Donegal. In this instance, it is particularly a dereliction of their duties towards the women of Donegal.  It is a deplorable situation, but to make matters worse it comes at a time when the hospital continues to experience record-breaking levels of overcrowding. Letterkenny University Hospital has been in emergency status since before the start of this year. It has lengthening patient waiting lists. The hospital has four operational inpatient operating theatres at the moment, yet only three of them can be used all the time. The reason is that the fourth theatre is now used as the maternity theatre because the other maternity theatre, built 18 years ago, was never commissioned. This means the hospital is down to three full-time operating theatres. As a result of this, consultants tell us that they cannot get operating theatre time because one of the theatres is now used for emergency caesarean sections and so on. That means that of the five theatres we have in Donegal, only three are used on a full-time basis. That is not an effective use of resources, and it has been the case for the past 18 years. Ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Rialtas inniu. Cad é atá ag dul a tharlú i dtaobh an ospidéal seo? An bhfeicfimid an seomra seo ar feadh 18 bliain eile, nó an bhfuil Feidhmeannacht na Seirbhíse Sláinte agus an Rialtas chun pacáiste airgid a chur ar fáil sa dóigh is go dtig linn é seo a chur i gceart? It is unbelievable to think that, while lists grow in Donegal and demand for operations and procedures are at an all time high, the hospital has a purpose-built maternity theatre on site that has been lying idle since 2000. It takes up half of the entire floor it is situated on. To make things worse, a mother who is giving birth and who develops complications in the maternity suite, who should go next door to theatre for an emergency caesarean section, now has to be wheeled out of the maternity unit, through the halls, into a lift and taken to a different floor where the theatre she can be operated on is located.This is a campaign we are very committed to and, on behalf of the women of Donegal and the children yet to be born there, we are asking the Minister of State for action.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	Gabhaim mo bhuíochas leis an Teachta Doherty as ucht an ábhair thábhachtach seo a ardú. The Government is strongly committed to developing and improving services at Letterkenny University Hospital, as is evidenced by the significant level of investment in capital projects in recent years. These developments include a new state-of-the-art blood science laboratory in 2015, a new medical academy and a clinical skills laboratory, both of which opened in 2016. The Deputy will also be aware of the significant investment in the hospital following the flood in 2013. I should also note that further capital investment in the hospital is planned. I am advised that the obstetric theatre to which the Deputy refers was built in 2000 as part of a four-storey building encompassing day surgery, renal dialysis, medical on-call rooms, a maternity ward and maternity delivery rooms. I have also been advised that the delivery suite was opened in 2007 and has been operational since then, while, as noted by the Deputy, the maternity theatre has never been opened fully and is not currently in use. My understanding is that all emergency caesarean sections are performed in the hospital’s emergency theatre, while elective sections are carried out in the general theatres along with other surgical specialties. As the House will be aware, in recent years this Government has had a particular focus on the development and improvement of our maternity services. Since January 2016, Ireland’s first national maternity strategy has been published, as well as the HSE's national standards for bereavement care following pregnancy loss and perinatal death and the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, national standards for safer better maternity services. Such initiatives represent essential building blocks to provide a consistently safe and high quality maternity service. In January 2017, the national women and infants health programme was established in the HSE to lead the management, organisation and delivery of maternity, gynaecology and neonatal services, strengthening such services by bringing together work that is currently undertaken across primary, community and acute care. Last October, the programme published a detailed implementation plan for the phased implementation of the strategy. In that regard, additional development funding of €4.55 million will be provided to the programme in 2018 to implement the strategy and improve waiting times for gynaecology services. Maternity networks are currently being rolled out across hospitals groups. In that context, and in view of the issue raised by the Deputy on the disused maternity theatre at Letterkenny University Hospital, I will ask the national women and infants health programme to engage further with the Saolta University Health Care Group in order to identify its resource requirements for maternity services in the context of the implementation of the national maternity strategy.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	340	I welcome the Minister of State's commitment that he will ask the national women and infants health programme to engage with Saolta. We have met Saolta and the management of Letterkenny University Hospital. We have raised the matter with the Minister. We want to escalate this issue because we want delivery on it. Everyone will agree that it does not make sense to spend hundreds of thousands of euro constructing a purpose-built maternity theatre adjacent to the maternity suite and not use it. We can go back to the past about resource allocations and all the rest but we need to make sure we do the right thing. This issue does not just relate to maternity services. While the Minister of State will ask the national women and infants health programme to engage with Saolta in terms of maternity requirement, he should remember that for every day this theatre is not commissioned he is denying the people of Donegal another theatre because the fourth theatre is out of use. It has to be retained at all times for emergency caesarean sections. It cannot be used for inpatient procedures, therefore, it has a knock-on effect in the hospital at large. I emphasise that this is not just about doing the best for the women and the children of Donegal, it is also a way of alleviating the pressure in terms of waiting lists. We have hospital overcrowding yet there is a large space at Letterkenny University Hospital that has been lying empty for the past 18 years. I am convinced that the Minister of State understands this issue. I hope he does, and I hope this will add to the urgency in respect of it. There is a solution. We do not have to pay a fortune to build this theatre. It is already built. The equipment is in place but we need the staff now to support it. By doing what I propose, we will relieve pressure in other parts of the hospital, which is what we are supposed to be all about.

The Deputy makes a sensible, practical and reasonable argument on all fronts. I believe it is accepted across the House that that is the future. While we are grappling with so many issues in the health service, here is a solution. The role of Deputy Pearse Doherty and others in the House is to refocus, and that is what is missing here. We must refocus the energies and the efforts to utilise this space and, as the Deputy said, it is not just for the women, the children and the fathers of these children into the future. It is also for the well-being and health of the general population of Donegal - nothing to do with maternity services - because it will increase the throughput in the rest of Letterkenny General Hospital and allow many more procedures to be done and eliminate the waiting lists on which we spend so much time beating ourselves up over politically in this House in terms of trying to get to the bottom of them. It is eminently sensible. It is something that can be achieved. I thank the Deputy for raising it in the House as it affords us, as politicians, an opportunity to get our officials to go back to the HSE and work with the Saolta group to try to refocus efforts to get this commissioned and utilised today or sooner rather than later.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	342	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for selecting this issue. People who woke up yesterday morning, particularly those who rely on Irish Rail, and read the lead story by Paul Melia in the Irish Independent would be concerned and anxious about the potential closure of rail lines. The Taoiseach tried to downplay that yesterday and said the report was two years out of date. That is factually incorrect. This report was given to the Minister with updated data as of November 2017, albeit the third review of the Irish rail network. The Minister sought submissions for the review of the rail network two years ago and my party made one at that time. We have yet to have a meaningful debate in this House on the future of the Irish rail network. What we do know is that this year, Irish Rail is €43 million below what it needs to maintain the condition of the rail network. Certain rail routes are at absolute capacity; they are bursting at the seams, so to speak. The condition of certain rail tracks is impaired requiring reduced speeds, which means longer journey times. Earlier today, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister said he wants Irish Rail to be more efficient and more profitable. The simple truth of the matter is that we will not have any new carriages - additional capacity - in Irish Rail for a minimum of 18 months. I refer to the 28 reconditioned carriages that are due for delivery at the end of 2019. To date, funding has not been allocated to order new carriages and even if new carriages were ordered today, we would not see deliver until late 2022. There is insufficient funding for rail tracks. There has been investment in recent years, however, and the opening of the Phoenix Park tunnel in late 2016 demonstrates that where we provide an adequate service and connectivity, passengers will respond. How does the Minister intend to increase the revenue? How does he intend to increase the number of people using our train lines? How does he intend to reverse the disastrous decisions taken in recent years in terms of under-funding a critical piece of infrastructure? This morning, I was contacted by commuters on the Mullingar to Dublin line. There was no heating on the train despite the fact that the temperature outside was minus 2° Celsius. That will not encourage more people to use the service in question. First, can the Minister confirm that there will be no rail closures whatsoever? Can he confirm, here and now, how he intends to ensure that we can increase capacity, increase passenger numbers, reduce journey times and increase frequency to attract people to use Irish Rail? Second, another important point for Irish Rail is the tens of thousands of CIÉ pensioners who are facing huge uncertainty. My colleague, Deputy O'Dea, raised that issue with the Minister in December and was complimented by the Minister for bringing it to his attention.He was unable to give further answers at that time without engaging again with the board of CIÉ. What action has the Minister taken since and can he update the House in his reply as to how these people who paid into a defined pension scheme can have their legitimate expectations met by CIÉ?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	343	I thank Deputy Troy for raising this very important issue. He has asked me to address the report on the future of the rail network, which I intend to do. The rail review report was undertaken jointly by the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Iarnród Éireann and published in 2016. The NTA then held a public consultation on the published review. The purpose of the review was to look at the existing rail network, identify the funding required both to maintain the network and provide for necessary capital works, and to consider the gap in funding in that regard. The review also examined the potential of the rail network to meet the economic, environmental and social needs of the State in the future and discussed the importance of maintaining a rail network to support strategic sustainable growth in travel demand. The review highlighted the considerable amount of taxpayer support currently provided to the rail network and provided an overview of the estimated additional funding required to support the network over the period 2016 to 2021. While the review identified a funding gap for Irish Rail, which stood at approximately €100 million per annum at the time of publication, I am glad to note that since the report was published, the Government has announced significant additional funding for rail infrastructure and services. As such, the funding requirement is being addressed. Deputies will be aware that the Government and the taxpayer provide huge levels of support for public transport. Between 2008 and 2016, over €5 billion was made available to the three CIÉ companies across the public service obligation, PSO, and capital investment programmes. Of this, Iarnród Éireann received over €3.7 billion, or nearly 75% of the total Exchequer funding provided in the period. I have previously spoken to Members about how we are increasing our spending on public transport services. The PSO subvention increased in 2016 and 2017 and is increasing further this year. Over the three years, the PSO subvention will have increased by approximately 35% in total. In budget 2017 alone, we allocated over €50 million in additional funding to Irish Rail to bring total funding for that year to over €300 million. This significant increase allowed for greater investment in the maintenance and renewal of the network and rolling stock and provided more money for safety projects. On the capital side, we announced €2.7 billion of Exchequer investment in budget 2018 to invest in public transport infrastructure and facilities over the next four years. The new national development plan will be published shortly and is a ten-year capital plan that will prioritise key investment actions to protect the quality and value of the existing extensive transport networks and to progress new key capital public transport programmes over the period to 2027. The public consultation process held by the NTA following the publication of the review helped to begin an informed discussion on the current and future role of rail transport in Ireland. Over 300 submission were received in response to that consultation process. The NTA has prepared a report of those submissions, which it is currently updating to reflect the additional funding made available for rail infrastructure and services in budget 2018. Once I have received and reviewed the NTA's updated report on the consultation process, I intend to bring it to Government for consideration. As I have said previously, I have no plan regarding the closure of any part of the rail network. The Taoiseach also gave assurances in the Dáil yesterday that there are no plans in that regard. To conclude, the role and potential of rail is linked intrinsically to where people live, work and wish to travel. These very issues form the core of the Government's national planning framework, which is being finalised. The new national planning framework will form an important context for the consideration of issues raised by the rail review report and for any recommendations I may bring to Government in due course.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	I acknowledge the increase in funding in the past two years but the Minister must acknowledge that we are coming from a very low base. The plain fact is that this year, Irish Rail is €48 million below what it requires simply to stand still. The Minister referred to the review of the capital plan and what will happen over the next ten years, but what will happen here and now? What will happen those people who have seen new timetables for their services, which show increased journey times due to the condition of tracks that require trains to go slower? What will happen with rail carriages that are bursting at the seams? We will not have any further carriages until, at minimum, late 2019, if it is reconditioned carriages, or 2022 were new carriages to be ordered in the morning. The Minister is not answering that question. Funding is available in the Juncker plan, which is a point I have made to the Minister umpteen times at the Oireachtas transport committee, and CIÉ and the NTA should be making that investment in our rail network. The Minister referred to the national planning framework and he is right that we should be encouraging residential development along existing rail lines. We are not doing it, however, and in any event the existing lines lack any further capacity. What is happening here and now, not in ten years' time? The Minister failed even to acknowledge the point I made in the last minute and a half of my opening statement. It is a matter Deputy O'Dea raised with the Minister in December 2017. The Minister gave an undertaking to come back to the House having looked into the defined pension scheme for the tens of thousands of people who have paid into it and who have a legitimate expectation of a defined pension. I hope the Minister will take his two-minute reply to answer their concerns.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	345	I thank the Deputy for addressing these problems again and repeating what he had to say in the first place, partly, I suppose, because he feels I did not answer all of his questions. A lot of what the Deputy says is correct, but the CIÉ group, in particular Iarnród Éireann, is in a better place than it was two or three years ago. Things are improving significantly. Part of that is due to the fact that there is more Government intervention and funding. As a result, we have seen increased passenger numbers. Irish Rail is experiencing business growth with increasing passenger numbers and the introduction of new passenger services. It is not all doom and gloom. While it is difficult, it has always been so because it is, quite rightly, a heavily subsidised organisation.

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	354	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time". Although I will not be sure until I hear the speakers to my left, this may be an historic day for Members in that we will be able to get a climate emergency measure over the line of Second Stage. I will explain the purpose of the Bill to those in the Chamber and those who may be listening outside. First, it is to stop all future exploration for fossil fuels in the country and to send a signal to the world that Ireland will no longer be a climate laggard, as we were described by the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, over a week ago at a meeting in Europe, but will take its responsibility seriously in dealing with climate change. The Bill is by no means a radical proposal. It is a modest first step that we have to take and it simply stops us looking for more sources of fossil fuels. It does so because we cannot burn them given we know that, globally, we must ensure that more than 80% of known and proved reserves on the planet remain in the ground if we are to have any hope of limiting the temperature increases to under 2° Celsius. Global temperatures have already risen over 1° Celsius compared to the pre-industrial revolution era and we are hurtling on the way to a 1.5° Celsius increase. If we take the Paris treaty and our commitments to it seriously, this House will support the Bill. If we take the national transition objective plan seriously, this House will support the Bill. If we take the national mitigation plan or the national adaptation framework seriously, this House will support the Bill. These are all Government plans and the Bill is, therefore, completely in line with Government policy. The second purpose is to highlight in a real and concrete way what is happening to our planet and what we need to do to stop that. It also seeks to highlight how we might begin to imagine an alternative from the catastrophic climate change that humanity and the planet are now facing. The impetus behind the Bill was the fact that, last year, the Department and the Minister granted consent to Providence Resources to start drilling for oil in the Porcupine basin. It follows a long history of granting licences for exploration and of actively encouraging exploration for oil and gas off our shores. Ironically, the Minister and the Department did this just days after this House voted to ban onshore fracking. I want to welcome to the Visitors Gallery all of those who are here to support the Bill and, hopefully, to see its passage through the House. They have done a tremendous amount of work with Solidarity-People Before Profit in the lead-up to the production and presentation of the Bill. In particular, I refer to the young men and women from Stop Climate Chaos, Not Here, Not Anywhere, Friends of the Earth and Trócaire. I will take the opportunity to thank two very prominent climate scientists, Professor Kevin Anderson and Professor John Sweeney, for their advice, help and support. We signed up to the Paris Agreement in 2015, having announced our commitment to limit global temperature rises to under 2° Celsius. The Taoiseach and Ministers have repeatedly announced their concern and assured us of their commitment to tackle climate change, yet we have continued to issue licences and grant consents to explore for more fossil fuels. It does not make sense. The disconnect between the rhetoric and the actions of Government and the State is startling but it is more than that. It represents the disconnect globally between what all governments and economic elites around the world say about climate change and what is actually happening to our planet, given our continued use of fossil fuels and levels of carbon dioxide emissions. The science is accepted by all except the odd man out, those like Donald Trump and Deputy Healy-Rae, but everybody else accepts the facts around the science. Globally, last year we emitted larger amounts of man-made carbon dioxide from industry and other sources than ever before in human history. We are 27 or 28 years on from Kyoto, which was the first global conference on how to deal with climate change. Decades after the science was settled, and knowing what the consequences will be, our economic, social and political system, which is based on profit and competition, actually emits more of the gas that is unwanted and dangerous to the planet and that is guaranteed to have devastating impacts on the climate, the environment and all aspects of Earth's biodiversity. 2017 was a year that saw Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Irma and Hurricane Maria, a year that saw south-east Europe undergo a heatwave named Lucifer, a year where wildfires raged across California and was a year of record droughts, floods and other extreme weather events here and around the world. It was a year that continued the trend of record-breaking and it has entered the records as one of the warmest years ever; indeed, the warmest five years ever recorded were between 2010 and 2017. None of this is news to the people in the Visitors Gallery, to campaigners, to Members of this House, to scientists or to researchers and I am sure it is not news to Department officials. All of these events and what will follow are the predictable outcome of the policies and actions that governments and economics elites have taken or failed to take since the Kyoto summit nearly 28 years ago. One report estimates that, between 1996 and 2015, more than 500,000 people died as a direct result of extreme weather events and there have been financial losses of over $3 trillion. Some 20 million people on the planet now face starvation and severe food shortages. We should be under no illusions that this Bill will stop climate change. That is happening and will continue to happen even after this Bill is, hopefully, passed. However, the world I grew up in will be profoundly different and more dangerous for the people of today and their children unless we take the first step. I passionately believe we must take that first step and give an example to the rest of the world, along with countries like Costa Rica, France and Belize, which have taken this measure in order to say that something has to change and that the economic and political elites have to get their priorities right. The market system will not deal with our problems. I will conclude by quoting John Bellamy Foster, who, when talking about us having done nothing in the 28 years since Kyoto, stated "vested interests that are tied into the fossil-fuel financial complex, and ... the higher rate of profitability in the economy to be obtained from the fossil-fuel economy" are preventing us dealing with climate change. I believe that is at the core of this problem. It is the power and greed of the fossil fuel industry that we have to begin to challenge. Let this country be one of the first few countries to stand up and have the courage to do so in order to begin to address the future of the planet and the environment for all people here and beyond.

#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	356	I welcome those in the Visitors Gallery and it is good to see so many people there. I congratulate my comrade, Deputy Bríd Smith, on this very good Bill. I believe it is a good combination of red and green and it is a measure that puts down a marker for this country and other countries that the over-reliance on fossil fuels is unsustainable. Even though it is a limited measure in terms of climate change and the environment, it sends out the right message on any future exploration in this country. Fossil fuels are the past and renewable energies are the future. There can be no doubt that human activity driven by the profit system and capitalism has had and is having a detrimental effect on people, the climate and wildlife. We talk about the environment but, in the same vein, we have to talk about why the environment is being slowly destroyed. The elephant in the room starts with a C - it is capitalism. Capitalism destroys the planet constantly. Those who do not believe in climate change are in denial. What capitalism is doing to the earth is a clear and present danger. The deputy director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at Manchester University, Kevin Anderson, states that in order to deliver on the 2° Celsius climate warning target agreed at the UN conference in Paris almost three years ago, radical and rapid cuts in consumption among the world's richest consumers, who are the biggest polluters, and a re-ordering of economic priorities are necessary. I could go through a list of environmentalists, academics and politicians who constantly give the same narrative. There are others in the House who will probably disagree, but capitalism is the clear and present danger. It is why we have climate change and are at the point of climate catastrophe. In order to make that transformation, we must transform the society we live in and the economic system that perpetrates those crimes. For the good of everyone who lives on this planet, we must address these issues. This Bill goes some way to doing that but we must change the system overall.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	357	The name of this Bill, the Climate Emergency Measures Bill, is important. Just as when we talk about the housing crisis, it is vital we call things what they are and in this case we have an emergency, a catastrophe which threatens humanity. Instead of recognising that, political leaders around the world largely fiddle while the world burns, because of the interests they represent, whether they be agribusiness or fossil fuels. They ignore the severity of the problem and pay lipservice to it while we hurtle towards a climate disaster. The most simple point that we must reiterate repeatedly in this debate, because it is unanswerable, is that the known fossil fuel reserves are already four or five times the amount that can be burned without increasing the global temperature above the 2° Celsius limit agreed in Paris, which would be catastrophic. It is that simple. It is an open and shut case as long as the profits and the share price of the fossil fuel industry does not come into it. Even that 2° Celsius limit is too high. Globally, temperatures have already increased by almost 1° Celsius which is enough over time to melt half the ice in the Arctic as well as creating the basis for a massive increased occurrence of extreme weather events, including droughts and floods. We already see this. It is not something in the dim and distant future, rather it is happening now. Global temperatures are rising. Sixteen of the 17 warmest years on record occurred since 2001. Global warming has been concentrated in the past 35 years. In Iraq, in 2016, temperatures hit 54° Celsius, which is close to the point at which humans cannot survive outside. In Ireland, six of the ten warmest years have occurred since 1990.  The consequence of that rapid change in our environment is immense. The environment is not something separate or external to human society and how we have to live. It was an idea captured brilliantly by Karl Marx when he explained that nature is our second body. We cannot function without it, yet capitalism is destroying it. The consequences are seen in thousands dying as a result of unnecessary and extreme weather events that are not inevitable but which are caused by climate change. That figure is set to increase to up to 150,000 deaths annually from extreme weather events by the end of this century. Some 14 million people have already been made homeless due to extreme weather events. The impact on agriculture is already being seen in the threat to bees in Germany, where three quarters of all flying insects have disappeared in the past 25 years. The impact on biodiversity, agriculture and the sustainability of human existence is devastating. Some 95% of the Great Barrier Reef has suffered from bleaching which is largely irreversible. This is the canary in the coal mine, when it comes to the devastating impact of the policies we have been pursing.  It has an impact on the millions of people who have suffered malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, heat stress, a return of famine and an increase in those living in areas affected by famine in the past year. As a result, it is estimated that between 2030 and 2050 the number of additional deaths caused by climate change will be 250,000 annually. In Ireland, Hurricane Ophelia left widespread damage last October. Flooding in Donegal in 2017 has already cost €15 million in damage and repairs at current rates, and rain and flood damage is set to increase by 30% in the coming years.  The cause of this and many other examples is indisputable. It is carbon emissions through the burning of fossil fuels globally. The answer demanded by activists around the world, and those here today, is very simple: we have to keep it in the ground. Ireland's record on the environment is very poor. The Government and Ireland's political establishment should be extremely embarrassed. According to the 2018 climate change performance index, Ireland is the worst performing country in Europe in terms of taking action. It is in first place in the volume of emissions per person in Europe and is eighth highest in the world. Ireland is set to miss its EU 2020 and 2030 emission reduction targets, and greenhouse gas emissions have increased by 7% since 2015. The consequences are paid not only by people here and around the world, but they will also be paid financially to the tune of up to €600 million in fines. We also have the third highest emissions per capita of residential energy use due to our high dependence on oil, coal and peat. If we continue on this trajectory, Ireland will not be able to cut its emissions of carbon dioxide by 80% by 2050. By way of comparison, the transport sector accounts for 19% of emissions, the industrial and commercial sector, 16%, energy, 19%, and waste, 3%, with agriculture the source of the largest amount of emissions in Ireland at 33%. The agrifood sector is a major political block to change here. Just as elsewhere in the world, it is establishment politicians who lag and people who lead. The recent Citizens' Assembly recommended by 98% that climate change be put centre stage in Irish policy making, showing widespread support for environmental issues, and 100% recommending that the State should take a leadership role and responsibility for adapting existing structures. It was the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, who gave the game away in Paris a year or two ago when he said that climate change is not a priority for Ireland. He gave the establishment's game away at a meeting to discuss climate change, of all places. The Government now gives us different lipservice, which I suppose is welcome. The Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has said that he is not proud of Ireland's role as a climate change laggard. It is absolutely the case that there is nothing to be proud of, but will he do something about it? That is the real question. From the point of view of humanity, it makes no sense to explore for more fossil fuels, fuels that cannot be burned without destroying our environment. The only logic for exploring for more fossil fuels comes from the companies which want to increase their share price by increasing their reserves. A paper published in Nature estimated that if we are to avoid going over the 2° Celsius point, some 82% of coal worldwide cannot be burned, along with 49% of gas and 33% of oil. We cannot burn it. We should pass Second Stage today and the Government should implement the Bill. We should agree to keep such fuels in the ground and send a message around the world.  In the context of the broader picture of why this is happening, the answer is contained in some of the points about the power of the fossil fuel industry. There is an idea, with which I agree, that describes the era in which we live as the anthropocene, that humanity is having a huge impact on the environment, especially in relation to climate change. It explains the massive acceleration in world temperatures since the industrial revolution. It is not only human society in the abstract which is having an impact on the environment, but human society organised in the form of capitalism, in the private ownership of energy companies and in the means of production and the drive for profit, where the damage to nature is externalised, companies do not care about the cost to nature, where humanity has been disconnected from nature as a result of that drive to profit, and where just 90 major companies have created 63% of the cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide since 1751. As Friedrich Engels observed "We do not merely want an amelioration of the present society but the establishment of a new one." Capitalism has outlived its usefulness for humanity. It has destroyed our environment and disrupted our climate. It has regulated 1 billion people to the slow death of starvation and malnutrition. It offers no way forward. Instead, we need a rapid and just transition to an economy based on zero emissions. It means leaving fossil fuels in the ground. It means investment in transitioning to renewable energy, in passive houses, in retrofitting and in public transport and it means democratic planning over our economy to meet the needs of people and planet.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	359	I thank Deputy Bríd Smith for raising this important matter and taking it into the Chamber. It is worth setting the scene, in terms of how the Government is approaching climate change, which is undoubtedly one of the biggest global challenges of our time. The decisions we make cut across almost all the different sectors of our economy, be it farming, housing, transport, industry or job creation. Our energy and climate policies are all closely interlinked, meaning a change to one element of our approach can have significant effects on other elements. As such, a holistic approach is essential. The scale and complexity of the challenge demands a co-ordinated approach, at both national and international level. At international level, Ireland is committed to concerted multilateral action to tackle climate change through the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires that all parties produce plans to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change, and show increasing ambition over time with these plans. Ireland's obligation will form part of the European Union's overall commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels. Nationally, Ireland's first National Mitigation Plan sets out this Government's collective approach to reducing the country's greenhouse gas emissions. It represents the first in what will be a series of strong roadmaps for action across all sectors to make progress towards Ireland's national transition objective. The plan takes a whole-of-Government approach to tackling greenhouse gas emissions. Progress on this work is collectively reported on by Government on an annual basis in its annual transition statement. The Government has already implemented a wide range of policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the economy and we will work on an ongoing basis to make further progress towards our national transition objective. There are 106 individual actions in the National Mitigation Plan, including the introduction of a renewable heat incentive; the finalisation of a renewable electricity support scheme; DCCAE capital funding for 2018 which will be invested in sustainable energy projects which will save over 120,000 tonnes in carbon emissions every year, supporting 3,500 jobs, mainly, in rural areas, while also reducing our dependence on imported fossil fuels; and the allocation of additional resources to stimulate and support electric vehicles take-up in the high visibility taxi sector and to develop a new toll incentive regime for zero emission and ultra-low emitting cars. Renewable ocean energy can also play a critical role in helping Ireland meet its long-term energy and climate targets. While some offshore renewable energy technologies show promise in the near term, rigorous testing must precede deployment at scale. Some technologies, such as floating wind devices and tidal devices, are not likely to be deployed at scale until the mid-2020s onwards, with wave from approximately 2030. I am aware of examples in Ulster. In my own province, there is work between Queen's University and Letterkenny Institute of Technology, LYIT, into further research in this area. It is an INTERREG supported project and involves sharing practice from different aspects of the industry in Scotland as well. Nevertheless, Government recognises the opportunities offered by Ireland's ocean energy resource and is putting in place today the building blocks that will enable Ireland's future offshore renewable energy industry. The offshore renewable energy test sites in Mayo and Galway Bay, along with the Lir National Ocean Test Facility in Cork, represent a full suite of world-class test facilities to help develop this promising resource. These actions, and the many others in the plan, will result in reducing our fossil fuel use progressively to a point where we can reach our long-term vision of an aggregate reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 80% by 2050 across the electricity generation, built environment and transport sectors but that is not to say that more is not needed. Turning to the fossil fuels we use, and let us be clear we will continue to use them for quite some time, neither the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change nor the International Energy Agency envisages a 100% renewable energy electricity system. Therefore, some fossil fuel will remain a component of our future energy mix. There are clear climate benefits that natural gas offers over coal and peat in power generation, while at the same time providing flexible generation to support renewables on the system. There is also considerable progress being made on the role that natural gas and renewable gas can play in our transport system, particularly in the freight sector, which is a notably challenging area to decarbonise. Turning to our use of oil, I have already mentioned that actions are being taken by Government to support a change from diesel and petrol cars to electric ones. However, there are some elements of the transport sector which will be especially challenging to decarbonise, in particular the aviation and marine transport sectors. Efforts to date have largely been focussed on energy efficiency rather than alternative modes of transport. As an island nation, we are especially reliant on both of these modes of transport. The fossil fuels we import increasingly come from more distant parts of the world and the further afield they come from, the worse impact they can have on the climate, as it takes considerable energy to deliver them. We also have to consider carefully Ireland's energy security. Security of supply is often not on a par with other considerations when designing energy policy, especially when things are going well. However, in the words of the European Commission, the EU had a stark "wake-up" call following gas supply disruptions in 2006 and 2009. The good news is that fossil fuels will no longer be our single source of energy security and the measures we have to hand to deal with energy security are continually evolving with increasing levels of renewables, developments in energy storage, the potential for further grid interconnections and the continued roll-out of energy efficiency. We must, however, coldly analyse and assess what they can deliver and over what timeframe. Of course, these real and challenging issues should in no way curb our ambition but, nevertheless, cannot be simply set-aside or wished away. I will leave my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Kyne, to deal with the Bill itself.

As Chairperson of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, I have no fixed view on whether offshore oil and gas exploration should be banned permanently and I might in time come to the conclusion that they should be. The only view I offer at this stage is that this legislation should probably not be continued in this House without the matter being carefully considered and in a more holistic fashion. The Minister of State with responsibility for natural resources has previously invited the committee, of which I am Chair and of which Deputy Bríd Smith is a member, to hold a broad policy debate on national energy policy. It is something the committee should do. We need to hear expert witnesses who can give evidence on this issue and also to hear from those who have differing views on the topic. Only then, when all the potential pros and cons have been evaluated and discussed, should legislation be drafted. This is not only about banning fossil fuel exploration in Irish territorial waters. It is about competitiveness, climate change and security of energy supply. Deputy Bríd Smith may be surprised to hear that I am probably close to her position on this issue. I would ideally like to have a situation where fossil fuels are a thing of the past. However, I urge the Deputy to consider progressing this on an all-party basis, with due consideration of supply security and other issues.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	362	I am pleased to say that Fianna Fáil will be supporting this Bill, as we recognise the importance of making a strong shift away from our reliance on fossil fuels to cleaner, greener forms of energy. The Bill is part of a global campaign to highlight the need to reduce fossil fuel dependence to prevent dangerous temperature increases. The reality is that there is a climate change crisis unfolding around the globe and Fianna Fáil recognises that we must take decisive action to address it. If we do not, the pressures that will be placed on every society around the world will be simply unprecedented. Unfortunately, many of these threats are already in motion. The year 2016 was the hottest on record, with the average temperature almost 1° Celsius higher than the 20th century average. Given that most of us would probably like Ireland to be at least 2° Celsius warmer year round, that temperature increase might not sound like much but we need to remember that during the Ice Age, when places like Boston were under a mile of ice, the average temperature was only 4° Celsius lower than it is now. Too many countries are already feeling the effects of this temperature change and the associated climatic shifts. Public health experts have warned that the ongoing water shortages in Cape Town, a city with 4 million inhabitants, will likely result in the outbreak of life-threatening illness.Spain and Portugal are still grappling with one of the worst drought seasons either nation has ever faced. To look away and continue with business as usual would be one of the greatest acts of moral negligence we could commit. We need only look around our own country to recognise the very significant change in weather patterns in recent years. We see the extreme flood events that were characterised a number of years ago as one-in-100-year events; they are now happening every second or third year. This should be a wake-up call to all of us that patterns are changing and having a very dramatic impact on us. Addressing this issue begins with us having a serious discussions about our fundamental reliance on fossil fuels. Between 1970 and 2010, fossil fuel combustion produced about 78% of the carbon emissions produced worldwide. The need to reduce drastically the amount of fossil fuels we burn is obvious to most people; how to do so, when the global economy has been largely built upon the combustion of various fossil fuels, is much less obvious. Looking closer at Ireland's contribution to global warming, we see that in 2016 fossil fuels accounted for over 91% of our energy use. Given the amount of talk we hear in this Chamber about clean energy technology and wind turbines, many people probably think we source about half, or even more, of our energy from renewable energy sources. Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth. I commend the Bill on forcing us all to acknowledge this and to have an important discussion about our plans for Ireland into the future, and I compliment Deputy Bríd Smith on her foresight in introducing the Bill at this time. My party acknowledges that this is a complex conversation. One does not go from 91% reliance on fossil fuels to no dependence on fossil fuels overnight. This is not simply a supply-side problem. It would be hypocritical of me to pretend that by shutting down Irish production we will create a carbon-neutral country overnight. Whether it comes from the Corrib gas field or the tar sands in Alberta, western Canada, we will still need fossil fuels to put in our cars, to power our farms and factories and to heat our homes. Given the considerable environmental impacts and the nature of many of the alternatives, it makes no environmental sense for relatively clean natural gas to be edged out by much dirtier alternatives. There is therefore a job of work to do to reduce our demand for and use of gas and oil. Furthermore, consideration is not given in the Bill to its implications for the considerable number of exploration licences and leases that are already in place, whereby companies have already invested considerable resources in exploring Ireland's deposits and are in the process of applying for extraction licences. By banning all extraction licences, the Bill would effectively end this process. There would be considerable legal issues with radically changing the nature of Ireland's licensing regime for these companies and operations that are already in the system. This would need to be addressed and teased out on Committee Stage, and there is an opportunity for all of us to work constructively in that vein. This is why I am anxious that the Bill pass to Committee Stage. I am not blinded at all by my desire to see a cleaner environment, but we must recognise the complexities of the issues that must be addressed thereafter. My core point here is that the Bill needs to be seen as one piece of a much larger discussion about Ireland's need to decarbonise and become cleaner right the way from supply to demand and end use. The Government is completely shying away from this conversation, and this is reflected in Ireland's current climate change policies. While in government, Fianna Fáil published and introduced, together with the Green Party, the Climate Change Response Bill 2010. This Bill, which was one of the first of its kind in the world, set out a comprehensive framework for Ireland's journey to near carbon neutrality by 2050. Among other provisions, it set out annual targets for Ireland to meet in our journey towards much lower emission levels, something that would have given us a clear vision of where we needed to go. One does not build a house without breaking it into smaller steps, and one certainly does not overcome one of the biggest technological and economic challenges in the history of the State without breaking it down either. When Fine Gael and Labour subsequently entered power, the Bill was ignored for five valuable years during which we could have reduced emissions. When they finally introduced their version of the Bill, it fell far short of our original proposal. Suddenly there was no specific goal for 2050, and gone were the annual targets to guide us along our way to a low-carbon economy. In short, between 2010 and 2015, all the binding targets that were there had been extracted. While the Government did establish the expert advisory council, it has completely ignored its advice. When the chair of the council, Professor John FitzGerald, one of the most esteemed climate experts in the world, categorically stated that the Government's policies to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions would be insufficient to meet Ireland's short and long-term goals, his advice was not heeded. Professor FitzGerald was also the fore in identifying Ireland as a laggard and not as the leader that some would try to present us. If the Government will not take action, the rest of us must forge ahead without it. My party is working on our own climate change proposals which we will bring forward later this year. We will focus on the big changes that are needed to create a long-term sustainable future for Ireland, one in which our economy does not rely on dirty fossil fuels and our children can enjoy clean air and an unspoiled countryside. This is an opportunity for Ireland to take advantage of the next energy revolution, particularly in respect of green technologies. Whereas we lacked the natural resources to be a major player in the fossil fuel industry, Ireland has the potential to become a serious hub for the production of clean energy technology. With 3,171 km of coastline, significant tidal activity and a temperate climate, Ireland is well-suited to most of the major green energy technologies out there. What is more, our highly skilled workforce is ready and able to take on the tricky business of engineering these new technologies. The SEAI, for example, has estimated that on and offshore wind energy generation could create 20,000 jobs by 2040 in Ireland. This is the part of the story on which we need to focus. How do we maximise the benefits of the next energy revolution for our nation and its citizens? I thank Deputy Smith for giving us an opportunity to address this question. While I may not agree with all she has to say about climate change, or indeed other topics, I welcome this chance to exchange views on what will be a defining issue for our generation. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, which is exactly what Deputy Smith's Bill has done for us today.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	363	I also commend Deputy Smith on bringing forward this Bill. As Deputy Dooley said, Fianna Fáil will support it. We are in a climate emergency. Despite President Trump's tweets, snowfall in winter does not automatically mean climate stability. We live in a time of extreme weather and repeat extreme climate events. I learned even earlier today that the ESB dam on the River Shannon was built to withstand a one-in-10,000-year flood. Unfortunately, those water levels that were once considered one-in-10,000-year events are now considered one-in-150-year events. This shows the journey we have taken in relatively recent times, over the past 60 years since the construction of the dam. I crossed the Liffey at the ESB dam at Poulaphouca, Ballymore Eustace, in my constituency recently. We see similar weather events reoccurring and the entire Liffey basin, with which I am familiar, flooding repeatedly. Flood events are becoming the norm on many local roads and areas adjacent to streams and rivers, which is completely unacceptable, as are the storms and the adverse weather conditions we have seen recently, be it Storm Ophelia, Storm Brian or the other storms we saw last winter. Ambition and aspiration are needed and we need to think big and bold, and this Bill does so. When we think we cannot achieve things, we should look to people such as Elon Musk, who last night sent his car into space, and the creativity and ambition of man that is realised in such endeavours. Where there is a will, there is a way. Such people find it possible to do things that were previously thought impossible. We have seen leadership in such places as London and Paris. I understand a ban will be imposed on non-electric vehicles entering the latter city from 2030 onwards. We are seeing more and more such initiatives in cities around Europe and indeed the world. Targets and aspirations are being set and imposed, but in statute, although these countries often give themselves lead-in times, 2030 in the case of Paris. We also see the success of renewable energy in many areas but not yet in Ireland, a point to which I will return. We see this in such countries as Portugal, Spain and Germany, some of which have achieved negative pricing when they have got a particularly good spell on renewable energy, particularly wind and solar. We should be in a position to do likewise but we are nowhere near. We have seen this happen and become the norm in other countries that run entirely on renewable energy for continuous periods of two or three days when this has been achieved and done well.I am disappointed with the Government's approach to date, notwithstanding the good work of the committee. The Chairman of the committee, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, myself - I am Vice Chairman - and the cross-party membership are doing some excellent work. I am disappointed with the Government as a whole. I recently asked the Taoiseach what provision is being made for the possibility that the State will incur fines of over €1 billion if we do not make our targets for 2020. His response, which was quite flippant and dismissive, was that it was an issue for next year and not this year so the question was out of scope. It is far more serious than this year or next year. We need to think about the next 100 years. The State is on the hook potentially for €1 billion. We established this at the committee and the figures are borne out in the detail. For moral as well as financial reasons, this is not a place we want to be. As Deputy Dooley indicated, Fine Gael, on entering Government, appointed an advisory council but then proceeded to ignore its recommendations. Professor John FitzGerald, one of the most esteemed climate experts attached to Trinity College, spoke about how the Government, unfortunately, will fail to meet its target and that its strategies are completely inefficient for mitigation in the short and long term in the area. I mentioned the moral argument but the financial argument is also strong. It is a fact that fossil fuel extraction in Ireland has been unsuccessful. We do not have a series of coal mines, even if we were minded to go back to using them. With regard to driving revenue to the State, the Corrib gas field has been successful from an output point of view but it has not been commercially successful. Shell sold its stake having made just under €1 billion in losses. This means a loss to the taxpayer because loyalties are calculated based on revenue and profit. If extraction is resulting in losses, there is no gain whatsoever for the taxpayer. The Bill is in line with national trends on divestment. We supported last year's legislation on companies divesting assets relating to fossil fuels industries. That legislation was passed. There is a trend worldwide whereby up to €5 trillion of holdings in fossil fuels funds have been divested. There is a variety of renewable energy options and I will touch on them in a few moments. I have a few concerns about the Bill and I hope they can be addressed or mitigated on Committee Stage. I will return to them then. I am concerned about energy security. Were the Bill to pass today we would be saying "No" to any non-renewable sources being used to produce energy in the State from the day of its enactment. This is a very noble, laudable and desirable goal but I worry about its implications because we are not even making 50% renewable energy, as I understand it, so where will the other 50% come from? If we cut off sources such as the Corrib gas field, the alternative is to import energy. Natural gas is understood to be a transitional fuel from the high pollutants of coal and oil through to renewables. In order to fill the gap, we would have to import nuclear energy and energy generated from non-renewable sources elsewhere. I look forward to the discussion on this. I am concerned, however, because it is stated that we will not be allowed to use Irish gas but that we will import French gas or energy generated by nuclear reactors in France or the UK. I want to understand this further because a very important point arises in the context of from where our non-renewable energy comes if we do not produce it here. I mentioned the Corrib gas field in the context of transition. An opportunity exists there up to 2050. I want to understand a bit more about how this might work. With regard to foreign direct investment, which is critical to our economy, when people invest in the State, there are a number of things they look for, including energy security and energy supply. There is uncertainty about 50% or more of the supply if it is based on imports. We have the UN interconnector in respect of which complications are arising on foot of Brexit. The interconnector ceased functioning a couple of times during the past 12 months for technical reasons so there are issues with it. How do we fill the gap? A caveat in respect of foreign direct investment is that we sometimes hear about multinationals or other companies coming in. They tend to have very green boards and strong corporate social responsibility and they may state that they will only use renewable energy. This sounds great and it is something to which we all aspire and sign up. It is very welcome. Perhaps that is a discussion for another day, but we have to be careful that we do not allow a company to come in and only use renewable energy by taking from the finite amount of renewable energy on the grid rather than generating new renewable energy to use itself. In the context of a particular facility being 100% renewable, there is a difference between taking energy from the grid - and so from someone else - and a company generating new renewable energy that it can use to sustain itself. The latter case is something we want to encourage and we want to see. There are difficulties with some renewable sources and I hope we can surmount them. There is a big community backlash against wind energy. The big operators in this area have not endeared themselves to local communities in the past and this is something about which we have to be very conscious when we promote renewable energy. I cannot understand why the Government would not support an offset scheme for solar power in order to allow GAA halls, local community halls and houses throughout the country to put a couple of solar panels on their roofs, plug into the grid and get discounts on their energy bills. They could lead by example with regard to schools and communities. There was a scheme in place at one stage, but the Government has not restored it. Perhaps that is something at which the Minister could look. It would be a very positive move if he were to do so. There is huge potential in offshore wind. The Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment recently discussed the possibility of generating huge amounts of wind energy off the west coast. A number of stations could be put in place out of harm's way. I do not think there would be much community backlash if something is five miles or more off the coast in the Atlantic Ocean. There is great potential to tap into wave and offshore wind energy. I am particularly concerned about energy security and what would fill the void in the short term until we get to 100% renewable energy, but that is a debate we can have on Committee Stage. The Bill is much needed. It relates to a subject that is very important to everyone in the House, everyone in the State and everyone on the planet. I welcome the Bill and we certainly will support it. I look forward to further debate on Committee Stage.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	364	I welcome the fact that Solidarity-People Before Profit has introduced this Bill. We will support its passage to Committee Stage but it will have to contain extremely important provisions without which the entire Bill would be pointless. These are to set in motion the direct replacement to fossil fuels because if we do away with something, we have to replace it. It is completely immoral to refuse to use our own gas but to continue to use fossil fuels belonging to somebody else because we do not have replacement renewables. Without this in place we should use the natural resources we have to the benefit of people. What is realistic in terms of fossil fuels? What precise renewable energy sources will be put in place? Without renewable energy sources, Sinn Féin believes we should have exploration for the benefit of the State and its citizens. The problems with fossil fuels have been outlined well during the debate. We can rehearse the problems being caused, including global warming, but we must have solutions. What sources of energy do we need to develop to complement the intermittent sources of wind and solar? They are intermittent but it is important to use them. What will be the place of biogas? Sinn Féin's policy is to grow that industry. I commend Sinn Féin's policy to the Minister of State and I have a copy for him to read. I hope the Government will take it on board. We do not have micro-generation of electricity. We have rooftops all over the country on which there should be solar panels. A Bill on micro-generation was introduced here just before Christmas. It would be a useful start in developing it so that we could have real alternatives. We need to develop a wide variety of renewable sources, such as wind, solar, biogas, hydro, wave and tidal. Being against everything will not solve this. We must have solutions. What is needed is action on renewable energy. What renewable energy sources have been put in place by parties in the House? I have a lot of respect for the Green Party in many ways but some of what it has put forward lacks credibility. For example, in September last year, Deputy Eamon Ryan, a former Minister with responsibility for energy, when opposing Sinn Féin's Bill to regulate - not stop - wind farm development stated, "We can turn to a mixture of wind and solar development, particularly offshore wind, and interconnection". This means interconnection with other countries. He also stated, "The better, cheaper back-up system is for us to connect with our neighbours".When the wind stops blowing and the sun goes down, the solution is to rely on Britain, where gas, coal, nuclear power or whatever is necessary will be used to produce electricity for us. That is not all right. Will it be all right in the future, then, for us to drive electric cars, thinking we are ever so green? We should have electric cars. However, if the electricity comes from Britain, where it is generated by fossil fuels or nuclear power, it is not good enough. We cannot move the problem around in the same way as the abortion problem.  We should have connections with other states, including France. However, we must have a vision whereby we produce our own energy sources and become an exporter of renewable energy. We met many experts in the field who said that Ireland can become self-sufficient and become a net exporter using renewables. For this, however, we will need to determine exactly what sources we are going to use. The Government has been vague on this. Its solution is the national mitigation plan, which is heavy on aspirations but light on actions.  Sinn Féin has met representatives from all sectors of the industry, including the Electricity Supply Board, ESB, Trócaire, Stop Climate Chaos and Friends of the Earth. I welcome the fact that some of them are here in the Gallery today. We have done this in pursuit of a plan for the production of alternative sustainable sources of energy. We have been putting forward solid proposals that work in other countries. Ireland is way behind on this issue, as the Minister knows. It is a shameful fact that we are going to exceed by far our carbon emissions targets for 2020.  Energy production will not come from any single source. That is the message here. The replacement of fossil fuels will have to come from a very wide portfolio, using different technologies. However, electricity only accounts for part of our fossil fuel consumption. Transport represents 40% of the energy used in Ireland. What are we doing about that? We are very weak on public transport and public transport networks. We have to change that. Public transport needs to be properly planned and made more available. I refer again to electric cars. There are approximately 2,000 electric cars in the State, but there is no plan for the necessary infrastructure or charging system. It is in limbo. We need a way forward on the subject. When it comes to renewable energy, there has been a lack of vision, direction and action.  Apart from burning fossil fuels, we are intrinsically linked to the petrochemical industry in the western world, and that must change. It is vital that we look for solutions and alternatives, because petrochemicals are present in other everyday products such as plastics. We need to reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels, which is hugely damaging for our environment. Such imports also cost nearly €5 billion a year. It is not just for the sake of the environment, self-sufficiency or reducing cost that we need to change. If these were not enough, we also are facing large fines. The great reason we should change is environmental. There are other reasons in between but we also are facing fines from 2020 onwards because we are absolutely failing to meet our obligations on greenhouse gas emission and renewable energy production. That cost will run into billions of euro.  I hope this Bill will open the debate and that we take it to Committee Stage. We want to amend it. We recognise the reality that we have to change. We must also recognise that we need those alternatives, and we in Sinn Féin want to accelerate them. We need to work harder at bringing those forward. We need to move away from polluting fossil fuels and this means creating a different economy, a sustainable economy. 
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	It pains me to say this, but the Minister's tenure in this Department thus far has been an absolute disaster. Climate change is the biggest problem facing the planet. Each year, we see record temperatures and each year, climate change takes thousands of lives around the planet. We see a ramping up of droughts, floods and extreme weather events and these in turn are affecting the politics of the planet and are creating instability around the world. I hear the words of the Minister. I listen to the grave tones in which he is enunciating. However, I am struggling to see any concrete actions the Government has taken thus far in this area. Everything he mentions is a matter of horizon politics. Somewhere in the future, on the horizon, we will take a particular action that will resolve the issue. At this urgent time, I have heard the Chair of the committee talk about the need for consultation, analysis, research and plans. The only word she did not use was action, which is what needs to be taken. The fact is that because of the Government's policies, this country is the third worst with regard to domestic carbon emissions. As has been said, we are on the verge of paying hundreds of millions of euro in fines because of its inaction on these targets. Look at what has been done by the Government. The only offshore wind project we have is the Arklow Bank Wind Park, which was built in 2004. There are 2.5 million cars on the road right now, and only a couple of hundred of those added every year are electric cars. Moreover, despite all the Government's plans, the number of electric cars sold in January 2018 actually fell when compared with the figure for January 2017. It is said that diesel fumes now cause about 38,000 deaths internationally. Many other cities have concrete plans and actions in hand to take diesel out of city centres but I do not know of any Government plans in that regard. For years, many cities have had buses run on alternative and renewable fuels. Not a single euro has been spent by the Government on alternatively-fuelled buses in any city in the State.  What really gets my head spinning is the fact that Ireland has only 44,000 farmers who are actually making a living. The average wage for a cattle farmer in this State is €12,500. Most of those farmers are well placed to produce renewable energy. All they need is feed-in tariffs from the Government but yet the Government will not develop any such measures. In Britain, solar power from March to September now produces more energy than coal and nuclear power combined and yet there is not a single solar farm in this State. I call on the Minister to wake up, and fast. 
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16499	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	366	The Labour Party is supporting the Bill. We wish to see it proceed to Committee Stage. It is great to stand in the Chamber and hear the voice of a young child in the Public Gallery. It is a nice reminder of just exactly why we are all here. It is lovely to hear that little voice from on high. I will offer a different slant on this Bill. In Paris in December 2015, Ireland agreed to halt climate change. We signed up to very specific targets, namely, to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2° Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit that temperature increase to 1.5° Celsius. The time has come for us to be very serious about that target from a global perspective, particularly in regard to what we do on the island of Ireland.  If one considers the development agenda, I note that on average, we spend approximately €600 million per annum supporting poverty reduction in sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, in working with our key partner countries through Irish Aid. Through Irish Aid, we support subsistence farming projects in the Tigray region of Ethiopia to allow a sustainable model of agriculture to exist there in order that people can feed themselves, at the very minimum. We have to make the connection between the programmes that we are supporting in sub-Saharan Africa and the effect of a global average temperature increase of 2° Celsius above the pre-industrial levels on the very people we are assisting. We in western Europe are contributing by our actions to that very same increase in temperatures. There must be an understanding of the causal link between what we are supporting in our laudable programmes in Irish Aid on the one hand and our behaviour on this island. I wish to refer to the excellent Stop Climate Change briefing document that was submitted to Members. It refers to the role of financial analysts and says that financial analysts have highlighted the risks of fossil fuel assets becoming stranded or worthless, a warning reiterated publicly by the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. It continues: "An increasing number of legal scholars and regulators are now warning that fiduciaries who fail to consider climate change risks in their investment analyses and decisions could be liable for breaching their fiduciary duty in the future, exposing them to litigation risk". If we are capturing the zeitgeist, there must be ownership of the agenda from a political point of view to ensure that we divest ourselves from those types of investment instruments and that we, as a Parliament, on behalf of the people, take radical action on climate change. In this country we are now subject to greater weather events which have an impact on the delivery of food, how agriculture operates and on the built environment in the towns, villages and enclaves in which we live. We must start to take radical action to ensure we have both an investment portfolio and a set of policy instruments that take seriously the risks inherent in climate change. In conclusion, we will support the Bill. It is time for us to get to grips with this issue from a non-partisan point of view and this is an opportunity to do that. I hope the Government will facilitate the Bill passing to Committee Stage. It appears there is a clear majority in the House for the view that it should proceed to that Stage. When that happens we will have an opportunity to put forward amendments as we see fit, contribute to the debate and have a successful outcome on the Bill, such that it leads to a set of policy instruments that ultimately give effect to real change.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	367	I support the Bill introduced by Deputy Bríd Smith. It is short and concise and proposes to amend the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960 by prohibiting the issuing of licences for exploration for fossil fuels. The Bill recognises and legislates for the scientific reality that we must stop seeking more carbon based energy. It is also fully in line with Ireland's climate and energy obligations and security of supply requirements. I wish to respond to the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, on energy security. It is clear that ending the State's fossil fuel licensing will not disrupt Ireland's current gas supply or usage or in any way jeopardise the energy demands of citizens and businesses in Ireland. Ireland's national and international climate commitments require the almost complete decarbonisation of the energy, transport and home heating sectors in the medium term. However, natural gas is a key component of Ireland's current energy mix, particularly for base load electricity generation. It is recognised that the existing gas supplies must be maintained and the policy change proposed in the Bill does not seek to switch off any existing supplies and does not affect current exploration licences. The State's climate and energy objectives are clear about the need to phase out fossil fuels. It is highlighted in the Government's climate strategy, produced in July 2017, that Ireland depends on fossil fuels to meet 88% of its energy needs at an annual cost of approximately €4.6 billion. We must reduce this reliance on fossil fuels very considerably by 2050. The 2050 objective is set out in the 2014 national policy position, which is underpinned by the Climate Change and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. The 2014 policy position is also bolstered by the State's energy White Paper, Ireland's Transition to a Low Carbon Energy Future 2015-2030, which further specifies the objective of reductions in emissions by 80% to 95% compared to 1990 levels by 2050. The Minister, therefore, has an obligation to support this Bill on Second Stage.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	368	I commend Deputy Bríd Smith on introducing this Bill. When we license for drilling instead of expanding our renewable energy infrastructure, choose biomass over wind, water and solar power, increase the national herd instead of helping farmers and the public to diversify from climate destructive forms of food production and consumption, when the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport gives priority to roads and fossil fuel guzzling buses over electrified rail and we fall way behind almost every European country in terms of the transfer to renewable energy, these are all political choices that have the effect of stealing the right to quality lives from the people of the planet. A nonsensical argument is being spread by the Government, and the polluting industries that gain from the status quo, that Ireland signed up to more than it could handle and that it is facing a bigger burden in terms of the targets than most other countries. The truth is that there was no political will to face these problems and there still is none. In 1990, the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report was published. In 2009 we signed up to the targets that the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment now says are unachievable. Ireland will be one of only two EU countries that will miss their targets, which is some achievement. We signed up to the targets in 2009 and published the legislation in December 2015. The legislation was empty, containing no mitigation measures or references to targets. Now, in 2018, we still do not have concrete, detailed sectoral mitigation action plans. In 2009 the Scottish Parliament voted to cut its nation's CO2 emissions by 42% by 2020, a target it reached six years early. In 2014 its emissions were 44.8% lower than in 1990. Given that we grant licences for drilling for fossil fuels off the coast of our country to some of the biggest polluters, knowing the science of the situation and how it is threatening the possibility of human life on the planet, it appears the Government does not care enough to take the necessary action. It does not appear to care enough about what future generations will have to deal with or about the lives of those on the front line of climate disasters today. We have the comfort of not having to deal with many of the worst climate disasters. We see them on television and they are a nice, handy distance away. It is a little like the bombing in the Middle East and supporting the Americans using Shannon Airport to allow them to bomb the living daylights out of those countries.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	369	Fair play to Deputy Bríd Smith and Solidarity-People Before Profit for bringing the Bill before the House. The Bill gives a clear signal of intent and proposes real actions that will help to achieve our carbon emissions obligations. We must view this against the backdrop that we are at the bottom of the pile. It is a great little country for ignoring targets to which it has signed up. In that context the Bill makes sense by preventing the renewal of licences for exploration which would tie us into long-term commitments to fossil fuels at a time when we have committed to divesting from them. It is absolute lunacy. Some of these frontier licences are quite complex and can run for up to 12 years. This Bill is necessary to stop the lunacy we saw when the Minister issued a licence to Providence Resources Plc to drill off the west coast of Ireland a week after the House voted to ban onshore fracking. It is disgraceful. We are now tied to that commitment up to 2020 in the naivety of thinking that offshore fracking is less damaging than fracking onshore. The blasts from oil and gas exploration are clearly a daily threat to Ireland's dolphin, whale and porpoise population. They also kill approximately 64% of zooplankton, a vital resource for the entire marine ecosystem, not to mention the damage that can occur from oil spills and the like. Bills such as this give us an opportunity to turn our performance around and become a forerunner in some of these areas. The task ahead is huge and that is because we have ignored it up to now. There is no doubt that we must start quickly improving. The Government does not have a clear strategy on how to pursue our climate change policies. Rather, it is giving out many mixed signals on the issue. The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment considers many issues. There have been many publications and draft plans but no clear methodology for how targets will be met. Meanwhile, other Ministers have come up with very specific targets for increases in agricultural output and the size of the national herd, incentivising the development of energy-intensive industries, such as those involving data centres and so on, that fly in the face our international obligations on climate action. The Bill is a step in the right direction. If the Government wishes to embrace what it states are its policies, it should welcome the Bill with open arms.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	370	I commend Deputy Bríd Smith and her colleagues in Solidarity-People Before Profit on putting forward the Bill, which is similar to a Bill introduced by the Green Party. However, we are very glad for her to bring it to the House and it is to be hoped that it will be passed and enacted into legislation. I commend Stop Planet Chaos and also the NGO movement in Ireland, which has had a hugely positive role in recent years in working with this Parliament on this and other legislation we have advanced. Ireland can be good at this. It can be a good, green land. We can be a proud people in the transition that has to be made. We can be ahead of the curve. We will be good at this and we should move forward and grasp the opportunity at hand. In supporting the Bill, I commend, without wishing to pick out individuals, Bill McKibben of 350.org on his work five or six years ago in doing the simple maths and atmospheric physics which showed that we need to keep 80% of known fossil fuel reserves in the ground. That is the rational and scientific viewpoint. Ministers often say that we have to be serious, think about this issue and resolve it. The reasoned, intelligent and thought-out science is in favour of the Bill. The Government is taking an irrational, reckless, dangerous, thoughtless and careless approach by going the other way. When Deputy Bríd Smith and I attended the COP23 talks in Bonn last year we encountered further analysis by priceofoil.org which showed that the latest research indicates we cannot use known reserves or existing coal, gas and oil production sites if we are to meet the climate commitments in the Paris Agreement. That is the physical, scientific and energy reality we face. Climate change is not the only reason to change our ways. Startling new evidence published in Nature magazine last June indicated that the seismic activity that is being engaged in is destroying our natural habitat and having a real effect on the zooplankton that form the base of the food chain, as Deputy Clare Daly stated. The world has lost half its wildlife in the past 40 years. We cannot ignore the biodiversity crisis that the Bill will help to address. In recent days, the Irish Wildlife Trust - fair play to it - published another important study showing that 48 species in the Irish marine environment are currently threatened with extinction. We must act. The great joy, opportunity or reality is that advancing in this direction will be good for our economy. We will be good at this. It is a pity that Deputy Stanley is no longer in the Chamber. I listened to his contribution and thought he had gone back to the old days when the maxim was to burn everything English except their coal. I also thought he was advocating for economic nationalism, whereby we have to hold on to what we have. The world has changed in that regard. We have to leave that oil in the ground. Doing so will allows us to switch to the alternative, renewable, cleaner and indigenous energy supplies we have. That is where the world is going. Some 90% of new electricity generation in Europe is in that renewable space. Some say it is only a marginal contribution but, rather, the entire margin of investment in electricity generation is in this renewable space and we can be good at it. Ireland is a windy country. The first turbines were installed here in 1992 at Bellacorick in Mayo and are still in operation. We were one of the first to use offshore wind turbines when they were put in place on the Arklow Bank. They have worked perfectly every day since but they are the only ones we have installed. We must make a big investment in floating wind turbines and wind turbines in the Irish Sea and that is from where our energy supply will come. That is a certainty. If there were no climate, environmental or wildlife implications, I would still say that oil extraction is a poor business bet. One must go into one of the harshest environments on earth, 200 or 300 miles out into the Atlantic, to extract oil. In Irish waters, a viable oil source is found once in every 40 or 50 exploratory investigations. We will defeat oil by making it too cheap, not by it being too expensive. There will never be an economic case for extracting oil from the Atlantic. Oil will never again go over $150 dollars per barrel because people will switch to electric vehicles and transport and that will keep its price down. At less than $100 per barrel, the extraction of oil from Irish waters will never make sense. Gas in Irish waters will never come ashore because it is so distant but, rather, will be shipped off to some other location. For those who argue that we have to think of energy security, there is no security in oil and gas. It is available on the international market. We will use oil for the next ten, 20 or 30 years at most but it is available on the international market and we do not lose any security by not having our own. It comes into Whitehaven in Cork and does not have an Irish, British or American stamp on it. There is only one oil market and there is no security risk in that regard. The security risk is missing out on the economic opportunity for switching the other way by leading the curve in the transition that is now inevitable because California, China and Germany are doing it and we can too. We can be one of the best places in the world to do it and we should go for it. The 1 million Irish homes that have oil-fired central heating should, over the next ten years, have heat pumps installed, along with solar panels on their roofs and electric charging points in their driveways. If that is done, hey presto, we will start to have houses that are very efficient, smart, comfortable and well-run. We do not need oil or gas. We must stop and make the switch. We have lost our green reputation and reputation is important. It is, therefore, important that the Bill is passed such that the world starts to recognise Ireland is doing the same thing as France. It has made a similar decision to that proposed in the Bill in respect of its waters. We can do likewise and that will helps us because we will be able to stand a little prouder in the world and tell the truth that we can and should be good at this. More than anything else, we need to get the politics right. The Bill cannot be one of the 24 or 25 that will be stuck at Committee Stage for the next eight months, two years or whatever time. The Government needs to realise that the world is changing and that it cannot stop that by blocking legislation from passing not just Committee Stage but through the Dáil, across the corridor into the Seanad and out into reality. There is nothing to stop the Bill proceeding. I look forward to it. We could have a committee meeting or pre-legislative scrutiny next week. We should bring in Bill McKibben and Mary Robinson to see what they think. We should ask Lorna Gold to get Pope Francis to Skype the meeting. That is the important point: it raises our hearts, spirits and souls that we will be good at this. I am sure of that.

I have five minutes and that is it. I will not overrun my time. I am trying to get at how the world has to evolve. I have listened to Deputy Eamon Ryan and the way the world has evolved but there are certain things about which I continue to be firm and fast. I am aware, for instance, that there are other people who want to see a world and an Ireland where there is no such thing as a person burning timber or turf in a fire in their home. I know people would want that. I would not want that but would seek to retain the right of people to burn the fuel they might have on their own farms and which they have done traditionally over the years. I do not want to be a part of anything that would result in those people not being able to burn what they want in their own fires. It is tradition and is part of what we are all about. While I very much respect that there is a modern, younger generation compared to the likes of me for whom in the future there will be no such thing as the burning of turf or timber, we must respect the right and entitlement of people who are there now and who have traditionally done this. Of course city living and town living is different to rural Ireland. This is why I always want to speak up on behalf of the people who do not pollute, in my opinion. All they are doing is what they, their families and the people before them have done for many years. With regard to the Bill and the whole idea behind it, in the past Ireland may have oversold itself by agreeing to sign up to these measures. The technology is not there to drive an electric car from Malin Head to Mizen Head. It cannot be done currently as the technology is not there. Members may remember when mobile phones came in. A phone was something we used to make a phone call. Now we can do anything with mobile phones. I have no doubt but that in time, there will be such a car that can drive from Malin to Mizen and a lot further on one charge. We must admit and recognise, however, that we do not have the technology at present to allow us to do away with all diesel cars to minimise our emissions. We must be sensible and realistic. We have to deal with what we actually have to offer people. At the moment the technology is quite simply not there. Of course great things are being done around renewable energy. Previously a wind farm was completely alien to us and one would have to travel to see one. I remember going to Pamplona as a young councillor to see the wind turbine capital of the world as it was called. Now Ireland is creating an awful lot of renewable energy through wind farms and solar farms, which are an additional source of income to farmers. It is about a job of work and we have to evolve and we have to work but we must work within the constraints of what we have. I thank the Chairman.

In its presentation the Government said that in 32 years' time - a generation away - in the year 2050, Ireland might be able to reduce its emissions by 80%. This is not even true. In the past month, the Climate Change Advisory Council has stated that the Government will miss the 2020 targets. Professor John FitzGerald of that council has pointed to the high dependency on oil, coal and peat as being the primary reason. The Government can announce very noble things and very positive and important initiatives like sustainable energy projects and electric vehicles but the Bill and the reduction in fossil fuel consumption is actually critical to meeting those emissions targets. The Government has no answer and no solution. The aspects that do get talked about, such as resources to stimulate the take-up of sustainable energy are all private so we have no control. It is not even a Government-led project, which at least would be a bit more serious, but it is reliant on the private sector to do it. I am not really surprised at the Government's response because reference has already been made to lagging behind. For 20 years the Government has sat and taken advice from the likes of Conor Skehan who, as a climate change denier, advised Fine Gael right up until the period when Phil Hogan was the Minister. It seems it is only in the last couple of years that Fine Gael has accepted the idea there is a climate change problem. Mr. Skehan's attitudes on homelessness and the environment are very similar; they are ill-informed and ignorant. At one point, an architect was drawing diagrams trying to disprove expert climatologists and was saying there was no problems with polar bears as that was all the fault of local tribes. This is the rubbish and dross to which the Government has been listening. It really needs to catch up and take this issue seriously. The Public Gallery is full of younger people tonight because this is a serious issue for young people and they take it a lot more seriously than does the establishment. The first thing the Bill says is that it is an emergency and that the effects of climate change are being felt around the world right now. We need to implement radical policies in how our society operates. The one degree rise in global temperatures over the last number of years has led to a sharp increase in extreme weather events. We see it in Ireland also. It is often the poorest who are hit the hardest. While it is all very romantic to listen to Deputy Healy-Rae, and we all love a log fire, this is a serious issue where massive areas of the planet are becoming uninhabitable and where up to 25 million people are being displaced. If we keep going, this number will rise dramatically in the next years. The current rate of CO2 pollution in the atmosphere has increased to a level not seen in 3 million years. We therefore have to dispense with some traditions that were not good traditions. That is the reality. It is also wrecking nature and the ecosystems with irreversible damage done to some of the most beautiful things on our planet. Scientists agree that we are in the process of a sixth mass extinction of animals and wildlife; a biological annihilation. The Bill argues that it cannot be left to big business and the private sector to voluntarily agree that at some stage in the future, they will tackle climate change. They will put their profits first. This is why we on the left have put forward an alternative to capitalism destroying the environment. There are 90 major companies that have created 63% of the cumulative emissions. These are the companies this Bill targets. They will not simply leave fossil fuels and profits in the ground. We need a completely different type of society to successfully stop climate change. We need to challenge the rule of the 1% who control these companies and the big businesses that are the major polluters so we can take control of our resources and our planet. Then we can invest the billions of euro needed to really transition from a carbon-based economy to a green economy.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	379	If this Bill is passed and progressed through the Oireachtas without being watered down and then implemented, it would be an historic achievement for environmental campaigners.It would be a victory built on the back of struggles by communities like the community in Rossport, which has stood up to Shell for many years and has braved State repression and media opposition all along the line. The Bill before the House focuses on keeping the fossil fuel reserves in the ground so that they cannot be burned and thereby add to the carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere. I want to focus on some other measures the State could take on fossil fuels to reduce emissions and decarbonise the economy. Ireland is on track to miss its emissions targets for 2020. In fact, we may have an increased level of emissions. We are also on track to miss our targets for 2030. Even though these targets are on the lower end of the scale of what many scientists think we need to achieve, we are still on track to miss them. As the environmental crisis gets worse, the timeframe within which we can take action decreases and the emissions reductions we will need to make grow. This is the result of policies that successive Governments have implemented or failed to implement. According to a study carried out by the Irish Academy of Engineers, with massive investment across sections of the economy, the country could still meet its 2030 targets. The academy has laid out a raft of measures which could be implemented over the next 12 years, ranging from investing in renewable energies to retrofitting homes and investing in vital public services. It has estimated that the cost of such measures would be €35 billion. In our view, this would necessitate the increasing of taxation measures on the wealthy and multinationals and the making of a political decision to prioritise the environment over the interests of big business. In Ireland, the second biggest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, after agribusiness, is the transport sector, which contributes 20% of all emissions here. Since 1990, transport has been the fastest growing contributor of emissions. Emissions from the sector have increased by a massive 130% since then. Most of this has come from people using their cars. The number of cars in this country has increased from 800,000 in 1990 to almost 2 million today. Nearly 75% of all journeys are taken in cars. The best way to tackle this is to invest significantly in public transport. Instead, the Government seems to be doing its best to drive people away from public transport. It has under-invested in public transport services, as we have seen with Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann. It has forced cutbacks on bus and train routes and increased fares across the board. By running the service down, it is encouraging people into cars. Despite all of this, the number of people seeking to use public transport has increased and buses, trains, and trams are packed at peak times. If we are to provide a service to cater for the people who want to use public transport, while also encouraging people out of private cars and reducing emissions, we need to invest massively in improving and expanding public transport services and cutting fares. We can look at examples of success stories of investment in public transport. In 1981, the left-wing UK Labour Party council in London implemented the "fare's fair" policy on London transport. Fares were cut by a third before this was challenged in a court case. However, the result was clear. During the period in which fares were reduced, the use of public transport increased sharply. Last year, Solidarity and People Before Profit introduced budget proposals to revolutionise public transport and get people out of cars. An investment of just €500 million could halve all fares on CIÉ and Luas routes. This would encourage huge numbers of people out of their cars and onto public transport. We are repeating this call tonight. We are also proposing a reversal of all cuts in public transport subventions. This would cost just €90 million. If the subvention were doubled, services could be increased and fares could be slashed. These examples show that it is not the case that environmentalists are campaigning for climate change to be tackled, while workers separately campaign for better public services. Both of these struggles are linked and need to come together. Public transport workers like those in Bus Éireann who are battling the company and the Government against cuts in pay, routes and conditions might argue that more investment is needed to improve public transport services because of climate change. We need more bus drivers on decent pay and conditions to improve public transport services and thereby tackle climate change. Likewise, environmentalists should support workers and trade unionists and see their struggles as part of the battle to defend public services and the environment. It is by building movements like this that we can force radical green change onto the agenda. A radical left-wing Government will reorganise society to protect the environment and raise living standards of all.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	380	Cuirim fáilte roimh an díospóireacht thábhachtach seo. I thank Deputies for their contributions on this important national strategic issue. I welcome the general tone of the comments that have been made. Before I respond to the matters raised by Deputies, I would like to make a number of points. As the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, has already outlined, the Government is fully committed to tackling climate change. Ireland and its European partners are fully playing their part in achieving the EU climate goals. We have set out our actions and our future direction in the national mitigation strategy, which tackles energy-related greenhouse gas emissions and focuses on energy-efficiency and decarbonising our energy system. The effect of this will be to increase renewable energy and to reduce the fossil fuel component of Ireland's energy use. The mitigation strategy is a living document. We recognise that more actions will need to be taken. I believe the Irish people are willing to take more actions and to change their behaviour. The Government must oppose the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018. Banning oil and gas exploration and production is not a commitment under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change or the Paris Climate Agreement. Similarly, banning exploration was not recommended by Citizens' Assembly in its deliberations on making Ireland a leader in tackling climate change. Oil and gas exploration and production continue to be undertaken by other developed countries in Europe, including the UK, Norway, the Netherlands and Denmark. These countries have ambitious climate change goals and are strongly promoting renewable energy. The Bill before us is not a credible proposition. If it were passed, it would neither reduce Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions nor change or reduce our use of fossil fuels. However, it would lock Ireland into permanent dependency on imports for its future fossil fuel needs in the post-Corrib scenario. In the coming decades, Ireland and the EU as a whole will require some supplies of fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, which is viewed as a transition fuel in the period up to 2050. As the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, has said, the White Paper on energy commits to decarbonisation but also states that natural gas will be a transitional fuel out to 2050. It should be noted that among the EU 28, the dependency on imports in the case of oil increased from 74% in 1995 to 89% in 2015. In the case of natural gas, the dependency on imports increased from 43% to 69%. The Corrib gas field demonstrates the impact that indigenous supplies can have on Ireland's import dependency. Ireland went from importing 89% of its overall energy needs in 2015 to 70% of its needs in 2016. However, production from the Corrib field will peak and decline from 2019 onwards. Thereafter, we will become increasingly dependent on imports for gas and 100% dependent on imports for oil. The Government and the public are willing to tackle climate change. Unfortunately, however, we reject this Bill as gesture politics. During a debate on the departmental Vote last year, I proposed to Deputy Bríd Smith and numerous Senators that the relevant Oireachtas committee should hold a broad policy debate on national energy policy to inform any legislation. However, this Bill has been proposed before any such debate has taken place. I certainly did not try to stop a debate. In fact, I encouraged it when I addressed the Deputy at the committee and during the Seanad debate on the fracking Bill. I also encouraged it through my officials with the Chair of the committee and also with the clerk to the committee. I recommended over recent times that there should be a general debate on energy security and policy. When the Chairman of the joint committee spoke earlier, she said she is agreeable to including a debate on this issue as part of the work policy over the coming period. I would like to respond to some of the comments that were made by Deputies. I assure Deputy Bríd Smith that this Bill is not in accordance with Government policy. As I have said, the White Paper on energy classifies gas as a transitional fuel. France has been mentioned as an example. I remind the House that nuclear power is a major part of France's energy supply. The French electrical grid is connected to seven different countries. This means we are not comparing like with like when we compare Ireland with France. Obviously, we have no nuclear power. I do not think anybody is asking for a change in that regard. At present, our only gas and electricity connections are to the UK, which is about to leave the EU. There are plans for a Celtic interconnector to France by 2025 and this will facilitate the importation of nuclear-generated power. France's future energy mix is 50% renewables, which I welcome, and 50% nuclear. Costa Rica has also been mentioned. Costa Rica has a moratorium on petroleum exploration and extraction until 2021. Our targets have also been mentioned during the debate. Under the EU renewable energy directive, there is a legally binding target for us to meet of 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. We have admitted for a long time that meeting that target remains challenging, although we hope to achieve it. According to the most recent analysis from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, we will achieve between 13.2% and 15.4% of it, which is between 82% and 96% of our target.Yes, we would like to be able to do more and certainly it is our ambition to increase that over time. Deputy Murphy talked about the Citizens' Assembly and I stated that it did not recommend stopping offshore oil exploration. He also mentioned the need to address peat and coal, with which I agree, and natural gas is a transitional fuel and has a lower emission basis. Deputies Dooley, Lawless, Stanley and Sherlock all recognised the complexity of the issue and I agree with them. Hence the rationale for having a debate in committee to tease out issues as supported by the Chair of the committee, Deputy Naughton. The Bill pre-empts any debate and does not cover the broad range of issues that would form part of an holistic debate. Deputy Collins said the Bill would not affect existing exploration licences as drafted. In fact, it would. It does not permit progression from licence to lease. Deputy Lawless again talked about energy security, which is part of the reasoning behind not supporting the Bill. I mentioned this in respect of the interconnector. Deputy Eamon Ryan talked about bringing in climate experts and I agree with having a full debate at committee on this. Nobody was stopping it. Since we banned onshore fracking we have been actively encouraging that this debate take place. It would bring in groups like the International Energy Agency, some of the NGOs that are in the Gallery, oil producers and other reasonable groups that would have an interest and a view in respect of this topic. Deputy Coppinger talked about Fine Gael being climate deniers. We are certainly not. I do not know anybody within Fine Gael, within my parliamentary party, who does not believe that climate change is real and is an issue in our society. We fully believe that climate change is real. I have stated that numerous times. We have our policies on it. I do not know anybody within the parliamentary party who is denying climate change. People talk about capitalism and large oil exploration companies. I am not sure who we are going to get to build the offshore farms when they come, or the offshore renewables. They will be multi-million euro projects that are going to need investment from large companies and conglomerates. The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, mentioned the work that is being done on offshore renewables in respect of wave energy and floating pontoons for offshore wind turbines. I spoke at a conference here in Dublin last Friday morning. There was a mention of the Lir facility, the Galway Bay test site and the Belmullet test site, all of which are developing renewables. It was commented that we will be the Saudi Arabia of renewables. We have that potential in relation to renewables and it was said that we will be the leading country in the world but that technology is not here yet. It is advancing. We are supporting it. The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, is supporting it but it is not just here yet. I am also very worried by the objections to wind farms that we continuously have. I have seen it locally. It is a complex issue that impacts on people and I expect, unfortunately, that there might be a policy of some people objecting even to offshore wind production as well, when the time comes. When I signed the licence for Providence, there was this talk about 5 billion barrels of oil that were going to be burned. Not all oil that is found is actually burned. There is a huge number of uses for oil in the world, for plastics, medicine, bitumen for our roads, clothing, parachutes, safety glasses, golf balls, fishing rods, detergents, candles, credit cards, sunglasses, tents, guitar strings, shoe polish, contact lenses, eye glasses, toothpaste, antifreeze - there is a huge array of products that oil and hydrocarbons are used for in everyday society. We have to acknowledge that. Not all oil that can be discovered is actually burned. It is put to a lot of other uses. As an island, we also have to acknowledge that we are technology takers. I said on radio when I was debating with Senator Grace O'Sullivan that I would love to have a situation where we could say there was no need for oil or gas and that day will eventually come. However, as an island, for example, there is no alternative to jet fuel for people going on holidays until there are technology changes. There is the marine sector. There is perhaps technology in that sector in respect of hydrogen, but we are not there yet in terms of alternatives to those very important uses of hydrocarbons. I am not in a position to support the Bill. I have encouraged a debate in committee, a larger debate than just this Bill, about energy security and alternative uses. We fully support the climate change objectives. Our Department is encouraging those changes and I welcome the debate here and look forward to a larger debate in committee on overall energy policy.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	381	I am sharing time with Deputy Bríd Smith. We are taking five minutes each. The obfuscation and the attempt to throw mud in our eyes that I just heard from the Minister of State really is extremely disappointing. It puts to shame people like the man whose bust is behind me in the Chamber, James Connolly. In a quote that is very appropriate to this debate, he said, "Our demands most moderate are, we only want the Earth." That sums up what the Minister of State's attitude should be to this Bill. It is a modest demand to do what is absolutely necessary because we want the Earth for our children and our grandchildren. We do not want to sell that future out along with a sustainable existence for our children and grandchildren on the basis of short-term interests. That is what is at stake. It is simply beyond disputable fact that if we do not leave 80% of the known fossil fuel reserves in the ground, we are facing climate catastrophe. If we burn what is in the ground, global temperatures will rise by between 4° C and 6° C within the next 100 to 150 years. A 4° C reduction in temperature led to the last ice age and it took tens of thousands of years for that to happen and tens of thousands of years for the planet to recover from it. Imagine what a 4° C rise in temperature will do. We have no idea but it will be on a scale that is unimaginable. We will be literally selling the future of our children and grandchildren. This is already happening. It is not hypothetical. Some 21 million people have been displaced as a result of climate change; 16 of the warmest years on record have taken place within the last 17 years; sea levels are rising by 3.4 mm a year, the fastest rate in 2,000 years; a crack in the Larsen C ice shelf recently saw a 5,800 km block of ice, four times the size of London, break off the ice shelf and drift into the sea, leading to the sort of rise in sea levels that we are seeing. Flooding is due to triple by 2030 on a global scale with disastrous consequences and costs. What is the response of the Government to all of this? It is paying lip service to dealing with climate change while in reality bringing special pleading to the EU so we can get around having to meet the targets we need to meet. That is a pathetic record. We have had a 7% increase in emissions over the last two years. We are the third highest producers of emissions per person in the EU. There is failure on every level to invest in micro-generation, community-led renewables projects and failure to invest in expanding forest cover. We are missing our targets in terms of expanding the forest estate, failing to invest in public transport, to electrify the bus fleet, to reduce fares as Deputy Mick Barry already said, to introduce passive house standards, to reduce energy use, to retrofit old buildings to reduce energy use - failing to do anything, in fact, that would substantially impact on energy use and global emissions. This Government resists any tangible, concrete targets but engages in special pleading. This stuff has to stop.It was people power of the sort we have seen from the Stop Climate Chaos coalition, Trócaire, Friends of the Earth, the Not Here, Not Anywhere group and from the people in the Border counties that forced the ban on fracking on the Government. At the time it resisted amendments suggesting that we should ban offshore fracking. If we do that we will force ourselves and the State to look at all the other things we need to do. If the Government keeps saying we need to think about, debate and discuss issues, we will lose time. The clock is ticking on towards irreversible, runaway climate change. If the Government is serious, this is a Bill that it should absolutely support. It proposes that there will be no more exploration licences. It is not asking that we turn off the lights now but it proposes that no more exploration licences be issued and that this country starts to invest. As the State built Ardnacrusha, a hydroelectric station, and transformed this country, please do not tell me we need capitalists to develop our power sources. We did it in the 1920s when Ireland was a Third World country. 
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	382	I was not surprised to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, and the Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, state this measure is unrealistic and not credible and that it amounts to posturing and gesture politics. I was expecting that but not the lack of a sense of emergency. They say that our day will come, this will happen and that we should debate it over a long period. The point is being missed here. We have been debating this issue for three decades and the planet is heating up at a rapid pace. Ireland is missing its targets. It missed by up to 7% last year. We will not meet the EU targets in 2020 or 2030. We barely invest in public transport. The Minister of State, Deputy McHugh, called gas a transition fuel. There is no evidence of that. There is no evidence that natural gas is any less damaging to the planet than is oil and yet the Minister of State seems to speak with authority on these things. The carbon dioxide that accumulates in the atmosphere and drives climate change can come from anywhere in the world. It can come from China, Britain or Northern Ireland. The point is being missed. This is an emergency. The point is being missed by Deputy Michael Healy-Rae, who suggests that we wait and that the situation will change in time. We do not have time. The planet is hurtling towards catastrophe. The point of this Bill is not to say in an unrealistic, gesture-politics way that we can survive without oil and gas immediately and that we can immediately make it happen in some magical way. If this country, this Government and this House take the brave position of making a statement to the rest of the world that we intend to leave oil and gas in the ground and that we are not issuing any more exploration licences, not only will we be sending a signal globally but we will be sending a message to the greed and the power of the fossil fuel companies to the effect that they cannot get away with what they do everywhere and all the time. Amazing alternatives are available. When we were in Bonn, we went through the tents and looked at the technology that is being created throughout the world now to drive those alternatives forward but there is no political support for them. That is the problem. The political support to do something now is not present here and it is not present across Europe. We are failing to recognise that. We keep saying that we will be all right because we can trade off in transport and that we can pay the Third World for its emissions and give it some money to plant trees and do good things for the planet. That is not going to work. We have to make a stand and start to clean up our act. Carbon trading and offsets will not do it. Breakthroughs are not being looked at in a serious way here. I believe that if we give ourselves a kick up the backside by signalling that the future is not about fossil fuels but rather about renewables then consecutive Governments will be forced to really invest in them. I will conclude by citing Professor Kevin Anderson, who I mentioned earlier. He said one cannot fool nature. One can talk all one wants and pretend one is doing something to deal with climate change but the reality remains that we continue to emit more carbon dioxide by using more gas and more oil. Carbon dioxide levels continue to rise at an increasing speed and it is bringing us towards an historic catastrophe.  I thank the other parties in the House which have indicated their strong support. We hope that we will get this Bill past the next Stages. I thank all of the environmental campaigning groups, particularly the young people who passionately want the Minister to pass this Bill.  We have a very modern Taoiseach in Leo Varadkar, who likes to be identified with changing the world in similar ways to Justin Trudeau and other modern-type leaders of this world. He should make a stand and back this Bill and begin to change his own party's mind. Ireland will go down in history if it backs this measure as one of four small countries in the world which are saying to the big powers that we should save the planet now and stop taking more gas and oil out of the ground.

We obviously agree with the thrust of the Bill and acknowledge that more archives are going to come into the public domain. The worry we have as a party is that the Bill as it stands could allow for a Minister in the future to make decisions on the basis of the Bill which might be political. What we are simply trying to do with these amendments is depoliticise those decisions. All of us have loyalties to our own political parties and objectives and often archives can shine a light on actions of colleagues or foes. For a Minister to have such a clear power to determine whether archives will be made available etc. creates a difficulty. That is the reason these amendments have been tabled.

I thank Deputy Tóibín. We discussed this considerably on 7 December on Committee Stage. However, I will make some opening comments in regard to it. The role of the Information Commissioner is defined under the Freedom of Information Act 2014. Amendments Nos. 1 and 3, if carried, would give a co-decision role to the Information Commissioner before a Government Minister could agree to transfer records to the National Archives after 20 years. My Department has been in contact with the Office of the Information Commissioner and, as the Deputy knows, he has informed us that he would be reluctant to take on what appears to be a decision making role that may not fit with his statutory role as Information Commissioner. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also supports that view. I am aware the Deputy is concerned there may be political influence over the early release of documents. All decisions on records to be released under this proposed legislation will be taken in consultation with the Director of the National Archives, John McDonagh, whose functions are enshrined in legislation in section 4(1) of the National Archives Act 1986. In a sense, he is a neutral voice separate to the political process. The input of the director as provided for in section 4 of this Bill allows for the balance the Deputy seeks. I therefore cannot accept amendments Nos. 1 and 3. In regard to amendment No. 2, and again we discussed this on Committee Stage, the Deputy is requesting the substitution of the word "may" with "shall". The procedure proposed in the National Archives (Amendment) Act is cumulative. I have to say to the Deputy that I consulted with the Attorney General subsequent to our committee meeting on 7 December regarding any proposals to substitute the word "may" with "shall" and he has said that it is cumulative and that before I make any order, I must first consult with the director and obtain the consent of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and other relevant members of Government pursuant to paragraph (a). Second, I also have to be satisfied as to the matters referred to in paragraph (b). To clarify for the House, paragraph (b) states: The Minister may make an order under this subsection where he or she is satisfied that—(i) (I) the records concerned are of significant historical or public interest such as to warrant their transfer to the National Archives, or(II) the transfer of the records concerned to the National Archives will facilitate the balanced and fair reporting of matters of common interest to the State and other jurisdictions,and(ii) the arrangements for such transfer are adequate.If the word "shall" is placed in paragraph (b) that could lead to confusion as to whether I, as Minister, must make an order if I am satisfied as to the matters referred to at paragraph (b), notwithstanding the conditions provided for in the previous paragraph, that is, consulting with the Director of the National Archives and obtaining the consent of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and other relevant members of Government. I cannot make such an order, therefore, unless I have consulted with the director, received the consent of the relevant parties and I am satisfied as to the matters referred to in paragraph (b). I therefore cannot accept the amendment.

First and foremost are the difficulties with a political decision being made by the Government on whether a particular document will be made available and then the issue of whether the resources will be made available to the Department in order for the Department to be able to carry out its work. As we know, the Department and the National Archives have had difficulty in dealing with much of their workload in recent years. There is a general feeling that there will be a weakness in this process in making sure these archives are made available to the general public.
#JosephaMadigan	unknown-#JosephaMadigan-party	unknown-#JosephaMadigan-dob	unknown-#JosephaMadigan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	400	Again, we discussed this on Committee Stage. If we were to accept the amendment it would put the records at risk. The transfer of departmental records more than 30 years old, the subject of the amendment, is dealt with in the main Act. Essentially, this proposed legislation mirrors the current requirements in the existing legislation where the Director of the National Archives will be responsible for ensuring that arrangements for the transfer of files are adequate, both in the Department responsible for transferring them but also in the capability of the National Archives to take them. This amendment seeks to delete a provision included in the proposed legislation that assures the safety of the archives. This requirement that the arrangements for the transfer of records are adequate is a long-standing provision in the existing legislation. If this amendment is adopted, it could put records at risk as it would suggest that records could be transferred in a situation where the storage facilities are not adequate. We consulted with the Director of the National Archives, John McDonagh, who said there are not sufficient resources currently to take all of the archives over 20 years old. That is particularly relevant as the National Archives are embarking on a major upgrading of its facilities on Bishop Street. There is an €8 million development plan and it will take a number of years to complete. The amendment the Deputy is proposing would remove the flexibility that the archives have currently to best manage the intake of records. In the circumstances, I consider that this amendment could put records at risk and, therefore, I cannot accept the amendment.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	401	I apologise on behalf of Deputy Niamh Smyth who is at a function commemorating Countess Markievicz. Fianna Fáil is happy to support the Bill, which is in the interests of Government transparency. It is important that the Republic of Ireland aligns itself in this regard with Britain and Northern Ireland so that we can get across our side of the story in respect of the release of State papers of relevance to Anglo-Irish relations in particular. Fianna Fáil is concerned that many Departments are failing to transfer their records to the National Archives, which matter requires attention. We are also concerned that no system is in place to manage digital records. We hope the Government through the Minister will take progressive steps to ensure Departments meet their statutory responsibilities in relation to archive management and put in place a proper archival management system for digital records. I was very interested to see the release of the State papers from 1987 because they were of particular interest to me and my family. A letter was released, allegedly send by the UVF to my father, the then Taoiseach, informing him that MI5 had asked the UVF to assassinate him. That was obviously of some concern. It shows what information can be released and the importance of these State papers. The alleged letter from the UVF is something that needs to be investigated further, although it is probably not a matter for the House this evening. Certainly, it is something I will be looking into. Fianna Fáil supports the Bill which is in the interests of transparency. I hope it will benefit historians in particular and ensure that important papers on Anglo-Irish relations and the Northern Ireland situation are released simultaneously in the Republic and in the United Kingdom.

I agree with Deputy Haughey that the difference in release dates between the two countries has been a major problem. The British have obviously been ahead of the game and, as a result, could release papers into the public domain giving their perspective, thus colouring public understanding of serious events in the history of this State. At the time of the release of the particular letter to which Deputy Haughey referred regarding threats to his father's life, I was really struck by the lack of response from the Government. We had documentary evidence of a very strong allegation that the life of a Taoiseach of this country was under a significant threat emanating from the sovereign Government of the neighbouring island through the UVF. However, there was no response from the Government to that information whatsoever. There are many people in Dublin and elsewhere who are very aware that the British are also sitting on documents relating to the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. There is a refusal and a strong reluctance to permit those documents to be made available. The objective of a modern Government should be a transparent democracy. To have a transparent democracy, we must ensure that information is placed in the public domain. When that information is in the public domain, it allows citizens to make better choices and to understand the processes and the systems around them to a great extent. It allows them to hold those systems to account. My only concern - albeit a strong one - is that we are not providing the necessary resources for Departments to make these archives available within the time provided for in the Bill or for those documents to be processed in such a way as to make them digitally accessible to citizens. I have not been convinced otherwise as yet. I urge the Minister of State to ensure that those issues are addressed.

It is very important that our shared history is reflected in an adequate way. They are quite correct that the UK has been five years ahead of us since 2013. The 1987 records were released on 1 January 2018 whereas the papers released in the UK on that date related to 1992. It is important to have a synchronised release of official records in order that we can ensure, as both Deputies pointed out, that the Irish side of the story, particularly regarding Anglo-Irish and North-South relations, is reflected in a comprehensive way. That is why the Bill is very important. In the context of Deputy Haughey's late father, I note the provision in section 8 of the principal Act that provides for the retention of any record which "would or might cause distress or danger to living persons on the grounds that it contains information on individuals, or would or might be likely to lead to an action for damages for defamation." Of course, that only applies to living persons but it is an important protective clause. I thank the Deputies for their comments. The legislation provides a mechanism to ensure that records over 20 years old which are of significant historic or public interest can be released to the National Archives and, thereby, to the public by recognising the significant resource issues which have been pointed out. I thank the Deputies for their co-operation in expediting the passage of the Bill.

Is sláinte an phobail atá i gceist. Ba cheart dúinn a chinntiú nach leanfar leis an réimeas atá againn faoi láthair. Ba chóir dúinn daoine óga, go háirithe, a chosaint. Is fiú freisin cosaint a thabhairt dóibh siúd atá gafa leis an alcól nó faoi gheasa ag an alcól. Aithnítear go bhfuil alcól agus drugaí fite fuaite lena chéile. Bíonn na tascfhórsaí timpeall na tíre ag déileáil ní hamháin le ceist na ndrugaí mídhleathacha ach freisin le drugaí eile agus cad a tharlaíonn dá réir, go háirithe dóibh siúd atá gafa leo. Le blianta anuas, déanann na tascfhórsaí déileáil leis an gceangal idir an alcól agus an tionchar atá ag an alcól ar ghnáthdhaoine. Tá an straitéis ceannann céanna i gceist sa dá chás. Nuair atáimid ag caint faoin ábhar seo, ní mór dúinn an cruachás ina bhfuil teaghlaigh timpeall na tíre, agus an tslí ina bhfuil siad ag déileáil leis na fadhbanna seo, a thuiscint. Go dtí seo, ba léir dóibh nach raibh aon chosaint acu.
Bhí siopaí, ollmhargaí agus off-licences nua á n-oscailt i ngach áit thart timpeall orthu agus iad ag díol an druga seo: alcól. Ní killjoy mise. Tá mise breá sásta deoch nó dhó, nó níos mó, a bheith agam ar ócáidí ach níl mé faoi gheasa ag an druga seo. Leis na blianta anuas tá an cruachás atá ag baint leis seo do theaghlaigh atá ar an ngannchuid feicthe againn. Fiú teaghlaigh a bhí go leor airgid acu, theip orthu déileáil leis seo. Bhí daoine sa tír seo a raibh gnólachtaí móra le fostaithe acu agus bhí saol teaghlaigh maith acu. Tar éis bliain nó dhó tugtha don ól nó do dhrugaí, áfach, ní raibh pingin rua fágtha. Sin an sórt rud atá i gceist. Ní raibh aon chosaint ann dóibh agus bhí fógraí i ngach áit thart timpeall orthu agus iad ag brú alcóil orthu. Bhí na fógraí seo ar an teilifís, sna nuachtáin, ag stadanna bus agus ar an raidió. Anois tá an reachtaíocht seo ag iarraidh déileáil leis seo agus molaim é. Ar a laghad, táimid sásta bogadh ar aghaidh agus iarracht a dhéanamh chun déileáil leis seo. Measaim nach dtéann an reachtaíocht fada go leor ó thaobh réimse amháin de ach táim sásta tacú leis an mBille seo. Araon le gach duine eile sa Teach seo, fuair mé a lán litreacha agus achainí ó dhreamanna ar nós Retail Ireland, vintners' assocations agus a leithéid. Bhí comhlachtaí atá lonnaithe i mo cheantar féin ag impí orm gan tacú leis an mBille seo, agus tuigim iad. Tuigim cé chomh mór is atá an gnó seo, tuigim an méid infheistíochta a dhéanann siad ann, agus tuigim go mb'fhéidir go mbeidh siad beagáinín thíos leis ar feadh tréimhse. Ní sin atá i gceist, áfach. Is é an Stát atá thíos leis agus an fhadhb seo leis an alcól againn le ró-fhada anois. Tá gá dúinn seasamh éigin a ghlacadh mar tá na rialacha agus na ceadúnais chomh scaoilte sin nach fiú iad a bheith ann in aon chor. Tá an reachtaíocht seo chun rialacha a chur i bhfeidhm a dhéanfaidh sé níos deacra alcól a fheiscint, ní hamháin i bhfógraí ach sna hionaid atá a dhíol chomh maith. I mo cheantar féin, san áit atá m'oifig agam i mBaile Formaid, níl ag oscailt le déanaí ach siopaí geallghlacadóra agus siopaí ina bhfuil alcól á dhíol iontu. Ní off-licences atá i gceist agam. Tá an méid céanna off-licences ann le tamall maith de bhlianta. Sna siopaí agus sna ollmhargaí atá á n-oscailt, tá spás curtha ar leataobh chun póirtéir, fuisce agus a leithéid a dhíol. Caithfimid stop a chur leis sin ionas nach mbeidh páistí ag déanamh ceangal amach anseo idir an dinnéar nó milseán a cheannach agus slab beorach a cheannach. Seo ceann de na bealaí chun tús a chur leis an troid seo. Mar a dúirt mé, ní killjoy mise. Bainim sult as pionta nó dhó ach ní mise ceann dóibh siúd a bhíonn, mar a deirtear i mBéarla, locked nó fluthered gach deireadh seachtaine. Is fíorannamh a bhím san riocht sin. Tá daoine ann nach féídir leo maireachtáil gan a bheith ar meisce, áfach. Bíonn siad buckled nó, mar a deirtear i gCorcaigh, langered. Tá sraith fhocal ann agus ceapann daoine go bhfuil sé seo greannmhar ach tá sé seo an-dáiríre. Mar a dúirt mé, baineann sé seo le saol dhaoine. Beidh mé chun tosaigh i slí amháin ar mo pháirtí mar beidh mé ag rá nár chóir alcól a bheith ar díol in aon siopa sa tír seo agus go mbeadh sé ar díol in off-licences amháin, mar a bhíodh sé. Le drugaí eile a cheannach, bíonn ar dhuine dul go dtí an poitigéir. Is druga é seo agus ba chóir go mbeadh ceadúnas áirithe ann chun é a dhíol agus ní chóir go mbeadh sé ar fáil i measc nithe eile. Mar a dúirt mé, fuair mé achainí ó chomhlachtaí. Tá an comhlacht is mó in Éirinn a dhíolann alcól - Guinness - lonnatihe i mo cheantar féin. Tá comhlachtaí nua atá ag díol fuisce sa tír seo lonnaithe ann chomh maith. Nílim ag iarraidh go mbeadh siad dúnta nó go mbeadh poist caillte. Tá siad ag déanamh an oiread sin airgid, áfach, nach gcuirfeadh sé seo isteach orthu beag nó mór. Dúradh gur thug 800,000 duine cuairt ar a whiskey distillery visitor centre anuraidh. Dream mór é seo agus an chuid is mó acu ag teacht ó thar lear chun turas a thabhairt orthu seo. Níl an reachtaíocht seo ag cur cosc ar fhógraíocht lasmuigh den tír seo atá ag iarraidh turasóirí a mhealladh isteach sa tír chun cuairt a dhéanamh ar Guinness, the Dublin Liberties distillery atá le hoscailt i mo cheantar féin agus a leithéid. Tá Teeling ann cheana fein agus tá Guinness ag tógáil distillery eile. Tá roinnt mhaith mhór díobh seo ann agus níl siadsan chun alcól d'aon sórt a chur ar fáil ach amháin má tá brabús i gceist leis, agus brabús an-mhór atá i gceist. Ní gá ach féachaint ar cá bhfuil na comhlachtaí móra alcól timpeall an domhain. Tá siad i mbarr a réime faoi láthair mar tá níos mó daoine ná riamh ag ól. Ba chóir go mbeadh ceadúnas ag gach áit atá ag díol alcól agus baineann sé seo leis an Teach seo chomh maith céanna. Aon áit a bhfuil beár nó off-licence ann, ba chóir go mbeadh ceadúnas ann. Ó thaobh bialanna agus a leithéid, tuigim an t-athrú a tharla tamall maith de bhlianta ó shin ionas gur féidir le daoine suí síos agus buidéal beorach nó gloine fíona a bheith acu lena mbéile. Táimse ag déanamh tagairt do dhaoine atá ag ceannach peitril: bíonn 24 buidéal Budweiser nó Bulmer's, mar a ólann mise, os a gcomhair amach agus iad ar chostas an-íseal. Bíonn an costas i bhfad níos ísle ná mar a bhíonn sé in off-licences nó sna tithe tábhairne. Tá rud éigin mícheart nuair atá sé níos saoire dúinn dul áit éigin eile seachas na háiteanna atá an ceadúnas acu agus atá tar éis cloí leis na rialacha thar na blianta. Níl mé ag rá nach bhfuil fadhbhanna ann maidir le díolachán alcóil sna tithe tábhairne agus a leithéíd ach ní chóir go mbeadh muid ag ligean do níos mó áiteanna alcól a dhíol.  Tacaím go huile is go hiomlán leis an reachtaíocht seo. Mar a dúirt mé, ba chóir dó dul níos faide. Ba chóir go mbeadh muide sa Teach seo ag cur teachtaireachta chuig gnáthphobal na tíre agus chuig an aosóg go háirithe go bhfuil alcól dainséarach. Má tá sé dainséarach, ba chóir go mbeadh rialacha speisialta ann chun a dhéanamh cinnte de nach bhfuil sé ag déanamh damáiste d'ár sochaí amach anseo. Ní hamháin in Éirinn atá an fhadhb. Tá an fhadhb ann i dtíortha eile timpeall na hEorpa chomh maith. Molaim an Bille agus tacóidh an páirtí leis. Ba chóir go mbeadh sé níos láidre, áfach. Tá go leor airgid ag na comhlachtaí móra chun teacht timpeall ar an mBille seo sna bealaí a thagann siad timpeall ar chosc ar fhógraíocht alcóil i dtíortha eile.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	405	I very much welcome the Bill. It has been a long time coming and I might talk later about how we got here. The Labour Party will broadly be supporting the Bill. There are a couple of issues that need to be further explained, particularly to the public and those who work in the industry, and a couple of tweaks that may be possible. I want to acknowledge those who have worked on this Bill in the past, including the former Minister, Mr. Alex White, and, in particular, the former Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, who put a lot of work into it and did not get much thanks for her efforts. It is possible that if she did not have the job of bringing in this Bill, she might still be sitting in the second row of Ministers across the Chamber. I want to acknowledge her role because she fought very hard for this. As I said, I am broadly in support of this Bill for the obvious reasons that everyone in the House has spoken about. We have a serious problem with alcohol in this country. Ireland is the fourth heaviest drinking nation in the OECD in terms of quantity of pure alcohol consumed. We have a serious problem with binge drinking and we can see this all around us in our everyday lives. People are now nearly consuming more alcohol at pre-drinks gatherings than they do when they go out for drinks.We can see it all around us, including in colleges, but it goes beyond that. Often when people meet in houses before going out, they consume more than when they actually go out.  It is causing real issues. We know about the health issues it causes and I emphasise the mental health issues. The long-term impact on mental health as a result of abuse of alcohol is seismic. Other long-term impacts include diseases, including liver disease in particular. It is a great cost to the State. The level of deaths attributable to this issue is beyond debate. It is a fact. As a country we need to wake up and deal with this issue in a real way. This Bill is a significant contribution to doing so. As Labour's health spokesperson, I know that I could find many different ways of spending the level of funding that goes on dealing with health issues caused by alcohol misuse. I have spoken to many emergency department workers, nurses, doctors and even managers of various hospitals, who have told me of the amount of time and funding that goes on this and the chaos that it creates, especially at night, as a consequence of accidents or other alcohol-induced injuries or health failures. Our emergency departments are being clogged up as a result. It also causes serious domestic and social issues. We need to deal with this and do so quickly for future generations.  I am conscious that this Bill is being brought in to help future generations. As the father of six and seven year old children, I am very conscious of that. I am concerned by children's exposure to alcohol. I have a daughter who is fanatical about the GAA and with a father from Tipperary and a mother from Kerry, she is interested in matches and goes to Croke Park quite often. The Minister of State's native county is improving but he would not be there as often as I am. I have spoken about this in the past. I have become very conscious of being surrounded by alcohol advertising and alcohol itself and imagery of it, which is not something I was conscious of in the way I am now, as I bring children to matches and so on.  We need to do this work to ensure that future generations are protected, that they are socialised around alcohol in a respectful way, that in later years they understand what alcohol is about, and that their first interaction with alcohol is not about drunkenness but about people socialising and enjoying themselves. The principle is not about getting drunk but people interacting and socialising. I have heard many contributions outside of this House. I will return to the matter of lobbying on this issue later. It has been argued that this legislation is a push towards bringing in legislation that would be akin to having a nanny state. It is anything but that. It is progressive, positive legislation. There are issues I seek to have dealt with in the Bill but in principle, it is good legislation. Our country must adapt to the circumstances in which we find ourselves. Ultimately it is a public safety issue.  We cannot abdicate responsibility and we need to deal with the issue. I mentioned social issues earlier. I have been very taken by radio advertisements I have heard recently, which feature a mother and father who cannot get out of bed on a Saturday morning, having previously promised their children that they would take them to the park. People have mentioned it to me. It is a true story that happens in every town and county in Ireland each weekend, whether it is Saturday or Sunday mornings. I dare say it probably happens often during the week too. It reflects the social impact of alcohol abuse on people.  As for the changes to be brought about by the Bill, I welcome the lead-in times for the various components. It is important in allowing the industry to adapt to the measures. I have a query about the HSE's role in giving evidence in the granting of renewal of licence or granting licences and would like the Minister of State to explain this in greater detail. Clearly it is about giving an opinion on whether a licence should be renewed but I would like more detail on the emphasis on this and why this has been chosen. On labelling, this obviously is one of the most contentious issues and is one with which we must deal. There was considerable emphasis on it during the Seanad debate on the Bill. Undoubtedly, we will have to have health labelling and I welcome this, and the areas that it will cover. I will sound a word of caution, however, not merely regarding the size of labels, and so on. It will have a particular impact on the smaller producers such as craft brewers here and this should be borne in mind. As someone who is sponsoring other legislation to support them as a growing indigenous industry nationwide, it would not appropriate for me to speak without raising that. There is a big difference between the cost to a small craft brewer and to Diageo. Obviously, alcohol is alcohol and it does the same damage regardless of whoever produces it. Nevertheless, it is something that ought to be dealt with. The Minister of State should work in parallel with our European colleagues on the pan-European progress that has been made, at European Council and European Parliament levels, on the approach to labelling and health warnings across alcohol products in the EU. I say this for genuine reasons. I was a Member of the European Parliament for two years. It was being discussed when I was there in 2009 and it is still being discussed. I am concerned that we need to do that in parallel with what is being done in this Bill because I am not sure whether this legislation will cut the mustard in terms of European law. We must undertake a process and there will be a pre-warning for six months. I want to make sure that one way or another, that labelling will be in place at a European level. Unfortunately, my reading of this measure leaves me unconvinced that it will go through as smoothly at a European level as some believe.I include that as a word of caution in order to emphasise that there needs to be a parallel process at a European level to look at this. I have been an advocate of minimum unit pricing for a long time. I have to say I have heard some amount of rubbish from some in the industry stating that this will change the price of certain products. The issue here is to deal with the cheap products that are causing damage all over the country - one can find the bottles and cans dispatched across parks and fields in both urban and rural locations around the country. I appreciate the examples that have been given by the Minister. I agree 100% with him on what is being proposed. Drinking in a controlled environment, as far as I am concerned, is the best option and the more we can change the manner in which people consume alcohol from an uncontrolled environment to a controlled environment, the better. It is the right way to go. If we have to move on this minimum unit pricing again after it is implemented in order to push it in that direction, I believe we should do so. Ultimately, the way in which alcohol is being consumed, because of the pricing differential, is a real issue. I also note in the Bill the prohibition on changing the prices in a period of time, in other words, having happy hours and then resuming normal pricing. I ask the officials here to look positively at a further change to that, and it is to do with an element of competition here. I believe the Minister is correct in getting rid of happy hours and other forms of promotion, such as those that would allow two for one, but if one goes down to Temple Bar on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday, one will also encounter the practice where the price of a pint goes from, dare I say it, €6.20 to, an hour later, €7.20, and an hour later again it could be €8.20. As part of this process, I believe there is a way in which the price of a drink sold in a premises within 24 hours, or some defined period in legislation, cannot change. It is a way of dealing with what is obviously a competitive issue as well. When it comes to advertising at sporting events and advertising in general, I very much welcome the changes that are being brought about. I have spoken previously about the impact of advertising at sporting events. I love sports and I played rugby for years. When I talk, it is still not the European champions cup. It is the Heineken Cup in my head and dare I say among most supporters who are in my case fanatical about Munster. That shows the impact it has. It becomes ingrained. Personally, I cannot stand Heineken. I would never drink it but that is not the issue. I still call it the Heineken Cup. Therefore I very much welcome the changes that are being brought about here. There is also a practical issue here in relation to local advertising. Whether it be the local pub, gastro-pub or whatever premises that sells alcohol, it needs to be facilitated and is so through this legislation. In relation to the display issue which was so fraught in the Seanad, I believe the three options that have been brought about through much negotiation are good and deal with this issue. That was necessary and had to be brought about. I very much welcome them. In relation to the advertising thresholds as regards broadcasting, I note the distinction between television and radio. I ask the Minister to respond as regards why that distinction is there, particularly in the case of radio. I understand the volume of times that children listen to radio or watch television has been agreed with broadcasters but there are also summer holidays and all such types of changes. I would welcome more information on that. I very much welcome the prohibition of advertisements in certain places, such as open spaces and public parks, but I question how it will be monitored to ensure it will work. When it comes to selling alcohol from off-licences, a real issue which is worthy of further discussion is one of manner and scale - dare I say it is particularly young people but not confined to them. They can go into off-licences and buy huge volumes of alcohol. One will see them coming out with their three or four slabs of whatever. I probably do not favour us having a discussion about age limits here but I am open to a discussion on increasing the age limit or whether we must have a situation where persons of a certain age are only allowed purchase a certain amount of alcohol in an off-licence. Frankly, we all know what is happening. The 18 year old is going in, getting the slabs of alcohol and dishing them out to those who are under age. One can see it around the place. I believe that is an issue that needs to be looked at in some way in the future because it is happening in front of our eyes every day of the week. I am not one of those who places much meas on large-scale lobbying but when it comes to this Bill, the volume of lobbying that has come across the desks of all of us has been considerable. I am the type of person who generally reacts the opposite way if I feel that a certain amount of the lobbying has been excessive and in this instance I believe that to be the case. Obviously, the drinks industry is such a large industry. It is an industry that employs many. As a Member who is bringing legislation through the Houses to support small brewers, I believe it is an industry that deserves support. However, it is also an industry that has to be responsible, that has to accept facts and that has to listen. I believe those are lessons that the industry would very much need to heed. It is also an industry which needs to be assessed for its adherence to competition law and this is something that I will return to in this House. There are certain issues within the industry as to the way certain large-scale alcohol manufacturers, such as breweries, are behaving from the point of view of competition law that need to be brought out into the open and discussed more freely. It has a distorting effect when it comes to sales, when it comes to the capacity to advertise and, obviously, when it comes to their influence on consumers, in particular younger people, and by extension the volume of alcohol that is being consumed in our country. Certainly, there are lessons to be learned from that. I very much welcome this Bill. I have spoken on elements of it previously, in the Joint Committee on Health and in other fora. There are a number of issues that I have raised on which I would appreciate a response from the Minister. I raised issues relating to labelling. Who is responsible for labelling when product is being sold and exported? Is it the retailer? Is it the wholesaler? When product is being imported, who is responsible for the labelling that will be put on products? I have asked specific questions and I would appreciate, in his own time, the Minister coming back to me.

#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	407	We will share that time. We are debating this Bill because major public health issues surround alcohol in this country. Many people enjoy their alcohol, have a positive relationship with it and look on it as a positive in their lives but many people do not. I will read some facts into the record. There are 88 deaths every month in Ireland that are directly attributable to alcohol. One in four deaths of men aged 15 to 39 in Ireland is alcohol-related. Every day 1,500 beds in our hospitals are occupied by people with alcohol-related problems. This incurs a huge cost to both the individuals affected and to society. The annual cost to the health service of alcohol-related disease is €1.5 billion. The estimated cost to the State when non-health issues, such as driving offences, violence, domestic violence, mental health and child welfare issues, are added to this is €2.35 billion. In 2016 an estimated 300,000 working days were lost due to alcohol. This is a modest Bill. The restrictions it would place on the alcohol industry are relatively mild compared with those that have been placed on the industry in other countries, including other European countries. However, in opposition to the Bill we have seen on the part of a multi-billion-euro industry a lobbying campaign of which there have not been many similar examples in recent years or even further back in time. University students of the future might well do theses on the lobbying campaign that was waged by big business in the form of the alcohol industry to take the teeth from this Bill and to have it watered down.The Irish Times has published some fascinating information about this lobbying campaign which I will read into the record of the House. It refers to lobbying in the form of face-to-face meetings, receptions, letters, emails, contact through social media etc. from the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, ABFI, the Vintners Federation of Ireland, Retail Excellence Ireland, RGDATA, the Convenience Stores & Newsagents Association, Heineken, the DAA, Slane Castle Irish Whiskey Limited and an organisation called Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland Limited. A colleague saw the latter name and wondered whether there had been a split and the other faction might be called irresponsible retailers of alcohol in Ireland limited. Incidentally, Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland Limited is chaired by a former IDA chief executive officer, Padraic White. The article in The Irish Times indicates some of the lobbying that has gone on. On behalf of the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, Ms Patricia Callan made six contacts with Ministers, five with Ministers of State, one with the Taoiseach's chief of staff, six with special advisers, two with assistant departmental secretaries, 15 with Deputies, 21 with Senators and one with an MEP. Also on behalf of ABFI, Mr. Jonathan McDade made five contacts with Senators. His colleague Lorraine Hall made seven contacts with Senators, three with special advisers and one with a Deputy. Mr. William Lavelle, a former special adviser at the Department of Justice and Equality, made one contact with a Minister, two with Ministers of State and two with Fine Gael Deputies. The director of the public relations firm Q4, former Fianna Fáil general secretary Martin Mackin, lobbied against the Bill. He contacted six Fianna Fáil Deputies, six Senators and one special adviser. This is a major campaign. Let us consider the way in which it has operated. The following amendments were suggested to Senators by Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland Limited. The first amendment it suggested to section 20 of the Bill was, "In page 21, line 23, to delete 'one year' and substitute 'two years'". Lo and behold, an amendment was tabled in the name of Senator Swanick stating, "In page 21, line 23, to delete "one year" and substitute "two years"." The second amendment suggested by Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland, RRAI, read, "In page 21, lines 28 to 30, to delete all words from and including 'through' in line 28 down to and including line 30." Senator Swanick tabled an amendment stating, "In page 21, lines 28 to 30, to delete all words from and including "through" in line 28 down to and including line 30." The third amendment proposed by the RRAI read, "In page 22, to delete lines 17 and 18." Senator Swanick tabled an amendment stating, "In page 22, to delete lines 17 and 18." The fourth amendment proposed by the RRAI was, "In page 22, to delete lines 33 and 34 and substitute with the wording of what constitutes a stand-alone off licence in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008". Senator Swanick tabled a very similar amendment. The RRAI recommended, in page 23, line 3, to delete "one year" and substitute "two years". Senator Swanick tabled an amendment stating, "In page 23, line 3, to delete “one year” and substitute “two years”." The sixth and last amendment suggested by the retailers was, in page 23, line 9, after "not", to insert the words "immediately adjoin a storage unit or storage units containing other beverages or food products". Senator Swanick, showing a bit of independence here, tabled an amendment stating "after “not” to insert [one word, namely] “immediately”", which is only slightly different. This was a cut-and-paste job on the part of a Fianna Fáil Senator as the Bill was being debated.

In any case, I think what the alcohol industry has done here is to use the Seanad debate to water down the proposals concerning the separation of alcohol from other products in shops in order that it not be sold alongside the cornflakes. As we know, 37% of wine sales are impulse buys. The idea of separation was a very positive idea but the alcohol industry has watered it down very significantly and now it is moving on to the next stage in trying to gut this Bill, focusing its energies on the issue of the health warnings. We support the health warnings. It is a fact that every year in Ireland 900 people are diagnosed with, and 500 people die of, alcohol-related cancers. That is what the alcohol industry is trying to water down. Health warnings have been effective against smoking; they will be effective against alcohol abuse. There are some issues around minimum unit pricing we might like to tease out on Committee Stage. There is a need to change the culture surrounding alcohol in this country. The health impact of alcohol is overwhelming. It can best be tackled by cultural change and increased awareness of the negative health effects of alcohol misuse. In general, we do not think that increasing prices on inelastic goods is the most effective way to reduce consumption and alcohol misuse. While we do not believe that increases in the price of alcohol or other drugs even such as tobacco is a way to resolve misuse, we are still without doubt very supportive of this Bill and will vote for it. However, we want to engage in some further debate on the issue of minimum pricing. Time is kicking in, so I will be very quick to conclude. We think the proposals regarding advertising and children are positive but that in general they do not go far enough. There should not be links between sports and advertising; in fact, there should be a ban on alcohol advertising. I will restate my starting position. In this debate there are, on the one hand, the health professionals and, on the other, a multi-billion-euro industry, which wants to put its profits above the health of people. This is progressive legislation. If anything, it does not go far enough. There are some issues with minimum pricing we want to debate at the next Stage, but our stance on the Bill is a very supportive one.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	413	On behalf of People Before Profit, we are supportive of the overall aims of the Bill and pretty much all of the measures it proposes. There is no doubt about the health and societal implications of excessive use of alcohol. The World Health Organization states drinking alcohol is associated with risks of developing health problems such as mental and behavioural disorders, liver cirrhosis, some cancers, cardiovascular diseases and injuries resulting from violence and road crashes and collisions. A significant proportion of the disease burden attributable to alcohol consumption arises from unintentional and intentional injuries, including those due to road traffic crashes, violence and suicide, and fatal alcohol-related injuries tend to occur in relatively younger age groups. In 2012, approximately 3.3 million deaths, or 5.9%, of all global deaths were attributable to alcohol consumption. Harmful alcohol use is the fifth leading cause of death and disability worldwide, up from being the eighth biggest cause in 1990, so the problem is getting worse. Every ten seconds somebody dies from a problem related to alcohol. Many more develop alcohol-related diseases. Here in Ireland there are three alcohol-related deaths every day. The public cost of alcohol is significant. In 2013, alcohol-related discharges accounted for 160,000 bed days in public hospitals. That is 3.6% of all bed days in that year, and it compares to 55,000 bed days, or 1.7%, of total number of bed days in 1995. There has been more than doubling of the number of alcohol-related discharges and bed days related to alcohol. The cost to the taxpayer of alcohol-related discharges from hospital is €1.5 billion. That is equivalent to €1 in every €10 spent on public health in 2012. This excludes the costs of emergency cases, GP visits, psychiatric admissions and alcohol treatment services. An estimated 5,315 people on the live register in November 2013 lost their jobs due to alcohol use, and the estimated cost of alcohol-related absenteeism was €41 million in 2013. A separate review commissioned by the Department of Health found that alcohol-related illness costs the health care system €800 million in 2013. It is right that we should take the issue extremely seriously and recognise it for the major global and national health problem it represents. The Government bringing forward this Bill indicates a desire to take it seriously. I cannot help but contrast the sensationalism around medicinal cannabis that we got from some of those expressing concerns about it, as against the failure to dramatise just how serious is the alcohol problem. This is something I said during the debate on medicinal cannabis because many of those who tried to cast concern about Deputy Gino Kenny's medicinal cannabis Bill did so on health grounds. Frankly, some of it was tantamount to scare tactics, when we compare what I have just described regarding what is known about alcohol with the fact that cannabis use does not cause cancer, no deaths are attributed to it, it does not produce diabetes or heart disease and it has many medicinal uses. I would like to see some balance and proportionality in the debate on these issues, and a recognition that the advantages of medicinal cannabis significantly outweigh the dangers. This is not to say there are not some dangers with medicinal cannabis but, frankly, some of the debate on the Bill failed to put those things in proportion for somewhat opportunistic reasons in my opinion. That is just an aside. The more important thing is the health and societal implications of alcohol are very serious, as I have said, and the evidence is there to back it up. In this context, the measures the Bill proposes are positive. I absolutely support the labelling of alcohol with health warnings. Advertising having to include health warnings is certainly a step forward, and the restrictions on advertising for alcohol are all steps forward, as are the restrictions on sponsorship and advertising on television and radio, but we should go much further. None of the alcohol companies tried to meet us, because we would tell them where to get off. We do not give a damn about the impact of any of these measures on the profits they might make because the health case is simply unanswerable, as is the societal case. It is a good thing to reduce alcohol use for all sorts of reasons and, therefore, we do not care about health measures impacting on the profits of these companies. We would like to see a complete ban on advertising and alcohol-related sponsorship. The health dangers of alcohol are at the same level as those of cigarettes and it should be treated in the same way. There are many people who do not have an irresponsible relationship to alcohol. We are not setting out to penalise them but we need to not be worried about the profits of the multibillion euro industry. We do have questions on minimum unit pricing and concerns as to whether it will actually have the impact the Government believes it might. There is some relationship between price and consumption, but it is not clear to me in terms of health issues, binge issues and other spin-off societal issues, such as mental health issues, that introducing minimum pricing will significantly impact on them. Critically, there is potentially a danger, as is the case with other intoxicants, that when things are banned they are driven underground into the black market and the consequences can potentially be worse. The evidence also shows that if people have a problem with alcohol, they will seek out the highest concentrations of alcohol where they can get them, and if they cannot get them by paying for them legally, they will get them elsewhere. I am not convinced, and obviously there are consequences for those who have a responsible relationship with alcohol, in terms of what alcohol products will be hit by the minimum pricing, particularly affecting people on lower incomes and the less well-off without necessarily having the health impacts the Government hopes for. We need to debate this issue more seriously.If we want to address the problems associated with alcohol, what we need is a massive public education effort. Information about the health risks should be spread in schools, in communities and at every level. We need investment in some of the communities that are worst hit by the impacts of alcohol misuse, addiction and so on. That cultural shift, and investment in communities that are particularly badly hit by these things, are the most effective ways of dealing with the negative societal and health impacts of alcohol misuse.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	417	I support the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015, though I did have initial reservations regarding the structural segregation of alcohol, particularly where smaller retail outlets are concerned. That has been addressed following the pressure applied by the retail industry. I support the Bill as a public health initiative. Though the Bill will not solve the cultural love affair that we have with alcohol, it will have a positive impact in changing our drinking culture, particularly among young people. That is where our efforts must be addressed, because we are past intervention. We are not going to change the habits of older people who have grown used to drinking and made it a part of their culture. However, it may highlight the idea among parents that when they drink, they are setting an example for their children. That is an aspect of this issue that people have to deal with.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, we are going to have to do a lot more in the communities and I will outline one of the reasons. When I was younger, I played basketball and a lot of sports. The one thing young people all did afterwards was go for a drink. Prize-giving ceremonies, awards of medals and trophies etc., would all take place somewhere where there was drink. That still goes on among young men and women playing football, though probably not as much. It is not prevalent at the professional level but I refer to the community level. There will have to be an examination of alternatives that can be put in place for those communities. Where does one go after a football match? What activities does one participate in? Team sports are a great thing, because people make friends and bond with others. The bonds are made for life. I still have three good friends from my time playing sport. They live in Cork, Australia and elsewhere but we still keep in contact because of that sporting connection. That is a very important part of the community, particularly in working-class communities. That question is not really addressed here but it must be deeply examined. How do we fund a community to provide alternatives for younger people as to where to go afterwards and where to socialise? I can only work from my own life experience. When I was 12 or 13 years old, my father did not have a very big drinks cabinet, as he could not afford it. This was the early 1970s. However, because of the culture around drink, the peer pressure that takes effect, my friends and I would go to the cabinet and take a bit of whiskey. We would put a bit of water into the bottle so my father would not notice. He would have noticed when half the bottle's contents were gone but he would not have noticed it initially. That is what my generation did when we were younger. The supermarkets did not have huge displays of alcohol. There were no off-licences in the early 1970s. However, drinking was still a part of the culture for young people growing up. Nowadays there is a huge amount of advertising and lots of drink is in kids' faces as they walk in the door of the shop. I think that segregation can play a role in mitigating that. I am a public representative on the Canal Communities Local Drugs and Alcohol Task Force. I participated in many initiatives undertaken by the task force in the local community to try to highlight the issues around alcohol. We promote responsible drinking, encouraging people to enjoy it but not to depend on it. There has been a lot of debate about avoiding a nanny state that dictates what people can and cannot do. However, I think public policy can play a very positive role in explaining the health implications of alcohol. The task force must be given more direction on what to do in the alcohol aspect of its work. It must do more work and that effort should come from the task force itself, with help from the Department of Health. It must be funded for this, which is not the case at present. The task force does a lot of its work without additional resources, and this must be examined.  Three people a day die from alcohol-related illness and disease. We know the impact on families of a lot of alcohol in the family home and of having alcoholics in the home. I have a friend whose partner has a liver disease and is still drinking. He just has not got the ability to stop. It causes friction. The couple cannot go out socially and have one or two drinks as it always leads to more drink and chaos at the end of the night. This man collapses regularly and is constantly in and out of hospital. This is replicated all over the country. People like this are not isolated cases. They are in every street in Dublin, Cork and Kerry and so on. We know that 1,500 hospital beds are tied up in treating people with alcohol-related problems, such as cancer, liver failure, stroke, accidents suffered at home or accidents that occur in the street when coming out of pubs and nightclubs. How many times have we seen people in an accident and emergency department after a drinking session leading to an accident? I have probably been there myself. The sobering thought one has afterwards is that one has taken up the valuable time of medics, health nurses and doctors because of drunkenness. It is madness. Donal Buggy of the Irish Cancer Society reported that in Ireland in 2013, 12% of breast cancers were caused by alcohol. That equates to 353 a year. Every year there are 500 related cancer deaths. Liver disease has tripled within the 15 to 34 year old age group, particularly among men in their 20s. It is crazy. Those people put their lives at risk by drinking alcohol excessively. It must be excessive unless they already have a weakness in their liver.  Alcohol costs the health service €3.7 billion a year. The Road Safety Authority reports that 29% of fatal collisions involve drivers and motorcyclists who have consumed alcohol. Alcohol is a depressant and has contributed to 50% of all suicides. We have the fourth-highest rate of youth suicide in the EU. Alcohol is a killer.  If one considers the lobbying industry, I note the drinks industry lobbied Fianna Fáil Deputies to say the restrictions in this Bill were so strict that they would prevent the Christmas Guinness advertisements from being aired next year. That is true, but there is no harm in that. I remember that Guinness has used very professional advertisement agencies and sometimes created brilliant advertising. The one from the 1990 World Cup, featuring a man dancing to music around a barrel, always sticks with me. The advertisements are so good that the memory sticks with me 30 years later. That is how profoundly they can eat into one's psyche.  Producers, advertisers and sellers of alcohol want us to drink more and we as a nation need to drink less. That is why the lobbying industry puts so much money into lobbying Deputies, Senators, councillors, Ministers etc. in this Parliament. In an Alcohol Health Alliance opinion poll of members of the public, 92% of respondents agreed that alcohol consumption is too high; 78% were concerned about children's exposure to alcohol; 74% supported Government intervention to reduce alcohol consumption and protect people from alcohol-related harm; and 82% support Government action to curb alcohol marketing that appeals to young people.  Having said that, I will read a quotation from a journalist who recently published a piece on lobbying stating:Drinks industry representatives extensively lobbied Government Ministers, TDs and Senators about controversial legislation to deal with Ireland's alcohol crisis, according to the latest figures from the lobbying register. It is estimated the drinks sector, led by Ibec's umbrella group the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland ... had meetings with 14 Government Ministers and Ministers of State and 10 special advisers about the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill.The director of the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, ABFI, Ms Callan, lobbied six Cabinet Ministers, five Ministers of State, the Taoiseach's chief of staff, Brian Murphy, six special advisers, assistant secretaries in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, 15 Deputies, 21 Senators, Fine Gael MEP Seán Kelly and three councillors. That was her role in lobbying. All lobbyists had to list their contacts for the final three months of 2017 by 20 January last. The State register obliges lobbyists to list who they had contact with but not whether it was a meeting, telephone call, email or other informal contact. Contacts also include lobbying five Senators and a Dublin city councillor by the ABFI's Jonathan McDade, while a former special adviser at the former Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Lorraine Hall, lobbied seven Senators, three special advisers and Deputy Joe Carey from Clare on behalf of ABFI. A former special adviser at the Department of Justice and Equality, William Lavelle, lobbied the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, two Ministers of State and Deputies Colm Brophy and Tony McLoughlin for ABFI. The public relations firm Q4's director, former Fianna Fáil general secretary and Senator, Martin Macken, and Ms Hall of ABFI lobbied six Fianna Fáil Deputies, four Senators and Stephen Lynam, special adviser to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe. In an interview with The Irish Times, Ms Callan said she wanted the drinks industry to be allowed into the policy-making tent. She said, "What's really unusual in this job is that, sometimes, people don't want to talk to you at all. But this is a booming sector, which supports over 200,000 jobs." Countering that, Alcohol Action Ireland said that IBEC and the ABFI had "never really been outside the tent". That is very true. I support the Bill. This is an opportunity to see how lobbying works in this country from the point of view of big industries and big money. The alcohol industry wishes to sell more drink but, as a nation, we must drink less. That is what we must try to do.

Ba mhaith liom é sin a chur i gcomhthéacs. I am tempted to say I am looking forward to a drink after this debate and long day. There is nothing wrong with taking a drink. What we are discussing here is the abuse of drink. It is important to put the matter in perspective. For the first time, we are addressing alcohol as a public matter. I welcome that very much, given that the abuse of alcohol is responsible for approximately - I hate that word when talking about deaths - 90 deaths per month in this country and the accident and emergency departments are overwhelmed with drink-related problems and illnesses, not to mention the inter-generational effects of alcohol such as violence, assault and domestic violence. There are also the economic costs. In 2004, and the price has increased since then, the CEO of the Health Research Board provided figures on the economic costs. At that time it was €2.39 billion in combined health and crime-related costs and €527 million in lost economic output. The Minister clarified that the overall purpose of the Bill is to contribute to the reduction of the harmful use of alcohol or the harmful result of the abuse of alcohol. Indeed, the steering group gave a target of reducing alcohol consumption to 9.1 litres per capita, representing a 23% reduction over the 2010 figures. I welcome what is being attempted in the Bill, although I will return to the reservations I harbour. I welcome that the Bill targets some specific areas. I have no difficulty with that. One is price, although I have a guarded opinion on the minimum price and whether it will achieve what is hoped. However, I give it a guarded welcome. The other areas are availability and marketing. I welcome without hesitation the action on advertising, which does not go far enough but I will return to that, and the labelling. As many speakers have said, the minimum price seeks to target cheap alcohol consumed by those most at risk. We can estimate the value to society of introducing that if we extrapolate from the Sheffield research. I do that with a caveat because it is difficult to extrapolate and also because there will be no increase in the minimum price until after a three-year period. It is not clear if it will be linked to the consumer price index or adjusted for inflation. However, the estimated saving is €1.7 billion. These are important matters to be considered. I welcome the ban on advertising near schools and in parks, playgrounds and public transport, as well as the prohibition of price-based promotions. In particular, I welcome the ban on advertising on children's clothing. I also welcome section 21, which gives the Minister the power to restrict the sale and supply of alcohol products. I have a difficulty with where we are going in respect of alcohol and the serious nature of that issue in our country. There is a certain hypocrisy, not on the part of the Minister but on all our parts. As I said, half in jest but also seriously, I will enjoy a drink tonight. There is a certain amount of hypocrisy in the way we talk about alcohol and how to deal with it, while not acknowledging that we have failed utterly to treat the reasons people drink in the first place. I do not expect the Minister to capture all of that in one legislative measure. However, people drink for many reasons and we are not tackling those reasons. We do not lead by example when we celebrate. When the former President of the United States visited Ireland, we all delighted in the fact that he was seen drinking a pint of Guinness. When we go out, it is difficult to get a cup of tea at regular functions. It is much easier to get wine and so forth. The legislation utterly ignores off-licences, which are allowed to be as attractive as possible. What captured the difficulty for me was the attempt in the Bill, particularly before it was amended in the Seanad, to have physical barriers erected in shops, as if that was the problem. It is as if someone going into the SuperValu near my home - although it has changed its name now - and seeing drink would be encouraged to buy it. I do not accept the logic that somebody will buy drink just because it is near the butter and that it must be segregated, while yards down the road there is an off-licence with a sign offering two bottles of Buckfast Tonic Wine for €20. Initially, requiring a physical barrier to be erected in small shops in rural areas was simply unacceptable. It fails to deal with the problem of alcohol abuse. It was targeting an outlet that was not responsible for the alcohol abuse and not targeting those responsible for it. I am very familiar with the legislation that has been brought forward repeatedly over the years but never implemented. It is an offence for a publican to serve somebody who is intoxicated. It is an offence to drink on the streets of Galway. We introduced by-laws prohibiting drinking on the streets in Galway. Immediately, however, we had to make exceptions because it is a city of culture, of which I am proud, a bilingual city and a city of festivals. The pressure groups said that we had to allow drinking on the streets, so now we have by-laws that mean nothing. The gardaí told us they could not enforce the law because they did not have the authority to confiscate and destroy. We introduced by-laws to allow gardaí to confiscate and destroy the drink, but then exceptions were introduced. There was also a lack of gardaí on the ground. One can see the level of hypocrisy and duplicity here. It is okay to drink to excess during a racing festival. We could not possibly stop people in Galway drinking in the streets during the races, yet we will tell young people not to drink. I have a difficulty with the hypocrisy of how we do that at a societal level. I am glad that changes have been made with regard to the physical barriers. Otherwise, I certainly would not have voted for the legislation, even though it contains many good sections. Tomorrow, the Committee of Public Accounts will discuss the Dormant Account Fund. A substantial amount of the Dormant Account Fund has not been used. Imagine that happening with a fund established to deal with disadvantaged areas and to help people with education. These are specific points, but it is completely underused.We will be examining the reasons for that tomorrow. No review has been carried out in that regard. Those funds should have been used for young people and targeted at those in need, both areas which are underfunded. We do not have enough community centres or alternatives for our young people. If we are serious about dealing with alcohol, it is not by banning it, putting up physical barriers or going back to the days of prohibition in America that this will be done but, rather, by beginning to grow up as a society. Alcohol is not bad in moderation. The abuse of alcohol is a very significant problem in our society that we have condoned on every single level. Young people are far too clever for us and they see our hypocrisy. When I go home and talk to my sons and their friends, I will be met with that hypocrisy and they will go to a pub and drink shots. The level of over-drinking is astounding and we must deal with it.

Although some of its measures are important, it goes a step too far. I support the proposal to bring in a minimum pricing per gram of alcohol. It is far too easy to get huge amounts of alcohol below cost price, which is causing huge damage to the pub trade.

The Bill places huge and unnecessary restrictions on alcohol advertising and sponsorship. The proposals set limits on how alcohol may be portrayed in advertisements. However, it could be detrimental to the sponsorship of events such as the Guinness Pro14 by alcohol companies. Where are we going with this? Why are we in here week after week condemning the drinks industry and debating Bills on road traffic and alcohol? Are we going to turn an event such as the Heineken Cup into the Ribena Cup or the "White Lemonade" Cup? Will the Bulmers Comedy Festival have to be renamed the "Still Water" Festival because we cannot talk about alcohol anymore? Such events that have drawn tens of thousands of people to Ireland and created huge revenue for the State could now be in jeopardy. The provision of the Bill with which I most disagree provides for the strict labelling of alcohol bottles and cans and will lead to the separation of alcohol products within retail outlets. It will be an unnecessary cost for retailers. Where are we going to stop? We are treating the Irish people like fools, as if they will see a drink advertisement and then run and buy that drink. Most people can make up their own minds. Excessive drinking will always be a problem, which is regrettable, but the Bill goes too far. Before I was elected to the House, I was involved in a community and voluntary forum and, through that, was on a joint policing committee. One will always try to stop young children drinking alcohol. I have three young children and I would not like them to drink to excess. I brought forward a proposal at the joint policing committee on the labelling of alcohol bought in off-licences. Often, an 18, 19 or 20 year old buys the alcohol but a 13 or 14 year old consumes it and is then drunk on the street afterwards. The proposal I put forward - to which nobody wanted to listen at the time - was that the bottle or can would be labelled such that the purchaser could be identified, there could be a comeback in respect of that person and we would find out to whom the alcohol was given. In my town of Schull, Tidy Towns groups go out during the summer collecting bottles and cans on the mornings after young people having been ferociously drunk with no control over them. The Bill is looking at advertising instead of going into the detail of trying to sort this out. On labelling and cancer warnings, I cannot understand where we are going. Most products we eat could contribute to cancer in some way. Should we label cans of Coca-Cola, sweets or chocolates because they could cause cancer or may be dangerous? It is important to note that no other country has introduced mandatory cancer warnings on alcohol products. My fear is that the introduction of cancer warnings on Irish products would lead to a stigma regarding those products and give a clear advantage to foreign competitors not required to use such labels such as, for example, producers of Scotch whisky. That would have a very damaging impact on small distilleries and breweries that are bringing new products to the market. It is also worth considering whether introducing labels warning about the dangers of cancer would solve the problem of harmful or underage drinking and balancing that against the harm it would do to indigenous Irish industry. It would, perhaps, be more beneficial for the Department of Education and Skills to roll out an effective education campaign to inform people about recommended drinking guidelines rather than put a cancer warning that is unlikely to work on a bottle. The Bill does not appear to provide for an exemption for products sold at airports. That needs to be reconsidered. While I have many worries about the Bill and take issue with many of its provisions, some parts are to be recommended. In recent months, the Government has been attacking the drinks trade in any way it can, which will lead to tens of thousands of job losses across the country. Why does the House not spend time talking about drugs and the prevention of their importation? The issue of drugs has not been raised in the House. Why are we afraid to mention it? It is a far more serious issue than alcohol in this country and we are avoiding it.

Perhaps we should lay off the drinks industry and see if we can create a few jobs and try to keep rural Ireland and communities alive. I would like time to be spent on seeing how we can help businesses such as hotels and pubs to survive. Earlier today, the Rural Independent Group met a number of people to discuss insurance costs. One gentleman said his insurance has risen from €80,000 to €230,000. No Member deals with the matter of insurance. It was discussed in the House approximately one year ago and was then put back into the box and parked. The Minister looks very bemused but the bottom line is we have not-----

A person whose insurance has increased from €80,000 to €230,000 cannot be expected to survive in business. The insurance costs for the business of a person in west Cork went from €11,000 to €25,000 without any claim having been put in. That is another connection to what we are discussing. It is leading to many businesses closing down and the silence from the Government on how to control the insurance industry is deafening. These are the type of measures that need to be tackled as well as, perhaps, some of the issues in the Bill. If the Government is genuine in its intention to tackle alcohol issues, it should do what I have been calling for since I was elected to the House and shut the Dáil bar. There is no mention of that in the House. We discuss road traffic and alcohol Bills while there are two bars in the Oireachtas. What kind of message does that send to the people of this country? What are we doing? This is supposed to be our place of work. We do not need bars in the Oireachtas. If the Government is serious about tackling alcohol, it should start at home, which, for Members, is the Oireachtas. It should bring forward legislation to close the Dáil bars. People who get up at 7 a.m. or 8 a.m. and work hard all day do not have any alcohol to drink or the opportunity to drink it and are now afraid to call in for a pint on the way home because the Road Traffic (Amendment) Bill 2017 finished that practice. If the Government wishes to continue attacking the drinks industry, it should start by closing the Dáil bars. That would be an honest way to start tackling issues relating to alcohol. The Government should lead by example. On visitor centres, the Bill does not contain any exemptions for Irish whiskey distillers' visitors centres. This means that advertisements for whiskey distillery visitor centres that contain the name of the brand will be severely constrained. For example, such advertisements will be prohibited in train stations, at bus stops and within 200 m of schools and crèches. Visitor centre advertisements will not be able to contain images of people or use storylines.I ask the Minister to give special consideration to the impact of these measures on visitor centres. I visited such a centre recently at Clonakilty Distillery. This owner of the distillery is selling his product all over the world. He is trying to get the business off the ground and is doing so successfully. The visitor centre in Clonakilty is a high-rise building and the owner took me up to the top floor. He is going to bring in people from all over the world to visit this centre. The man's thoughts on this Bill are that if a crèche or a playschool were to open within the viewing vicinity of that building, then his business would be in serious trouble. He would either have to block the windows or cover up whatever advert he might have up on them. This is crazy. I do not know where we are going with this. It is making matters a lot more difficult with. There are lots of ways of going about things, but this Bill not the way to proceed. Everybody supports the objective behind the Bill, namely, to tackle harmful and underage drinking. However, extreme legislation is not always good legislation. I ask that the Minister consider the points I have raised and engage with the industry before Committee Stage in order to see what small changes can be made to address the concerns I have highlighted. Nobody is interested in scuppering the legislation - and they should not be - because there are many good aspects to it. I accept that. It is, however, about making sensible changes in order to strike a balance. I am afraid we are heading down a road similar to that relating to poitín whereby we will not be able to take a drink, advertise a drink or show a drink to anybody. The Minister will have to consider changes to the legislation before it would get full support here.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	434	I am glad to be able to speak on this important legislation. For some time, the Bill has been going to and fro and there has been much lobbying in respect of it. I have been here for ten years and many other items of legislation have come before the House. Much of the legislation in question, while very well-meaning, has never been enacted. Members debate the legislation in detail on the various Stages, it goes to committee and then on to the Seanad but it ends up not being enacted. Let us consider crime, which is a hugely serious issue. People who have carried out multiple offences are out on bail. They get free legal aid that is paid for by ordinary taxpayers and workers. We passed legislation to provide for tagging and, to my horror, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, told us this week that it has been referred to a working group. This is foot-dragging and it flies in the face of the aim of dealing with issues holistically. With regard to the drinks industry, I do not agree with my colleague about the Dáil bar. I like to bring visitors and others to the bar in the evenings. The Dáil bar also provides employment. The Deputy spoke about jobs and that we have to look at it holistically, but sin scéal eile. I am of the view that the proliferation of some types of off-licences has caused a great deal of trouble. Some off-licences that are dedicated to that type of business are run quite well but too many small shops now also have off-licence sales. I listened with interest to Deputy Connolly, as I always do. She said that it is not because a person sees a drink that they want to buy it. However, I am of the view that some investigation is needed in that regard. I feel sorry for the person who is a recovering alcoholic. He or she may go into a small shop to get a loaf of bread, a pound of butter and some milk and is then faced with alcohol right in front of him or her. This person can choose to not go to a pub or a hotel but must go to the shop or the filling station for food or diesel. There is too much of this type of availability. I also did not agree with the proposals for the Long Kesh-type shutters. That is another draconian measure - it is madness. Who drafted this legislation for the Minister? From where did he get it? I mean no disrespect to the officials in the Chamber but I would love to know who they are. I would love to get into that drafting office some day, sit down for an hour and listen to the comments at teatime. To me, it appears that they look at bizarre ways of dealing with problems. I am sure the drafting office staff must be very disappointed also. I am not sure what the plural is but, with respect, I will call them drafters and hope the wind does not get too strong. I wonder if they get frustrated when Bills are drafted, changed and passed on all Stages and are then either not implemented or the process of implementation is too slow. We must look at this issue. We keep talking in this House. It is a talking shop and there are many areas affected. When I started here I wanted a capping or can tax. I asked the then Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, God rest him, for such a tax to be imposed in respect of off-licence sales. The publicans and the Vintners Federation of Ireland had lobbied me, and rightly so. I had no problem with that because I use a lot of pubs for hosting my clinics and I understood that they all paid rates, staff wages, ESB bills, VAT, insurance and so on. They sponsor everything that goes on in a parish. They are the first people whose doors are knocked on by people seeking sponsorship, so we must give back something to them. They are small family businesses and they are trying to survive. It is not easy. An uneven playing field has arisen over the past 20 years. One can now buy 20 cans or 20 bottles of alcohol for €20 or less. A cap or can tax would have brought in almost €1 billion in revenue when the State needed it badly in 2009, 2010 and 2011. When the previous Government led by the Minister's party came to power in 2011, I lobbied it also. Promises were made. Deputy Burton, who was a member of the Cabinet at the time, actually told me that the tax was going to be introduced in 2012 budget or that for 2013. It was not brought in. The next day I asked her what had happened, as she had been full sure. Deputy Burton said that the supermarket lobby was more powerful than the Vintners Federation of Ireland. That is a fact. We have been raped and plundered up and down the country, in farming and every other industry, big business. We have all the big co-ops and big industries in now. Nothing saddens me more when at home in Tipperary when I see Tesco vans driving up and down the boreens and lanes day and night. We are so short-sighted. It is fine if a person has no other way of getting his or her shopping and has to do it online. However, if we then need a local shop in order to buy bread or milk, we will not have anything like that when it is gone. Cad a dhéanfaimid feasta gan adhmad? The shops will all be gone. Big businesses are a scourge in this country. While we need and support foreign direct investment, we have to impose controls on them. They have too much power. They have an in with the Minister and his colleagues. It is the same with the pharmaceutical companies. Nobody is commenting on the problem with prescription drugs. It is a massive issue. I have noted down the two Ds; drink and drugs. These are the lethal cocktails at home. Wine is so cheap and so available. These are the big industries and they have us in their pockets. I do not say this lightly. It is my honest and firm belief after ten years in the House. They are controlling everything and they are powerful and to hell with ordinary people and workers who are looking to buy homes and get on property ladder. The big people can do what they like. Ireland is a banana republic from that point of view because the State will not put any manners on any of the companies in question. Those with the responsibility in this regard just kowtow to money and everything else. It is disgusting. I would say that it is quite corrupt in this House with big business. There is another issue regarding the pharmaceutical industry. We have had families in recently about it. The Minister said that he does not have responsibility for insurance. I prompted him and said there is such a thing as Cabinet collective responsibility. I am sure the Minister read the handbook when he was appointed and he should know by now that he has a responsibility. Several hundred families in the State have issues and concerns in respect of the HPV vaccine and when they came out an lobbied on the issues, they were threatened by a man the Minister should have sacked, Mr. Tony O'Brien. They were called "emotional terrorists."

That is what the Minister is, and a puppet for many more people in big industries too. Mr. O'Brien was not correct. He was disgraceful. He should have been sacked or at least reprimanded to say that to the families with very sick children. I met some of the parents recently. They have sick children and no evidence to prove it. They are entitled to lobby on their concerns. He termed it "emotional terrorism", but it is too cosy. The real emotional terrorism is happening in hospitals day in and day out. People are waiting for ten or 12 hours. People are going to hospitals reasonably healthy, getting MRSA and going home in coffins. That is emotional terrorism. The Minister stands over it and he is a puppet for Mr. O'Brien. The Minister backs him up and says that. It is disgraceful. I am so incensed that he would say that.

The businesses we met today have had their insurance increase threefold, fourfold and fivefold.It is outrageous. This is happening because of the lawyers, the courts, the whole system, the merry-go-round, the fat cats and the claims they give out. If a person in England breaks his or her finger, there is a set fee for it. Why do people here get tens of thousands of euro in the same circumstances? Those involved in the murky business of the Four Courts and all the courts are getting what they want through the litigation process. Solicitors are allowed to advertise on a "no foal, no fee" basis. There was no such thing as "no foal, no fee" advertising 20 years ago, but it has crept in now. By allowing people to milk the system, we are putting all the costs on the backs of ordinary families and, especially, small business people. The big barriers in shops that were proposed by the Government in this legislation were like a jail. Small shopkeepers would have incurred significant costs. Tesco and all the big conglomerates could afford to put up these barriers. They are able to engage in below-cost selling and all this other stuff that ordinary shopkeepers cannot do. I am nearly out of time. I am appalled to think that the Minister would say Mr. O'Brien was right to say that parents were committing emotional terrorism.

People cannot sleep because they are on trolleys beside vending machines and there are people walking up and down in the middle of the night. If this were happening in a war, the Government would be brought to the Hague for war crimes on the basis of depriving people of their sleep. They are not getting care in the hospitals. The Minister can smile all he likes. He is more interested in telling the members of the National Association of General Practitioners, without even consulting them, that they will have to be on the front line in providing abortion services here. I repeat that as far as I am concerned, the Minister is a puppet and a damn good one.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	457	I warmly welcome the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill 2015, which has finally arrived in this Chamber exactly six years after the steering group's report on the national substance misuse strategy was published in February 2012. Some of us here remember that very well. Since then, every effort imaginable has been used by the alcohol industry to stymie, misrepresent, confuse, delay and kill off this strategy. Even before the strategy was published, the representatives of the alcohol industry who sat on the steering group did everything in their power to hold up its work, water down its proposals and delay the finalisation of the strategy. They ultimately issued their own minority report. During the early stages of this process in 2012, I had responsibility for the substance misuse strategy in my role as Minister of State in the Department of Health, a position I held for a short period. At that time, departmental officials enthusiastically got to work on drafting legislation to give effect to the proposals in the strategy. When I consulted members of the Cabinet, it quickly became obvious to me that the alcohol industry had continued on its lobbying spree. It was particularly successful in targeting three particular Ministers. I refer to the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine; Transport, Tourism and Sport; and Justice and Equality at the time. For this reason, the Cabinet became particularly unenthusiastic about making progress with this legislation. The subsequent appointment to the Department of Health of the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, convinced him of the importance of these measures and he progressed the Bill at that stage. However, the heavy lobbying continued apace. We know that 156 different instances of lobbying in respect of this legislation have taken place since late 2015. The lobbying register shows that officials have been extremely active in this area in respect of the legislation. We also know that apart from the long list of Members of the Oireachtas who have been lobbied, as Deputy Collins referred to, many of the lobbyists themselves are ex-Fianna Fáil advisers and staffers who worked with various Ministers. It seemed for a period of time in recent years that there was seamless movement back and forth between the alcohol industry and the staff of Fianna Fáil. For example, one of the lobbyists with the Alcohol Beverage Federation of Ireland, ABFI, which is the most active group that is lobbying on behalf of the alcohol industry, was Ross Mac Mathúna, who is a former special adviser to the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney. Lorraine Hall, who previously worked as a special adviser to the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has also been lobbying in this area. We also know that Ciaran Conlon, who is a former special adviser to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and a Fine Gael official, has lobbied on the Bill on behalf of Responsible Retailing of Alcohol in Ireland. A former Fine Gael Deputy, Dr. Liam Twomey, is now serving as the medical director of DrinkAware, which is a so-called "responsible drinking initiative" that is funded by alcohol companies and large retailers. We also know that Imelda Henry, who was a Fine Gael Senator until quite recently, has been lobbying on behalf of the Vintners Federation of Ireland. I am concerned about the existence of this close relationship, to which I attribute the success of the alcohol industry in slowing down the passage of this legislation. It is entirely inappropriate that there should be such easy movement of staff back and forth between the lobbying wing of IBEC and ABFI and the Fine Gael Party. I do not think it is appropriate. I suggest there should be a significant cooling-off period after somebody has completed a period as a lobbyist or a period as an adviser to a Minister. There are clear conflicts of interest in this respect. The lobbyists have been very successful in holding this up. It is highly regrettable that as a result of much of this lobbying, it was decided to ignore the area of alcohol sponsorship, especially regarding sport and music. The promotion of alcohol takes many forms. As we know, sports sponsorship is a significant component of this. While representatives of the three main participation sports in Ireland were reluctant to divulge all the information on how much money they receive as sponsorship from the alcohol industry, two years ago the indications were that these sports gain somewhere between €10 million and €20 million in funding each year from this source. The figures for some of the sports may be higher at this stage. I welcome the fact that the GAA has been consistently reducing its dependence on alcohol sponsorship. The other sports could take a leaf out of its book. The dependence on alcohol sponsorship is heavier for soccer and rugby, particularly rugby, than it is for the GAA. Alcohol funding is now a relatively minor element of GAA sponsorship and is continuing to decline. We have to keep reminding ourselves that alcohol sponsorship is not done for philanthropic reasons. There is a sense that this is a kind of fuzzy, nice, good-willed philanthropic approach. It is clear that there is substantial commercial gain for the drinks industry if it is willing to spend large amounts of money on the promotion of its products. I ask the Minister to consider revisiting this aspect of the matter at some point. While it would be ideal if it were revisited in the Bill before the House, I am conscious that we need to get it through as quickly as possible. We cannot ignore sports sponsorship, which is the elephant in the room. I would like to refer to important analysis that has been conducted by Professor Gerard Hastings into sponsorship of sports and music events by the alcohol industry in the UK. Internal industry documentation was sourced as part of an investigation into the conduct of the UK alcohol industry by the health select committee of the House of Commons. Professor Hastings's analysis, which is entitled "They’ll drink bucket loads of the stuff", highlights the deliberate use of sports and music sponsorship to recruit young drinkers, particularly young male drinkers. It refers to an internal document from Carling which concludes that the point of Carling's sponsorship of these events is "to build the image of the brand and recruit young male drinkers". The Carling document also points to the attractiveness of being able to "piggy back" on the heroes of young people. It concludes, "They [young people] think about 4 things, we brew 1 and sponsor 2 of them". Having read this evidence, it would be impossible to conclude anything other than that the promotion of alcohol, including sports sponsorship, leads to earlier initiation of drinking, higher levels of consumption and greater health risks than would be the case in the absence of such promotion. We have a serious problem with alcohol in Ireland. We have a very unhealthy relationship with it. We have allowed it to permeate many aspects of our culture. In many ways, we have allowed it to define us as a people. By any standards, we drink too much. We drink approximately 25% more than the OECD average. That equates to approximately 130 bottles of wine, 46 bottles of vodka or 500 pints per person per year. When one considers that many people do not drink at all or drink very little, that means the rest of us drink to excess.The volume of alcohol which we consume is actually increasing, in spite of what the industry is saying. In 2016 our consumption rose by 4.8% according to Revenue statistics. While we like to think of ourselves as fun loving, the reality is that we pay a very heavy price for our love affair with alcohol. The estimated cost of alcohol-related illness and harm is €2.35 billion. Every night, as we know, 1,500 hospital beds are occupied by people with alcohol-related illnesses. That has to be taken into consideration in the context of the demands for increased numbers of hospital beds. There are other, more creative and effective ways of dealing with this. The abuse of alcohol is the big culprit. Alcohol is a contributory factor in depression and other mental health conditions and is implicated in half of all suicides. Nearly 300,000 work days are lost due to alcohol and it is a significant factor in reduced productivity and competitiveness. Alcohol is also a factor in violent crime, domestic abuse, sexual abuse, marriage breakdown and child neglect and obesity; it costs us very dearly as a society. Alcohol takes a particularly heavy toll on children, both because of their parents' harmful drinking and also their own early initiation into drinking, often at binge drinking levels - activity which is harmful to their physical, emotional, mental and social development. As adults, we often like to tut tut at the problem of youth drinking, but is it any wonder that they engage in this when we as adults set them such bad example? Many of us find it difficult to celebrate, have fun, enjoy ourselves or relax without the assistance of alcohol. We really do need to re-evaluate our relationship with alcohol and take steps to modify our behaviours around it. We all have personal responsibility regarding our health and our behaviour. However, the prominence of alcohol all around us, its heavy promotion, its close association with some of the great things in life like sport and music and the unrelenting marketing and cost-cutting of alcohol all conspire to put it at the centre of our society in a way that makes changing our habits very difficult. That is why the problem must be tackled on several fronts: price, advertising, labelling, promotion and other areas. On minimum unit pricing, we know that there is a direct correlation between price and problem drinking. Over the past decade, we have seen a cultural shift in people’s drinking habits. Increasingly, people are drinking at home and then going to the pub or club. Sometimes, after a session at home they continue drinking in the club. There is also the phenomenon of more people just drinking at home, stocking up in the supermarket and generally always having alcohol around the home. I do exactly the same thing myself. It is not that long ago that it was just for a special occasion, at Christmas or whatever that there would be alcohol in the house. For many people now it is a standard commodity to have in the house, if we can call it a commodity. If we go to visit somebody or somebody comes to visit us, the likelihood is that a glass of wine will be offered rather than a cup of tea. That is an indication of just what a central part alcohol has come to play in our lives and how it has managed to wend its way into so many of our different activities. The change in drinking habits coincided with the selling of alcohol at or below cost price, mainly in the big supermarket multiples. These are usually heavily promoted in-store at almost giveaway prices. This is very misleading of course, as supermarkets have to recoup these loss leaders by hiking up the price of foodstuffs and other goods. We are not actually getting a bargain. However, these kinds of offers are too good to refuse for many people, especially young people and problem drinkers. Alcohol is now available at literally pocket money prices, sometimes cheaper than water. The net effect is that consumption levels increase and people get more bang, or more harm, for their buck. A deep irony of this situation is that the multiples can claim a rebate on VAT due to the fact that they are selling below cost. It is a win-win situation for them. We know from research that minimum unit pricing can lead to a significant 15% reduction in consumption among problem drinkers. It specifically targets very cheap lager, cider and spirits off sales and has no impact at all on pub or restaurant prices. Its impact on average priced alcohol for moderate drinkers will be negligible. The advertising restrictions proposed in the Bill are very minimalist and, as I said, it is unfortunate that there was a caving in at political level on the original proposal to ban sponsorship of sport and music events. The proposals on health information labelling are sensible. We all need reminding of the direct links between the use of alcohol and a number of health conditions, including some cancers. Information on calorie content is helpful in tackling obesity as the high calorie content of alcohol is often overlooked in weight management. It is especially important to warn people of the dangers of alcohol intake when pregnant. This is a serious issue which needs a far greater level of attention. It is an issue which was highlighted by Dr. Mary O'Mahony, a specialist in public health medicine, at last year’s AGM of the Irish Medical Organisation when she stated that Ireland features as one of the five countries with the highest prevalence of alcohol use during pregnancy and consequent cases of foetal alcohol syndrome, FAS. It is estimated that 600 babies are born with FAS in Ireland each year, with an estimated 40,000 people living with the condition in this country. Some 80% of Irish women pregnant for the first time reported consuming some alcohol in pregnancy. Dr. O'Mahony was quoted as saying that drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause a permanent disability called foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, FASD. She said that among the consequences is induced brain damage, which is permanent and is associated with physical, mental, educational, social and behavioural difficulties. At one end of the spectrum, FAS may have visible signs of abnormalities and be recognised at birth. FASD is not recognisable until preschool or school age when difficulties manifest. Children born with FAS can show the following: 50% developmental slowing down; severe brain dysfunction at ten years; 10% attention problem at five years; 60% attention problem at ten years; only 30% have IQ below normal but 100% have severe dysfunction in areas such as language, memory and activity levels. FASD has a huge societal impact and many children are misdiagnosed. As Dr. O'Mahony said at the conference, "Children with FASD fill our foster care places, adults with FAS fill our jails and many people are misdiagnosed." More support for women and more resources in the form of screening and interventions for alcohol and health promotion campaigns to educate women on the consequences of drinking during pregnancy are urgently needed. These are very difficult statistics to talk about but we cannot ignore them any longer. For too long, we have swept them under the carpet and have not addressed this serious problem in respect of drinking during pregnancy and the resultant very significant problems that arise for children in that situation. FASD has a very significant impact on our population. There are 40,000 people living with it. It cannot be ignored. In a response to a parliamentary question I tabled a few years ago, I was told: Currently a Senior Psychologist in early intervention services who specialises in FASD provides training to clinical staff in the west and north-west area in so far as resources allow. Any additional resources required to develop screening tools for foetal alcohol syndrome or FASD, associated education programmes and specialised follow up services for children with positive diagnosis would have to be considered in the context of emerging priorities, service delivery plans and budgetary controls.That reply is a couple of years old, and I do not know if anything has changed in the meantime. I certainly hope it has, and I will ask a follow-up parliamentary question on that, because this is a huge, very neglected area which needs to be addressed.  Another area dealt with by the Bill is the separation of alcohol in shops. This has been greatly watered down since the original proposal. An industry organisation, Responsible Retailers of Alcohol in Ireland, RRAI, is the body charged with overseeing adherence to guidelines on displays. This is self-regulation at its best. Every year the RRAI produces a glowing report on its members. This is despite the fact that there was no difficulty finding a shop which blatantly breached the guidelines and had slabs of cheap larger stacked high at the front of the shop, in its window and generally in-your-face and impossible to avoid. Whether in the local mini-market or in the big supermarkets, the effect of these displays has served to normalise alcohol with the intention of encouraging shoppers to treat it as a normal commodity. There are areas not covered in this Bill, for example the need for greater enforcement of the law in respect of underage access to alcohol. We see very few prosecutions or closure orders for this offence. More commonly, it is a frequent occurrence for an adult to buy alcohol on behalf of minors and pass it on outside a shop. This too is an offence but it is rarely policed. Another phenomenon is alcohol deliveries to homes or even to public places. This is a key source of alcohol for young people, but there is little Garda activity in the area, and there remains confusion within the Garda about the legality of taking cash on delivery in those circumstances. Ultimately, the biggest encouragement for young people to drink is Irish society’s ambivalent attitude to it. We prefer to turn a blind eye to the use and the abuse of alcohol, as manifested on our streets in every city and village at weekends. Many parents will say that at least it is not drugs, but we know that alcohol is now the number one substance of abuse among young people. It is condoned, it is tolerated and, in many cases, it is facilitated. For their sake, and for the sake of everyone else in this country who has a problem with alcohol, I urge the Minister to ensure that this legislation is passed as a matter of urgency and that we do not have any further delay.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	458	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I agree with the Minister that its overall objective is to contribute to the reduction of the harmful use of alcohol in our country. It is disappointing that Irish people between the ages of 18 and 24 are top of the EU list for binge drinking. Ireland also ranks joint third for binge drinking in a World Health Organization analysis of 194 countries. I also agree that we must all take personal responsibility for our actions. I support the idea of providing consumers with accurate information so they can make fully informed decisions when purchasing alcohol products. The health risks and benefits associated with drinking are too complex and detailed to be communicated on a label. The Minister might consider the system currently adopted in France or the United States. The label in France states that the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy, even in small amounts, can have severe consequences on the health of the child. The mandatory advertising in France states that excessive alcohol consumption or alcohol abuse is dangerous for the health. Non-mandatory advertising states that alcohol is to be enjoyed in moderation. The Government warning in the United States is that "[a]ccording to the Surgeon General, women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because of the risk of birth defects" and that "[c]onsumption of alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or operate machinery". In many cases it may cause health problems.  Various health studies have shown that moderate consumption of alcohol may be associated with certain health benefits, including protective effects against cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, studies have also found that regular heavy drinking has been associated with some illnesses, including liver diseases, high blood pressure and an increased risk of certain types of cancer. A focus on one health issue alone does not give a full or accurate picture to help consumers to make an informed choice about drinking. The link between cancer and alcohol consumption is far from settled, despite hundreds of epidemiological studies that have researched this issue. Cancer is a complex disease that is not entirely understood, and research continues. The causality of alcohol and cancer cannot be determined on the basis of epidemiological studies. Furthermore, the existing epidemiological studies cannot and do not account for the multitudes of confounding factors. It is noteworthy that all cancers for which alcohol is a risk factor also occur in the absence of drinking. We must not apply a stigma to products produced in Ireland and give a clear advantage to our competition abroad, which is not required to carry such labels, such as producers of Scotch whisky or American whiskey. We cannot tell our export market that those products are better than Irish whiskey or else Irish whiskey will not exist. Risks, therefore, should be communicated clearly and accurately and should avoid scaremongering. There are also concerns that the proposal will result in regulatory divergence from the rest of the EU at a time when Brexit means that we need the support of the EU colleagues more than ever. I encourage the Minister to look at this section of the regulation again. I recently visited the Cooley Distillery in Riverstown, Dundalk, County Louth, which has been in operation since 1987. It employs over 70 people directly and many more indirectly in an area where employment is limited. The company that owns Cooley Distillery has invested €14 million in the site since it purchased the facility in mid-2012. A new warehouse was built, existing equipment was significantly upgraded, and a new mash tun was installed, along with energy and water conservation infrastructure. This investment increases productivity, promotes sustainability, protects jobs and improves health and safety. Since 2011 shipment from this site has increased by 400%. The manager of the distillery stated to me that future investments in this facility could be in jeopardy if the perception that Ireland is a negative market in which to operate develops. This in turn could impact on jobs and investment in the local economy. He suggested that whatever is agreed can be applied in the form of a sticker. This would help with smaller producers and importers.  Other primary policy objectives include reducing alcohol consumption to 9.1 litres of pure alcohol per person per annum by 2020. In 2015 it was at 10.9 litres of pure alcohol per person. Another policy objective is to delay the initiation of alcohol consumption by children and young people. A recent European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs found that seven out of ten 15 to 16 year olds had already drunk alcohol. The Bill also seeks to reduce the harm caused by the misuse of alcohol. The same survey found that a quarter of Irish girls and almost a fifth of Irish boys have reported being injured or involved in an accident due to alcohol.  The introduction of minimum unit prices is another aim of the Bill. A minimum unit price of 10 cent per gram of alcohol will apply to licensed premises and will be measured in pub measures. A pint of Heineken will have a minimum price of €2.25. A pint of Budweiser will have a minimum price of €1.80. A pint of Bulmers cider will have a minimum price of €2.02. A measure of Jameson whiskey will have a minimum price of €1.12. As is clear, this will have no impact on the prices in our pubs, clubs and restaurants.  The Bill will also provide for restrictions on the contents, placement and volume of alcohol advertising. The aim of these provisions is to protect children from exposure to alcohol advertising and to address advertising that links alcohol with positive, healthy lifestyles or social success. The advertising of alcohol products is prohibited in or on a sports area where sports are taking place, at an event aimed particularly at children, or an event where the majority of individuals taking part are children.  The Bill also provides for the drafting of regulations by the Minister for Health to prohibit or restrict certain type of promotions, for example, buy one alcoholic product and get another one free, or student night promotions. The intention of this provision is to prohibit promotions which encourage risky drinking, for example, those which encourage individuals to purchase or drink more than they intend or to drink faster than they intend. I am a pioneer. I have never drunk alcohol in my life. I am not anti-drinking. I believe in drinking less and drinking better. I appeal to the Minister to have a look at my suggestion on labelling. I was disappointed with one of my colleagues for using the Dáil bar as an excuse to talk about alcohol. I have been a Deputy for the last seven years and I have never once seen anybody abuse alcohol. I go into the bar regularly to get my tea and scone and I can take people into the bar as well.The only problem with the Dáil bar is that there are outstanding debts. The people who have outstanding debts should be given a time period in which to pay up. After that, if they want to go into the Dáil bar for a drink, they will have to pay there and then.

Deputies highlighted the impacts of not having high speed broadband on people throughout rural Ireland. As I said last night, I understand and share this frustration because my neighbours, family and friends are experiencing the exact same problems every single day. I believe that high-speed broadband is a basic necessity for families and businesses throughout Ireland, in cities, in towns, in villages and in rural areas, just as electricity and water was in the last century. That is why delivering high-speed broadband to every home, every business, every farm and every school in Ireland is a personal commitment from me and remains a key priority of the Government. I would like to address some of the points raised in the debate last night. The national broadband plan, NBP, is not just about the State intervention and the associated procurement process. The plan was designed to be a combination of commercial and State investment. That has been the clear intention from the start and that is why commercial investment of €2 million is continuing to deliver improved broadband services every single day. The increased level of investment by commercial operators has certainly been influenced by the commitments outlined in the national broadband plan. The level of commercial investment in deploying high-speed broadband to all regions, towns and villages across Ireland is stimulated by the national broadband plan. That is part of the overall package and has been publicly acknowledged by technology commentators. A number of Deputies made reference last night to the eir 300,000 project and the commitment agreement relating to that roll-out. There seems to be some misunderstanding about why the map for the national broadband plan State intervention area was revised to remove the premises within the Eir 300,000. The national broadband plan State intervention is a state-aided project and one of the fundamental principles under state aid guidelines is that state aid for high-speed broadband services should be granted only in respect of areas where market failure has been identified. Therefore, only where private investment does not deliver or does not have concrete plans to do so in the near future should state aid be used. My Department had no involvement in the selection of premises for inclusion in this commercial roll-out. That was entirely a decision for Eir, as it would be for any other commercial company. Following examination of the commercial plans submitted by Eir, I entered into a commitment agreement in respect of the Eir 300,000 roll-out. While the state aid guidelines envisage clear milestones being set out in commercial plans, the commitment agreement I delivered considerably exceeded those guidelines in that it included not only milestones for delivery but also robust monitoring and enforcement provisions. I hope it is now clear to the House that it is not a case that the commitment agreement in some way determined where Eir’s high-speed broadband infrastructure was to be built. That is always a matter for commercial companies. The commitment agreement provided a very strong assurance that planned infrastructure would be built and the commitment agreement set out clearly the quarterly milestones to be achieved. If the intervention area was not reduced to reflect the Eir commercial roll-out, there would have been a very real risk that the State would have been in breach of state aid guidelines. Such a breach would have resulted in Ireland not receiving approval for state aid and potentially mean that the contract could not be awarded. It was the emergence of concrete commercial plans from eir that led to the need to reduce the intervention area, not the commitment agreement. Deputy Dooley said last night that his proposed independent review could be concluded in two months and I explained that this was an entirely unrealistic expectation. It is now being suggested that a review could run in parallel to the current procurement process. That, too, is totally unrealistic and suggests either a naivety or that the NBP is being used as a political football. The conduct of a parallel review would significantly impact on the procurement team's ability to engage effectively with the bidder in dialoguing the final issues for resolution. The exercise would introduce uncertainty to the process and legitimately the bidder could decide to disengage from the process until the review was concluded. In any event, I reject the suggestion that there is any basis for carrying out a review. The Government in its counter motion last night recognised the significant uncertainty that would be created by embarking on an unnecessary review at this late stage of the procurement process and recognised that this could undermine and indeed collapse the procurement process. Putting the procurement off course at this key stage would seriously jeopardise the achievement of the objectives of the NBP and would in fact thwart the will of Dáil Éireann and the Irish people, which is to make high speed broadband available throughout rural Ireland. I recognise the time that has elapsed since the NBP was first mooted. I understand the impatience of those who are waiting on the NBP to bring high-speed broadband to their communities, but now we are in the final stages of the procurement process that can deliver high-speed broadband to those communities. Now is the time for strong and steady resolve to see the procurement process through to a conclusion. That is why we should continue apace with the public procurement process to select a company to build a future proofed high-speed broadband network in those areas, in every county in Ireland, which will not be served by commercial operators. Members of the Opposition have decried the delay in delivering high-speed broadband time and time again. Delivery of this vital service is too important to be treated as a political football. I would like to conclude by confirming that no decision will be made on the award of the NBP contract without the consent of the Government and it is my intention to keep this House and its Members regularly updated on progress in delivering the objectives of the national broadband plan, as I have done to date both formally and informally. As I said during last night’s debate, when I became Minister 21 months ago, five out of ten premises had access to high-speed broadband. Today, that is closer to seven out of ten premises. By the end of the year, I expect that to rise to eight out of ten premises and, by 2020, nine out of ten premises will have access to high-speed broadband. By the end of this year, 79% of the population, 87% of schools and 96% of business parks will have access to high-speed broadband. In summary of progress to date, in the past 12 months alone new telecommunications infrastructure has been delivered to over 280,000 premises providing high-speed broadband with services up to 1 Gbit per second download speeds. The 300,000 roll-out alone will deliver high-speed broadband to 810,000 people, one third of farms and over 1,000 schools. It is also important to remember the ongoing efforts being made to ensure delivery of the national broadband plan. In July 2016, I established the Mobile Phone and Broadband Taskforce as part of A Programme for a Partnership Government, whose role is to identify solutions to obstacles faced by the roll out of the national broadband plan and to facilitate the faster delivery of mobile and wireless broadband solutions across rural Ireland. I am planning to release shortly the task force's annual report, which details the progress made to date. Every local authority now has a dedicated broadband officer acting as a single point of contact for operators on coverage and roll-out issues and there is considerable co-operation between local authorities, operators and across Departments, including my own Department. I have endeavoured to ensure maximum openness and transparency for Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann and the public regarding the NBP procurement process while respecting the need to protect its integrity. I took the initiative to arrange special information sessions for Deputies and Senators on the NBP on three occasions in the past ten months. I held an information session last April when the map for the procurement process was finalised. I held a further information session for Deputies and Senators last September when the procurement reached the detailed solutions stage. Last week, I held a further information session to provide an update following the withdrawal of eir from the procurement process and, last night, I supplied each Deputy and Senator with a copy of the letter I received from Richard Moat informing me of this decision. I also supplied Members with copies of my response. This evening, ahead of these statements, Members received an updated, comprehensive briefing document from me. This week I have contributed openly and positively to two debates in the House and tomorrow I will attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to discuss the NBP. I will be accompanied by the officials from my Department who are directly managing the procurement process. I have ensured that citizens can get information on the availability of high-speed broadband through my Department's website, including in particular the interactive high-speed broadband map. Every week, I provide detailed information to Deputies in response to parliamentary questions and my Department continues to help citizens by replying to emails received through the dedicated broadband inbox. As the procurement process proceeds and as the deployment of high-speed broadband continues, I will continue to provide updates to Deputies and Senators and to the public. I encourage colleagues to think long and hard before they vote on the motion in the House tomorrow and to avoid jeopardising this project for rural Ireland.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	461	I had the opportunity yesterday evening to outline my deep concerns on the state of the roll-out of broadband. There is nothing between the Minister and me in policy terms; the issue is around the methodology. The Minister is right to say he has provided a considerable amount of information on broadband but, sadly, we have not had broadband itself. I have raised very real concerns with the Minister privately and in the House on an ongoing basis. I have sought from the Minister a timeline in answer to three simple questions: when he expects the contract to be signed; when he expects work to begin; and when he expects that work to be completed. To date, I have received no clarity around that. Each time I have raised the issue, the Minister asked me not to go there because it would delay the process. I do not know how the Minister expects me to accept that if he does not at least give me access to, or visibility of, the timelines he is talking about. When I proposed in 2016 that the State should take this contract into State ownership to be fully in charge and in control of its roll-out, the Minister said "Do not do that". I pulled back at the time because the Minister indicated that it would delay the process by six months. There has been a 19-month delay since 2016 against a timeline the Minister did not know the detail of or was unable to publish.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	463	Any time I asked the Minister to give me a timeline, his simple answer was that it was not about timing and that the matter was far too important for that. He said it was more important to get it right because the contract was going to exist for 25 years. When I bring forward an idea about trying to get it right, however, time becomes a problem again. Time is only an issue when something comes from this side of the House. When the issues are on the Minister's side, it is not a problem. There has been a 19-month delay so far. When he was pressed on the radio this morning by Bryan Dobson, the Minister indicated that September was when he, perhaps, expected a contract to be signed. By then, it will be a 27-month delay. The Minister has made no announcement on any delay. While I had my differences with the Minister's predecessor, Alex White, he flagged a six-month delay prior to leaving office. Since the Minister took over, there has been a 13-month delay, but the Minister has never once come to the House. I have given him ample opportunity to explain that there was a delay, but the Minister resisted. He has no choice now because of what has happened with Eir, which is not necessarily his fault. All I want the Minister to do is to take stock of where we are at. We cannot continue with delay after delay and, as companies the size of the ESB, Vodafone and Eir pull out, fail to ask legitimate questions such as whether there is something inherently wrong with the tendering process. Someone reminded me today of another project which came through the process the Minister has a new name for. It is not a tender, it is another type of procurement. I think it is the one that was used to get us the famous Eircode postcodes. We know where that is going, or not. For months, the Minister came to the House to tell me it was really good because it would get ambulances to the right locations. I understand the ambulance service is now going to use something else or so I have been informed.

The simple fact is that the process, at this stage, does not have the confidence of the people who expect to be served. Certainly, I do not have confidence in it. It is the Minister's prerogative. He has responsibility and, if he chooses to ignore the outcome of tomorrow's vote, let it be on his head. If the Minister gives any credibility to the Members here who are as serious as he is about a policy position to deliver broadband to those people, we need more than just information on the map, the intervention area, the covered area, the areas which will have duplicate and triplicate services and so on. What we want is broadband for all of the reasons I have outlined. As the Minister knows well, that is what his constituents want. I ask the Minister to go back to the Government and to then come forward with a credible proposal to review the process. The Minister mentioned in a briefing the other day that he had a plan B. Perhaps he might share that with me and my colleague across the House. We might then have some confidence that the Minister, his Department and the 80 external advisers have thought this through. I might then be prepared to accept the Minister's bona fides and those of the State on the delivery of this contract.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	466	I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on the issue. I would have liked to speak yesterday evening on my colleague's welcome and timely motion but it was necessary to allow other speakers to contribute who do not have the opportunity very often to do so. In the last few weeks, Fine Gael and the honourable Minister of the Independent variety have made a right dog's dinner of a couple of issues. The national planning framework is one and the other is this debacle around the provision of broadband and the Government's inability to put every part of the country on a level playing pitch regarding basic infrastructure. It is typical of the attitude of the Government. There is nothing among the Members of the House akin to an urban-rural divide. Far be it from us that it be the case. We believe it is fine to plan for Ireland's cities up to 2040 but not instead of or in neglect of rural Ireland. Rural Ireland and those who do not have access to this basic necessity do not take kindly to being treated as an add-on or second tier of society. Rural Ireland has been an add-on in this instance, however, because, as Deputy Dooley said, we have listened to three Ministers make commitments on the boldest of plans. We have held onto that commitment with the best goodwill based on what the Minister said when the Government took office. It has not materialised, however. The handling of this procurement has been anything but appropriate. Over the years and even in my office today, I have had many conversations with constituents who do not have access to broadband despite the way we laud the idea of a knowledge economy and notwithstanding the Minister's assertion that, by the end of the year, seven out of ten households and 96% of business parks will have it. I owe it to my constituents, including those who are in touch with me on this on a regular basis, to record the various areas in my constituency which do not have access to high-speed broadband.These are as follows: Screggan in Tullamore, Tubber, Horseleap, Rhode, Bracknagh, Durrow, Cloghan, Ballycumber, Ballycommon, Lusmagh, Cushina, Walsh Island, Pollagh, Ferbane business park, Coleraine, Kilmalogue, Daingean, Mountlucas, Clonygowan, Clongarrett, Killure, Treascon in Portarlington, Ballyclare, Blue Ball, Shannonbridge, Bellair, Lahinch in Clara, Ballycolgan, Gracefield, Barna, Erry in Clara, Clonsast, Crinkill, Shinrone, Ballycowan, Coolnahiley, Kilmucklin, Kilnabinnia, High Street Belmont, Tinnycross, Clonfanlough, Gloucester, Creevagh, Moneygall, Sharavogue, Killyon, Rath, Croghan, Ballyboy, Kinnitty, Ballinlough and Clareen. I do not know how many houses are in those townlands and areas. However, I can assure the Minister that when he says to me and those like me not to play politics with this issue, I am afraid that - surprise, surprise - I am a politician and I represent the people in these areas. These people have placed their trust in public representatives and in Ministers who have the privilege to lead Government on this issue. When I go back to these people, I will be saying to them that when they get their opportunity, they can pass judgment on the Government and its commitment in this area. It has failed them. The way they express their sentiment in that regard is that they will not be voting for the Minister or anybody belonging to him, having listened to the commitments he has made and given the ample opportunity he has had to progress this matter. I and others on this side of the House will be putting forward means and methods by which it can be done, sooner rather than later. We will ask those people to trust us and trust our commitment, based on the Minister's failure. I hope I never again have to read the like of what I have read into the record when we are talking about basic services and basic necessities, as the Minister rightly calls them, in this day and age.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	469	The privatised route for the provision of telecommunications, both with the original sale of Telecom Éireann and the completely privatised route for the national broadband plan, has not worked. There has been a long line of mistakes, false promises and false starts when it comes to broadband roll out. In 2002, Fianna Fáil when in government promised to roll out broadband on a national basis. The last Fine Gael Government unveiled the national broadband plan in 2012 but we are still no closer six years later. The programme for Government has a commitment "to provide broadband to every house and business in the country by 2020", which is not too far away, and still householders and businesses are waiting. The State cannot be held over a barrel by international financiers but this is what has happened, although the Minister is trying to tell us it has not. He tells us he has 80 advisers. Those advisers should know this, as he and I know it. Anybody who has been to a fair or a market knows it - there is only one bidder. The State should have complete control when dealing with a project on this scale, which involves 542,000 premises, given this could improve quality of life and bring real economic opportunities to rural Ireland. There is clearly a problem affecting every county in the State. In Laois there are 12,721 households and businesses in blackspot areas yet to be covered by the national broadband plan. I want to ask when those people will have broadband. There are almost 12,000 commuters leaving the county every morning because of the work situation. Some of these commuters work in small businesses that could be located in Laois and some could have work-from-home options if they had the broadband to sustain that. This is a county where the IDA has an appalling track record in creating employment. I and the other two Laois Deputies are due to meet the IDA next week to deal with this issue. In the absence of IDA development and of any major industries being brought to the area, local people are trying to develop their own businesses but they are hamstrung due to the lack of broadband, which goes right across the midlands. There are people contacting me from across my constituency and beyond. The absence of broadband is affecting farmers, who are now supposed to file for grants online, as well as small businesses and students - the list goes on. The Minister said to me in this Chamber two weeks ago that if he was to do all of this again, he might not have taken this course. I asked him last night to tell me what course he would have taken with hindsight. In any case, what is the timeline for the route he is taking? What is the timeline for the completion of the work on the more than 12,000 homes in Laois and more than 542,000 across the country? With only one bidder, all the bargaining power is in its hands. What happens if that bidder withdraws? The Minister has not told us that and we need to know. What is plan B? I have not heard it and I would like to know what it is. In the absence of a plan B, Sinn Féin proposes that we would have a speedy examination of the possibility of progressing the national broadband plan through greater State involvement, recognising the negative effects of the decision to privatise Telecom Éireann in 1999. We also propose looking at the feasibility of using existing State infrastructure and resources held by the ESB, which was interested in rolling this out but pulled out because the Minister allowed Eir to cherry pick it, as is clear from what has happened. We also want to place an obligation on existing providers to ensure existing customers are guaranteed a minimum connection speed. The 542,000 households and businesses are waiting. We need a solution that will provide high-speed broadband at an affordable price. In his letter to the eir CEO, the Minister stated that the draft contract negotiation phase of this project would not occur for several weeks. However, he tried to give us the impression a few minutes ago that everything is ready to go, despite what he said to the CEO in the third paragraph of that letter. I am not reassured about this from what the Minister has told us. This project is in deep trouble. I do not see anything wrong with spending seven, eight or nine weeks looking at this to see if we can take a better route.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	470	The broadband procurement issue raises grave concerns over the Government's ability to oversee the development and delivery of essential infrastructure across the country. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, boldly claimed that Ireland would be the first country in the world to bring broadband into every home yet, at the end of 2017, we still have not attained 100% coverage while the Netherlands achieved 98% installation and Luxembourg 97%. Arguably, both of these regions are geographically small, with high population density. More impressive, perhaps, is Norway, which has attained 94% coverage with a little over 5 million of population across more than 4.5 times the landmass of Ireland and a sparse population density of 15 people per sq. km compared to Ireland's 69 people per sq. km. Broadband infrastructure as an essential element of the social, economic and educational functioning of rural areas has been debated many times in this House yet here we are again, haggling with eir about public access to poles that used to be in the ownership of the people. High-quality, high-speed Internet access is a way of life in Nordic countries. Their governments support it, the Internet service providers provide it and the people use it. The high-quality Internet access available in Nordic Europe did not happen by accident. All of these countries have governments and telecommunications companies that are focused on providing exceptional Internet service to populations that are active Internet users. Finland was the first country in the world to declare that broadband access is a legal right for every citizen and 95% of the population has 4G coverage. It is clear, given the track record the Nordic countries have in STEM, that these are the countries we need to look to for good practice and leadership. The Minister's responsibility in bringing this contract across the line has, if he will excuse the pun, broad-reaching consequences. The necessity of broadband infrastructure to sustaining the essential social, economic and educational functioning of rural areas has been debated too many times in this House. No one needs to be reminded of the everyday dependence on digital connectivity to deliver education, run farms and businesses, sell tourism products and distribute millions of financial transactions between people and businesses in every nook and cranny of the State. Despite experts' attempts at future-proofing, new digital services and practices are continually emerging which were never seriously considered. Services such as virtual GP clinics are gaining credibility in the provision of online medical consultations and prescription of medication which had previously required a GP surgery visit. It is evident that such applications have a major contribution to make in providing services to remote dwellers where conventional means are becoming less viable. Similarly, according to the Western Development Commission's Insights from the Digital Economy Conference, 9% of adults run a business from home and 39% of the population do some work at home. This highlights the importance of adequate high-speed broadband in our homes to enable self-employment and home-working on a more common basis. Remote working eases demands on transport infrastructure and compensates users further by improving their opportunity costs for enhanced work-life balance. It also has potential to improve the potential to increase women's employment in rural areas for those for whom child care costs are prohibitive or child care services unavailable. I can see from the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment's high-speed broadband map of county statistics that the midland counties have achieved the 88% national average coverage. I have also received information from the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, that IDA Ireland has appointed a dedicated regional manager to boost the number of jobs created in this region and that the agency has launched a digital campaign to market the region to potential investors. These investments and their outcomes are both dependent on achieving full rural deployment as soon as possible. This will be influenced by the existence of high-speed broadband which is essential for job creation. I ask the Minister for assurances that the targets for 100% broadband coverage to every householder in Ireland has not in any way been hindered by the withdrawal of Eir from the contracting process. Can the Minister assure me and the rural dwellers across the country that high-speed broadband will be available to every household and business premises in Ireland under this contract and can he indicate the anticipated completion date? The issue is of great concern to rural communities and is a source of great frustration to over 12,000 constituents in County Offaly who want urgent action and not meaningless dialogue.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16499	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	471	I will begin by examining some of the Minister's speech to the House tonight. This debate is a continuation of the one on the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion that was before the House last night. If I read the political landscape correctly that the Opposition will support the motion, then I do not see why we could not have a short, sharp review. The Minister's response to that was inadequate in saying that it would delay the process inordinately. I do not think anyone here buys that response as there is huge scepticism about the manner in which this process has been handled. I refer to the Minister's speech tonight. He said: "My Department had no involvement in the selection of premises for inclusion in this commercial roll-out and that was entirely a decision for Eir as it would be for any commercial company". He is referring to the 300,000 connections that were to be rolled out which were beyond the State intervention. Given Eir's form, having been through seven take-overs and been asset-stripped, I do not know if I would believe the Rosary out of its mouth, as someone put it to me last week, on the matter. For the Minister to come in and say he had a commitment agreement in respect of the 300,000 without placing a copy of that commitment before the House beggars belief.

It is unusual for a Minister to interrupt a Member of the Opposition when he or she is speaking.

His new-found transparency will come as a great surprise to many people in this House.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	16499	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	481	The Minister raised the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion. Yesterday, I asked about red-line issues. The Minister has published documentation exchanged between himself and Mr. Moat on the red-line issues. We have had no articulation from the Minister as to what those issues were between Eir and the Government. The Minister seeks to be non-partisan on this. As soon as he decided he would set a 90-week target, or whatever it was, on this, it became a politically driven target. It is a bit rich for the Minister to come to the House tonight and tell us that we should not play politics with this. Last week in the House, Deputy Brendan Howlin, raised the matter of there being a plan B. The Minister has failed to tell the House this evening what that plan B is. All we have been told is that he is supporting the Enet bit, but even then the Minister has not told us what price will now be paid for the Enet tender.  Going back to the 131,000 figure, some of the houses have been passed by. I spoke of a very typical scenario which happens in rural Ireland where one might have an enclave of 12 houses. Some 12 poles to their left and to their right are covered but that enclave in the middle is not covered. Can the Minister guarantee that in these the blackspots, that the State-aided national broadband plan will cover these, at a price?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	482	Yes.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16499	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	483	I am sorry. The Minister said "Yes", but the people who live in that enclave of 12 houses are scratching their heads and wondering why, if Eir was so committed to this process, that it passed 12 houses on the same stretch of road. What was that all about? That causes great confusion for many families depending on this scheme. I am hopeful that we can get to a point where the 100% pEnetration rate of which the Minister speaks can be achieved. Whatever way the Minister wishes to cut the knife, he is politically exposed on this question. He set out clear targets and it is only right and proper that we interrogate the information that the Minister is providing us. With all the information we have received in the last 24 hours, I admit that it is taking us some time to try to interpret the correspondence, but I will refer once again to the Minister's document in regard to the 300,000 premises. The document states that the fourth quarter figures for Eir's rural deployment had yet to be verified by the Department, however Eir indicated that it had passed almost 121,000 premises to be identified, of the identified 300,000 premises as of December 2017.I am merely quoting, for the record, figures that the Minister has provided us with. The Minister has also provided us with figures on SIRO. He states that SIRO has committed to investing €450 million into providing fibre broadband to 0.5 million regional homes and businesses in 51 towns. As of January of this year, 127,000 fibre-to-the-home connections have been built in 19 towns across the country, with 32 to follow. I welcome this. What I want to ask the Minister - perhaps the Minister or his officials can clarify this to me by email after this debate is over - is whether there is a crossing over. Will we now face a situation where in certain quarters in certain parts of this country one can have the Eir offering, the SIRO offering or any number of offerings? SIRO, which was one of the bidders and which included ESB and which had given a commitment by virtue of the fact that it was part of the tender process, wanted to be part of this national broadband plan and is now getting on with matters within the market. The clarification I am seeking is, how is SIRO managing to provide fibre broadband, with its €450 million investment, to 500,000 regional homes and businesses in 51 towns and why is it that SIRO felt it had to pull out of this process? Is it not the case that SIRO pulled out of this process because as soon as the Minister made the commitment agreement with Eir for 300,000, it was in no way feasible for any other bidder, or any bidder of SIRO's stature, to be able to stay in the competition and it has decided to go it alone? There are still serious questions to be asked of the Minister's handling of this. The Minister has invested heavily, politically, from a reputational point of view, in delivering this. We all want to give the Minister a chance to do that but I contend that there is increasing scepticism, particularly in those areas which are black spots, and because of the withdrawal of eir from the process, about the Government's ability to deliver this plan on time and on budget.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	484	With more than 0.5 million homes, schools and businesses in rural Ireland without high-speed broadband and nearly 40% of the population affected by this, we have this situation. It is a fiasco. What is the position facing a student in one of these areas who has examinations coming up in a few months who does not have proper access? What is the position facing a business that is trying to advertise itself and its products and invest in developing a website with this type of coverage? It is a privatisation fiasco. Tendering meant that Government was effectively privatising the broadband service infrastructure. When they put it out, they had a choice of what sort of contract to offer: full concession or commercial status. They offered full concession. This meant that a private company builds it, then operates for 25 years on behalf of the State but at the end of the 25 years gets to own the infrastructure. It is a privatisation model of infrastructure. Private operators might be prepared to provide the service to a small city or a large town where there is a big concentration of customers, such as Galway, but for significant parts of rural Ireland it is a different story because one does not have the same clusters and the same potential to make profit, which is the bottom line and the agenda for them. This is part of a bigger privatisation fiasco. Fianna Fáil is pointing the finger at the Minister across the floor of the House. Fianna Fáil privatised Telecom Éireann in 1999. Ms Mary O'Rourke was the Minister at the time and all of these problems stem from that decision. In Telecom Éireann, prior to privatisation in 1999, there had been much analogue-to-digital investment. In fact, Telecom Éireann was shaping up to be at the top of the class with the explosion of Internet services but then Fianna Fáil stepped in and organised privatisation and it has been downhill all the way ever since then. When it was put on the Stock Exchange, it was valued at €8.4 billion. When it was sold to Mr. Tony O'Reilly, the price was €3 billion. The mobile arm was sold to Vodafone at the urging of Deputy Ross, who now sits in government. The O'Reilly operation asset stripped the company and made €1 billion for itself in doing so. They loaded up the company with their own debt. It was then sold to Babcock and Brown. They asset stripped the company. They sold the headquarters. They sold the phone masts. They loaded the company with more debts and then it was sold to Singapore Technologies Telemedia, STT, for €39 million. If we look at the current position with Eir, Eir has a mobile network - the old Meteor network. It has broadband. It has some television packages, including Eir Sport, and the cables. The cables, that are underneath the ground, are the key piece of infrastructure here. I stated that it was sold for €39 million but it was valued at €3.94 billion. The problem was, with all the asset-stripping and debt-loading, it had debts of €3.87 billion. The only way of sorting this out - the Minister can go around the Houses with his reviews and this and that - is to take the following steps. First, the Minister must re-nationalise and reverse the privatisation and the disaster of that under Fianna Fáil that has been built on by Fine Gael down through the years; and not accept the bad debts of the vulture funds, the debts that have been loaded on by the O'Reillys and Babcock and Brown down through the years, asset-stripping the company and saddling it with their own debts - the Minister should cancel those debts. If the Minister pays compensation, he should pay it on the basis of proven need to ordinary people only. The Minister should not pay the debts of the asset strippers and the billionaires. The Minister will have a nationalised company to invest in broadband. The Minister should provide the service that the private sector has not delivered, is not delivering and will not deliver, and while he does so, provide decent and unionised jobs. The Minister can tell me that flies in the face of EU regulations and all the rest of it - so be it. It is the only way to do the job. The private sector has failed. Privatisation has failed. The Government has failed on this issue. Re-nationalisation is the only way.

As the Minister and anyone here in the House is probably aware, the greatest mistake that ever was made was the sale of Eircom because since then, no matter what Minister is in power, it has put us on the back foot. It is probably one of the costliest mistakes this country has ever made and we probably will continue to regret it. Along with that, from what I understand, we are coupled with EU rules on how we conduct procurement. Basically, the State cannot have ownership of different assets which is playing havoc, not only in this country but in other parts of Europe.Since the privatisation of Telecom Éireann, we have relied on other private operators to provide services. My background is in the private sector. The ESB is a great company. When anything goes wrong, it is out there and able to solve the problem. Such services may not make money for a Government or the company involved but they create the environment and the opportunity for people to be able to go to work and pay taxes, which in turn may pay for the few quid that would be lost. I know the Minister has sent around a document, and I thank him for honouring what he said last night in getting a person to talk to me. The first thing that needs to be done, and I ask the Minister to arrange this, is a meeting between him and his officials and Senators and others in the likes of the audiovisual room to bring them up to speed on the exact problems and some of the obstacles and where we are and where we intend to be. In fairness to the officials, their insight is very helpful to people. It would be very easy for me, being in the same constituency as the Minister, to stand here and, on Facebook later, have a right go at him but I will not do so because one vision we must have-----

We must work together to ensure it is delivered. There are obstacles. We must hope Enet stays in the game because we had two other engines on the plane and they fell off. I am very wary of Eir, and I do not deny that. I was even more alarmed when I saw who is buying Eir. I have read up a little on developments in France and I worry about where eir is going, what it will try to do and what it would try to stifle. All politicians across the floor need to work together. Whatever legislation needs to be driven through here, be it at 12 o'clock at night or 7 o'clock in the morning, support must be given from all sides to put down the foundation that can deliver for us what is required. Whatever the consequences for some of these private operators down the road, it is broadband we want in all parts of rural Ireland and not to worry about them. Right across the floor support needs to be given to ensure we have no obstacle in our way, that we are ahead of any future obstacle that might come up and that we can plough through it without certain vested interests trying to hold the country to ransom. This is about the north, south, east and west of the country and about delivery. The Minister said that since there is now one crowd in the game, he may be able to speed things up in certain circumstances. It is vital for every Deputy in the House and for the public that this starts rolling rapidly. The Minister knows as well as anyone the frustration that is felt. People are beginning to wonder whether the roll-out will ever happen. The Minister's Department needs to ensure we are forthright and honest that the work being done by Eir is being done by Eir and that no Government or anyone else will do it. I have questioned how Eir even got that contract. I have read up a little about it and about EU rules and so on and I see that, unfortunately, many times one cannot stop a tide when the EU holds a country to ransom. This is the flaw that seems to be the big problem. My first instinct would be that whatever compulsory purchase orders, CPOs, or emergency legislation is required, and I know one can have problems in that regard and the Minister probably has better briefings on all this, must be brought in here. I urge him not to be afraid to say here if such a thing is to come and not to be one bit worried about what we must take on to ensure this is delivered. The sooner this contract is done, the better. Yes, it probably will cost more money, but my argument is always that if we are to spend €3 billion or €4 billion to bring people from Dublin Airport, which I think is needed, and I do not say it is not, we can bring broadband to the number of people we have talked about and 1.2 million people can benefit from it daily. That can make a country better and can allow people to work from home. We do not need too many more downers. There was trepidation the minute we heard eir had gone. Perhaps it was a good thing, but the worry is whether Enet will stay in the game. It is very important it would do so, or else we will be left with nothing, we will be back to the grindstone and we will be two or three years again going through the process. I ask the Minister and his officials to ensure that whenever this contract is signed, in the next few months, with a bit of luck, the ante is upped. I have done construction jobs and water jobs around the country, and there may be timeline pressures on them and one may have to put more resources and gangs into doing the work. It is vital that when we hit the ground, we do so firmly. I would have fairly big penalties for the people involved in the tender process if they did not deliver on time, but I would encourage them first. I do not like the word "penalties". I would nearly pay them a bonus to get it done in a 12 month or 14 month timeframe with more gangs rather than wear it out for the extra bit of time and have parts of Ireland left without broadband. I ask the Minister to arrange for every Deputy and other Members of the Oireachtas to have a very frank meeting in the audiovisual room in order that everyone understands where we are coming from.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	488	I too am glad to speak about this very important issue. I acknowledge the Minister's presence. This issue is as important as rural electrification was fadó fadó. We had very little at that time but we did have imaginative people and a good vision.The late great Canon Hayes, a founder member of Muintir na Tíre, said it was better to light a candle than to curse the dark. He was instrumental in having it rolled out to areas in County Tipperary and other parts of the country. He came from Limerick.  I was involved in the talks with the Minister when we were all Independent Deputies after being elected almost two years ago. They lasted a long time. The Minister decided to catch the wagon back to his old home ground of the Fine Gael Party and I wish him well. I have engagement with him and, in fairness, appreciate that he briefs rural Independent Deputies almost weekly, but we had no briefing on this issue. I know that it is probably a bombshell that hit him, but we need to be briefed on it. He needs to give us the facts. I have serious concerns about where we are. I have said at meetings in his office - he probably thought I was a little harsh - that I had no faith in the pronouncements he was making because I had been listening to them for too long. I had listened to them when I was in Fianna Fáil. We had roll-out after roll-out when I came into the House ten and a half years ago in 2007. We then had more, as well as promises and everything else. We have had more roll-outs than we have had dinners. It is all poppycock and a farce. It beggars belief that in 2018 we cannot deliver broadband to almost every house and that rural Ireland must again be left behind on the hind tit, as I said one time to former Deputy Pat Rabbitte. He was speaking about something being as useful as tits on a bull and I told him about Mrs Murphy's cow who had lost her two front tits. She had got caught in wire and been left with a dudeen of a tit. That is where we in rural Ireland are now and it is not fair or acceptable and the Minister cannot stand over it. I wish him well in his portfolio, but he was given the poisoned chalice by his old friend and sometimes foe, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny. He was also given responsibility for post offices. The Minister, Deputy Michael Ring, had responsibility for them but could not wait to get rid of them. The issue was too hot to handle and he shoved them over on top of the Minister. He did a Pontius Pilate and gave them to the Minister. It was another nightmare. Deputy Enda Kenny knew well that this was not going to happen because he had been around a lot longer than me. He has been here for almost 40 years. As I said, we have had roll-out after roll-out. It is like the Rolling Stones - roll on Monday; it is just not happening. The rich pickings have been taken. All of the companies involved during the years got rich pickings and milked them for what they were worth and then left these shores. I was a backbencher supporting a Government and that is what I learned. I have been burned so many times on this issue and we all have a share of the blame, including me, but it is just not good enough. I salute Eircom, the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the late Albert Reynolds. I met him at a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis in 1979 when he announced new measures. At the time people could not access a telephone service and there were only 20 or 30 telephones in a parish. People also had to dial the post office. I salute the postmistresses who sat up all night to answer the telephones and put people through. We have come a long way since. The late Albert Reynolds modernised the service with great vision, passion and enthusiasm. He was businessman of renown. His family no longer owns the business, but it is flourishing. We are now in a situation where we have got bogged down in red tape, procurement rules and God only knows what. The con artists are milking us dry. They are the ones who were given the job of rolling out this service, but they left these shores after they had taken the rich pickings. They had no bother in providing broadband in the cities which have everything, even as far down the road as Naas and other big towns, but in country areas we have nothing. It is like the Third World in many parts of rural Ireland that I try to represent. I heard some news tonight from the Minister's constituency, or perhaps it was Sligo. It is totally frustrating to have to try to run a business without broadband; it cannot be done. We know that we have to have the modern tools of trade. I am a businessman and we have to have the most up-to-date equipment as otherwise we will not be wanted. That is tough, but it is the name of the game and the way it is. There is the seeking of tenders and people must pony up and seek them or else there will be penalty clauses, rightly so.  With regard to the giving of Government contracts, let us take the national children's hospital as an example. I do not want to stray from the issue, but at the start the cost was €400 million. Now it is €1.4 billion and the hospital has not reached any height. It will never be finished. We are a soft touch. The Government, Government agencies and the HSE are a soft touch for the cowboys and cowgirls and the con artists and this is clear evidence. It is as clear as the nose on the Minister's face and mine. We have been conned and robbed and the ones who are picking up the can are taxpayers, including people living in rural Ireland. In some places in urban Ireland there is no broadband or even a modicum of service. One does not need to be an expert to know this. I salute those involved in Eir - I knew many of them - who in bad weather and poor conditions brought telephone lines and equipment over mountains. What do we have now? Two weeks ago a woman contacted me because she had no telephone service since Storm Ophelia. Thankfully, it is has been restored, but that was scandalous. I salute the minority of staff left working for Eir, formerly Eircom and before that the Department of Post and Telegraphs. A good friend of mine, Mr. Paddy Kelly, carries out repairs in a European Parliament constituency, but they cannot be made as there is only a skeleton staff. I used to do hedge cutting and hedges could not be cut as telephone lines were lying on ditches. Poles also fell out onto the road. It was a shambles. The company was sold off to Eir by a Fianna Fáil Government. It plucked, picked and milked it. It was sabotaged and now it is no more. We are a soft touch.  I do not know whether T. K. Whitaker is alive or dead. He was such an inspiration, with Canon Hayes and others.

I thought he was, but I was not sure. He was a visionary. We had such a dedicated public service, but now we cannot organise a contract for a blooming tennis match. We have laws and regulations and procurement rules. Today I had here people with an excellent project. I salute Mr. Jonathan Irwin and others, including in the Irish Prison Service, who came here today. I also salute the Irish Horse Welfare Trust. The project is in the Minister's constituency. He had a representative at the meeting because he was too busy to attend, but he is supporting the project which is wonderful. Mr. Irwin has raised €101,000 to build ten stables, but we are being told there could be problems in procurement. It is money that people gave voluntarily and on which they had paid their taxes and everything else. They made the donations to fund this wonderful project. For the past couple of years, to apply for EU tenders, small people must have a turnover of €5 million. No one has made millions in recent years. It just stinks to high heaven and is a lethargic approach adopted by the mechanisms of government. I am speaking about the official or permanent government. It is a con job. It cannot see beyond its nose. It is not fit to give contracts to fellows who are serving at mass because it has no interest in doing so and no fear of retribution or anyone challenging it. It might be cautioned or people might have their wages cut, but there is no accountability. There are so few Members on the Government benches now for most debate, but the problem is that there is hardly a businessman or businesswoman among them. However, there are, barristers, solicitors, teachers, doctors and God only knows what. They are good people in their own right, but they do not understand business and how it ticks. However, the poor people who are trying to do business understand it. It is a shame and disgrace that we are speaking again about the lack of broadband and we will be here again in two or three years' time. There is transparency in procurement and now there is one supplier, which is a monopoly. I will bring in a game of Monopoly to show it to the Government. I would not be surprised to learn that Eir was in cahoots with Enet from England which has no experience of operating in rural areas. This is and has been a con job. If it walks like and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. It is outrageous. There are regulators who are unbelievable. I have said many times that they are toothless and useless. Where are they in all of this? When the contracts were given during the years, where were they? They took their pensions and we now have all of these quangos. I see the officials whispering to the Minister and looking at him. I respect what they do and I am not blaming them but the whizz kids, the advisers and the smart boyos. Every businesswoman who opens the door tomorrow morning will pay rates, staff wages and the ESB, but she must also pay the banks which are terrorising people as they try to keep the doors open.  This is a waste. We could undertake the rural electrification project in the late 1950s. I remember Canon Hayes saying to people that they should light a candle rather than curse the dark. We are now inept to a massive degree. Thank God, we gained our freedom through the people who had fought for it, but now we have been tainted and are corrupt beyond belief. It is all backhanders and sideshows and to hell with ordinary people living down lanes and boreens. It is a case of croppies lie down.It is shameful, it is disgusting and it stinks and I have no faith in the process.
#SeanCanney	unknown-#SeanCanney-party	unknown-#SeanCanney-dob	unknown-#SeanCanney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	491	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the issue of broadband in rural Ireland and also on Fianna Fáil's proposal to launch a review. First, as a rural Deputy, no more than the Minister, I fully understand what is lacking. We have talked about it for years, and I know that it was high on the agenda when we negotiated the programme for Government. What is happening at the moment is the process of bringing the programme for Government to fruition. There have been hiccups along the way. However, I want to say something about rural broadband, something I have made clear on many occasions. I am not happy with the way Eir is performing in its commercial roll-out. My concern is that gaps are appearing all over the country in the roll-out of rural broadband. These gaps become apparent when one travels down a road with 50 or 60 houses, 50 of which are connected while the remaining houses in the middle are not. That is leaving a gap and it is very divisive. It is a way of dividing communities, putting somebody with broadband on a higher pedestal than somebody who does not have it. Given what Eir has done, students find they have to go to a neighbour's house to study for exams or they have to stay on in college in Galway while their friends can go home to study. In one house, a farmer can do all of his accounts and form-filling online, but in the next house that cannot be done. This is a huge problem and while I am not technically-minded in terms of how broadband works, I know that when 50 houses out of 60 are connected and ten are not, something is wrong. Eir has caused a problem by creating these gaps, which will be a problem when the broadband network is realised with Enet, after that contract is, hopefully, signed. Access to these houses to ensure broadband is delivered is a concern. Eir should be asked how it will deal with this. The last thing we want is to say that these houses, families, students or farmers will have to wait until we work it out later. I know from the briefing I got from the Minister that Eir is still willing to help out in any way it can, but its contribution must be more than words. Access to these houses is very important. It is an issue that has created untold anger. The reason people are talking about broadband is that Johnny can have it but Mick cannot. People in this country have been patient, and now they see that something is happening. However, it has to happen in a very even-handed manner, and I stress to the Minister that Eir should be brought back into the discussions. If it is not going to fill these small gaps, that should be made a priority under the new contract, that is, that they are taken care of first, not last. To return to the issue of Eir's withdrawal, I do not know if it is a good or a bad thing. I am not too worried about it. The Department and the Minister have done a damned good job in a very difficult, technical procurement process. As somebody who understands procurement and has some knowledge of this competitive dialogue process, I know that it is used for large infrastructure jobs. However, it is also used in cases where there are complicated and varying proposals and it is a question of trying to find the best fit. That is why it is competitive and there is dialogue. It is also why a number of bidders are brought into the process in order that the best tender can be found. The fact that a company decides to pull out of the process does not mean the process is complete. Perhaps Eir's withdrawal is something we will look back on in a couple of months and say that it was all right because we end up, hopefully, with a successful contract. Maybe we will save some time in the process now that we are dealing with the nuts and bolts of getting a contract in place. It is important we understand that people get exercised about the fact they do not have broadband and they have to wait. That is one of the things that motivated us when we were negotiating the programme for Government, especially rural Deputies, of which the Minister was one. We want to see this up and running. We want to see broadband in place and being rolled out in a very efficient and speedy manner. That is why it takes time to get the contractor, or the supplier, in place. If we started a review of the procurement now, we would delay the process. There are many external experts and bodies advising on this. I looked at the names involved, and I recognised some of them. Highly accomplished and qualified people are providing the necessary advice to the Department and the Minister. However, it is important to remember that having a review at this point would be counter-productive. We have a job to do and we should encourage the Minister to make sure we stick with the plan and broadband is provided. I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice that we have received much information from the Minister over the last day or two and the briefing was very good. However, a briefing in the AV room for all Deputies who are interested in the topic, so that we are more in tune with what is happening, would not go amiss. I know it is not easy because carrying out any kind of infrastructure project takes time. The last thing we want is to find, when we have finished the process and spent the money, that something is not right. That is why we have to make sure it is done thoroughly, in a way that will be of benefit to the people who have waited so long for it.  Some people get exercised and try to play politics with broadband, but it is too important for that and we all need to work together on this. We must also reassure the public that broadband will be delivered. I will return to the only issue I have about which the Minister knows from his own constituency. The gaps that have emerged should be a priority for us. We should not say to people that Johnny down the road has broadband but those further up the road have to wait two years to get theirs. It is important that we give these people confidence that they will be treated as a priority within the roll out, when it happens. We are all looking for information but when a procurement process is ongoing, it is very important that the Minister does not divulge information that is sensitive, commercially or otherwise. We must respect that. However, I want to compliment him on the information we have got so far. It is important we all work together, not to provoke people, but to reassure them that this Government and the Minister will deliver broadband in a way that we have never seen before. It is a vital infrastructure. We are launching the national planning framework, our ten year capital expenditure programme. However, broadband, water, wastewater, housing and health are the priorities and I offer my total support to the Minister in everything he is trying to do. My last word is to mind the gaps.
#JackieCahill	unknown-#JackieCahill-party	unknown-#JackieCahill-dob	unknown-#JackieCahill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	492	I would like to be able to stand up and say that when it comes to broadband, people in rural Ireland are happy with the situation. The patience of people in rural Ireland has evaporated. The anger out there is palpable.High-speed broadband is critical for the development of rural Ireland. It is the one service which, if put in place, puts a rural company on a level playing field with a city-based competitor. It encourages employers to stay in rural areas and to keep jobs in areas where they are badly needed. This benefits the local shop, post office and pub, thereby maintaining the fabric of rural Ireland. Rural Ireland will not survive without broadband but, unfortunately, the Government has let it down again. This country offered Eir access, through its local authorities, to the roads and footpaths. We gave it access to the doorsteps of over 75% of homes and businesses. We have given it an opportunity to make huge profits in the years ahead in the lucrative business of providing broadband in our economy. The chairman of Eir last week made much of how Eir had invested €200 million of its money rolling out broadband to 300,000 homes and businesses in small towns and villages over the past 12 months. However, he neglected to say that the retail value of providing broadband to those homes and businesses will give a healthy return on the investment within a couple of years. This is not the first time Fine Gael in government has undervalued the assets of our country. We all remember how Ireland’s mobile telephone licence was sold for a song to Esat Digifone and Denis O'Brien in the 1990s. That transaction ended up in the Moriarty tribunal and the High Court. Matters connected to that transaction remain unresolved to this day. On this occasion big business, in the shape of Eir, was allowed to cherry-pick the most lucrative areas in the country, while it strung the Government along with promises of tendering for the less profitable rural areas. However, when it had what it wanted it was out the door like a scalded cat, citing commercial, regulatory and governance issues. The Taoiseach and Government must answer for why Eir was allowed to proceed over the past three to four years without being tied into commitments for rural Ireland. Was it naivety on the part of the Minister in negotiating with a powerful company such as Eir, or was it a case of the Government not being up to the job? These questions will have to be answered. The most frustrating thing is that it did not have to end this way. This could have been a fair deal for both Eir and our economy. Eir could have negotiated a profitable deal for its company, as was its right and its responsibility to its shareholders. Equally, it was the responsibility of the Government to negotiate a fair deal for its shareholders, the ordinary men and women of the country. By any measure the Government has come up short. Either through lack of ability or carelessness the Irish people have been short-changed once again by the Government. Some 542,000 homes and businesses around the country lack access to broadband and are located in areas where it has been determined it is not commercially viable to deliver broadband. The NBP is intended to overcome this by providing a subsidy to companies to provide broadband of minimum speeds of 25 Mbps to those areas. There are serious questions about whether this speed will be sufficient to cope with future technological changes. In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, in America declared that speeds below 25 Mbps could no longer even be referred to as broadband. Essentially, the Government will provide a subsidy to the successful private sector bidder for 25 years, at the end of which the bidder will have full ownership of the infrastructure. The importance of broadband to economic growth cannot be overestimated. The National Competitiveness Council report says regional jobs growth is being stunted, and severe criticism is levelled at the sluggish roll-out of the national broadband plan to all regions. The World Bank has found that a 10% increase in broadband penetration increases economic growth by 1.3% over the long term. The facts do not lie. Ireland ranks 42nd in global rankings for the distribution of high speed broadband, while 40% of the population and 96% of the country geographically still lack commercial or fibre coverage. There are approximately 2.3 million premises in the Republic of Ireland. The chief executive officer of the Irish Small and Medium Enterprises Association, ISME, Neil McDonnell, said in August 2017:SMEs in rural areas, in particular, along the border areas and in Munster, are constantly in contact with us about the issue. The frustration for us is that we understood that the national broadband plan was going to be advanced at a certain rate, but it is not.These are the facts about broadband. We must provide it to the 530,000 rural homes as quickly as possible. We must inject an urgency that has not existed up to now. When Fianna Fáil was in government it delivered broadband to 234,000 homes and businesses across the country, meeting 100% of its target. This was unprecedented and remarkably forward thinking in next generation technology. Our current broadband policy is clear. We support the roll-out of fibre optic broadband directly to all homes and businesses in the State by way of direct State intervention and using commercial operators. The only technology that will fully future proof this delivery is via fibre to the home. Fibre to the home is fibre optic cable capable of delivering download speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second or 1,000 Mbps directly to households and businesses. With rapid advances in technology, Irish households should not have to settle for moderate rate Internet speeds which will be overtaken by technological progression in the next five years. We support the roll-out of fibre to the home and to all premises via a combination of private operators, direct State intervention where it is not commercially viable and facilitating community solutions such as group broadband schemes. However, the benchmark level of 30 Mbps as the minimum threshold for the so-called high-speed broadband promised in the Government’s plan is paltry and represents second rate ambition which will be quickly overtaken by technological advances by the time it is estimated to be completed in 2022. Given the Government's record it is hard to anticipate completion in anywhere near that timeframe. Any State intervention must use a fibre optic based network delivering broadband via fibre to the home technology directly to each premises. Fianna Fáil has taken steps to accelerate the roll-out of broadband in rural areas by bringing forward a Bill that would make it easier for telecommunications providers to share infrastructure assets such as masts and ducting. This would not only increase connectivity but would likely reduce consumer costs and prevent the construction of unnecessary masts. Our country has a proud tradition of attracting foreign direct investment. Reputation is important on the world stage. How we have handled the roll-out of broadband so far has seriously damaged our reputation. We cannot afford any more slip-ups in this process. The job ahead is difficult and has been made more difficult due to developments in the past week. However, failure is not an option with this project as the stakes for the country are high. I urge the Minister to listen to the Opposition and not to compound the mistakes already made by refusing to recognise a crisis when it is staring him in the face. If rural Ireland is to survive it must have modern infrastructure. Broadband is an essential part of that. The Government's record to date is extremely poor. The removal of Eir from the market will make the job more difficult, but we will insist on the Government delivering broadband to rural Ireland.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	493	Earlier today I was considering the current situation compared with what it was a year ago when there were three bidders in this process.SIRO pulled out for its own reasons and Eir has also now withdrawn. We are left with just one bidder in this process to provide broadband to the most difficult to reach parts of the country, areas that have the most potential because they are so under-developed. Eircom was privatised many years ago. Many ordinary people were stung, having been encouraged to buy shares in Eircom, many for the first time in their lives, and ended up losing so much. Eircom has since been taken over on seven occasions and asset-stripped on all of them. When I travel the rural roads of counties Leitrim, Sligo or Roscommon I see telephone polls hanging into ditches and gone white and almost rotten because, as I was told by a senior person in Eircom a couple of years ago, the budget for dealing with such matters was pulled after one of those takeovers. There was no budget for maintenance, apart from whatever trickle could be gotten by a manager who was prepared to go in and do something in an area. Members are very aware of the huge number of people left without broadband in rural Ireland. There are 11,500 such people in County Leitrim, over 17,000 in County Cavan, over 34,000 in County Donegal, over 14,500 in County Sligo and almost 19,000 in County Roscommon. All those people have the potential to prosper and try to have a future. As I said, the parts of the country affected are those with the most potential because they are the most under-developed. The lack of progress in the roll-out of broadband indicates that under-development will continue. A national school in Kiltyclogher in north Leitrim almost closed last year. It set up an online website called KiltyLive to encourage families to move to the area. There is a mediocre broadband service in the village but a mile or two outside it there is practically no broadband, nor any mobile phone coverage. The same pertains in many of our rural areas. Unless the Government gets to grips with this situation we will be lost. A few years ago in Carrigallen, beside where I live, people were worried because under the broadband plan at the time Hutchison 3G was erecting a mast to provide broadband to the town. The mast went up. People were worried about its implications but it is there and working. However, there is still no broadband in the area. The local supermarket cannot have an ATM because the broadband is not strong enough for it to operate. The national school had to get broadband from a separate provider which beams it in from Corn Hill in County Longford. Each inception of the national broadband programme has been a failure. The big failure on this issue is one of ideology. If one is determined to do something according to an ideological outlook, it will not work because ideology is the greatest solvent of all and disperses all thought in its path. It prevents people from thinking about anything other than the ideological route down which they are going. The ideological route down which this Government and past Governments have gone is that of private being better. The great things done in this country and every other country in the world were achieved when a Government went in, rolled up its sleeves, did the work on behalf of the people and provided for the people. Broadband is an issue on which that must be done. The State owns the ESB network whereby there is a system of poles and lines through everyone's fields and gardens to every house. That is the route through which the State can deliver broadband to everyone. Any other route is about somebody making a profit and that is the problem with this process. All Members are aware of the huge number of people waiting for broadband. Those people are being betrayed. I do not blame the current Minister, Deputy Naughten, who I believe wants to do the right thing. Unfortunately, he is going down the same route as has previously been travelled, an ideological route whereby broadband must be provided by some company that will come in and do it for profit. That is the root of this disaster. At its core is the ideological problem that when one wants to provide something for the people, it must be done by the Government. The Government must be the provider of last resort and, in this case, the provider of first resort. Schemes such as rural electrification, the installation of telephone lines and water schemes around the country were all provided when the Government of the time rolled up its sleeves and did the work. When such schemes were left to private providers to implement, they took the profitable parts and the rest could go to hell. That is what we see in this case and that is what will happen. I have no faith in the one provider left in the process. That provider is there to make money, not to provide rural broadband to people. Eircom was privatised to get private money in order that we would have the capital assets to roll out broadband across the country. That did not happen and it will not happen tomorrow, the day after that, next year or the year after that. Anyone who thinks otherwise is fooling him or herself. We need opportunity for the people, not a few well-connected people who think their company will be able to make them big profits from this process. That is not good enough. All Members who have contributed to this debate have mentioned the potential that broadband can bring to people, not just in rural areas but in the entire country, including cities. Everyone must ensure they have connection to the Internet because, no matter where one lives, it provides an opportunity to do business with any part of the world. If we want that to happen, the Minister must take charge and state that the Government is going to roll up its sleeves and do it and that will be done now by getting the money on the international markets, putting it in and doing it. To hell with anyone in Europe who says the Government is not allowed to do so because of some European law that has been made up about it. We need broadband for the people and that broadband should be delivered by the Government they elected, not some provider that rolls up with money it made on a stock exchange. That is nonsense and will not work. The ideological problem in this process must be tackled. The Government must realise that it has a responsibility to provide broadband and make a real difference to people. It must walk away from the ideology that has brought us along this route for so long and destroyed not just this situation but many others such as Irish Water and the other quangos that were set up. If we are to provide broadband to people, the Government must do so through the ESB network that already brings a line to every house in the country. That is the way forward and anything else is a means of lining somebody's pocket, which is not good enough. I do not think the Minister believes it is good enough. If Members realised the potential in this situation, action would be taken. This country could have an advantage over many other places and yet we turn our backs on that because someone thinks he or she can make a handy few bob. That is no longer good enough. When we look back on this in 20 years, it will be considered a lost opportunity. The opportunity is now and I appeal to the Minister and the Government to grasp it and tell the remaining bidder that there is no longer a bidding process if there is only one bidder and we will have to start again. The Government must go back to basics. It should go to the international markets, raise the money, contract whoever needs to be contracted and get fibre optic cable up on those poles and into everyone's house. When people see fibre optic cables coming up to the gables of their houses, they will start to believe in the Government and that it is working for people. It is an opportunity for the Government. However, if it continues on its current route with one remaining bidder seeking a profit from the process, it is throwing that opportunity away.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	494	I welcome the opportunity to speak on what is a hugely important issue for many people in rural Ireland and in my constituency of Kildare South. In my seven years as a Deputy in the House I have spoken on the issue of broadband on a number of occasions. I acknowledge the progress that has been made from when I first spoke on this matter. Many areas of Kildare have high-speed broadband now that did not have it when it started out. In Kildare South we are a mixed constituency of urban and rural. Those pockets of rural south Kildare that do not have the broadband still feel it. I do not need to tell the Minister about the importance of broadband and how it impacts on people's lives in so many different ways. It impacts on family life and people's ability to share their entertainment together as a family with new means of live streaming television and Netflix and so on. Not having that ability is a huge frustration when one's neighbours have it. It affects families in an educational context also when the children come home from school. They may have had iPads in school but struggle to do that work at home. It affects small businesses too. While there are some people in houses who have received broadband and do not know themselves since, I am aware of one constituent who needed to download a large file so he drove to a hotel carpark 15 minutes away. He sat in his car while robbing the hotel Wi-Fi on his laptop so he could send or download a large file. People who work in the agricultural sector and farmers now do all their systems online. In the equine sector people want to buy horses online, for example, and they look at sales in France and other places. They may be selling a foal and cannot follow on with it. If they do not have high-quality broadband, they have to travel to the sales and miss out on the work at home, along with all the work that goes with that. The ability of people to work from home is also affected. Consider all of the congestion. A lot of this is linked up to the national planning framework. We talk about taking pressure off our roads. Broadband can allow people to work at home and not have to spend all those hours on the M50. They can also have that quality of life element to be home with their kids, collect them from school and help them with their homework. There is a frustration for those people who do not have broadband. Broadband is very much like oxygen. If people have it they do not even realise they are breathing and they do not think about it too much. For those without it, however, it is the biggest frustration in the world. I accept that the scale and nature of the national broadband plan is a massive undertaking. Given the money that is being invested, it is important that the system is future-proofed and that the fibre to the homes is the best system. While my own dwelling has wireless and it does for now, I am aware that the future capacity of the household will not be matched by that. This is why the long-term plan is the right approach. We talk about the national broadband plan in the future tense, as something to be rolled out and to be delivered and that is coming our way. I recognise the fact that when this Government started there was 50% coverage around the State. We are now up at 71% and by the end of this year we are on target to be at 77%. A lot of that delivery is because of the national broadband plan, and because of it, many of the places in Kildare that did not have broadband a number of years ago have it now. The plan drove the private sector to put in the €2.75 billion worth of private investment in the past five years. I recognise this. Our focus, and the frustration of the Deputies in the House, is now on the remaining percentages. As we work down the numbers, these are the hardest to reach houses that will be the most difficult. Given the scale of the project, it is understandable that the final percentage will be the hardest to reach premises that will take the most time and the most cost to the taxpayer, but at no cost to the dweller. We recognise the importance of this infrastructure. This is on the same scale as the electrification of Ireland in the 1920s. The problem with percentages and projections is that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment has issued many of these in the past and, for a variety of reasons, some of the projections have slipped. This was long before the Minister's time. This has, however, led to frustrations. I do not for one minute doubt the Minister's conviction and his determination. If there is an issue with the public confidence in the Department, it is that some percentages have slipped in the past. With regard to Eir pulling out of the plan last week, I do not accept the argument of Opposition parties trying to tell us that the best way to deal with it is to stop, down tools, not do anything else and navel gaze for the next six months or beyond. I also do not accept that we should tell the bidder who stuck with the process all the way through, and who is backed up by SSE, John Laing and some very credible large-scale companies which operate worldwide, that we will walk away from this project now. We are in this now and we have to see it through, but valid questions have to be asked. I agree with the amended motion on the basis that if the Department were to review the process now, leaving aside the inordinate delay such a review would cause, it would undermine the credibility of the process we are in. It would also lead to a host of other problems. Deputy Martin Kenny can shake his head all he wants but that is a fact. Valid questions, however, must be asked of the Minister and his officials, some of which will be difficult to answer for commercial reasons. Perhaps the Minister will answer them when concluding the debate. While there is no price on this scheme in the public domain, and I would not expect that there would be, I am sure the Minister has a figure in his head and I am sure the Minister for Finance has a figure in terms of the taxpayers' money that we cannot go beyond. I would like some reassurance that state aid rules still apply and that there will be a point at which if Enet looks for too much, it will be told "No". It is not a blank cheque and it should know that. While the Minister cannot publicly talk about a plan B, and I understand that to do so would undermine the process, we must make sure that plan B is a very real and live option. We trust the Minister that it will be there to take out. Rather than stopping a process that people have concerns about, the Minister must drive it on and make it work. He has said he has the conviction to do this, but if it does not happen, then we must have the plan B to look at and to go with. We cannot be held to ransom on this. There are still a lot of cards left to play and we have made huge progress on it. The 300,000 houses that Eir has committed to do are, I understand, on a contractual basis. The roll-out of that has been a cause of frustration for those who see their neighbours getting it and who do not have it themselves. I welcome the appointment of a broadband officer in every local authority. I have found this very useful. Where broadband was coming on line and where there were local small businesses in rural areas, we were able to contact the broadband officer in the county council and get him or her to make the case back through Eir for that. It has proven a very important aspect where there is an economic ability and where there are jobs involved. Right now we have delivered 71% high-speed broadband around the State in a project of massive scale the likes of which has not been seen for a generation. By the end of this year we will be at 77%. We are united behind the Minister in driving on to ensure we hit that 100% as soon as possible. We are mindful of the fact that the hardest places to reach will be the ones that will take the most amount of time. The prize is a big one for us. When we talk about the national planning framework and what we will look like in 20 or 30 years, we look at the kind of Ireland we want and the extra one million people who will live in the State. We want 75% of that population growth to be outside of cities. For me as a rural dweller who is surrounded by green fields, the most important element of that is connectivity in transport and in broadband. We talk of addressing both of those issues. The national planning framework looks at 20 years from now and this is big vision stuff. The frustrations of the couple of years of slippage we have had with regard to hitting the 100% target will be looked back upon over a ten or 20 year period. The scale of the project we took on will also be seen. The big prize is the quality of life and the quality of jobs. As I said earlier, this will affect families, small businesses and all the knock-on impacts in the local communities. Parents will be at home in the evening to bring their children to the GAA club and to help out and volunteer. They will be able to use the local shops and support them. They will be involved in the community and voluntary sector in a better way because they can work from home and have a quality of life at home with all the different benefits that brings. It will take pressure off our cities and larger areas, and it will take away the drudgery of the commute that does not need to happen on such a large scale if we have that plan. Connectivity is at the heart of all this. It is at the heart of everything we will talk about in the coming weeks. We are with the Minister and we are completely committed to seeing the delivery through. We wish the Minister well in this endeavour, but I urge him and his officials behind the scenes to have that plan B and not let us be hostages to fortune in the situation we are in. This is not a situation that anybody wanted to be in, but I completely disagree with any suggestion that we should walk away from that process or throw it up in the air, as it were. From a political perspective, if we were to do that, the very same Opposition parties that asked for it would attack us for doing so. It would be politically expedient for them.The right thing to do here is to drive on with this process and plan for all eventualities.

As the main employment base in this very rural area is agriculture, people have to do a great deal of work online. It will be a great relief for them to know that they are about to get very good broadband infrastructure. This also will be a great improvement for their family lives. It will be a great improvement for their children who are attending college in Galway or Athlone because they will not have to stay in those locations at the weekend. They will be able to come home and it will be possible for them to download and upload their various assignments from home. Up to now, they have had to stay in Galway or Athlone because this infrastructure has not been in place. When I speak to people in places in my constituency like Kylebrack, Portumna and Headford, they tell me their broadband speeds are not great. They are not reaching out to the entire area. I had better not forget Killimor, which is definitely in the black hole where broadband will never be provided. Even under the existing plan, it was going to be left on the back foot. At the same time, it was going into the town itself. It was going to be delivered in a number of spaces, but it was not going to be delivered out. People like to know where the vision is going. People like to know the timeframes. People do not look for something that cannot be delivered. However, it is certain that people do not like to hear that something is going to be stalled or held up, or that they might never get it. They like to know. As Deputy Heydon said, broadband is like oxygen to people in rural Ireland. Reference has been made to the national planning framework document. Much of the infrastructure that people need is broadband. Many people are going to work from home. They are not going to commute to Dublin. They will not go into Galway because it does not have a ring road. They will not go into Sligo because of the lack of connectivity in the absence of the completion of the M17-M18. They certainly need fibre-optic broadband coming to their doors. They need to know it is future-proofed. They need to know, just as we did in the case of rural electrification, that the light will not go off after five or ten years. They need to know that broadband will continue to be available so that they can maintain their businesses and other forms of infrastructure. As Deputy Heydon said, this is about family lives, education, small businesses and people who work. All the Departments, including the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Employment Affairs and Social Protection, have gone online. We are encouraging this. Even banking has gone online. Everything has gone online. We are telling people we need them to move with the modern era, but unfortunately they do not have the opportunity to do so because they do not have the broadband or the broadband speeds. We do not want to stop progress. I would not want to be part of anything that would stop progress. When I knocked on the doors of Galway East, broadband was one of the biggest issues I encountered. People told me they need broadband so that their children who are in education in Galway can come home to Kylebrack or Marble Hill at the weekend and be able to upload their assignments from there. It was costing these parents a fortune to keep their children in Galway at the weekend, but they could not come home because they would be unable to download their materials. The reality of what we are talking about in these statements is the lack of a form of infrastructure that is available in our cities, where it works really well and is taken for granted. I would like to speak about the upgrading of the fibre broadband that took place in my home town of Portumna, where my office is located. Eighteen months ago, I could not work from my own home or take a phone call in my house. I was living in another black hole. I will admit that the improvement in mobile phone coverage has made a difference to my life. I can work from home. I can spend more time with my children. I do not need to be down in the office at unearthly hours of the night because I have to send an email or something like that. I know the value of this infrastructure, but I also understand the frustration, upset and anguish that people are experiencing at present. There is a fear among the 33% of people who are waiting for broadband that they will not get it. They do not know when they will get it. I do not want to speak about the history of the past - who bought what, where it all went and everything else like that. I think we need to start talking positively. As Deputy Martin Kenny said, we need to know where this is going, when our sleeves will be rolled up and when the people will get broadband. Broadband is what people are looking for. If it is not delivered into people's houses, it will crucify every single politician the next time we knock on the doors. We are all realistic in this regard. There has to be a real meeting of minds with those involved, including the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Department of Finance and the sole remaining bidder. There could be a public private partnership. I am only throwing out there these sorts of things. We have to know how we are going to deliver to the people. A great deal of education in secondary schools has moved online. Many second-level students are working from e-books. They need to have an opportunity to upload their lesson plans when they go home in the evenings. I think I have set out many of my frustrations in this regard. The big prize in rural Ireland is getting fibre-optic broadband into one's house. I wish the Minister well because I think he has an enormous task. I do not think we can go back to the people without having delivered broadband on this occasion.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	500	I thank the Chair for the opportunity to contribute to this debate. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, needs to have the support of all parties in this House in his efforts to deliver the national broadband plan. Success is not guaranteed, but I believe the process in which the Minister and the Government are engaged is the correct one. No major infrastructural plan of this nature will have a smooth passage. No plan like this will not hit a bump in the road. A bump on the road should not mean we deviate from the plan. Many speakers in this House are speaking as if the national broadband plan has already failed. It has not failed. It is still alive and kicking. I believe the Minister will deliver on it. We all know the importance of broadband. When the Minister was in my constituency of Clare earlier today, he spoke about broadband and about the delivery of services that depend on broadband. He referred to the trading online voucher scheme, which enables companies to expand their websites to allow them to trade online, thereby increasing their sales and their workforce and developing their businesses and industries. He also spoke about eLocal, which is a new plan based on broadband that will allow people to buy locally and have their goods delivered locally by An Post. The Minister has outlined these plans in relation to broadband. I believe they show his commitment on delivering broadband to urban and rural Ireland. The present situation is not what we would wish for. I know it is not what the Minister would wish for. That does not mean the plan has been abandoned, or so badly damaged that it cannot continue. That is not the case. We cannot depend on commercial enterprises to support national infrastructure if they do not wish to do so. This plan should not be thrown offline just because it might not help such enterprises to maximise their profits or does not suit their market forces. At present, we have a competitive bidding process that is continuing. Fianna Fáil is proposing to stall the process to facilitate an additional review which could last for two months, six months or a year. Where will Fianna Fáil find the experts to advise on this reviewed process? The process already has international experts giving their expertise on how it should be managed.Where will Fianna Fáil find new experts to give an alternative view? Should an alternative view be given, would that not open the process to litigation from those who have already opted out of the process if the terms and conditions of the broadband plan were to be changed? I do not see that reviewing and delaying is going to add anything to this process. We already have the experts we need and stalling the process is like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Deputy Dooley talks about bringing a bullock to the fair and finding there is only one buyer. I think it is more serious when a solution is proposed that throws the baby out with the bathwater, leaving nothing to bring home, neither the money nor the bullock. Rural Ireland needs to have broadband and should not languish endlessly without it. What Fianna Fáil is proposing would lead to that. What we need now is implementation and we have seen in so many parts of government that plans are produced but fail in the implementation process. We have seen it in our health service and are now seeing it in broadband. We have a process and should continue with it. We should implement it to the maximum and not continually review. We need broadband to 540,000 homes in Ireland. That is the reality of rural Ireland. It is probably going to be the last place broadband is going to be delivered but it must be delivered. The national broadband plan is the way this will satisfy rural Ireland. It is going to be slower than people had anticipated; it is always slower than people want. People in rural Ireland are crying out for broadband but to abandon the national broadband plan because it hits a bump is a very negative way to approach the subject. If any Minister is going to deliver broadband, it will be Deputy Naughten. During the negotiations for a partnership Government, broadband was a key issue for all rural Deputies, from the Rural Independent Group to the Deputies who are here, to the Minister, Deputy Naughten himself. It was a key area of discussion. Deputy Naughten is the Minister who will deliver this and the broadband plan that he proposes is the method by which it will be delivered. The current state of affairs should be seen as a stimulus to the broadband plan rather than knocking it at every turn. It is concentrating people's minds and certainly has concentrated the mind of the Minister in respect of delivering on this programme. Perhaps that is very good because it has clarified and concentrated people's thinking on the matter. The plan does lead to uncertainty and anxiety. I hear that every day in my constituency office as most of us do. People are uncertain as to how this programme is going to be delivered and when they see bidders dropping out they feel the process is flawed. It is the commercial interests of those who dropped out that are flawed, rather than the programme. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, should be given every support in delivering this plan. High-speed broadband has to be delivered to a dispersed population and the national broadband plan may be used as a template for other dispersed populations in other countries as a method of excellence on how a broadband plan can be delivered to a dispersed population. This House should give the Minister every support and freedom to finish his job and should not place obstacles in his way when every bump is encountered.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	501	I am grateful to my party for pushing to have this debate and to get everything on the record about this issue, which is the signal issue in rural Ireland. The post offices and Garda stations are important issues but this is much more important. All the issues have been well played out in this debate. I intend to list the concerns of my constituents. I invited them to address their concerns to me this week. I have heard it all before because many of them have been on to me for some considerable time. I asked them to comment on their positions and feel it would be useful to read the comments into the Dáil record. Kevin from the Slane area: "very inconsistent". Carol from Rathkenny: "area is very poor". They had 0.5 Mbps with Vodafone through the Eir line and recently moved to mobile broadband with a separate home phone and it is costing a fortune. Jane from Drumree: "no broadband or television". Mary from Rathkenny: "bad broadband". Gareth in respect of a school in Culmullen: "the fibre stops 500 m from the school". This is all across the place. I mBaile Ghib sa Ghaeltacht, tá an snáithín leathanbhanda ag dul díreach in aice leis an scoil, ach níl leathanbhanda ag an scoil Gaeltachta sin. There is no priority to connect schools. I say that as education spokesman as well. It is absolutely outrageous that schools are not prioritised because at the very least if the children do not have broadband at home surely they should be able to have broadband in their schools. That is right up and down the constituency. Ciara from Newgrange: "very bad coverage there". Many others from the Dowth and Newgrange area have been in touch as well. Shane from Screen says that Screen seems to be have been given fibre to the home in various patches but there are big gaps between each patch. This makes no sense to me; some are given incredible speeds while their neighbours are barely even getting internet signal. That is the digital divide. It is not just between urban and rural areas but between rural and rural. Some people have it due to the Minister's decision of last year with Eir. The Government, in cahoots with Eir, gave it to some people to try and get them off their backs but they created an awful divide in rural Ireland.  Assumpta, north of Navan, says there is no broadband in Castletown Kilberry, extremely poor mobile broadband only, very expensive and slow. Monica in Cormeen, a rural area in north Meath: "very bad mobile and broadband coverage". Again, there are comments in respect of Dowth and Newgrange from Margaret. Constituents just outside the town of Kilcock say there is no broadband and they are paying over the top for a very limited satellite Internet service. Mobile coverage is a joke as well. One constituent tried to get a landline but was unsuccessful. If they had a proper landline, Sky would give them broadband. They are only a couple of miles outside Kilcock; it is ridiculous. Liam is in the Kilcloon area, where today they had a "no wash, no drink" water notice from Irish Water. Everybody puts it up on social media but in Kilcloon, which is just a few miles outside the town of Maynooth, a lot of people would not have had the broadband to look at WhatsApp, Twitter or Facebook to find out about a very urgent health situation today where children suffered serious burns as a result of negligence that has been alleged on the part of Irish Water. Linda in the Kiltale area: "Eir has stopped fibre broadband halfway up in Derrypatrick, Drumree in Kiltale". It is not right that the other people are suffering bad Wi-Fi. Rosemary says that Eir fibre is being rolled out in two directions towards her house but it stopped short of hers and a lot of others in the area. At present, they can get fixed line broadband at a speed of 2 Mbps. It is a joke so they have opted for a very limited 100 GB very expensive mobile broadband which really only lasts 20 days. It is ridiculous. It is impossible to afford to pay for that for longer than 20 days in the month. That is what is happening. People are so frustrated at this digital divide. Colette tells me there is no broadband. I know this. I know all these issues but it is important to read them into the record. There is no broadband in the Kilbeg area. They are paying a fortune for satellite broadband with mediocre coverage. Peter Whelan from Slane is a man who featured on "Nationwide" recently in respect of his organic pig farm where he produces the best of bacon. I bought my Christmas ham off Peter this year as I usually do. He lives just outside the village of Slane. He has no broadband whatsoever. He is trying to run a business with a mobile phone that only works in one corner of his house. This is a man who has been featured on television, who is part of the Meath food series and the Boyne Valley food series where we are really trying to promote the best natural food products that we can get. The food is not processed very much but really is the best of stuff. He can only get mobile coverage in a corner of his house and is trying to sell products and organise things. The utility company is currently putting in new cables, but only to the main road at the end of their lane at Rathmaiden in Slane. Maria tells me the story of Scoil Ultain Naofa i mBaile Ghib sa Ghaeltacht. Tá an cás sin luaite agam cheana agus tá sé sin ag tarlú ar fus na ceantair tuaithe. Orla tells me in respect of Killeen in Dunsany that broadband is being rolled out to the first three houses. The majority of the houses are not being serviced.Catherine, who lives south of Slane, tells me that she lives near the main road and has difficult traffic to navigate, but she has no broadband. She can see all the traffic passing by every day of the week. What can she do? David says that he has Eir landline and broadband which costs €62 a month for 3 Mbps. Eir mobile costs him €45 per month for 1 to two Mbps. He cannot cancel because of contracts. His mobile phone, on the Three network, gets over 10 Mbps and he only pays €20 per month. He lives in the Duleek area, and says that the service is a joke. In my own case I have to say that the Three mobile coverage is better than what Eir is providing via landlines.  Aidan in Dowth says there is no broadband in Dowth, Newgrange or Knowth, which are world heritage sites. My good friend, Michael Lynch from Corboggy, in Moynalty says there is very poor broadband there and in all the townlands in the vicinity. That is a CLÁR area and is a rural area that I do not want to see forgotten about. We talk about rural and urban divides. We are talking about areas such as Corboggy, CLÁR areas, very rural areas in the north of my constituency. We are also talking about areas just outside Drogheda, Maynooth and Kilcock which have poor broadband. Sarah tells me that she cannot get broadband in Bellewstown. Another constituent says that there is no broadband at all in Woodtown and that the only option is a plug-in stick. Grainne says that she has a family of six, with four children under six years old. They live in Kilcloon, seven kilometres from the university town of Maynooth. Their house is one of 14 on a one kilometre long lane, and six of the houses have received e-fibre broadband. That kind of divide on a lane is isolating people and is causing terrible hardship for them. It is hardship for professional people such as Grainne who I am sure would like to work from home occasionally but cannot. Keena tells me that she works from home and tries to run an e-commerce business. She says that it is incredibly difficult because her broadband is so unreliable. She lives only one kilometre off the Trim Road at Batterstown, and e-fibre only reaches the first few houses on the road. Claire tells me that she lives in Ballymacall in the south of the county. Eir told her that it could not provide her with standard broadband in her home because it is at the end of the line and the signal is lost for weeks at a time. She says there is a good signal at the gate but it weakens the further up the drive she goes. Deirdre tells me that Kilcloon, Batterstown and Culmullen all need a better service. These are areas which are very close to Dublin. These are not places like Connemara or the Burren down in Clare. This is very close to Dublin, and we still cannot get it right. Nicky tells me that he cannot get any sort of broadband as his home is too far from the main exchange in Dunboyne. Even Imagine, which has tried to be innovative, is not an option because of the trees around his home. Vicky tells me that she can get a maximum of 2 Mb in Longtown in the south of Meath, in the Culmullen area. She says that it is a disgrace because there are more than 20 houses on this road. The fibre roll-out stops at Mulhussey on the Maynooth side and also on the Kilcock side, totally skipping her area. When she contacted Imagine, she found out that the mast was full so there was no decent alternative option. Justine says that she lives on a road between the main Trim road between Batterstown and Kennedy Road in the Dunboyne area, at the back of Woodpark Stud. She says that fibre is running down the Trim road and is being started on Kennedy Road. Despite that, her road, which is in the middle and has approximately ten houses, is being ignored. Charles, who is a veterinary professional, tells us that he cannot do school homework or projects with kids and cannot work from home. He says that he has relocated a business from the area because of Internet issues. I believe it was a useful exercise to set out the concerns of my constituents, representing a broad cross-section of opinion, from very isolated areas to very highly populated rural areas. They cannot get the broadband they need. It is a crying shame, and it is an indictment on the Government that the process has gone this way. I wish the Minister well, because my constituents and I want broadband, but the Government is going to have to get its act together on this issue.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-02-07 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	502	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate and to have these extra hours. What was allowed last night on the Private Members motion, which I know was limited to two hours, could not do justice to the amount of concern that people in the House have about broadband. It is a fundamental issue for all of Ireland at this stage. It is a fundamental issue for the development of our island as a whole and to ensure we have proper development. We talk about regional development, developing the regions and ensuring the population is dispersed throughout the island, and we have all kinds of grandiose notions about it. This is a fundamental issue. I have spoken to colleagues who have travelled quite extensively throughout the world, to parts of Peru, Chile, Brazil and Argentina and even the remote islands off the coast of Brazil. In small towns where there might not even be running water, in every hostel there was Wi-Fi and Internet access. It was the same in Cambodia, Vietnam and Thailand. We look at ourselves as a first world country and there is also a lot of talk about booming economies and expanding populations, but we are in the dark with regard to high-speed broadband. Many people tell us they cannot continue their business. An agriculture consultant has told me it takes up to an hour to send an email. That is not sustainable where the person is living. It is not sustainable for that person to work from home. We are not empowering experts in their fields such as agricultural consultants who are highly trained and educated and articulate in how they deliver their services. A Deputy from Clare was scoring some point with Deputy Dooley on this issue. The reality is that broadband has failed our communities. I was a Member of the previous Dáil as the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on communications. I was here in December 2013 when Pat Rabbitte sat in front of us and just before the local elections in 2014 there was a massive announcement that broadband would be delivered. We almost thought broadband would be delivered before we went to bed that night. Alex White took over as Minister, and in every debate and every five or six weeks at Question Time we were told the Government was waiting for state aid or EU approval, that the tender documents were ready and all the paperwork had been done on the Irish side but the Government was waiting for all kinds of dates. If we check the Dáil record it was suggested that this would be done in the middle of 2015 and then the end of 2015. It was all about dates as to when we would have a programme in place for places such as Kiskeam and Banteer and other places throughout my constituency that do not have access to high-speed broadband. Young people doing their homework at every level on the education spectrum do not have access to broadband. It absolutely makes sure they are second-class citizens. We have seen the Eir programme being delivered and we have seen places in Banteer in particular where there are six or seven houses where the services are being cut. We have tried everything to get it extended. We have seen it in Kiskeam where there are almost 20 houses at the cut-off point, and it cannot or will not be extended. High-speed broadband is not being delivered to these communities. There is a massive social divide. Commentators have been looking at it as a rural-urban divide but it is not. There are places 15 miles from O'Connell Street having serious difficulty with getting broadband. People have spoken about the telecoms industry and telephones in the 1970s and early 1980s and the ESB in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when electricity was brought to every corner of the country, whether one was in the remotest part or the most thickly populated part. This is a fundamental issue for us. I spoke about 2013. That is five years ago. We are no nearer to getting universal access to broadband than we were five years ago. People will say there are a range of plans, agendas and documents, but I do not believe we are getting anywhere near universal broadband.If we could help our citizens get universal access to broadband, whether they are living in remote parts of Cork North-West, urban centres or whatever, it would help enable us to have balanced regional development. Companies at the cutting edge of technology are generating massive amounts of products, such as pumps and so on, and are exporting them to Scotland, the rest of the United Kingdom and mainland Europe. They have subsidiary offices in Dublin. They are paying €800 a month for a broadband service in north Cork and €50 a month for a broadband service in Dublin. That is simply not sustainable. The sooner we stand up and admit that this plan is not working and that we should go back to brass tacks, the better. Many people spoke about the Eircom poles. There is one basic piece of infrastructure this country still holds, that is, the ESB networks. Every single corner of the country has proper electricity poles and they have been checked and maintained thoroughly. The Vodafone-ESB joint venture in 2012 or 2014 was spoken about. At the time I was shown the fibre-optic cable that would be put on those lines to deliver broadband services. That infrastructure is in place. I genuinely believe that the State will have to move in, and that a new semi-State company should be formulated to deliver this plan. We have all kinds of agendas, legal advice and so on but the basic point is that either we are concerned about delivering regional development and providing a broadband service, which is as important for today's farmer, housewife, children going to school and everyone else, or we are not. There are very few people who are not bringing some of their work home to do in the evening or who try to get information late at night on whatever services they are working on. The most basic need we could meet for them is to give them access to broadband services. Otherwise, we are disenfranchising people and making them second-class citizens. There was fine talk in the debate last night and we had the argy-bargy because Fianna Fáil put down this motion and challenged that there should be a review. God forbid that the world would fall in because we were going to have a review of what has now failed. We should stand up and say that we are not delivering broadband, the process has failed us so we should now look at how best we can avoid another five years of talk about it because five years have already passed. Deputy Rabbitte spoke earlier about getting basic mobile phone coverage. In some parts of the country, there is not basic mobile phone coverage. Technology has developed greatly in 20 years but the same pockets of the country that were without mobile phone coverage 20 years ago are without mobile phone coverage today. What did the representatives of the telecommunications industry and the telecoms regulator say when they came before the committee three or four years ago? They said there was more data now on phones and it is more difficult to pick up a signal. If someone had the most basic phone 20 years ago and they were not able to get a signal in parts of north Cork, the same basic phone would not get the signal today. That is not advancing our case. We have to be realistic. We are facing a massive challenge. We can have all the public relations and fine talk about this issue but we are at a juncture. In early 2018 we are commemorating many great achievements but I believe we will be judged on how we deliver broadband to enable every one of our citizens to continue their work and live their lives whether it is in north west Cork, Dublin, Meath or any other part of the country. We are totally disadvantaged in that regard. In terms of this debate, we will be looking for more time because all of us have more to say on the issue. We should start from scratch and admit that this process is a complete and absolute failure.

I met people from an English company in Sligo this morning who are prepared to set up a business in my home town of Ballymote. The Minister is very familiar with it; he knows the area very well. Unfortunately, we do not have the broadband service to allow this company to start up. It is a small company. We are looking at eight to ten jobs. We have the premises but, unfortunately, we do not have the broadband. It would be very easy for me, or anybody else, to come in here tonight and criticise the Minister but I will not do that. The Minister set out on a programme. Unfortunately, we had three companies tendering for this contract. Two of them, despite what I am sure were the Minister's best efforts, have pulled out and we are down to one. It is easy for those companies to pull out, particularly Eir, because it has cherry-picked the best and easiest to manage people who need broadband in terms of cities and so on.
