#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Section 11(1) of the Public Service Management Act 1997 makes provision for the appointment of special advisers to my office. As provided for in section 11(3) of the Act, the terms and conditions of these appointments are subject to determination by the Minister for Finance. Such appointments are exempt from the general rules governing civil servants and politics, for example, they can be members of political parties. The appointments are also subject to the Civil Service Regulations Acts 1956 to 1996 and any other Act for the time being in force relating to the Civil Service.The role of advisers is to keep me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, administrative and media matters. Under the direction of the programme manager, their primary function is to ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the Government's programme. Each of the advisers liaises with a number of Departments and acts as a point of contact in my office for Ministers and their advisers. They attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to their responsibilities. They also liaise, on my behalf, with organisations and interest groups outside of Government.In addition, a number of my advisers have specific responsibilities in relation to speech drafting. My programme manager meets other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis and reviews the papers for the Government meeting of that week. He monitors and reports to me on the programme for Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	1	At a press conference yesterday, the advocacy group One in Four announced it  was to cease operation due to a shortage of funding from the Department of Health and Children. During that press conference, it emerged that a telephone call was made to the One in Four group on 12 September, following which the director contacted the Taoiseach's special programme manager who met him on 15 September and confirmed that this telephone call had not come from the Department of the Taoiseach. He suggested that it might have come from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science or the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.Has there been any follow-up on that? Did the special adviser report the substance of that meeting to the Taoiseach? When special advisers to the Taoiseach meet with groups such as One in Four and others, do they have the Taoiseach's imprimatur or do they merely report back on the substance and content of those meetings and the matters discussed?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Frankly, I would need to check on the first question as I do not want to say there was no contact.On the second question, meetings are normally arranged when people write in asking to meet me and where I feel it would be important for a representative of my Department to meet them. I would ask advisers to deal with these requests. In most cases, although perhaps not all, they would brief me on the content of those meetings. I would have to check whether someone met that particular group. I can either report back to the Deputy or he can raise this again with me. I just did not check this matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	4	It is unusual that the Taoiseach is not as well briefed as he normally is.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I am not. The Taoiseach's special adviser confirmed to The Irish Times that a meeting took place on 15 September concerning this telephone call. The statement from the Taoiseach's adviser was to the effect that this call about the One in Four organisation had not come from the Department of the Taoiseach.

This deals with a specific incident and I suggest the Deputy submits a question on the particular incident.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	8	With respect to the Chair, the Taoiseach has just replied that special advisers report back on what happens at meetings. Did the Taoiseach receive a report from his special adviser on the meeting that took place on 15 Sep tember about a telephone call made to One in Four which his special adviser confirmed did not come from the Department of the Taoiseach, but which he suggested may have come from the Department of Education and Science, Health and Children or Justice, Equality and Law Reform? If that was reported back to the Taoiseach, was there any follow-up or investigation? What is going on here? As the Taoiseach has rightly confirmed, special advisers and programme managers report back to him on the substance and content of meetings. Was the Taoiseach's special adviser authorised to confirm funding to the organisation in question?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	9	My advisers would never have the power to confirm funding unless it was given by the line Departments. That would always be the case. They cannot make decisions without confirmation from line Departments. I would have to check the position in regard to this case. I honestly have no recollection of the One in Four organisation in this regard. However, I know Mr. O'Gorman regularly contacts the Department of the Taoiseach. He keeps in touch. I would, therefore, need to check what happened in this instance.

Does he perceive he will get more advice as a result of the award subject to increased productivity or will there be a reduction in the number of advisers to maintain the same level of advice?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.The cross-departmental team on housing, infrastructure and PPPs usually meets once a month. It has met on nine occasions so far this year and it is planned to hold a further two meetings over the remainder of 2003. The most recent meeting of the team was held on 1 October, with the principal agenda item being the mid-term review of the NDP. That review, as the House will be aware, involves evaluations of the individual operational programmes and an over-arching evaluation being undertaken by the ESRI. Broadband was also discussed at the meeting. Energy policy will be considered at the next meeting of the cross-departmental team on 29 October and the following themes will be considered at the subsequent meeting in December: the national spatial strategy; ports; and Gaeltacht and the islands infrastructure. It is also envisaged that an outline work programme for 2004 will be agreed at the December meeting of the team.Overall, the cross-departmental team has played a valuable role in advancing the infrastructure agenda set out in the national development plan. While very good progress has been made, the Government will continue to work towards improving delivery of infrastructural projects, in both time and budgetary terms.As the House will be aware, the Cabinet committee and team are supported by an NDP communications strategy group, involving key delivery Departments and agencies. Among the key achievements and activities of the group are the establishment of an NDP-community support framework information unit under the Department of Finance to lead an information campaign; the dissemination of information on NDP investment, as required under EU regulations, through such mechanisms as regional information campaigns, a dedicated website, the NDP annual report and the In Progress newsletter launched earlier this year; the development of supplements and advertisements in the main national daily newspapers; and the commissioning of public awareness research. The communications strategy group will continue with its work over the remaining lifetime of the NDP, taking particular account of the outcome of the mid-term review process.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	15	At the Taoiseach's recent outing in Killarney in front of ecstatic fans, including Páidí Ó Sé, he announced his latest brainchild, the national infrastructure board. This seems to have arisen out of a realisation that major projects around the country have been over cost, over budget and over time principally because of swans, snails and the occasional person hanging out of a tree in the Glen of the Downs. Why has this not appeared under the 111 items of legislation listed or heads of Bills before Government or due to be published? There is no sign of it. Has it resulted from the astonishing report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, which clearly lays down the Government's inability to properly manage infrastructural projects to date, including the Luas scheme, the mad cow roundabout, the Cork School of Music and others?Does this national infrastructure board deal only with a small number of major projects? Is it to take into account the abolition of the National Roads Authority or An Bord Pleanála, or with what sorts of projects and of what scale and magnitude will the infrastructure board deal? When are we likely to see a Bill on this matter come before the House for discussion? Is it not a fact that the time remit of the national development programme will have run out by the time the national infrastructure board, complex though it may be, sees the light of day?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The question of bringing forward a Bill to expedite the processing of projects of strategic national importance is being progressed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. We would hope to have that Bill published by Christmas and discussed in the House in the next session. Better value for money outcomes are being promoted through greater use of multiannual programming and other ways of trying to keep the capital programme in line. Over recent years, mid-term evaluations have pointed to significant parts of various projects, including Luas, being on time and within the tender price.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	18	There can be other long-term delays on infrastructural projects. I dealt with this matter at Question Time with Deputy Kenny two weeks ago. I made my views clear then that we cannot get a mechanism to short-circuit everything. The method has to be precise and apply to major infrastructural projects which must be well documented. Not all projects can be dealt with in this way. The details will have to be set out in the terms of the legislation at which the Minister is looking. A variety of factors have created extremely costly delays. These include, as I have stated, swans, snails and people hanging out of trees, because the delays they create cost millions of euro.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The Taoiseach has been up a few trees.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	22	They are issues that have to be dealt with. We will continue to do that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The Taoiseach and I referred to this matter two weeks ago in respect of the Corrib gasfield. In his conversation with the president of Shell he indicated the legislation might arrive next year. Is it envisaged that the infrastructure board would cover projects such as incinerators or major chemical installations, or does the Taoiseach envisage it dealing with the electricity and gas grids? When the legislation is introduced, what sort of facility will there be to distinguish between crank and valid objections, be they from residents, organisations or agencies?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I do not want to, nor can I, pre-empt discussions on these issues within the Department or the Cabinet. It is designed to deal with major infrastructural issues, not small ones. We will have a number of major construction projects under way over the next number of years. Deputy Kenny has mentioned some of those. We will have to find a way of dealing with planning delays and other related issues. All of this will become apparent in the detail of the legislation.Shell is shortly to make a decision on the Corrib gasfield. When I met its president he had heard about this legislation. Given the timescale Shell envisages, it would have to start work on this very large gasfield next summer. My advice to the president and his officials was to go ahead under the existing planning laws because there is no way the forthcoming legislation would be of benefit to them within that timetable. They were disappointed with that.If we consider the legislation in the House after the Christmas recess and discuss it fully, it is unlikely to pass through the House until close to Easter. For Shell to begin setting up its structures at that stage would not be practical. My advice to them was that whatever decision they made, and they are talking about hundreds of millions of euro, and have already invested such amounts, they must make that decision under existing planning laws and arrangements. I know that is being discussed at the world board meeting of Shell within days.

Will he agree that its report runs contrary to the continual claim by Government that we are a European hub in terms of high technology and the development of broadband and Internet access? What is being done to address the imbal ance in broadband roll-out and Internet access between east and west, between urban and rural communities and between those coping with disadvantage in their communities and everybody else? Is the Taoiseach aware that the EU Court of Justice has ruled as not permissible the Government's proposed funding of the development of Internet access in schools? What proposals are in place to ensure schools throughout Ireland have access to a competent and efficient Internet education system?

Will the Taoiseach agree that we have lost our most appropriate source of funding, the telecommunications system, in wrongfully selling it to private interests at a time when it was proving so profitable that it could vote its directors a €446 million dividend, including €20 million to Anthony O'Reilly? Would it not have been wiser to retain such a source of critical funding to enable us address our broadband and Internet deficits? Will the Taoiseach agree that selling Eircom was a short-sighted proposal?

The second report I referred to, in case the Taoiseach has forgotten, was the EU Court of Justice report.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I asked for the name of the first report the Deputy mentioned.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Deputy Ó Caoláin, please allow the Taoiseach to continue without interruption.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I am aware of the international group referred to and wish it well with the development of broadband but its figures in relation to Ireland are totally out of date. Quite frankly, the figures given are a load of rubbish.Ireland is in fourth place behind Holland, Denmark and Sweden in the latest report on the Euro-barometer in terms of Internet penetration. It is important to understand that Ireland has a world class competitive broadband infrastructure in terms of international connectivity and the national backbone. Our system is state of the art in that respect. I have pointed out a number of times this year that we are experiencing local level network deficiencies. That is why we took the correct decision to finance, with local authorities, the building of metropolitan fibre loops in 19 towns around the country.Notwithstanding that, the Government has no intention of re-entering into discussions about Eircom. That decision was made and Deputy Ó Caoláin is entitled to his opinion. The decision was based solely on the need to deepen national competitiveness into the future while stimulating investment in broadband infrastructure. The relevant Minister has, during Question Time, given an account of what he is trying to do to activate the market in this regard. Many commercial and public sector companies in Europe were stung in relation to 3G licences. They are up to their necks in debt and have not taken up broadband to the extent they should.We are working on two parallel strands involving 19 towns around the country. The first involves infrastructure projects. I understand from the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that 17 of 19 projects are under way. The second strand deals with the management process. The Minister has put forward an appropriate model for private sector involvement in the operation and management of the local networks and placed advertisements in the Official Journal of the European Union last June. The closing date under European Union procurement procedures was 15 August and the contract is to be signed over the coming weeks.The Government has decided to provide broadband to schools and specialist schools throughout the country and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, have announced their projects in that regard. We will also, wherever we can, deliver broadband to areas of disadvantage, including community centres, where people require it. This is being done in a number of ways. Some areas will have fibre optic cables while others will have wireless technology.In response to Deputy Ó Caoláin, the central objective is to roll out phases to ensure we get the optimum private sector participation. I agree with the Deputy it is a pity there is not greater investment. We have engaged in extensive consultations with those in the industry to try to secure their involvement. The Minister will be glad to provide details on this. Additionally, over the past few years the Government has engaged the international telecommunications expert, Ira Magaziner, to assist us in mapping the way for ward. He completed a review of the Government's broadband strategy and the Minister is involved in the follow-up to that, of which he will provide details.We would like to have far greater broadband penetration. We are not in a strong position and I do not believe we will be until we can get private sector involvement. However, a huge amount of work is under way in this area and the Government has made good decisions. Nevertheless, it would be immensely helpful if we could get some of the private sector companies to engage in this area in a real way. It tends to happen that when one engages in a particular area, the others become very interested, but it is still proving difficult to get them to engage nationally.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the Cabinet has signed off on the mid-term review and, if so, will he indicate when it will be made public? Has he anything to say about its conclusions?Will the Taoiseach indicate if there are any conclusions in Government as to why PPPs are not working? Will he outline the difficulties involved in establishing a template for their operation? Will he indicate if, even at this late stage, the Government has given any consideration to appointing a political supremo to drive the implementation of the national development plan, especially in the context of evident criticism and reports, such as that of the Institute of Engineers of Ireland, which suggests that the completion date of the plan will be delayed from 2007 to 2013?With regard to the big idea emanating from his party's Ard-Fheis in Killarney proposing the establishment of an infrastructure board, will the Taoiseach indicate how it is intended that an appeal would lie in the event of issue being taken with the board on a point of law? Does it mean that an appeal must be made directly to the European Court of Justice, which must be the case given the European dimension to the infrastructure spending in this country? If there are long delays in Ireland because of snails, swans and people hanging off trees, as the Taoiseach puts it, they are three times as long in Europe. Is he providing in that proposal for judicial review or will appeals be made directly to Europe?Does the Taoiseach share my bemusement at the Minister for Transport, with all the sincerity only he can command—
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	36	That is nothing in comparison to the Deputy.

I was under the impression the Minister was its greatest critic. Does the Taoiseach agree with his Minister or the Leader of the Seanad who said it was time the Minister got his finger out?  Does the Taoiseach believe, as the Leader of the Seanad says, the mess is the creation of the present Minister for Transport or does he agree with the Minister that it is due to his predecessor? It is important that we clear up this question because we cannot have these divisions bringing what the Minister for Transport said is confusion to the project.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The mid-term review will be published shortly. A number of issues will be addressed. The Deputy asked for an insight. The Exchequer provision for national roads is a major part of the programme and it has exceeded the NDP forecast by more than 10%. Project re-scheduling will be necessary and the mid-term review will point that out. The need for re-scheduling arises from an incremental number of factors, especially construction price inflation, planning delays, capacity constraints and non-Exchequer funding shortfalls over the period. Other issues highlighted are the negotiations with the farming bodies and the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, which led to long, unavoidable delays.However, more progress has been achieved during this period than since the foundation of the State. Thirty major roads projects have been completed since 2000 comprising 231 kilometres in all, including 83 kilometres of motorway to dual carriageway standard. A further 16 schemes are under construction, involving 173 kilometres, of which motorways comprise 155 kilometres. A total of 16 projects will be completed by the end of the year and substantial planning and design work on many other projects has been undertaken. There is no need to go through the major projects but all the work that was envisaged will  not be completed. It will have to be re-scheduled and spread out. The National Roads Authority will pursue a detailed programme and roll it out in the period ahead.Construction price inflation is not nearly as bad as it was in the first few years of the programme at which point it was substantial. The Deputy does not need me to go into the figures as they are in the public domain. Public private partnerships have worked well in some areas. The Kinnegad bypass is a few months ahead of schedule. PPPs are also being used for education projects but there is not great interest in them in other areas. The Minister for Transport is anxious to proceed with other projects through public private partnership.It is not true to say PPPs have not worked. I have already mentioned the Department of Finance's view on their value, which I know is shared by a number of members of the Opposition. The fact that the State can borrow money more cheaply than those involved in some of these projects is always mentioned. There is scope in other areas. I have said to Deputy Kenny that the legislation will be debated in the House. I gave the general detail of the legislation some weeks ago.The Minister for Transport is the biggest promoter of the Luas scheme.

May I ask about the delivery of the national development plan? Funding for the BMW region under the plan so far has been less than 50% of that committed to in the plan. The relevant figure in respect of the southern and eastern region is over 160%. Will the Taoiseach elaborate, for example,  on the fact that eBay has announced that it will not go to Athlone because the necessary infrastructure is not in place? Does he not agree that this fact makes a sham of the spatial strategy? Does he not agree that there are no decent roads to connect Mullingar, Tullamore and Athlone, which have been designated as regional growth centres under the national development plan and the national spatial strategy? Will the Taoiseach elaborate on the nature of the delay in respect of the Cork School of Music, which is close to the heart of my colleague, Deputy Allen?

That is why these issues have been brought up. Some 90,000 vehicles pass by the location each day. Things change and certain matters have to be reconsidered – that is the issue. The Deputy should put down a question to the Minister for Education and Science in respect of the Cork School of Music.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	90	On foreign direct investment, it is the policy of the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in all cases to try to persuade industries to locate in the regions. Our first task is to get foreign industries into the country. If we are faced with a  choice between an industry locating in Ireland but not in one of the regions and that industry leaving the country altogether, we prefer to keep the industry in the country, wherever it locates. Some foreign companies are glad to move to the regions. Others have reasons, relating to educational facilities, public transport or proximity to other industries, not to do so. However, we endeavour to persuade companies to locate in the regions. Having a national spatial strategy and a framework to show companies, as do the IDA and Enterprise Ireland, is proving to be an efficient way of proceeding.We have a long way to go to get all our roads up to a satisfactory standard, but we must acknowledge the enormous improvement in recent years. Now that we have raised capital expenditure to between 4% and 5% of GDP, which is more than €5 billion this year, we must keep it at that level. In the past our problem has been that a few good years have often been followed by five or six very bad years. If we can maintain our capital programme at 5% of GDP, we will be able to deal with the deficiencies in our infrastructure over a sustained period. At 5% of GDP, we are spending more on our capital programme than our competing countries. Among European countries, only Luxembourg's capital programme is at a higher level than ours. I would like to see everyone in this House agreeing to maintain a capital programme at that level for ten or 15 years. If we did this, we would see an enormous change in the future and that would be preferable to looking back at what has been achieved over the past 30 or 40 years.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	92	We have not heard much detail on the infrastructure board from the Taoiseach. I presume that, having conceived the big idea, the Government will now work out the detail. I look forward to that.Does the Taoiseach accept that a political person needs to appointed to drive the implementation of the national development plan? Another quango or piece of bureaucracy will not suffice. We need someone to politically drive and lead the implementation of the plan. The plan is diffuse and several Ministers are involved in its implementation. There is no evidence that anyone was driving the plan politically in its early life during the boom years and we are now left in a logjam. Will the mid-term review examine this?How can the Taoiseach tell the House that Luas is on time and on budget when we all know this is not true? It may be on time and budget in accordance with the latest budget or schedule, but it is certainly not on time or on budget according to the plans drawn up by the former Minister, Senator O'Rourke. The Taoiseach cannot cite the  excuse of foot and mouth disease. It did not delay the Luas.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	96	Is the Taoiseach aware of the Indecon report, which feeds into the mid-term review? Can he confirm that it is scathing in the areas of electricity, communications, housing, health, research and development and the three year delay in the Luas project?How are environmental impact assessments to be catered for by the infrastructure board, given that the Taoiseach regards the process as being too slow at present? Would he agree with the many people who feel that the infrastructure board is intended to fast-track projects that are particularly close to Fianna Fáil's interests, such as the rezoning of 47 acres of woodland in Dunleer, on which a Fianna Fáil activist will make a huge profit of €9 million? Can he say whether he is really thinking in terms of the nation's long-term interests by getting so cosy with the likes of Shell over the Corrib gasfield when there is no doubt regarding the supply of gas into the country?We need to put investment in place. There has been an investment of €4 billion in transmission grids, which are favouring connections to fossil fuel rather than renewable energy sources. Does the Taoiseach not believe that the long-term interests would be better served by considering the long-term renewable energy potential of the country, as well as its needs, and by seeking to leave the Corrib gasfield unexploited until we need its oil? We do not need it at present but we will need it in the future. It would be more valuable if we left it there and concentrated on renewable energy potential.

It is based on 2002 statistics and not information that is long out of date. Is the Taoiseach aware that the report places Ireland lower in the league than developing  nations such as Peru and Croatia? Does he not acknowledge the important issue at the heart of this argument, as exemplified by eBay's decision to locate in Dublin rather than in a rural location like Athlone, as had been mooted?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	109	It has and this is why the Eurobarometer report deals with the statistics on a monthly basis. We are fourth on that list. As I have already explained to the Deputy, our problem does not concern broadband infrastructure in terms of international connectivity or the national backbone but concerns the local area. This is why the Government is trying to deal with this issue and get companies to introduce networks to 19 centres.I do not agree with Deputy Rabbitte's point. Whether projects concern schools, hospitals, roads or any other infrastructural development, the head of the Department, who is the political head of the Department, is involved in their direct implementation. Major areas of infrastructure comprise a direct political responsibility. The implementation of the national development plan in the capital programme is, in the normal course of events, a matter for individual Departments. More capital infrastructural projects have taken place in the period 2000 to 2003 than in the previous 15 or 16 years. This is a fact and we need to stop talking nonsense.On Deputy Ó Caoláin's point, I would like to get more companies into counties Monaghan and Cavan. I have no difficulty with this. However, I question the wisdom of standing up in this House and criticising private sector companies that have decided to locate in Ireland for their preferred choice of location within the country. To do too much of that would solve one's problem but the companies will locate outside the country.

The reality is that one has to try to convince private sector companies to follow the national spatial strategy and we will endeavour to do this.On the issue of gas, meeting the president of one of the biggest companies in the world is not cosying up to anybody. Showing courtesy to a person whose company has already spent in excess of €200 million on a project in this country is important and I would not be doing my job if I did not explain what happens in the legislation in this country.

Apart, however, from the normal level of maintenance which one would expect from a rail network of this kind, only in recent years has there been any upgrading of the overall DART infrastructure. Since 2000, Irish Rail has increased the capacity of the system by almost 50% by introducing 38 new DART cars. More than 90,000 passenger journeys are now made on the system every normal weekday. The DART is, however, operating at capacity and earlier this year I approved an investment programme of €176 million in the system.When this project is completed in 2005 it will provide 40 new air conditioned DART cars to bring the fleet from the original 80 units to 154 units; additional storage and other facilities for the new units; eight car train sets at peak hours, instead of the current maximum of six car trains; an upgrade of the power supply to enable it to handle the demands of longer trains; fully accessible stations along the route from Greystones to Malahide and Howth; and, a 30% increase in capacity from 11,800 to 16,000 passengers per hour at peak times in each direction. Phase two of the project, which will involve increasing the frequency of the services, will commence in 2005 and will take about two years to complete.My Department and I have been aware for some time of Irish Rail's proposals to upgrade the DART, including plans not to operate services on some parts of the system at weekends. In this regard, the need for an effective communications strategy was stressed to the company on several occasions. However, specific and final details relating to the implementation of the project, including the extent of closures of the system at weekends on the southern line, were first made known to me by the chairman of CIE and Irish Rail in the course of a meeting with him on 6 October. The final details of Irish Rail's plans were not conveyed to my Department. On 26 September, some draft details of a proposed public information campaign by Irish Rail were given to officials in my Department by Irish Rail executives. The planned campaign was subsequently changed and I understand the campaign launched on 6 October by Irish Rail was somewhat different from that which was conveyed to my officials. I have since expressed my concern to the chairman about the manner in which the public was informed of Irish Rail's plans and made it clear to him that, even at this point, it is imperative that the public is kept informed about any disruption.Additional Information.I understand the upset the works will cause both to weekend users of the DART and to businesses along the line. However, there is an inevitable level of disruption to services attendant upon works such as these being undertaken on an active railway. I am pleased Irish Rail has agreed to my request to provide normal weekend ser vices in December in the run-up to Christmas. This will go some way towards assuaging the fears of city centre traders in the vitally important period leading up to Christmas.

I understand, however, that officials in his Department were aware of the plans at least six weeks in advance of the announcement that DART services would close down on Saturdays and Sundays. Would it not have been prudent of the officials in question to mention to the Minister that services were to be reduced by 30%?Would it not be prudent to use some of the 80 new DMU diesel cars to provide a weekend service between Greystones and the city centre and, in nine months, from the northside to the city centre, given that they will not all be in use on Saturdays and Sundays and do not require electricity, which will be shut down during the upgrading works? Is the Minister aware that technology is available to provide pre-cast platforms which could be installed in all 25 stations over one weekend, rather than over an 18 month period? Will he, even at this late stage, review the feasibility of this option?

At meetings in August and September between officials of the Department and Irish Rail, the company indicated it was planning weekend closures. On 6 September, the draft posters for an advertising campaign were handed over. At that stage, it was not clear whether Irish Rail had finally decided whether there would be full closure of the line between Pearse Station and Greystones because the company had indicated in a press release some time previously that a final decision had not been taken on the sections of the line which might close. The publicity literature showed the campaign commencing on 28 September. The chairman subsequently brought this to my attention in detail on 6 October. I take this opportunity to thank the chairman of Irish Rail and the company for agreeing to my request to run the DART service as normal in the southern corridor in the three weeks leading up to the Christmas break.

During yesterday's launch  of the DMUs, the company informed me that it would consider using some of the new units on longer distance routes during down periods in the city. This is, however, an operational matter for Irish Rail.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	125	In light of the fact that the Department knew of the plans at least six weeks beforehand, will the Minister ask his officials the reason he was not informed of the company's decision? Will he direct Irish Rail to operate DMU units which are not in use on the commuter lines at weekends on the DART line in order that at least a basic level of service is available?As regards the proposed bus service, it will take 90 minutes, for example, for the 84 bus from Greystones to travel into the city centre. Will the Minister take steps to ensure the regular 84X service, which takes 50 minutes to come into town, is available at weekends to provide a substantial level of service for commuters? Why is the integrated ticketing system promised in 1994 not in place? It would ensure that commuters who cannot use the DART service would be able to use buses without having to buy new tickets.As regards the DART signalling programme, would it not be logical to carry this out in tandem with the current upgrading works, rather than closing down the lines again in 2005 to introduce the new system?

The Deputy's proposal on the use of DMUs relates to an operational matter. It appears to be a good idea and I will pass it on to the company to see if it will take it on board. It appears that it will be late 2004 or early 2005 before the technology to enable integrated ticketing to be introduced is fully rolled out.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	129	My Department has been assured by the Dublin Transportation Office and the Railway Procurement Agency that, under the current scheme, Luas, which has its own over-bridge and will travel on its own dedicated track, will have no negative implications for traffic on the Red Cow roundabout. Given the concerns which have been expressed about the potential for traffic congestion at the roundabout, my Department commissioned a technical report to  analyse the feasibility of providing a separation between the Luas and local road infrastructure. The consultants indicated that the cost would be in the region of €20 million to €30 million. The RPA has recently communicated to the Department its views on the proposals put forward in the report and has estimated that a realistic cost of constructing a grade separated solution and the consequential costs arising from interruption of services would be at least €50 million, with a minimum timescale of 2.5 years.The NRA today announced proposals which could achieve major improvements in the key traffic movements on the M50, including at the N7 Red Cow roundabout. The proposals would involve total expenditure of some hundreds of million euro. Subject to approval of the necessary environmental impact statement and motorway scheme by An Bord Pleanála, it should be possible to start construction of phase one of the M50 project in 2005. This would mean upgrading the N7 roundabout and the N4 interchange at Palmerstown, as well as construction of a third lane in the centre median for each carriageway between the two interchanges. The Department has been informed that other parties are also interested in providing these facilities on a public private partnership type basis. In finalising the design of the upgrade, the NRA will give further consideration to a number of issues, including the interface of the upgrade with Luas.

Today's plan is for a €300 million flyover, last week's plan was for a €700 million spaghetti junction and the week before the Minister planned to put Luas on stilts. Today the Minister has mentioned a fourth plan for a PPP proposal. Will the Minister definitively outline his intentions in respect of the Red Cow roundabout? Is he still looking at the plans? Has he made a decision? He indicated earlier that he supported today's plan. Which plan will be chosen? It seems that the Minister and the various agencies involved are making this up as they go along. Will the Minister give a definitive answer today with regard to his intentions for the Red Cow roundabout? Which plan will be implemented, what is the cost and what is the time scale involved?

There are some options. First, however, it depends on whether one accepts that the Red Cow roundabout is a problem. If one does not accept it is a problem, that is fine.

I have said many times that I regard the Red Cow roundabout as a problem. It carries 90,000 cars per day, it is a major intersection of the M50 and the main Cork road and the Luas is on top of it. That is a problem and I am sorry if that offends some people. I am looking at solutions. I am not an engineer but a number of solutions have been put forward. One is to elevate the track on its existing alignment. We arranged to have that option studied independently. The outside consultants said it would cost between €20 million and €30 million while the RPA, after looking at that study, said it would cost twice as much. Engineers differ—
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The RPA is good at doubling figures.

The NRA takes a medium-term view. It tells me that the roundabout needs a substantial upgrade. The €300 million figure quoted in the newspaper is not for the roundabout but relates to the complete upgrade of the M50 and the provision of additional lanes.One solution is to take the upgrade of the roundabout out of the broader M50 upgrade, bring it forward by a couple of years and, in conjunction with that, remove the tracks from the roadway through the roundabout, which is an engineering matter. That is another option as we go forward. I will study what I have received from the NRA. Like the Deputy, I saw the NRA announcement this morning in the newspapers, but have not received it officially. Apparently, it arose from a board meeting of the NRA yesterday in Limerick. When I receive the NRA's formal report, I will study the plan and make a quick decision.If the Deputy accepts that this matter needs to be sorted, there are two solutions. One is to authorise the elevation of the track and the other is to bring forward the general upgrade of the roundabout and incorporate the solution into that upgrade. I have no figure from the NRA for the upgrade but I estimate that it would cost up to €100 million.

However, it must also be recognised that these interests need to be balanced against the requirements of public transport users and the wider national interest in an efficient and effective public transport system.In this context and arising from a meeting I had with ICTU leaders in July, phased discussions on public transport regulatory reform involving officials of my Department and representatives of the CIE unions recommenced on 10 September 2003. Parallel discussions are also taking place with the managements of Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann. The initial phase of discussions focused on the principles of public transport policy, phase two on the regulatory framework and the final phase will focus on the detailed aspects of regulatory reform of public transport. Three meetings have taken place to date, most recently on 1 October, and further meetings are planned for the near future at dates to be agreed. The current discussions are primarily focused on regulatory reform. The detailed issues concerning conditions of employment, pensions and other technical matters, which are currently being examined by my Department, will also be the subject of discussions with the trade unions in due course.Discussions are progressing. It is my intention to proceed with the necessary legislation in 2004.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	168	According to the Minister, at the meetings everything appears to be discussed but what should be discussed, that is, a plan to deal with public transport in the city. Is the Minister aware that independent research carried out  recently compared Dublin as a trans-European benchmarking measure of performance to nine other European cities? It found that Dublin's transport services were better than the London services. Another survey, the EUROSTAT survey, found that Dublin was third in Europe whereas the London model was seventh and that Dublin was better than London in terms of overall satisfaction, safety, reliability, traffic supply and in many other areas. Why did the Minister wait until late August to send officials from his Department to London to study that model? What is the Minister's opinion of the London model?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	169	With regard to the London model, passenger numbers are at their highest level in London since 1969 and it has the highest level of bus kilometres operated since 1963. It is experiencing the fastest growth in the number of passengers since 1945 and 80% of its fleet is fully accessible. There have been significant cost reductions in the London model and the numbers using public transport are growing dramatically. That is the experience of the London model. We have also closely studied the Helsinki model. In that model passenger numbers are up by 10% and cost savings are at 29%. In Stockholm cost savings of 25% have been achieved in the 12 years since competition was introduced and passenger numbers have increased by 18%. There are many other examples of this model.Wherever competition in the form of franchising has been introduced, passenger numbers have increased. That is what public transport is about, getting people out of their motor cars and on to public transport. This is ultimately about passengers and nothing else.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	170	Has the Minister looked at the other surveys which have found the current transport system in Dublin to be way ahead of the London model? If the Minister is committed to his plans, why have they not been published, at least in draft form, so that they could be discussed with him and debated by CIE employees and public representatives? Why have they not been placed in the public domain thus far? In their absence, does the Minister expect to bring legislation before this House during this session to break up CIE?

As I stated in my reply of 24 June 2003 to Question No. 361 from the Deputy, any proposal which might lead to discriminatory treatment between routes operated within the European Union, including internal flights in Ireland, would run counter to EU competition law. The determination of the maximum levels of airport charges that may be levied by Aer Rianta is a matter for the Commission for Aviation Regulation, which acts on an independent statutory basis as provided for under the Aviation Regulation Act 2001.The manner in which Aer Rianta levies airport charges at the three State airports is a matter for the company, subject to compliance with the commission's determination. As the Deputy is aware, Aer Rianta has a statutory responsibility to operate on a fully commercial basis.Aer Rianta operates incentive schemes to promote the development of new routes at the three State airports. The new route incentive scheme for the current year at Shannon and Cork Airports offers carriers significant reductions by way of discounts on the standard airport charges. The scheme covers the first five years of operating a new route, offering a 100% discount in the first year – i.e. no airport charges are payable by the airline in the first year – an 80% discount in year two, a 60% discount in year three, a 40% discount in year four, and a 20% discount in year five. Thereafter, the standard Aer Rianta charges at Shannon Airport will apply. The corresponding scheme at Dublin Airport covers the first three  years of operation of a new route, with a 100% discount in the first year, a 60% discount in year two, and a 50 % discount in year three.The incentive scheme for new routes is subject to certain qualifying criteria and is operated by Aer Rianta in an open, transparent and non-discriminatory manner.

The first is from Shannon to Dublin. The fare is €62, of which the total taxes amount to €35.50, or half the price. On a single flight costing €31, the total tax—
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	179	It is not in order to quote. This is Question Time, and the Deputy appears to be giving information.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I wish to ask the Minister about the make-up of those taxes. I know the regulator is responsible for the airport security tax. Is the Government not responsible for the Irish passenger service charge, which makes up part of that price? The public service obligation, or PSO, is international, but there was a subsidy of €280 on a flight between Shannon and Knock.Does the Minister not think there is something wrong somewhere when a fare is almost the same price as the taxes on it? We have seen Aer Lingus going off domestic routes. In an effort to promote new domestic services, could the Minister support some kind of PSO offer for those routes?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I agree with the broad thrust of what the Deputy is trying to do, namely, bring about cheaper internal flights, particularly from Shannon to Dublin. I very much accept that. We will do so by tackling the problem on several fronts, including attracting new airlines. The Aer Lingus transatlantic flight provides some service. Aer Arann dropped its remaining services there at the end of 2002, and there are other services from time to time from such companies as SkyNet on its Dublin to Moscow route. It is not possible to discriminate between internal and external charges at airports. Wherever the plane comes from, the charges are based on landing rather than the aircraft's original point of departure.We are currently stuck with EU competition law. Neither I nor the Minister of State has considered PSO for Shannon. Hitherto there has been a commercial operation at Shannon, and where that is so, PSO would not be permitted by the European Union. I doubt if the PSO would be permitted in the case of Shannon. It is very much a commercial airport.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	182	It is very hard for a new airline to take up a domestic route when Aer Lingus transatlantic flights are taking on passengers in the morning. That is what happened in the past. Could the Minister envisage a situation where a company such as Aer Arann could be brought back into Shannon Airport in a similar manner to  what is currently happening in Cork so that it would have sole responsibility for domestic routes?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	183	That is a good thought, and there is no reason that it would not do it. The Deputy will be aware of my plans to establish a separate Shannon Airport authority. This morning the Government cleared the heads of the Bill, and in the next few days I will be announcing the membership of the interim Shannon authority, pending the enactment of the full legislation. It will be its job to get down to those kinds of issues immediately and see what deals it can do with Aer Arann or anyone else who might provide a service. My Department, the Minister of State and I will give it every support in doing so.

Bus Éireann notified my Department in March 2003 that it wished to revise its schedules on the Expressway service between Ballina and Dublin. Bus Éireann sought nine changes to that service, one of which related to a connecting bus and ferry service to the UK departing from Busáras in Dublin. The company also requested, for operational reasons, that my Department consider the proposed service changes in conjunction with proposals for a further 15 service changes to the Expressway between Sligo and Dublin, one of which related to an onward connecting bus and ferry service to the UK.Most notifications are cleared quickly by my Department, the exception being where there is a potential conflict with private bus operators. In this case, the following had to be taken into account when considering the Bus Éireann application: two prior applications for new licences from private operators; one prior application for a substantial amendment to an existing licence; and six existing licensed services.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I thank the Minister for his reply and the good news. The bottom line is that people have been waiting for eight months. Irish Ferries changed their times, and as a result people such as economic migrants returning home to Ireland from their well-deserved holidays had to wait for four hours. The Expressway bus would leave Ballina at 12.30 p.m. and arrive in Dublin at 4.15 p.m., but people would have to wait until 8.50 p.m. to get the connection to the boat. The bus  was there to do that, and had done so up to March. The sailing would be at 9.45 p.m. that night, meaning terrible hardship, especially for people from the west of Ireland.I very much welcome what the Minister had to say. However, I wonder why people had to wait so long for the change in bus times. I was at the Minister's office about the matter on 26 August 2003 and again last week. I greatly welcome what has happened now.Can the Minister see any way around this problem, such as a change in the interpretation of the legislation? I realise that other people such as private operators are involved. However, eight months is a long time to wait, even for those complications to be sorted out. How is it that a major operator such as Bus Éireann has to get the Minister's permission to change a timetable?

I acknowledge and admire the Deputy's persistence, which has helped to focus people in terms of having a decision made in time for announcement today. He identified a matter which is at the heart of the issue of bus regulation, namely, the fact that we are operating under legislation which has been in place since 1932. I propose that this legislation be abolished in 2004 and that new legislation, incorporating a regulatory scheme for the 21st century and representing an entirely new approach, be introduced. The 1932 Act is an anachronism and results in our being obliged to pore over every detail of applications of this type.

I welcome the fact that new legislation will be introduced because the 1932 legislation is out of date.On a slightly different topic – it does, however, also involve waiting – I wish to refer to a shortage of bus shelters. In Castlebar, buses do not stop outside the hospital and bus shelters are not provided in Foxford, Swinford, Charlestown, etc., which obliges people to wait in the rain. I am aware that Bus Éireann has a contracted service with providers, but the latter will not establish operations in an area where it is not profitable to do so as a result of a scarcity of advertising. Would the Minister consider providing Bus Éireann with funding in this regard or could a PSO be put in place in order that bus shelters might be provided? I do not believe Bus Éireann is being assisted by the fact that people are forced to endure the elements while waiting for public transport. The latter is a disincentive for people to use buses.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68, 84, 112, 149 and 157 together.A high quality and efficient public transport system is essential to sustaining the economic and social progress made in Ireland in recent years. To this end, the Government has in recent years increased State financial support for public transport services to historically high levels. However, as in many areas of the public sector, Exchequer investment alone is not sufficient to deliver the level and quality of public service which the current generation of Irish people expect and rightly demand.The regulatory framework for the bus market in Ireland dates back over 70 years to the Road Transport Act 1932. In the intervening period, the environment for the provision of public transport services and the demands of those using public transport have changed significantly. The regulatory model for public transport needs to reflect a more sophisticated and effective approach which takes full account of the economic and social changes of the past decade and provides a better framework for the years ahead. We must seek greater accountability and customer responsiveness in our public services.It was in this context that I set out my policy objectives for public transport reform in my Nov ember 2002 statement to the Public Transport Partnership Forum and to the Oireachtas Committee on Transport in June 2003. These detailed proposals can be summarised as follows: as Minister, I will continue to set the overall regulatory policy and approve the broad public transport investment strategy; within that regulatory and investment framework, an independent body will be established to procure public transport services, regulate public transport and allocate current and capital funding for specific purposes from an overall allocation provided by the Exchequer; franchising will be the primary means of procuring bus services in the greater Dublin area; and the independent body will also regulate public transport fares and set and enforce quality standards for public transport service.The consumer interest is an overriding concern underpinning my approach to public transport reform. At present, public transport services are largely provided on a monopoly basis. Under the proposals I have outlined, bus services in Dublin will be procured through tendering, with an independent body exercising choice on behalf of the customer and taxpayer. If the chosen operator fails to deliver a satisfactory service, it can be replaced. This is not an option which is available under the current monopoly arrangements.As I indicated in my reply to Priority Question No. 65, discussions on public transport regulatory reform are currently taking place with the CIE trade unions and management. I have also stated my intention to give legislative effect to the reforms during 2004.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	192	In regard to the matter raised earlier by Deputy Cowley, everyone agrees that a nine month wait for a decision under the current legislation is totally unacceptable. When does the Minister intend to publish the new legislation? Will it be early or late in 2004? Is he still of the opinion that 25% of the existing Dublin Bus market will be opened up to private bus operators? In other words, is it not correct that the additional buses and services urgently required in the city of Dublin will not be provided? Will the Minister confirm that not one cent of additional funding will be provided to the new regulatory authority to allow it to ensure that additional services will be provided?The Minister referred earlier to replacing the 1932 Act with legislation that would include a regulatory scheme for the 21st century. Does he believe that the establishment of five separate agencies to control the new bus markets represents a 21st century approach?

The Department of Transport is already in place and a new regulatory authority could be put in place or that job could be allocated to an existing organisation. It is possible that none of the five authorities to which the Deputy refers would be officially established by me.I am determined that the new legislation will be put in place in 2004. I would like to be more specific in that regard, but the latter is not possible at this stage. As soon as I am in a position to provide more specific information, I will do so.In reply to the Deputy's question about opening up the existing market, I am still extremely determined in that regard. We need to open up the existing market and I have set a 25% target in that regard, but we also need to look at the broader market. In this regard, we must consider the greater Dublin area and the outlying areas and the new services and expansions of existing services that are required there. We are also involved in discussions with the trade unions about a broader approach and the total number of services the greater Dublin area and the rest of the country will require.With regard to funding being made available to the new regulatory authority for the procurement of services, subsidies will continue to be required in the area of public transport. As already stated, these will be the subject of a bidding process.

If there is rapid expansion in an area of Dublin and new services, which cannot be procured on a commercial basis, are required and the State decides to provide them, subsidies will be made available. There will continue to be subsidies for public transport, where they are needed and as demand requires.

One of the justifications he used for deregulating the Dublin bus market is that he wants to provide choice for consumers. Will he explain how franchising out a route on which services are currently provided by Dublin Bus to a private operator will provide choice? There will be no choice on the routes. Will the Minister explain what he means in this regard?Everyone agrees that there is a need for a substantial increase in the provision of public transport services in the greater Dublin area. Given that this is the case, why is the Minister franchising out 25% of the existing routes? Surely it would make sense to allow Dublin Bus to continue to provide the services it is already doing well to provide in light of the low level of subvention. Surely it would make better sense to franchise out new routes. There is no doubt that many new orbital routes are required. Why is the Minister restricting the franchise system to existing routes? Has he considered the possibility of franchising out new routes?With regard to bus regulation, the Minister often cites the example of Copenhagen as the way he wishes to proceed. Is he aware that the cost of regulation of the bus market in Copenhagen is almost equal to the total subvention provided to Dublin Bus at present? What does he estimate will be the cost of the regulatory authority for Dublin?

If the yellow bus company wins a parcel of routes through tendering to a regulator, and there is X number of public complaints – this will be laid down in the contract – I presume that company would not be re-awarded the franchise when it comes up for renewal. It will go to somebody else.

After we enter franchising, I can see no reason the change of franchises on a regular basis would not become normal practice. As things stand, if a set of routes does not measure up, the taxpayer or customer has no say. If that route were franchised and won by a company that did not perform adequately, the regulatory auth ority would remove that franchise and give it to another company. That provides an awful lot more choice than we currently have where a total monopoly exists.

Does the Minister not agree that it would be farcical to go ahead with bus competition without having some form of integrated ticketing system?While I have no difficulty in principle with what the Minister is talking about, I have difficulty with the practicalities of it. Sadly, I believe the Minister's priority is 25% of existing services. For someone using the No. 10 bus route, it will be blue Brennan buses instead of the current No. 10 bus. Does the Minister not agree that we need additional capacity within the Dublin market and the priority should be the increase of this capacity by introducing private operators to provide it? That is what the number one priority should be.

Therefore, we will have more buses on the streets and more services for passengers. It is important to point out that Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus have substantially increased fleets – they have got hundreds of extra buses in recent years. They are doing a good job running those and I am committed to quality bus corridors and doubling the number of bus lanes in the city and county in the next year. I have provided funds to the DTO to get on with that. There is no point in having extra buses if they cannot move through the traffic.

The legislation will lay down the regulatory regime.The Deputy is right about integrated ticketing – I would prefer to have it fully in place. I attended a presentation on this recently. While it is becoming an enormously high-tech operation, it is exciting. When it is finally rolled out—

It has already entered into agreement with one bus company and is talking to CIE about the issue.

Perhaps the Minister will indicate his intentions on meeting his commitments to provide additional buses for Dublin Bus under the NDP.Has the Minister considered the introduction of service level agreements with Dublin Bus? Nobody is suggesting it should be given a blank cheque. Excellent public bus services are provided in many other cities on the basis of service level agreement negotiated with the transport authority. Why can the Minister's Department not do this?

There are huge advantages in running a bus network when the company can switch buses from one route to another. To do this, routes would have to be near the same garage. Does the carving of 25% of the market not have to be one slice of the pie?

Could that be rolled out? Is it the Minister's plan to leave the existing buses with Dublin Bus and introduce new buses?

The meeting on 15 July 2003 involved an ICTU delegation and the Taoiseach, a meeting which I also attended.Following the most recent of these meetings, the General Secretary of the ICTU and I are in correspondence on a number of points which had been raised by the unions in Aer Rianta. I pointed out that I regard the unions as key stakeholders in the context of the various consultations already under way in my Department with other relevant parties on the implementation of the Government decision. I have indicated to the unions that I remain available to meet with them again as required.While I appreciate that there are some understandable concerns among the staff at the airports, I have made clear to their union representatives that there will not be any diminution in the tenure or the terms and conditions of employment of Aer Rianta workers arising from this decision. I have stated this publicly on several occasions and there should be no misunderstanding of my position on this important issue. I propose to reflect this position in the amending legislation which is currently under preparation to give effect to the Government decision.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	288	On 15 August 1998 one of the worst atrocities in Irish history occurred in Omagh, when 31 innocent people were bombed and murdered by the Real IRA. On 5 November last year, in replying to questions in the House, the Taoiseach stated clearly that there was no contact between any member of the Government and the Real IRA and that there had been no initiative for contact brought about by his then special adviser, Dr. Martin Mansergh, who is now a Senator.This is contradicted by a claim in a book to be published which states that a meeting took place between the Taoiseach's special adviser on Northern Ireland, Dr. Mansergh, and the alleged leader of the Real IRA and alleged perpetrator of the Omagh bombing, Mr. Michael McKevitt.What concerns me is not the integrity of Dr. Mansergh, the Taoiseach or Fr. Alex Reid regarding the matters they were dealing with in relation to Northern Ireland. What concerns me is that the Taoiseach, in answering questions here as head of Government, chose not to confirm to the House whether or not a meeting took place between his special adviser, presumably with his imprimatur, and the leader of the Real IRA. I do not want to get into the business of saying, in the words of a newspaper article, that the Taoiseach lied to the House or that he misled the House. I would like the Taoiseach to have the opportunity to set the record straight, if it needs to be set  straight, and to let us know whether or not a meeting took place between his special adviser and the leader of the Real IRA; if it did take place, whether it was with his imprimatur; and why, in essence, the Taoiseach did not see fit to inform the House of that fact when he answered questions on 5 November last.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I thank Deputy Kenny for the way he has framed this and the opportunity he has given me to deal with this matter.I made clear in a Dáil statement of 5 November last, and also in a more extensive statement that I distributed the same day on this issue, that my special adviser at the time, Dr. Mansergh, did have contact with the 32 County Sovereignty Movement in 1998 some weeks before the Omagh atrocity with a view to persuading the Real IRA to cease their activities after the overwhelming ratification of the Good Friday Agreement by the people of Ireland. I also said that following the Omagh atrocity, Fr. Alex Reid was in discussions with that organisation with a view to bringing about the ceasefire on its part, which was eventually announced in early September 1998. I said that in this period Fr. Reid maintained contact with Dr. Mansergh on the issue.Following the announcement of the ceasefire in September 1998, the Government strongly communicated the message that the Real IRA should not only maintain its ceasefire but should disband and cease to exist by the end of the year. That message would also have been communicated and reinforced directly by Dr. Mansergh in a follow-up meeting during Christmas week in 1998 at the request of the movement in response to his earlier contact at a time when the Real IRA ceasefire had been in existence for three months. Regrettably, the Real IRA did not heed this message and subsequently resumed its activities. It should also be made clear, as Deputy Kenny said, that everything Dr. Mansergh and Fr. Reid did during this period was designed to bring about a Real IRA ceasefire and a definitive end to its activities.I accept Deputy Kenny's comment that the position is not clear from the record. I did not say that Dr. Mansergh met Mr. McKevitt during Christmas 1998. Deputy Kenny has obviously read the record. I am sure he will accept that I was talking at that stage about a deal that was meant to have been done prior to the ceasefire in which Dr. Mansergh and Fr. Reid were involved. I did mention the other events, but I accept that I did not go into all of the activities.I want to repeat what I said in the Dáil last November. I said no deal was done by the Government either directly or indirectly with the Real IRA in return for a ceasefire or in the context of seeking its disbandment at the end of 1998. At all times it would have been made clear, as it was in my public statement in response to the ceasefire, that the law would take its course regarding the atrocities for which the Real IRA was responsible, and the sustained and successful  action of the authorities here against the Real IRA provides ample evidence of that. I confirm that while I was talking at that time last year about what happened in the events leading up to the ceasefire in September 1998, I referred to some of the activities, but I accept that I did not refer to this one.Dr. Mansergh put a report of that meeting into the records of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of the Taoiseach. In no way was Dr. Mansergh acting in a secret way. I accept it would have been better if I had mentioned that at the time, but I do so now. I reiterate that it was done with my imprimatur and the reason it was done during Christmas week was that at that stage the organisation had been on ceasefire for three months. We felt it was worth trying to convince it not only to stay on ceasefire, which was not an issue at that time, but to disband.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I am glad the Taoiseach has taken the opportunity to clarify the information he gave to the Dáil on 5 November last. This is one of the central issues to which he referred in Killarney last weekend when he spoke about commitment, responsibility and leadership. I am not impugning the integrity of Dr. Mansergh, but I would have thought this would have been relevant information because it sends out a signal to the families of the victims of the worst bombing atrocity in Irish history, that at a time when they were pursuing their course of justice, without any great help from either Government, the special adviser to the Taoiseach on Northern Ireland, had a face to face meeting with the alleged leader of the Real IRA and the alleged perpetrator of this bombing.With respect to the Taoiseach and his office, it seems that the lack of information and clarity from some of the replies given by him as head of Government diminishes the authority of his office. Deputy Rabbitte has been pursuing questions on an another matter. We get a formula of words which lead to a public perception that the full truth is not being told. I would like the Taoiseach to repeat that his special adviser at the time, Dr. Mansergh, met with Mr. McKevitt and that he regrets not putting that on the record. I hope this will set a new standard for full and comprehensive answers and truth in line with the standards set last weekend for commitment, responsibility and leadership.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I do not want to take any great issue with this. I could give interesting insights if I wanted about special advisers meeting people on ceasefires and not on ceasefires, but that is not my form in dealing with Northern Ireland. I do not think we or Deputy Kenny should go down that road.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	294	Deputy Kenny asked me about two particular issues last year. One issue concerned whether a deal had been done prior to the Real IRA going on ceasefire. The question, in response to which I gave a full answer, was raised over a two week period. I was also asked about issues relating to cars and vehicles in response to which I also gave a full statement. I also circulated a comprehensive statement. I did not read out the full statement in the House because I had only two minutes to reply, but that statement is also in the public domain.I accept that I did not go into the period of the ceasefire. At that stage, I was dealing with one set of issues. It would have been better if I had addressed the matter, but there was no question of trying to cover up the official note, which was on the records of the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As I stated at the end of that note – I think I also said this in the House – lest there be any confusion, there is contact between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about prisoners and other matters with the Real IRA, and that continues on prisoners' issues, although not with my advisers.There is ongoing contact with other groups, both loyalist and republican. That contact started in 1998 and has continued through the lifetime of successive Governments.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	295	One area on which the Taoiseach has not been prepared to correct the record relates to the questions that surround the negotiation of the indemnity deed with the religious congregations. Rather than answering questions about why he was prepared to put the taxpayer at risk for an unlimited liability and cap the liability of the religious congregations, he has said he was the first Taoiseach to make an apology and the State was prepared to pay the Bill irrespective of whether the religious ever contributed a penny. The Taoiseach refuses to answer questions about why the Attorney General and his staff were excluded at a critical time. He also refuses to say why the terms of the indemnity were never debated in this House. He further refuses to say why normal Cabinet procedures were not followed. He refuses to say why records were not kept of the critical meetings. In all of these instances, he retreats behind the shelter of saying that he was prepared, in the name of the State, to foot the entire bill for the cost of redress for survivors.In that event, how does the Taoiseach reconcile his generosity with the decision of the Department of Health and Children to pull the plug on the One in Four organisation? How can the same Government that is so generous-minded and open-handed with taxpayers' money have caused redundancy notices to be issued to the staff of  One in Four? How can the Taoiseach reconcile that when his most senior adviser was involved in the setting up of that organisation in Ireland, knew it was necessary, knew that a therapeutic dimension was always at its core and that – because it was reported to him – it was relayed to the principal in that organisation that if he did not behave and not criticise the Government during the collapse of the Laffoy commission by the Government, he was in danger of biting the hand that fed him? What action did the Taoiseach take on that? How does he reconcile the collapse of that organisation with his stated good intentions to fund the entire cost of this neglect by the Catholic Church and State for generations?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Deputy Rabbitte continues to suggest that the issues relating to the religious congregations were not properly dealt with by Government. They came properly before Government. There were many meetings. Comments have been made several times about the meetings which the Attorney General did not attend. I outlined those circumstances, noting that the Minister of the day and the Secretary General of the Department were at those meetings. I noted that the issue came before Government in the draft deal in January 2002 and that it was negotiated over the period and finalised in the summer of 2002. I have given the references and dates on previous occasions and it should not be necessary to go through them all the time.As regards the One in Four group, since May 2002 the Department of Health and Children has provided funding to all the relevant organisations. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has stated that there should be counselling arrangements and he assisted from the outset in the establishment of those arrangements.The One in Four organisation was provided with funding of €633,000. Some €208,000 of this was made available to its UK-based operation to deal with calls related to clerical abuse. This year, €425,000 was granted to One in Four in Ireland. The money was paid over before the end of the summer. Some €302,000 of this grant relates to staff salaries, pensions, expenses and training, while the remainder relates to the costs of premises and volunteers. This level of funding was agreed at a meeting on 25 March this year.As regards counselling costs, information was sought from One in Four regarding the service it intended to provide. The organisation agreed to forward this information but it was never received by the Department of Health and Children. There was never any agreement in place to fund counselling provided by One in Four. It was the subject of negotiations which dated from the meeting of 25 March.The Department of Health and Children provides counselling for all adults who suffered abuse through the national counselling service. It also provides funding for private counselling for those resident in institutions who do not want to  use the State services. I provided those figures in this House recently. Mr. O'Gorman contacted, and had a number of meetings on different issues with, my programme manager. They made contact on 15 September. Deputy Kenny raised this issue earlier. Mr. O'Gorman was critical of the officials of the Department of Health and Children. My programme manager listened to his complaints and discussed the matter with the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. A meeting was arranged for later this week, as I understand it. That is the position with One in Four. This issue was one aspect of the business of One in Four. Its other services had been funded for the year. The only issue in dispute related to its counselling service.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	297	The Taoiseach again recites the details which differ each time one raises the questions. One merely has to read the record of the House.How can the Taoiseach reconcile what he has said in the past with pulling the plug on the One in Four organisation? There was a detailed meeting with the officials on 25 March, the proceedings of which were furnished to the Department of Health and Children by Mr. Colm O'Gorman, and copied to the Taoiseach's Department on 27 March. There was never any issue taken with any line in that record of that meeting. When the Taoiseach then gets himself into trouble with collapsing the Laffoy commission, and when Colm O'Gorman makes public remarks, it is relayed to Mr. O'Gorman that he had better keep quiet – or else. He is now in a situation where he has had to put €73,000 of the money awarded to him into the organisation to keep it alive.The Taoiseach will recall that one of the central recommendations of the Finlay report was that an independent counselling service was necessary. That is what is now being collapsed. In addition, the same Minister is terminating contracts of psychotherapists in the State service whose contracts are now running out. This is the Government that was so open-handed through Deputy Michael Woods, which is now undermining both the State service, through the national counselling service, and the One in Four organisation. This is the commitment of the State to dealing with this problem, with the Taoiseach boasting so much about his apology.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	298	The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has been stating to me again what has been stated outside the House. The Minister, his Department and the officials involved reject all of the allegations made about them regarding this matter. They have put €17 million into the national counselling service. At the meeting on 25 March the level of funding was agreed for all of One in Four's services except its counselling service.I repeat what the Department has told me. As regards counselling costs, information about the  service it intended to provide was sought from One in Four. The organisation agreed to forward this information but it was never received by the Department. There was never any agreement in place to fund that counselling service and it remained subject to negotiation. That is the factual position. The national counselling service is a very good one. To date, €17 million has been spent on it.

It has been funded and is continuing. Those who do not want to use it have access to private services. In cases where people had conscientious objections to using that service because of the trauma they have been through the State provided private counselling services. The meeting between Mr. O'Gorman and the Department's officials has been arranged and he can pursue the issues. There is a difference in what has been presented as facts. I can only tell Deputy Rabbitte that all of the people concerned advise me that what has been stated is factually incorrect.

What was the purpose of that meeting, when did it take place and who was present? The Taoiseach stated, and again made reference to it this afternoon, that in the course of that meeting he discussed the Corrib gas project. Was that the reason for the meeting? Does the Taoiseach believe that, as a Head of Government, it is appropriate for him to discuss with the president of Shell a proposition that is still going through the planning process? Would he agree that it is inappropriate for him to discuss a planning application that has yet to be determined at another level within this jurisdiction? Would he accept that it is even more inappropriate for him to meet the president of Shell and discuss proposed legislation which does not even appear as yet in the programme of proposed legislation that the Government issued to this Chamber following the summer recess? This legislation has not been discussed either in this House or by any Oireachtas committee.The Taoiseach must acknowledge that it is strange that the legislation referred to by him on 1 October as the critical infrastructure Bill, and again by Deputy Cullen during his visit to Killarney last week as the national infrastructure Bill, comes in the aftermath of his meeting with the president of Shell. Will the Taoiseach confirm that in the course of that meeting, the president  indicated that he was loath to proceed with the project until he had the necessary assurances regarding the planning permission issue? Would the Taoiseach agree that this is yet a further prime example of privileged access to the corridors of power for some regarding planning matters?

The president of Shell had to make a decision on behalf of the European board. Accompanied by officials from the Irish and European operations he wanted to know the Government's view of the Corrib project before making a decision on the allocation of further finance. He asked if we were still interested in Shell investing further money in this country. I confirmed that inward investment was welcome. He then asked me, as the national infrastructure Bill had been in the public domain for several weeks, if that Bill would be in place prior to the company's re-application. I explained to him, as I have already outlined to the House on two occasions in reply to Deputy Kenny, that it was unlikely the new Bill would be in place before next summer when it was hoped the company could commence work. I recommended it stay with the normal planning structure. He informed me it would take that information into account. The project was, it believed, a viable and  good one but it would have to reconsider the level of investment required. It had other projects in hand at various locations around the world and the matter would go before the European board of Shell for a decision.I totally reject Deputy Ó Caoláin's view that my meeting international figures of any company is in any way wrong. It has always been our practice to do so. It is entirely appropriate for the Taoiseach or Ministers of the day to meet officials of such companies at properly documented meetings.

Does the decision by An Bord Pleanála on the gas terminal in west Mayo not now prove to have been the correct one given the serious events at Pullathomas, County Mayo, and verification of the disastrous proposals on the stacking of peat where the safest methods for dealing with various difficulties that would arise in terms of the development were clearly not signalled? Is what the Taoiseach is now proposing a fast-tracking of major projects which will deny interested communities and concerned sectors of society the opportunity to properly utilise the planning process?While we all wish to see faster processing of planning applications, we cannot do so by sacrificing the importance of the system in ensuring the highest standards of safety and health considerations irrespective of the scale of the proposal.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The planning decision on the Corrib field has already been made. Shell and all other companies which I have met are well aware of the planning process in this country. They know it is independent and that they must go through the various stages involved. Companies like Shell which make large scale investments involving millions of euro need to know the timescale involved in the process as the period in offshore work is very limited. They asked questions about the new Bill and current planning laws. They are aware of the process and were not interested in asking me to make representations on their behalf. The process has been a costly one for them. They are not interested in influencing anybody in that regard. For anyone to suggest  they were seeking assistance from Government is totally incorrect. Shell has already invested several hundreds of millions of euro here. Its application has been rejected and it must now start again or not bother to go ahead with the project. It is entirely appropriate for me to meet such companies to answer their questions, and I hope that will continue to be the position.

Chrissy Heffernan, Karen Heffernan and Brid Smith have joined 12 others in prison while another anti-bin tax protester was injured by a truck this morning. This escalating situation demands not only that the Government reconsider its policy but that the Dáil should have the opportunity to debate the need for the Minister to direct Dublin City Council officials to withdraw their order for the non-collection of bins from non-compliant households and to begin discussions with councils, trade unions and community representatives to prevent further escalation of this crisis.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter, namely, the need to clarify and update the Government's position on genetically modified organisms in agriculture in light of the tests in the United Kingdom which show that contamination of conventional and organic crops can occur within a 16 mile radius of a GM trial site; that it can take at least 16 years before non-GM crops can be grown and sold once a GM crop has been planted and that this debate take place before ratification of international treaties on this matter so that Ireland can develop as a GMO-free food producer.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Some 17 requests have been made to adjourn the Dáil under Standing Order 31, none of which has been successful. Such requests are rarely successful. It is farcical that Deputies from all sides of the House must resort to these tactics to get mention of individual projects or matters of concern. Will the Taoiseach indicate if Government time will be made available to hold a serious debate on effective changes to the way business is conducted in this House, by the committees and throughout the Oireachtas? There is a crying need for the Oireachtas to respond to  the concern expressed by the public on the way we conduct business.At his party's Ard-Fheis in Killarney last weekend, the Taoiseach referred to the acquisition and distribution of further State lands for housing. Will he indicate if this will require legislation or if it is possible within existing structures to transfer State lands to local authorities or whatever for the provision of housing, which is urgently required?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The Whips have commenced discussions on the reform programme referred to by the Deputy. I understand it is to be discussed again tomorrow. With regard to the second issue raised by the Deputy, much depends on the organisations. State lands have already been transferred. Legislation is not required, but it may be required in some areas connected with semi-State bodies. However, Departments, such as the Department of Defence, are able to proceed without legislation.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	344	Will the Taoiseach indicate when it is proposed to sign the regulations banning smoking in the workplace and when provision will be made to debate the issue in the House after the worrying betrayal of loyal publicans who have been so helpful to his party? They appear to have been reneged on in Killarney.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Will the Taoiseach indicate if further information is available regarding the publication date of the proposed infrastructure Bill? Will the legislation address corruption relating to rezoning decisions that have caused many of the problems occupying the Taoiseach? Will a more comprehensive infrastructure Bill be introduced to deal with the root causes of the problems?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18475	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	352	Over the weekend, rather embarrassingly, a Minister of State announced the introduction of a regulation that was in place.  I refer to promised secondary legislation to appoint a children's ombudsman. Primary legislation was passed in April 2002. Fianna Fáil's election manifesto stated this office would be fully operational during 2002. As the end of 2003 approaches—

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18475	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	354	It appears the Government will go to the last legal moment on this.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	355	We cannot have a debate on the legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18475	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	356	This is not a trivial matter.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	357	Of course it is not. That is why it is the subject of a parliamentary question to the Minister responsible.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18475	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	358	We have spent a great deal of time discussing the wrongs of the past. A greater effort should be made to put in place a children's ombudsman to deal with issues for the future.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	359	It took approximately five years for the Bill to be passed and we know where the blame for that lies. The office must be set up within two years under the legislation. If the Deputy wants further details, he should table a parliamentary question.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18475	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	360	Will I receive a communication as to when the office will be established?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	361	No, it has to be set up within two years of the passage of the legislation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18475	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	362	Fianna Fáil stated that would happen in 2002.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	363	If the Deputy tables a parliamentary question, he will find out details about the position of the office.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18475	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	364	It must not be a high priority.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I refer to two related Bills. In light of another fatality at a building site in Limerick last week, the introduction of the safety, health and welfare at work Bill is urgent and necessary. The Law Reform Commission's report published yesterday recommended the introduction of legislation to make corporate manslaughter an offence. Will such legislation be introduced?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	366	The second matter is under examination but it is too early to say what the legal situation will be. The heads of the safety, health and welfare at work Bill have been approved and the legislation should be available early in the new year.

Will the Taoiseach provide time this week for Members to have the opportunity to discuss the report fully rather than wait until a future week when the report will have been thrashed out in the media and every other forum throughout the jurisdiction?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The Deputy has made his point.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I ask the Taoiseach to respond on this important matter. Many Bills have been deferred pending the publication of the reports into the health services. A debate on the Hanly report in the House is needed and Members should not have to read about it in newspapers. How soon can the debate take place? Publication of legislation that will make statutory provision for entitlement to health and personal social services was promised in 2002 and the recommendations in the Hanly report will have relevance to people's statutory rights.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	373	We cannot have a debate on it. The Deputy should ask a question appropriate to the Order of Business
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	374	What happened to the legislation? I am not surprised the Taoiseach looks puzzled. The Bill was "to provide for clear statutory provision on entitlement to health and personal social services in the health service".
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	375	Will the Taoiseach ensure, at the very least, that the relevant spokespersons are invited to the launch of the report if there will not be a debate in the House?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I call Deputy Olivia Mitchell. I apologise to the Deputy as I should have called her earlier.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I am so quiet the Ceann Comhairle would hardly notice me. One of the crises galloping towards the Government in regard to the health service is the implementation of the European working time directive for junior doctors in hospitals. Plans to implement it before next August have been left perilously late, endangering both the continuity and quality of the health service. When will the health and  social care professionals regulatory Bill be published? The Hanly report should be discussed in the House and not dismissed, as it was by the Taoiseach on radio last week, before the rest of us know what is in it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	378	The health and social care professionals regulatory Bill will be published this session. The Hanly report will be published tomorrow and I am sure when Members have had an opportunity to read it, we can have a debate. It would be a good idea if people read it first. The scheduling of the debate should be taken up with the Whips.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The Deputy cannot jump up and down in his seat without being called by the Chair. He asked three supplementary questions on this during Taoiseach's questions, which is without precedent in the House.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I note Deputy Healy-Rae is not in the House, Sir. To lose one Kerryman to Mountjoy Prison is serious but to lose two would be a tragedy. Could I ask the Taoiseach, on mature reflection, why the smoking regulations will not be ready until November, given that they were due to be published this week? Are the terms still being negotiated?
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	392	They are on the web.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I did not know they were to be available this week but they must be legally drafted first. I presume Deputy Rabbitte would not be against their being drafted. As soon as they are drafted, they will be published.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	395	My support has always been consistent.

The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government laid an order before the House on 3 July that can be annulled within 21 sitting days. Is it correct that the House only has the opportunity to annul the order before 20 November? I am concerned, given the Taoiseach's remarks regarding swans last week, that medieval castles could be next. I hope the House will have an opportunity to debate such a move if the Minister for the protection of heritage decides that a motorway should plough through the heart of a medieval castle.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	404	Swans were never better off. They were delighted and breeding this year was the best ever, according to experts.

The swans would not get a look in. They were under more threat as a result of rezoning than anything else.

I look forward to Deputies' contributions. This short Bill is important and extremely urgent. It is specifically focused in so far as it deals exclusively with one important aspect of oil pollution – civil liability and compensation – as the title of the Bill indicates.This Bill amends existing legislation to give effect to two internationally agreed instruments which, taken together, increase almost sixfold the limits of compensation payable to victims of pollution resulting from spills of persistent oil from tankers. The two instruments can be attributed to the reassessment at EU and international levels of many aspects of the regulatory arrangements regarding maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment, following the Erika disaster off the coast of France in December 1999. An examination of the arrangements which apply at international level regarding liability and compensation in respect of pollution caused by oil tankers was undertaken in this context.Compensation is payable in accordance with the 1992 international convention on civil liability for oil pollution damage, known as the liability convention, and the 1992 international convention on the establishment of an international fund for compensation for oil pollution damage, known as the fund convention. The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts of 1988 and 1998 give effect to these conventions. The liability convention governs the liability of ship owners for oil pollution damage. The convention lays down the principle of strict liability for ship owners and creates a system of compulsory liability insurance. The ship owner is normally entitled to limit his or her liability to an amount which is linked to the tonnage of his or her ship. The fund convention is supplementary to the liability convention.The main function of the international oil pollution compensation fund, the IOPCF, is to provide supplementary compensation for damage  under the liability convention. The compensation payable by the IOPCF for any one incident is limited to 135 million special drawing rights, or SDRs, which equates to about €180 million. This includes the sum paid by the ship owner or his or her insurer under the liability convention. A claims manual has been published by the IOPCF to assist parties who have been affected by an incident in presenting claims. The first of the two internationally agreed instruments relates to the compensation levels which apply under the 1992 conventions.While the examination has been under way at the IOPCF since the establishment of a working group in April 2000, it was considered that action needed to be taken in relation to compensation levels without awaiting the completion of the working group's business. The total amount of compensation – 135 million SDRs – fixed in the 1992 fund convention was considered unacceptably low. It was decided to increase the compensation levels by about 50% to a total of 203 million SDRs. The increases which are to apply internationally are to take effect on 1 November 2003. The Bill gives effect to these measures and accordingly needs to be enacted by that date.While the IOPCF working group is continuing its examination, its deliberations have led to the adoption of a protocol to the fund convention in May 2003 at the International Maritime Organisation. The protocol is the second of the two instruments to which I referred earlier. It provides for the establishment of a supplementary compensation fund, which will further increase the amount of compensation payable to victims to 750 million SDRs, or approximately €1 billion. The supplementary fund was initially proposed by the European Commission as an EU measure. Member states preferred to pursue the matter in an international context, however, and adoption of the protocol with considerable support from EU states followed. Member states have been urged to introduce legislation to give effect to the protocol at the earliest opportunity, before the end of the year if possible. Annual contributions to the IOPCF are levied by the fund administration on oil importers in member states that have imported by sea more than 150,000 tonnes of oil in the previous calendar year.Three importers in the State are liable for contributions to the fund: the ESB, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation and Aughinish Alumina. The size of annual contributions varies according to the amount of oil eligible for levy and the number and size of claims settled in any one year. Claims arising from a costly incident can push up the contribution required in a given year. The total contribution made by the Irish importers in 2002 was about €200,000. While it is not possible to estimate accurately the effects of the revised limits, it is not anticipated that the current contribution levels will be significantly affected.The provision of adequate compensation for victims of oil pollution from tankers must be viewed as part of a wider framework involving  the prevention of pollution and the response to incidents. I had hoped to introduce the provisions of this Bill as part of the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003, a wide ranging Bill relating to aspects of the marine environment which was published on 3 July 2003 and referred to the Seanad. The provisions relating to the increased limits have, however, been fast-tracked and published separately in view of the approaching deadline of 1 November.The Bill as published was amended by the Seanad. It now includes amendments to the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts 1988 to 1998 which relate to the supplementary fund protocol. Drafting work had commenced in January 2003 prior to the adoption of the protocol at international level. Provisions relating to the protocol were not, therefore, included in the Bill as published. As both sets of provisions involve amendments to the same legislation, it was considered more efficient and rational to include both elements in the same Bill.The Bill before us updates our legislation regarding civil liability arising out of pollution from oil tankers. The Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2003 updates our legislation on the protection of the marine environment by giving effect in our law to several internationally agreed instruments. These include: the Protocol to the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation; the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage; the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems for Ships 2001; and Annexe Vl to the MARPOL Convention – the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, done at London on 2 November 1973, as amended by the protocol done at London on 17 February 1978, MARPOL 73/78. I look forward to discussing the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill with Deputies in due course.I also mention the Sea Pollution (Hazardous and Noxious Substances) (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill 2000, which is currently before the House. This Bill gives effect in Irish law to the International Convention on Liability and Compensation for Damage in connection with the carriage of Hazardous and Noxious Substances by Sea 1996, HNS convention. The Bill complements the arrangements regarding civil liability and compensation for oil pollution which are the subject of the Bill before us.EU member states, including Ireland, have been to the fore in recent years in advocating improvements at international level in safety standards for ships and the protection of the marine environment. Ireland was one of a number of EU member states which co-sponsored the request to the International Maritime Organisation leading to the increased limits which are the subject of the Bill. EU member states were also  prominent in advocating and supporting the adoption of the supplementary fund protocol.Following the Erika incident, measures have been introduced or agreed on the regulation of ship classification societies; the accelerated phasing out of single hull oil tankers; the strengthening of port state control measures; and ship reporting arrangements. The European Maritime Safety Agency was established by regulation in August 2002 for the purpose of ensuring a high, uniform and effective level of maritime safety and prevention of pollution from ships within the EU. The agency is to enable the Commission to offer the full range of professional services needed to discharge its duties in this connection. All member states are represented on the board of the agency.The reassessment process undertaken in the wake of the Erika incident was given added impetus in November 2002 when the Bahamas registered tanker Prestige, laden with 77,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil, broke in two off the coast of Galicia, spilling an unknown but substantial quantity of its cargo. EU Ministers committed themselves to building on the progress made in the previous few years. To that end, a number of new measures were introduced.The EU Council of Ministers and the Parliament have adopted a proposal by the Commission to further accelerate the phasing out of single hull tankers and to ban the carriage of heavy grades of fuel oil in single hull tankers. EU member states have requested the IMO to introduce similar arrangements to be applied internationally.The Commission recently published a proposal to amend the regulations to provide the agency with the necessary legal competence on the pollution response and to specify its role in maritime security and the training of seafarers. This proposal is being examined at official working group level by the member states. A proposal by the Commission concerning sanctions for offences involving pollution of the marine environment is at present under consideration at EU official working group level.Belgium, France, Ireland, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom decided earlier this year to present the IMO with a joint request to designate certain maritime areas as particularly sensitive sea areas to strengthen its protection of particularly vulnerable areas. The limit of the PSSA proposed coincides with the 15th meridian, the Porcupine Bank, and includes part of the special waters of the north west Europe zone, as defined in the MARPOL Convention; the English Channel and coastal waters; and, certain parts of pollution response areas and exclusive economic zones along Spanish, French and Portuguese coasts. The aim of the exercise is to protect our marine environment and coastline from oil spills by discouraging vessels from entering into the PSSA. It was proposed to ban certain tankers. Others, for example, double hull and some single hull tankers, would have to state their intention  to cross the area 48 hours in advance. The PSSA request was considered by the marine environment protection committee in July 2003. Irish experts from several Departments and agencies together with colleagues from five other states attended to support the request. The MEPC agreed in principle to the request for designation and referred the matter to an expert navigation committee for examination. This committee is expected to report to the MEPC next year. The MEPC did not accede to the request to ban tankers as proposed. It is open to the states concerned to introduce other protective measures. Possible proposals in this regard are being considered by the officials and experts concerned.While attention has properly been given to disasters such as the Erika and the Prestige, I remind the House, as I pointed out in the Seanad when introducing the Bill, that in Ireland we succeeded earlier this year in averting a serious oil spill. The handling of the spill has been used as a model for other countries of how to react to such a disaster quickly and in a co-ordinated way. An incident occurred on 28 January 2002 off the coast of Donegal involving a 22 year old single hull Panamanian registered tanker, the Princess Eva, which had a potential for pollution similar to the Prestige or the Erika. The vessel was carrying 55,000 tonnes of heavy oil from Copenhagen to the United States. On 28 January 2003, the vessel experienced very heavy weather off the north west coast of Ireland. Following an accident on board in which two crew members were killed and another seriously injured, the vessel entered Donegal Bay where the two bodies were transferred to shore. An oil spill was averted due to the actions taken by the Irish Coast Guard and the maritime safety directorate of my Department.Events such as these serve as a reminder of the vulnerability of our coastline. Ireland has, accordingly, consistently supported measures at EU and IMO level to bring about improvements in ship standards, better protection for the marine environment and adequate compensation for victims. I propose to continue with this approach. These events have also focused my attention on the provision of safety services. I am satisfied that the establishment of a single agency responsible for all safety matters is the best course of action. I intend to submit proposals to Government for decision in this regard as soon as possible. This matter is at present being discussed with trade unions and staff representatives with a view to resolving industrial relations issues which arise and charting the way forward for the development of marine safety services. I look forward to debating the legislation required with Members of the Oireachtas in due course.This Bill, together with other measures which have been introduced or proposed, underlines the Government's commitment to ensuring that our legislation complies with accepted EU and international standards while addressing specific Irish concerns. This commitment is further underlined  by the urgency accorded to this measure. It requires to be enacted by 1 November 2003, the date on which the increased limits come into effect internationally. It is in the interest of both the contributors and potential victims that this deadline be met. In the event of an incident off our coast, the increased limits would only apply if our legislation were in line with that which applied internationally. On the other hand, if an incident occurred which affected a state whose legislation gave effect to the increased limits, Irish contributors would be required to pay towards meeting the extra costs involved.In the circumstances, I ask the House to deal with the Bill as expeditiously as possible. I made a similar request to the Seanad and am pleased to report that Senators readily acceded to it. I look forward to hearing Deputies' contributions and have no hesitation in commending the Bill to the House.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	440	On the Minister's last point, he will have Fine Gael's full co-operation in trying to pass this Bill as quickly as possible to ensure that we meet the deadline set out. It would not only be embarrassing, but also extremely serious, if Ireland did not do what is necessary to comply with the rules agreed internationally. However, the House is due an explanation as to why we have waited until now to deal with the Bill and why we are rushing it through in one week. The plan, as I understand it, is to complete Second Stage by 1.30 p.m. tomorrow and to take Committee Stage on Thursday. Therefore, we are expected to have our Committee Stage amendments ready at more or less the same time as we conclude the Second Stage debate. It is appropriate to express concern over the timetable outlined by the Minister. However, the Bill is of such importance that no party in the House would actually try to stop what is being attempted by the Minister and all are eager that the legislation be enacted in time.I am concerned about the number of changes that have been made to the Bill since its initiation in the Seanad. It has more or less doubled in size, from five sections to 12. The House is due an explanation in this respect.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	442	We were assured during the passage of the last Bill, when we had to accept entirely new sections on Committee Stage, that this would not happen with a subsequent Bill. I presume there is a fairly simple explanation. For example, there is a welcome new section regarding the introduction of an extra fund. It is not unreasonable to express some concern at the changes, even though they are relatively self-explanatory.The purpose of the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation)  (Amendment) Bill is to increase the limits of compensation payable to victims of pollution resulting in spills from oil tankers at sea. As we know, compensation for oil pollution of the sea is payable in accordance with the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1992 and the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1992. The Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) Acts of 1988 to 1998 give effect to these conventions. However, as the Minister pointed out, following the Erika disaster, in which a Maltese-registered tanker broke up in the Bay of Biscay off the coast of France in December 1999, compensation limits were re-examined, and rightly so. Agreement was reached at the International Maritime Organisation in 2000 to increase the limits of compensation substantially by 50% for boat owners' liability and in respect of liability payable through the international fund. This fund, as has been outlined, is contributed to by all nations that import and export oil resources. A new section was added to the Bill regarding a supplementary fund of €1 billion.The purpose of the Bill is relatively straightforward. The manner in which it is being taken is of some concern but, as I said, the Minister will have our full co-operation in terms of dealing with it by the end of the week in order that we do not leave ourselves in the embarrassing and potentially dangerous position of not being covered under international legislation.On our level of preparedness for oil spillages at sea, we as a sovereign country have 11% of EU waters under our responsibility and there is a significant amount of traffic travelling through these waters on a daily basis. Many of the vessels concerned are not monitored as closely as they should be and this needs to be addressed.Consider the Prestige disaster that occurred off the coast of Galicia in Spain. I was lucky enough to have been afforded the opportunity to look at the clean-up operation some months ago. We can learn from many of the concerns that were raised in the aftermath of the clean-up operation, which, I am glad to say, is more or less complete. The first was that there was no real emergency plan to deal with the break-up of the tanker, which is highly surprising considering that this was not the first time a tanker broke up off the coast of Spain. As a result of the lack of a plan, there was a lack of co-ordination and indecision during the period of stress and break-up of the tanker. Nothing was done for about four days and no decision was taken on where the tanker should be towed or how it should be dealt with. As a result, it broke up with very few protections in place and with an insufficiently co-ordinated response. Another startling fact I heard was that it took some days before a vessel capable of towing the Prestige could reach the site at all.How does Ireland compare to Spain? I am glad that we certainly seem to have a plan of action to cope with a similar incident. The Minister rightly referred to the Princess Eva example of January 2002, in which this very significant tanker, carrying 55,000 tonnes of heavy oil, got into difficulty. The problem was brought under control in a very organised and co-ordinated way, thanks to the Maritime Safety Directorate. This is a good example of how we can deal with an issue and, through proper planning, prevent a potential tragedy in a relatively short time.We should not, however, be quick to pat ourselves on the back and assume we do not have any difficulties in this area. I have raised in the House on a number of occasions the fact that Ireland requires a tug or towing vessel with the capacity to tow or detain a large oil tanker should it get into difficulty. We do not have such a vessel. Although our new research vessel, the Celtic Explorer, has a certain amount of towing capacity, it is not nearly sufficient to tow an oil tanker the size of the Princess Eva, the Prestige or any of the other larger oil tankers which regularly and quietly pass along our coastline. I appeal to the Government and the Minister to invest in a tug or towing vessel with the capacity to tow or detain a large oil tanker which finds itself in difficulty off our coast, particularly the west coast which is a rough section of ocean.The Minister raised the issue of single-skin tankers. We are not sufficiently active or aggressive in expressing to the European Maritime Safety Agency our concern about such tankers. While I accept that we, with many other European Union member states, successfully lobbied to reduce the period for phasing out single-skin tankers, we must aggressively continue to try to reduce this period. Single-skin oil tankers are an outdated technology and must be replaced as soon as possible. In the meantime, we should lobby hard to ensure such vessels do not pass within a reasonable distance of our coastline or that of the rest of Europe. Spain, Portugal, France, Britain and Ireland have all expressed a desire to ensure such tankers are required to keep a minimum distance from land while carrying toxic substances or oil along the EU coastline. What progress is being made in that lobbying exercise?I understand the need for tankers to travel along the route of the European coast when making the journey from Africa to northern Europe. Given that many of them are difficult to monitor and are single-skin, however, our primary concern must be to protect our greatest natural resource, namely, our coastline and surrounding seas. We have not pressed this argument sufficiently.As regards the monitoring of our coast and ship inspections in ports, the Minister and his officials will be aware that the authorities in the EU were, until recently, expressing serious concern about the level of inspections of commercial shipping vessels taking place in our ports. While the figures have improved in the past 18 months or  thereabouts, as an island nation we should be at the top of the list, rather than in the bottom half, in terms of the number of inspections of commercial shipping vessels European countries carry out in their ports. It is not good enough to meet the minimum standards laid down by the European Union and it would be unacceptable if a significant oil spillage occurred off our coast from a ship which had left one of our ports.With regard to the monitoring of activity in the waters around the coast, I understand some 140,000 square miles of water are under our sovereign control. I doubt whether our Naval Service and Air Corps have the capacity to monitor effectively activity in such a vast area, while at the same time monitoring fishing activity, possible drugs smuggling, oil slicks, dumping at sea, the flushing out of waste material from the tanks of ships and so forth. We need to re-evaluate our capacity to monitor what is happening around our coast.Given that it is virtually impossible to have a sufficient number of ships to monitor such a large area, we must place greater emphasis on the Air Corps. The Department should, therefore, discuss the potential for improving the service with the Department of Defence. Will the Minister provide the figures on the coverage of our waters the Air Corps achieves on a weekly and monthly basis?Do we have a reporting mechanism for oil slicks and, if so, how many have been reported in the past 12 months? I suspect no such formalised mechanism is in place. We should consider introducing an incentive scheme, notably for fishing vessels but also for other commercial ships, to report oil slicks and the dumping of waste at sea to the authorities.On a number of occasions in the past year, legislation has been introduced to try to increase our state of preparedness for a major accident at sea, such as the spillage of oil or hazardous and noxious substances and other types of pollution or dumping at sea. This concentration on legislation to enforce the law on pollution at sea, while welcome, is long overdue. If we are honest, we will admit that most of it has been to comply with the requirements of either European Union or international law. I suggest that the next time we are required to introduce legislation within a specified timeframe, we do not leave it until the last minute, as has been the case on this occasion. Having said that, the Minister will have the full co-operation of the Fine Gael Party in ensuring we pass this Bill before the end of the week.

The Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is sitting right now while the House is discussing this important Bill. The Bill has to be dealt with quickly. It is strange that we always seem to end up having to pass Bills from this Department within weeks of a deadline.The committee that oversees the Department is meeting today to discuss the price of mobile  phones, another important issue. I ask the Chair to liaise with the clerk of that committee, Mr. Lenihan, to try to ensure that this type of clash does not happen again. It is most unfair to the Opposition spokespersons. We have a deep interest in both issues but we do not have the gift of bilocation.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	444	That is not a matter for the Chair but for the Whips and the committees.

If that is the case, it is a matter for the support staff to work together to ensure these clashes do not occur. I accept the Chair's point. I am one of the Labour Party Whips and I will take the matter up at that level as well.I also regret that the Chair did not give Deputies an opportunity to discuss what is probably the most important issue in the marine portfolio, the decision made in Brussels yesterday on the Irish box. Thirty six hours later, the Dáil has had no input to this issue. My request for an Adjournment debate on the matter was also turned down. The Minister spun a particular line and appeared to have the support of some of the fishing representatives, but grave issues arise as a result of the decision to reduce the Irish box by up to 70% in size under an agreement that will only last until December 2008. There are grave issues for the future of the marine and fishing industry in this country and it is deplorable that we were not allowed to discuss them. When I spoke to fishing representatives—
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The Deputy has made his point. He must discuss the Bill before the House.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I will address the Bill but there are outstanding issues about the implementation rules, the level of fishing inside and outside the new box and the future of Ireland's eastern fishermen, whom I represent, and fishermen in the north west. The House should have had an opportunity to discuss them and I regret that the Chair did not permit it today.I understand the Minister's desire to have the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill passed as quickly as possible. I welcome the Bill and I thank the staff from the Department who gave me a fine briefing on the legislation. The basic issues addressed by the Bill are a 50% increase in the level of compensation and the establishment of the supplementary fund. These are important initiatives which were taken internationally and which this country needs to be part of and support. The Labour Party has put forward a small, technical amendment with regard to section 4(a). We would prefer that the European regulations referred to were amended directly, rather than in  general terms. However, that can be discussed on Thursday.This Bill was an important opportunity for the Minister to address the grave danger to our coastlines and seas, a vast area that is ten times the size of our land mass and of which this nation is the sovereign representative, posed by the continued use of single hulled tankers. Since the 1970s these ships have been involved in a litany of disasters in which bad weather or some type of accident to the hull resulted in disastrous spillages and pollution.The Minister says we will work with the EU to take action on this issue and that as time passes, this will cease to be a problem. However, it is only a short time since the Prestige wreaked havoc on the northern Spanish coast and destroyed hundreds of kilometres of coastline. That ship had apparently been for sale on the Internet for £500,000. It was registered under a flag of convenience and eventually caused disaster off the Spanish coast. There is an opportunity now, by amending this Bill, to ban single hulled tankers from our waters. The Minister should take the initiative and not wait for his EU colleagues, as he did yesterday. He should take the lead and use this legislation to do so.

The Minister has an opportunity, as the representative of a country with one of the biggest marine areas in the European Union, to take the lead. Perhaps he would consider making a major amendment to the Bill. He should look to the courage the Minister for Health and Children has shown in relation to smoking and ban single hulled tankers from our waters. This is an opportunity to make a major impact in this regard.I welcome the Bill. For the last four or five decades and since the modern global economy has evolved, there have been increasing problems with oil pollution. The most conservative estimate is that about 0.25% of all oil production ends up in the sea. Other estimates calculate that 1% of oil production ends up directly polluting our oceans. Figures range from between six and seven million tonnes of oil per annum to an astonishing 20 million tonnes per annum for the amount of oil that is deliberately or accidentally offloaded from the 6,500 tankers which ply the oceans.This is an important Bill. The work being done by the convention in London, for which this House legislated in 1988 and 1998, is important in protecting our fragile ecosystem, of which the oceans are the largest part. We need ongoing studies on the anthropogenic impact of oil pollution from all sources, including the run-offs from petrol stations and petroleum based industrial installations on land as well as tankers. There has been a litany of disastrous oil spills over the  years and we must keep this issue under close surveillance. I hope this Bill will have an important role in that regard.Like the Minister, I congratulate everybody involved in managing the disaster with the Princess Eva earlier this year, including the coastguard, Donegal County Council and inspectors of the marine safety directorate who acted swiftly to deal with that ship and its cargo of nearly 54,000 tonnes of gas oil. The Minister told me some time ago that the operation cost our agencies in the region of €190,000. I hope that it was all recovered from the perpetrators together with all other outstanding costs, under this or other legislation.At any one time there are five or six major oil tankers ploughing through our seas. When one looks back at the record of disasters such as the Exxon Valdez in Prince William Sound in Alaska in 1989, the American Trader off California in February 1990, the Braer off Scotland in January 1993 and the Jessica in the Pacific in January 2001, in which hundreds of thousands of gallons of oil ended up in the marine environment, one realises that we must make the most strenuous efforts to try to cope with any eventualities that may arise. In recent times there have been shocks other than the Princess Eva around our own coastline. My own constituency was recently damaged by 200 tonnes of diesel gas from the MV Blackrock in Dublin Port. We ended up with an oil slick along Sutton beach and Dublin Bay. There have been other similar but smaller disasters in Galway and elsewhere. The Minister must clearly take responsibility for this area.A study of the incredible disaster involving the Prestige off the coast of Galicia in northern Spain clearly shows that the regional government of Galicia and the Spanish Government were completely unprepared for a major disaster of that type. Our marine journalists and people in this House asked at the time whether Ireland was any better prepared. The current Minister's predecessor, Deputy Fahey, promised us that we would have a major tug for use in such emergencies. The Minister referred to it when he went to Scandinavia to welcome the Celtic Explorer. However, as far as I know, neither the commitment from the former Minister, Deputy Fahey, nor that of the current Minister, Deputy Ahern, has been met in that regard. It is clearly a key element in attempting to deal with oil pollution emergencies and has not been addressed. We are told that the LE Eithne and various other boats have a towing capacity, but that is certainly not sufficient to deal with a disaster of the type caused by the Prestige.When the Minister was appointed, and when I accepted this portfolio from the Labour Party, I was struck by the fact that France and Ireland were being threatened with court action over our failure to carry out sufficient import inspections. I commend the Minister for increasing the number of marine surveyors and bringing the percentage of inspections up over 25%. I note that Norway has a 35% rate. If one enters a Norwegian  port, one seems to have a one in three chance of being closely examined. Perhaps the Minister could continue that welcome improvement.In addition to the famous tug, the Minister promised us a coastal protection strategy study around the first time that I asked questions on this area. I am not quite sure what has happened in this regard. The Minister promised that within two years he would have a strategy for all areas of our coastline. However, he failed over that time, just as his predecessor did. The long dark night of the soul that we are enduring with this Government is now in its seventh year. It seems like it has been here for ever. The Minister has completely refused to introduce the coastal zone management Bill. Every time a session starts and we receive lists of legislation, the coastal zone management Bill is always scheduled for the following term. A rainbow Government would address this if it were to get an opportunity.Regarding the Bantry Bay charter, it is deplorable that where a group of local representatives, including fishing interests and yachtsmen, got together to produce a very important initiative in Bantry Bay on the edge of the Beara Peninsula in West Cork, the Minister allowed it to die. I cannot see why he could not have kept it going as a model for our entire coastline, so that we might also have had a charter for Dublin Bay in my constituency, Baldoyle Bay and so on.One of the key issues which has recently arisen regarding the condition of workers is that of flags of convenience. During the Minister's tenure, which is now well into its second year, is there any way in which he and his international colleagues might address that very unsavoury practice, which concerns working conditions and wages at sea? It is also a significant cause of the mayhem that has gone on regarding the pollution of our waters by oil.One of the most deplorable aspects of the safety of our coastline, on which this Minister has made a regrettable decision, relates to Dublin Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre. In recent weeks we heard the appalling news that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, proposes to close down the centre. Our marine rescue co-ordination centre just a few streets away, along with those at Malin Head in Donegal and Valentia in Kerry, provided a 24-7 system for monitoring our coastline and co-ordinating marine emergencies all around the country. A key advantage of the Dublin location is that a senior coastguard and Department managers are based at the same location in Leeson Lane. I stood here four or five months ago after a report calling for the closure of the Malin station, which would have been a deplorable act, something which would also have been true of closing Valentia. The question of why we cannot have three centres remains to be answered.The Minister hails from the east coast. It was put to me that closing the centre was like moving air traffic control from Dublin Airport to Shannon. Having aeroplanes landing in Dublin con trolled by radio from Shannon would clearly be crazy. However, that is what the Minister proposes for the Dublin Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre. I understand that 17 or 18 staff members are involved. Given that the Irish Sea is one of the busiest sea lanes in the world, with over 80,000 passengers and crew at sea during recent holiday weekends and huge movements of freight, including dangerous cargoes of oil and gas, I urge the Minister to re-examine his decision. I want all three centres to be retained. It has been said that in an ideal world, we would have one east coast centre and one west coast centre. However, given the shape of our island, it is perhaps desirable to have three centres in a sort of triangle arrangement. In the event of an emergency such as that caused by the Prestige off northern Spain, I find it hard to believe that the response from marine rescue, the fire brigade, ambulances, Garda and coastguards could be completely co-ordinated from two remote ends of our country.I stood up to defend Malin, and I continue to defend it and Valentia. It is incredible that the Minister wishes to proceed with the closure. If the Minister is interested in marine safety, which is the ultimate concern of this Bill, perhaps he will revisit his decision to close the Dublin Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre. Otherwise, we may unfortunately have to raise the matter again in the coming days and weeks.There may be an opportunity, before Thursday, for the Minister to take a really important initiative such as that taken by his colleague in the Department of Health and Children. The Minister is used to employing Bills as vehicles to introduce policy. When he was at the then Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs, he used various innocuous social welfare Bills as vehicles to introduce policies which were not related to the Bills' content. He has taken similar action since he took up his new portfolio. Perhaps he could take this opportunity to make this an even more significant Bill.With that caveat, on behalf of the Labour Party, I warmly welcome the Bill.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I wish to share time with Deputies Eamon Ryan and Morgan.I welcome the Bill, the purpose of which is to increase the limits of compensation payable to victims of pollution resulting from spills of oil from tankers. This legislation will be extremely important for our economy, particularly in light of the exposed nature of our coastline and the virtual inevitability of vessels running aground in difficult weather conditions. Everyone will recall the recent disaster off the Spanish coastline when a tanker ran aground and caused major difficulties. People will have seen pictures of the damage to sea life, seabirds and the Spanish economy. The impact of this disaster will be felt for many years, particularly by those who inhabit that part of the Spanish coastline.The bulk of all oil pollution at sea results from routine operations such as discharges from tankers. These are the type of matters we will have to address. Members will recall the catastrophic effects of the grounding of the tanker Torrey Canyon in the English Channel in 1967, which resulted in a spill of 95,000 tonnes of oil and caused heavy pollution on both the French and English coastlines with serious ecological and fishery consequences. Other major disasters involving tankers include that involving the Amoco Cadiz in 1989, in which 40,000 tonnes of oil were spilled, and the stranding of the Braer in 1993, which resulted in a spill of 85,000 tonnes. Such accidents will recur and it is important to consider how we will deal with them and how we will compensate the people affected by them. There are many vessels at sea which are not actually seaworthy and there is no way that Ireland can protect its interests by being involved in carrying out the number of inspections required in respect of such craft.In each of the episodes to which I refer, the level of oil pollution reached lethal limits for marine fauna – mainly birds and mammals. The damage caused was much greater than mere ecological disturbance in the sea and on the shore. It must be remembered that half of the world's extracted crude oil is transported by sea on supertankers. Each journey involving a supertanker carries its own level of risk. I accept that a large number proceed on their journeys unscathed, but we must recognise the level of risk involved.The escape of oil during shipping largely occurs during routine tank cleaning. During this process, oil is deliberately released into the sea. This practice is only illegal in certain areas and for vessels over a certain weight, namely, 400 tonnes. We should reduce this level of tonnage because any level of spill or discharge by a vessel causes pollution.When tanker accidents occur, the visual effect is evident. The impact of oil spills on the marine environment depends on the importance of an area as a breeding or feeding ground, on the season and on oceanographic conditions. One of the most dramatic accidents occurred in 1989 in the shallow waters of Prince William Sound near Alaska. In this instance, the oil tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground and spilled more than 40,000 tonnes of crude oil. As the oil spread along the coastline, it covered sea animals, birds and plants. It turned literally hundreds of miles of this coastline, unique for its cleanliness and biological resources, into an area of ecological disaster.Commercially harvested fish and shellfish that are contaminated with oil have a tainted flavour and are responsible for an increased level of skin lesions. An accident such as that involving the Exxon Valdez would have incalculable consequences for our shoreline, marine life and marine ecology. The main provision in the Bill is the increase in the level of compensation payable by 50%. I trust that the people of Pollathomas,  County Mayo, which I visited yesterday with my colleagues on the Independent benches, will be able to benefit from the same type of compensation. The people in that area feel they have been forgotten by central Government. They are being dealt with, at some level, by the county council in Mayo and also by the Office of Public Works. However, they are concerned that they are being passed from agency to agency without the funding necessary to alleviate their difficulties being provided and they are beginning to feel distressed. The Government should give urgent consideration to this matter.I am satisfied that the Bill seeks to prevent oil pollution disasters occurring near our shores. It will ensure that any victims of major oil pollution will have recourse to compensation. When we talk about victims, we usually refer to people and businesses. However, we must remember the real victims, namely, sea life and seabirds. Sea life is most immediately affected by oil spills. Seabirds become smothered in oil and are unable to fly. In attempting to clean themselves, these creatures ingest the oil and are poisoned. Some species are attracted to the shiny surface resulting from an oil slick and try to dive into the sea. Approximately 60% of birds and other wildlife washed up on our shores die as a result of oil spillages. However, they are not always washed up on the shoreline and there are many oil spillages of which we remain unaware.In addition to this Bill, the House is also dealing with the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill. Maritime matters are of great concern to Ireland, as an island nation. We must protect our coastline, which is a major part of our tourism industry. It is all very well passing laws in respect of dumping at sea, oil pollution, etc. but we must up the ante to a large extent in terms of enforcing such legislation. No one denies that the latter will require the provision of a high level of resources. It is difficult, given that these laws are not already in place, for the authorities to inspect ships near our coastline.For many years, people felt that it was acceptable to dump at sea. A culture built up that if one was not caught in the act of dumping, it would do not one any harm. However, such behaviour has a way of coming back to haunt people. The difficulty now is that, because this practice has been established, it will cost money for those involved to change their way of life. In my opinion, a high level of resources and stringent policing will be required.I compliment those responsible for the drafting of the Bill, which I unreservedly support.

In my opinion, there will be general support in the House to try to have it passed by 1 November in order that we can comply with the international regulations.It is unfortunate that the Bill is being presented at this late stage, particularly as the international deadline for implementation is only two weeks  away. I regret that, in a sense, we will not have enough time to give it proper consideration. I understand that the Minister intends to bring forward amendments on Committee Stage on Thursday. I can excuse him, to a certain extent, for arriving late with his homework or for perhaps having only done it on a Sunday evening, but it is regrettable that we are not rowing together – as he stated he hoped would happen – in respect of passing the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and the Sea Pollution (Hazardous and Noxious Substances) (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill. There is no doubt that these Bills are related. If we are intent on addressing the issue of marine safety, it would be far more sensible to take these Bills, which, in essence, are seeking to achieve the same effect, deal with them at one sitting and allow a proper debate across a range of areas involving marine safety.It is regrettable that we are addressing this Bill separately from the hazardous and noxious substances Bill as the issues are similar. We will now have to deal separately with the protocol to the international convention on oil pollution relating to preparedness, response and co-operation. It makes no sense that we are not debating these Bills together. One of my main criticisms of the Government parties in this regard is that they have failed to bring about this basic level of co-ordination. If they had been co-ordinated, we could have gone into detail and had a proper Second Stage debate across a range of different issues. When we deal with one after the other we will not, to my mind, give them due attention or necessary time.In regard to the detail of the Bill, I laud the role of the EU in pushing the protocol regarding the establishment of the supplementary fund. It is a good example of where the EU, acting not only as a multilateral organisation within its own right but also on a global basis, has pushed the International Maritime Organisation to improve standards and set stricter limits. Taking the step beyond EU boundaries and seeking tighter international laws is something for which the officials and the EU should be applauded.Given the number of incidents in Europe over recent years, such a move is not surprising. There have been many accidents over the years. In my 40 short years on the planet, there seems to have been a major oil spillage in Europe every five years or so, such as the Betelgeuse incident in Brittany. I am sure Deputy O'Donovan is aware of an incident in Bantry. While it was different from some of the major incidents, it was still a major oil tanker incident in our waters. There have been many incidents in European waters. Given that the EU is such a heavily industrialised area with a large number of oil tankers moving through its waters, it is not surprising that we have concerns about the issue of compensation for oil tanker spills or damage. The increase in the fund is welcome. When one looks at the level of funds and the €120 million that was in place,  clearly it would have been inadequate if we had a major incident.The Minister said he wishes to go further and look at overall safety and later he referred to the establishment of an agency. I echo Deputy Coveney's comments – we need more than an agency. I also have concerns about the type of regulations we are passing in terms of improving marine safety. Deputy Coveney mentioned a report during a previous debate which referred to the need for an ocean-going tug on the west coast. The report, carried out in 1998 or 1999, is a seminal document and shows the almost mathematical certainty of incidents in our waters every year given the volume of merchant marine traffic and large trawlers around our coast. We can be sure, on a mathematical statistical basis, that we will have two serious marine emergency incidents involving the merchant fleet every year. This is an approximation. On the basis of this, the report concluded investment in an ocean-going tug would be worthwhile for the State and the EU. The tug possibly could come to the rescue of boats in difficulty off the south west coast of England or the northern coasts of France or Spain.We know from recent responses what would happen if anything came to pass with the disused American merchant navy ships which are being towed from Virginia to Hartlepool in north west England. The Minister told us that if there was an incident, we would have access to tugs from the European Continent. I wonder how long it would take a tug to get from the Thames estuary, Le Havre or Brest, or wherever the Minister has contracted it to be in readiness—

Unfortunately, there would be no Red Cow roundabout for going around the Fastnet Rock a few days late.Maritime incidents involving oil tankers can involve compensation bills of €500 million to €700 million. These bills are of such magnitude that the Department of Finance has to tell us why it will not invest the necessary money in an emergency towing vessel that might save us the €500 million bill in the first place. It is not enough for the Minister to propose agencies for us to adopt international protocols. It is important that we invest in proper marine safety infrastructure if we are serious about protecting our marine environment. Such vessels could have a dual role. They could monitor activities at sea and assist the naval and fisheries protection services. It would not be as if such a vessel would sit waiting for an accident to happen.Another recommendation in the report is that we would apply to the International Maritime Organisation for the designation of our north west coast, a particularly sensitive area, as a no-go area for certain oil tankers. I believe that request was previously turned down by the International Maritime Organisation. The Minister  indicated a similar request would be made in conjunction with European states, but he did not clarify whether this is likely to be passed. The Minister told the House the MEPC is the agency dealing with it. I was attending a committee meeting while the Minister delivered his speech. However, it is unclear whether he thinks we will or will not be successful in achieving such an exclusion zone.I encourage the Minister to seek such a zone. In addition to environmental costs, the perception of the image of Ireland abroad would be one of the greatest costs in the event of a marine accident involving an oil tanker. There is no doubt that an oil tanker disaster on the beaches of Donegal, Connemara or west Cork would be hugely costly to this country on a symbolic level as well as on an environmental level. I encourage the Minister to clarify the status of this exclusion zone proposal.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	454	I welcome this Bill in the spirit in which it is intended, as a means to increase the level of compensation available to the victims of pollution from oil tankers. I am sure we all agree that if people are subjected to hardship and loss as a consequence of such an event, they ought to be adequately compensated. For this reason, I have no difficulty supporting the Bill and ensuring that it enjoys a speedy passage through the House.However, I also feel that compensating people for wrongs done is not as effective as preventing them occurring in the first instance. I would like more done in that regard. As has been outlined by my colleague from the Green Party, I note that Ireland was one of the states to request the International Maritime Organisation to designate a significant part of European waters as a particularly sensitive sea area. This would mean that some tankers would be banned while others, including some double hulled tankers, would have to give 48 hours advance notice of their intention to cross the area. I am disappointed to learn the marine environment protection committee of the IMO rejected the request for a ban in July. However, it did leave some scope for individual states to introduce their own measures and I hope the Minister will see fit to introduce such a step.There are also other issues which arise in regard to penalising the owners of any vessel responsible for pollution. For example, if such a vessel was in a fit state to sail out of our waters after such an incident, what steps can be taken to ensure that the owners are brought to book? Is there any procedure whereby other states that adhere to the international protocols can act on behalf of this State to ensure that such vessel owners pay adequate compensation? I seem to recall that this was declared to be the case with the legislation on the trafficking of illicit substances debated by the House in the last term,  and I seek assurances that the same applies in regard to this Bill.Another issue relates to the level of surveillance by the State of the types of vessels which carry oil around our coasts. The State is well able to carry out surveillance on terrestrial matters when it suits so I hope this can also be done at sea. Any Member who has spent any time out on the sea, as I have, will have passed rusty hulks the size of Croke Park, which look even bigger if one is sitting in a fishing boat. Even if one is on a passenger ferry, one might utter a prayer as these dirty big brutes come ever closer. Some of them look quite shaky, which leaves a lot to be desired in terms of the management of this situation.One would hope that not too many of those ships are carrying oil, but of course we know from previous disasters on our own and other coasts that this is not the case. Many of the vessels which run aground or shed their loads are exactly the type of badly maintained vessels to which I have referred and are carrying oil. The State, therefore, should have more discretion in this area and be able to prevent vessels which it feels are not safe from carrying dangerous substances, including oil, in our waters.Greater powers of inspection are required. We should also examine ways of ensuring that companies involved over a long period in the commercial trafficking of oil in our waters are operating strict standards of maintenance of vessels. This is particularly important for some of the multinationals like Shell and Marathon, which unfortunately have already demonstrated some disregard for ethical and environmentally friendly procedures.As I said, despite my broader concerns over the pollution of our waters, this Bill is a non-contentious piece of legislation and I will be supporting its speedy passage.
#DennisODonovan	unknown-#DennisODonovan-party	unknown-#DennisODonovan-dob	unknown-#DennisODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Like previous speakers, I welcome this timely Bill. I also compliment the Minister on his excellent work in Luxembourg this week in resolving the very contentious issue of the Irish box, which was resolved to the satisfaction of every major fishing organisation in Ireland, north, south, east and west. I will not dwell on this matter but it relates to fishing and the survival of fishermen, onshore and offshore, and the Minister did an excellent day's work in Luxembourg. That should be put on the record.This is an excellent debate on a matter very close to my heart, as I represent Cork South-West. One hears debates on agriculture, Luas and traffic in Dublin, and there is massive interest in those matters, but we have had major oil spillages in Bantry Bay. The oil spillage of 1974 was the biggest ever to hit Ireland but nobody referred to it. I was a student at the time and worked in the area trying to make some money. There were three oil spillages from the Whiddy oil depot in the early 1970s but there was no compensation. Some of the smaller fishermen and farmers  chased Gulf Oil and after four or five years they got a totally inadequate snippet of compensation.Going around the coast, the Ranga washed up on Slea Head and was an eyesore there for years. The Bardini Reefer is semi-submerged in Berehaven Harbour and when the USS The Sullivans visited Bantry Bay recently, due to the area's links to the Sullivans killed in the Second World War, I was embarrassed that the hull of the Bardini Reefer was still sticking out of the water. We hear a lot about compensation and protocols from Europe and Ireland but whether the EU or our own Government acts, this wreck should be dismantled and removed from the important safe harbour between Bere Island and Castletownbere. It is a disgrace that it is still there.A previous speaker mentioned the Betelgeuse disaster on Whiddy Island in which 50 lives were lost. We hear a lot now about tribunals and inquiries but the first big inquiry was set up to investigate that disaster, and rightly so, as 50 lives were lost and it was important to discover the truth. It is a fact, however, that that particular ship was turned away from another port in Europe which did not want it because it was a dangerous vessel. It was brought into Bantry Bay, broke its back and one of the greatest calamities ever to occur in Ireland was the result.In the not too distant past, the famous Tribulus owned by Shell, entered Bantry Bay and another disaster was averted only by the quick action of tugboats and local services. Consider the damage that could have been caused to the Kenmare estuary, Bantry Bay and Garnish Island, which is one of the most wonderful tourist attractions in southern Ireland. Damage could also have been caused to the mariculture and aquaculture industries – recently published figures show that quite apart from the fishing industry, those industries are worth €550 million to the country in exports. Damage could have been caused to places like Dunmanus Bay and Roaringwater Bay, where several hundred people are employed, onshore and offshore, in the mussel, shrimp, scallop and oyster industries.Compensation has been mentioned and it is wonderful to learn that the compensation fund is to be increased sixfold. That will compensate some fishermen and others in the community, but it could never compensate for the damage a major ecological disaster would inflict on the flora, fauna and fish life along the coastline. Many people do not consider this. I am being parochial but one could apply the same argument to Mayo, Wexford and elsewhere. The damage that could be caused is unbelievable.In another relatively recent incident, the Kowloon Bridge, a massive ore carrier, came from South America to Bantry. It was a heap of scrap and a total wreck which entered Bantry Bay on a stormy night. Thankfully we got it out of the bay and its crew was airlifted off Mizen Head. It drifted along and had it not hit the Stag's Rock off Castletownshend, it would have ended up on Ardmore beach in Waterford. The Kowloon Bridge lies in very important herring spawning grounds off Baltimore and Castletownshend and it is an absolute disgrace that it is allowed to remain there. Unlike the Bardini Reefer, deep sea divers could be brought in to dismantle the Kowloon Bridge and remove it from our coastline. We do not want it there.The main shipping lanes from South or Central America to Europe, for ships going up the English Channel to Holland or France, go past the Fastnet, off the south west coast of Ireland. As a consequence we have had several serious incidents in the area. Everyone talks about the Exxon Valdez and the recent incident off the Donegal coast, which was handled successfully, but it is important to reflect on our history. That history has been one of devastation and in most cases there was no compensation.The Bardini Reefer was deliberately brought into Berehaven Harbour and abandoned for insurance reasons. It now lies semi-submerged in the harbour and that cannot be allowed to continue. The Minister should take a hands-on approach to this matter and ensure something is done about it.I am delighted that Europe is now coming on board, as Ireland was the first country to suffer this problem and had to complain first. It is only in the last few years that Europe has woken up to the problems we are facing. There was a huge debate about the ship which got into trouble in the Bay of Biscay. Last year we saw the same problem with a vessel drifting off the coast of Spain and Portugal but the reality is that different countries, such as the country of origin of the vessel and Portugal and Spain, did not want to tackle the problem. They let it drift and eventually the ship broke up. There was widespread media coverage of that incident by CNN and Sky. However, CNN and Sky were not available when disasters occurred in Bantry Bay and elsewhere off the coast of west Cork. We should not forget those disasters.The Minister was criticised for rushing the Bill through the House. However, this Bill was intensely debated in the Seanad. I compliment the Minister on expanding the legislation to include important measures. In accordance with the essence of parliamentary democracy, the Minister has listened to contributions and taken on board positive points, which, as a result, has strengthened the Bill. I compliment him on his foresight in this regard.Deputy Coveney referred to the need for an ocean-going sea tug to be based here, a requirement which, speaking from the heart, I support. If such a tug vessel was based here it should be supported by EU funding and based in one of two venues, either in Bantry Bay or in the Shannon Estuary. Most of the incidents that have occurred off our coast have occurred in those areas. If shipping disasters which occurred here involving the Ranga, the Bardini Reefer, the Betelgeuse, the Tribulus or the Kowloon Bridge, to mention but a few, had happened in France, Spain or Holland  ten to 15 years ago, the European Union would have moved more quickly to address this issue. It is moving gradually to address it now, but it took disasters to occur in the Bay of Biscay and off the coast of other parts of Europe before it realised the extent of the problem created by such disasters. When such disasters occurred in west Cork, off the coast of Kerry and elsewhere off the south coast, Europe did not want to know about them for many years.To ensure the proper safety, control and policing of these vessels, it is crucial for us to have an ocean-going tug, based off the south west coast. I appeal to the Government, the European Union and our European contacts to ensure that the Kowloon Bridge and the Bardini Reefer are dismantled. They should be taken from their watery graves where they are causing damage and pose a hazard to people from Bere Island travelling to and from Castletownbere or elsewhere on the mainland. The owners of small craft have to divert out of the path of these wrecks that have been in those waters for the past decade and which will be there for another decade if we do not do something about them. Their presence is unacceptable.Reference was also made to the Erika disaster. Were it not for recent incidents such as that disaster off the coast of mainland Europe, the legislation and protocol referred to might not have been brought forward as quickly. Their implementation is not before time and I welcome them. I also welcome that the compensation fund under the protocol has been increased by 50% from 135 million SDR to 203 million SDR. I presume the amount referred to in the compensation fund will apply to each incident at sea that occurs and that it is not a global amount that will cover a series of disasters. If a disaster occurred off the coast of Mayo, Wexford or Kerry, I presume this fund could be tapped into in respect of each such disaster.I note that in respect of victims a 750 million SDR supplementary compensation fund will be available, which is welcome. Such a fund could assist fish farmers in Bantry Bay, Roaringwater Bay or Killary Harbour in the event of a disaster occurring, but it would never compensate for the damage such a disaster would cause to places like Garnish Island, the tourist industry and the fish farming industry in the long-term. In the short term, the fishermen would get a few bob and they would be happy for four or five years, but such a fund would not compensate for the damage that would be caused in the long term to our massively important fish exporting industry. Fishermen in our industry, whether it be from fish farms in west Cork or elsewhere, have won awards not only in Europe, but recently in America. This is an industry of which we are proud and I stated recently that BIM should retain control of it.A main concern is the environmental impact of a shipping disaster, in respect of which no fund  would fully compensate the next generation. We are obliged to protect our beautiful coastline. However, I have sad memories of the history of how we have dealt with the graveyard of vessels off the coast of west Cork during the past 20 years.The Minister said there were three importers in the State liable for contributions to the compensation fund and that they contributed €200,000 in 2000. He referred to the ESB, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation and Aughinish Alumina near the Shannon Estuary. Our largest oil reserves are stored in the facility on Whiddy Island, currently owned by Phillips Conoco. That company is probably one of the five largest oil exploration, shipping and refinery companies. The INPC sold the facility three years ago to Tosco, an Irish American owned group. We had great hopes for that company in Bantry. It had great plans. However, it saw a financial gain to be made and it sold the facility to Phillips Conoco. The company is engaged in the regular shipment of oil to and from Whiddy Island in Bantry Bay. Some of the tanks in that facility are full. There is no crude oil stored there; some of the oil there is semi-refined and some of it is bunker oil. Is that vastly wealthy company contributing to this compensation fund? I am not being narrow-minded in asking that question. Some 40 to 50 full-time workers are employed in the installation on Whiddy Island and long may that last. That company is an important employer. If that company is not contributing to this fund, I will raise the question again as to why it is not. I stand to be corrected that it is contributing.In regard to sea pollution and the establishment of a compensation fund, when the INPC owned the facility on Whiddy Island, a compensation fund was put in place following negotiations involving Cork County Council, the fishing industry and the semi-State company, INPC, to safeguard the then relatively infant fish farming industry, which included mussels, oysters, clams and shrimps. In the event of a disaster in the area, local fishermen would be compensated to the value of €5 million. Is that compensation fund still in place? If not, a compensation fund should be put in place in line with values in Europe in 2003. It should be index-linked and should be much greater than €5 million. That amount would be only peanuts in view of the fact that we are exporting €550 million worth of fish from that sector. This industry is of great importance and its value to the economy cannot be ignored.I note the Protocol to the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-operation. Are we in compliance with the provisions of that protocol? I understand there is an emergency response unit involving Cork County Council, given the history of incidents that have occurred in the Bantry Bay area. That unit should be monitored and updated. Many vessels are travelling to and from Bantry Bay and the Shannon Estuary. An emergency response  unit should be put in place that would be capable of adequately responding in the event of a marine disaster or one that involved the loss of human life.Reference was made to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage. Even though the Kowloon Bridge was a mammoth iron ore carrier, it carried many thousands of tonnes of bunker oil, which created another problem for us in the south west. The Minister mentioned the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems for Ships 2001 and the MARPOL Convention. These are very welcome. I am delighted that there is now within Europe for the first time in my memory a co-ordinated established approach to oil and sea pollution. Up to now there have been only bits and pieces of legislation. We were neglected for far too long. Now, particularly following the Erika incident and the most recent incident off the Spanish coastline, we are a European entity looking at the sea pollution problem where vessels occasionally, although hopefully less often now, carelessly discard bits and pieces overboard, which do not necessarily cause oil pollution. If one walks on some of our lovely beaches and strands on the south west coast in Kerry and Cork, one wonders from where all this rubbish comes. I have no doubt that some of it comes from the sea.Following the Erika incident, measures have been introduced or agreed in relation to ship classification societies. That is proper and correct. It should be internationally supported. The Bardini Reefer was abandoned and scuttled in Berehaven harbour. That happened not 50 years ago but in the recent past. It should not have happened. The Minister mentioned the accelerated phasing out of single hull oil tankers. This is not before time and I welcome it. He mentioned a strengthening of port-state control measures, which is also a very important issue. The loss of the Betelgeuse cost 50 lives, six of them local men, on 8 January 1979. That vessel had been rejected in a port, possibly in Spain or Portugal, but was accepted into Ireland. This recommendation is not before time. The Minister also mentioned ship reporting arrangements. The previous speaker mentioned that in his fishing experience he saw all these vessels, which I too have seen, passing our coastline. That situation, thankfully, has improved.I welcome this important legislation. It completes a legislative jigsaw puzzle. One Member said that Europe is leading the way, but we are part of a larger stakeholding. It is vital to realise that historically we have unhappy memories of sea pollution, of wrecks on our coastline, and that at one stage our south west coastline was a recognised graveyard for sea wrecks. I wish the legislation a speedy passage through the House. I acknowledge the significant cross-party support it received in the House today.

I am very disappointed that it must be implemented by 1 November. Deputy O'Donovan's referred to the great debate on this Bill in the Seanad and I welcome such a discussion. It is important that the Bill is implemented as soon as possible. However, I would like to know if other European parliaments have left it this late to introduce such legislation, which is of the utmost importance. I know everyone will get a chance to comment on the legislation, but I hate to see Bills rushed through the House to have them over and done with as soon as possible. Perhaps the civil servants might bring the Bill back to the Minister.Anything to do with pollution of our seas or coastline is of the utmost importance and should be at the top of the agenda. Deputy Connolly noted earlier the importance of preventing losses of sea life on our coasts. I have pointed out on other occasions that the fishing industry is hugely important, more so than is realised by the person in the street. Only those directly involved in the industry, whether they are boat owners or fish packers, know the importance of the industry. When one considers how much fish is consumed in restaurants, the results of oil pollution in Ireland would be terrible.We have seen oil pollution in countries such as Spain and France and on our own coastline over the years. Deputy O'Donovan spoke about the pollution in 1974 in County Cork. We see the massive clean-up operations necessary when oil pollution happens. I particularly recall the television images on Sky and CNN and other international channels. It is terrible to see oil and dead fish on coastlines.With the appearance of the Tánaiste in the Dáil, it is great to see someone getting a 50% increase in compensation. There are not too many people getting increases under this Government. Many Deputies on this side of the House will agree.This Bill is important in that those who suffer because of oil pollution will get increased compensation. When pollution takes place on any coastline, an instant action plan must be in place. When oil pollution occurs, time is crucial. Days and even hours can be important in saving fish life or the coastline, which is so important to us in Ireland.Deputies O'Donovan, Coveney and Broughan spoke about the importance of a towing tug. The Department or the Minister should prepare a plan so that within the next couple of years we have a towing tug ready if there is any major oil spillage or the sinking of a ship. We may rely on countries such as France or Spain to provide such a tug, but we may have to wait for it to arrive while pollution is taking place. If we had our own tug in place, less damage might be done to our sea life.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I wish to share my time with Deputies McHugh, Harkin, Twomey, Connolly, Sargent, Boyle, Morgan and Crowe.I move:That Dáil Éireann:–regrets the imprisonment of Deputy Joe Higgins and commends Deputy Higgins for his unswerving stand in the pursuit of equity in Irish society;–condemns this Government's lack of fairness and equity as seen in:–the cutbacks devastating community employment schemes throughout the country, undermining resource centres, crèches, after-school projects, services for the elderly and disabled, and voluntary groups working with the disadvantaged;–the deliberate and unjustifiable winding-down of the Whole Time Jobs Initiative resulting in the loss of important community services provided by the workers and their local organisations;–the removal of childcare allowances for participants in VTOS, Youthreach, and FÁS funded training schemes, preventing the most disadvantaged achieving second chance education;–calls for an end to cutbacks directed against the most vulnerable section of society; and–further condemns the parallel introduction of inequitable stealth taxes which disproportionately hurt the lower income groups.I unreservedly condemn the inappropriate and harsh prison sentences imposed on Deputy Joe Higgins, councillor Clare Daly and the 13 law-abiding citizens, including two mothers of babies and a grandmother, as a result of a peaceful protest in opposition to the bin tax which they regard as double taxation which disproportionately hurts lower income groups and against the inflammatory policy of non-collection of household waste from compliant PAYE taxpayers. I join the Dublin Council of Trade Unions in calling for an end to this inequitable tax and for the release of all peaceful protesters from Mountjoy Prison.While working class communities are being disproportionately hit by new stealth taxes, progressive measures like community employment schemes, jobs initiative and child care allowances for second chance education are being removed by this Government in a concerted and unfair attack on the most disadvantaged people. So far this year  more than 300 full-time jobs from the whole-time jobs initiative providing essential public services to local communities have been deliberately removed by this Government. These are real jobs providing services to the elderly, the disabled and in the area of child care in disadvantaged urban areas. We now know and have documentary evidence that the Cabinet committee on social inclusion and drugs chaired by the Taoiseach has decided to remove the remaining 2,200 JI jobs and a further 2,500 jobs from the social economy programme over the next 12 months. That is a scandalous decision by a sub-committee supposedly set up to tackle social disadvantage. Many of these workers who had been unemployed for more than five years and who had overcome great obstacles in their social circumstances to take on a full-time position, having worked successfully for more than six years are now told by this Government that they must go back on the dole.The manner in which these jobs have been and are being terminated is in many instances in breach of labour law and workers' rights, a matter which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions would do well to investigate. Added to the 5,000 CE workers removed from their jobs, this Government is shamefully putting 10,000 people back on the dole.
#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I, too, regret the imprisonment of Deputy Joe Higgins. Although I do not agree with his campaign, I respect his sincerity on the issue.I am glad of the opportunity to put on the record of this House the glaring fact that the cuts in community employment schemes are being implemented for one reason and one reason only, so that the books can be balanced, making the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, happy. There is no humanity involved in the decision to cut back CE schemes. No consideration is being given to the vulnerability of those involved or to the valuable work being done.In taking the decision to cut back CE schemes, the Government has identified vulnerable groups engaged in community work, sporting organisations and disability groups as easy targets. They have a poor voice and even if they protest, they will not be heard. That modus operandi reflects badly on a Government that likes to give the impression it is a caring Government. It could be more accurately described as a “don't care Government” on this issue.The Government does not care that those being hit by its cutbacks are in many cases disabled, lone parents or unemployed. It does not care that many of those laid off CE schemes are unlikely to be employed in the open market. It does not care that the work being carried out by the schemes under threat contributes enormously to towns and villages throughout the country. It does not care that sporting, disability and com munity groups will be severely affected by the cutbacks.Some regions have been cut back by 20% year-on-year for the past two years. That is a fact, not a figment of my imagination. What has that percentage cutback meant for Government? It means each vulnerable person laid off the community employment scheme has contributed €24.40 towards balancing the books of Government. A single person on CE receives €149.20. A person no longer participating in a CE scheme returns to the live register and receives €124.80 – a saving of €24.40 per person. Is €24.40 too much for the Government to spend to provide people with a sense of worth and dignity? Is it too much to spend so that disadvantaged communities can benefit from the labour of somebody otherwise unemployed? Is it too much to spend to enable voluntary organisations to continue their work? Is it too much to spend on an individual so that groups providing services to the disabled and others can continue their work?
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	459	This Private Members' motion is centred on the issue of equity and fairness in Irish society. I will concentrate on the failure of this Government to honour its commitment to mainstream health projects delivered under FÁS community employment schemes.Community employment has been used for many years as a stop-gap measure to deliver services to those with disabilities, special needs and the elderly. The Centres for Independent Living in Sligo and Leitrim and CLASP in Lough Arrow are just some examples of the projects affected in my constituency. Community employment schemes are now an integral part of service provision and communities and individuals in rural and urban areas rely heavily on them for the provision of basic services.However, the primary purpose of CE schemes is to progress participants into the open labour market. While CE was and still is a valuable support to local groups in the delivery of services, the proposal to mainstream those services through, for example, local health boards was a logical progression and was a reasonable mechanism whereby these valuable and vitally necessary services could be maintained in the local community. The services provided by CE schemes never made the headlines but they made a real difference to the lives of many people in all our communities. These services, including transport to visit a doctor or attend a clinic, meals on wheels, somebody to light the fire, respite care so that a carer could get a well-earned break, a personal assistant for a person with disability, peace of mind for a son or daughter who knew an elderly parent was visited when he or she was at work and independence for that elderly person, have contributed hugely to the quality of life of those who received them. Friendships were  made, trust was built and relationships were formed between those providing and those receiving the services.I have spoken to many people who expressed satisfaction with this service and who felt the Government was getting it right. In a quiet way some people's lives were changing for the better. Communities were supporting their own with full back-up from FÁS. Indeed, many communities have spoken highly of the efforts made by FÁS to support them and to be as flexible as possible within the parameters of the scheme. However, mainstreaming seems to have disappeared from the agenda. All of the high hopes and expectations have been dashed because the Department totally underestimated the cost of the move, which aside from anything else, indicates its ignorance about the value of the services provided.Last week, the Comptroller and Auditor General detailed the unbelievable waste of public money – in excess of tens of millions of euro – in just one year. Yet, the plug was pulled on investing money in health related projects and supplying a service for those who need it. We were told it could not be done because it would cost too much. However, it can be done and it is not too late for the Government to do the right thing. It should put in place an interim arrangement where this type of community employment scheme can maintain its status as of 1 January 2003. That does not mean ring-fencing numbers, but personnel. People are what matter. While this interim arrangement is in place, the Government should re-negotiate and honour its commitments.We have recently heard a great deal about the fact that there is more to do. The Government can do more, but it should act in a spirit of equity and fairness. It needs to do more right now.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	460	Only last night, large numbers of adults and children received certificates for computer training in my local parish of Tagoat, County Wexford. The training was provided by a supervisor on one of the local community employment schemes in her spare time. The presentations were made at a place called Yola farm, on the side of the N25, which is a local tourism attraction. It would not have been possible without three vital ingredients – funding from the Government, a massive local voluntary effort and the continuation of community employment and FÁS schemes.Many communities across the country are driving these schemes, which have greatly contributed to people's quality of life, forward. While we have all benefited from these schemes, the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged have benefited most. It is difficult to put a figure on the social capital of the schemes, while the physical environment of many villages and towns have been altered for the better.Many of the participants in these schemes have been given a chance they might not otherwise have had. Many have been long-term unemployed and some had mental health problems, which resulted in employers deeming them to be unemployable. It has often been the case that participants on such schemes, be they FÁS or community employment, have acquired the confidence and courage to get a job. Many have been successful and we must recognise and encourage this.Many Deputies express concern about issues such as health, education and crime. The schemes are an important part of the social fabric and they help to contribute to social equality. Successful economic and business policies are needed to fund aspects of them.It is important we all recognise how much the schemes contribute to every parish in the country. Last night, the Taoiseach said Fianna Fáil has a presence in 3,000 parishes across the country. These schemes are also present in these parishes. They have made a massive contribution and we must ensure their essential elements are maintained so that they continue to help those in need.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I support the motion. The Government introduced the social employment schemes in the early 1990s to facilitate the reintroduction of the unemployed to the workforce. Initially, people may have been sceptical about participating in a jobs or FÁS scheme and may have worried about the impact on their sense of status. However, these schemes removed people from the black economy and allowed them to work with dignity and pursue training.At the request of FÁS, the local authorities sponsored these schemes and saw their sponsorship as an extension of their community development role. The guiding principle of their involvement was that of empowerment of local groups, helping them to take responsibility and have pride in their areas. That has largely worked successfully. Some groups benefited enormously from taking control and responsibility and for running their own schemes, both developmentally and financially. They were good for their areas.Regrettably, in recent years there have been drastic cutbacks in the funding of these schemes. Participation rates have dropped from a high of 35,000 to approximately 20,000. This was done ostensibly on the basis that, as the Celtic tiger economy was taking care of everything, there was no longer a need for community employment schemes. The Celtic tiger economy is well gone and it must also be asked if it had any impact on certain parts of rural Ireland. While that is another debate, it is no longer valid to offer the excuse of the Celtic tiger economy for implementing cutbacks in this area.Last weekend, suggestions were made about restructuring the funding for these schemes. I hope this means the Government is quietly acknowledging the folly of its action in cutting them. I ask it to reconsider the benefits they have brought to rural Ireland, which are evident in local communities, local housing developments, schools, graveyards and across local services, such as meals on wheels and learning disability services. Such has been their success that people have received invaluable training and become an indispensable part of the community and the workforce.The present difficulties have arisen more from lack of foresight than scarcity of money. There are no major savings from implementing cutbacks in this area. Furthermore, it is impossible to put a price on personal dignity. Providing people with a job at a cost of €25 per week gives dignity to them and the society of which we are all part. The cutbacks to these schemes will place people at a higher risk of exclusion from society. When people are out of the jobs market, it is much more difficult for them to return to employment. They have no stepping stone back into society. Job applicants who indicate they are unemployed will suffer discrimination.The Government is in breach of its commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness that it would not reduce the numbers on community employment schemes below 25,000. When it reneged on its commitment there was no consultation with the social partners. The cutbacks impact on people and their local communities, especially those who are unemployed. They are the victims. In addition, many of the services provided by local communities and organisations depend on community employment sponsorship. Cutbacks tear the hearts out of communities. I hope they have stopped and the schemes will be rebuilt.The Government is more concerned with looking after the well-off than taking action to ensure there is a more just society. The community employment schemes were instrumental in gainfully engaging people while instilling in them a sense of self-worth and belief. This loss to the community will have catastrophic effects and it will be replaced by anger, frustration and despair, which breed violence and anti-social behaviour and lead to fragmentation of the community. I ask the Government to take on board restructuring so that people can be given their lives back and communities can be given jobs back.

We have our differences with the Socialist Party but the jailing of members of the anti-bin tax campaign has been completely over the top. This also highlights the Government's regrettable double standards whereby the threat to flout a court order is met with a prison  sentence for Deputy Joe Higgins and even calls for his resignation by Government parties, whereas when Deputy Parlon threatened to flout a court order relating to meat factories when he was leader of the IFA, he was not jailed and subsequently was appointed Minister of State. This is quite a contrast in terms of judicial equity and social justice.

The life of an anti-bin tax campaigner was endangered by a waste truck driver. I urge the Government to intervene to restore calm on this issue.The Green Party supports a reasonable fiscal incentive to avoid waste and misuse of resources. We oppose a flat charge for waste collection as it is inequitable and offers no incentive. I was the first Member to call for a levy on plastic bags in 1994. It took a long time for such a levy to be introduced but it has worked because it involves a reasonable cost and alternatives are available. I do not support Repak's work as it is not tackling the main waste problem. As a result, waste volumes are increasing with bottle banks and bring centres overflowing. The general feeling is the Government does not care or is not using its power.Sections 28 and 29 of the Waste Management Act 1996 state that the Minister can specify requirements to be complied with in respect of the nature, composition and design of packaging and the use of packaging, the prohibition of waste and the limitation and control in a specified manner of the importation, distribution, supply or sale of packaging. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government chooses not to use many powers in the Act and, as a result, there is a laissez-faire attitude to waste. All of us face a crisis because of Government inaction.The failure to grasp basic social and environmental equity issues is evident in the Government's belief in the trickle down effect in the economy. Since 1960 the gap between rich and poor has widened worldwide. The top 20% of the world's population was 20 times richer than the bottom 20% in 1960 while it is now 75 times richer according to the UN. In 1994 15% of our population lived in relative poverty but that has increased to 22%. Social inequity has worsened and it has been exacerbated by cutbacks of between 4% and 5% over two years on CE schemes, for example. That is having an enormous knock-on effect in terms of alienation and social inequity. However, it is a false economy.Sonairte, the ecology centre, ironically located in the Minister for Education and Science's con stituency, was in an ideal position, running 70 CE schemes. The centre was progressing well from an educational point of view but it has had the legs cut from under it. Ringcommon sports centre in Balbriggan is the only sports facility in the area and it is facing closure because of CE cutbacks. Wages for CE participants at the Bremore Castle scheme run by Fingal County Council were also cut and FÁS has been unable to support the scheme because of cutbacks. These will have short-term as well as long-term effects on the local economy. The cutbacks should be reversed.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	466	My employment prior to being elected was as a community employment supervisor of a number of arts based groups in Cork city. I witnessed, even at that remove, the beginning of the campaign of cutbacks and the effects they were having on many organisations in the Cork region. I pointed out in my maiden speech on the opening day of this Dáil that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment was in error in continuing with these cuts. I am disappointed she has maintained that policy and remains oblivious to the effects these cuts are having.I have come into possession of a report by senior officials to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion, which is not available to Members. However, the report should be made available because it outlines Government thinking in this area and provides a useful overview of who is involved in community employment schemes and why. For instance, almost 30% of participants are aged over 50 while lone parents comprise the largest category of participants, almost 25% of the total. The Minister's concern for lone parents is on record. More than 50% of participants – 12,500 – are engaged in community work while almost 5,000 people are engaged in environmental projects. These categories of work do not fit the Minister's agenda and that is one of the motivations behind reducing the number of participants from 30,000 to 20,000.The report of the senior officials proposes that the 8,000 places on the jobs initiative and social employment schemes should be phased out and 20,000 CE places should be maintained. Two options are available in this regard. A total of 18,000 places will be available, with an additional 2,000 for those aged over 55, or 20,000 places together with the extra 2,000 places. The report also proposes that not only should numbers be restricted to this level, but the hours worked should be extended from 19.5 to 30. CE participants who receive a similar payment to social welfare recipients will be asked to work 75% of the average working week. I would be surprised if the social partners support such a proposal but if this defines Government thinking, we face serious problems.Previous speakers have mentioned the physical effects of the changes in CE. Participants fill the gap created by a lack of voluntary activity in society because of changes in family and working lives. CE gives people satisfaction and dignity and it provides a pay-off to community and society, which the Government does not acknowledge because it does not recognise the concept of society as much as Margaret Thatcher did.These false economies will result in additional costs to the health service and local government services and ultimately a saving of €8 million for every 6,000 places lost, according to the report. It is a cost that will be far higher to our economy because the value added to society and the economy by those who participate in community employment, job initiative and social employment schemes is not being measured at present. I ask the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, to indicate that this does not constitute Government policy. The Government should be prepared not only to reverse the CE cuts that have been made, but also to increase the number of CE places. The fact that Irish society needs an army of people to provide social services should be recognised. The Government is unable and unwilling to provide such services.I will conclude by pointing out that Denmark, a country with a similar population to that of Ireland, provides €1.5 billion for active labour measures each year. The Government spends €332 million on community employment at present, but it wants to reduce that figure to €275 million. It is a damning indictment of the Government's consideration of community employment, as well as its view of what it can become.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	467	Sinn Féin condemns the imprisonment of all protesters against the bin taxes and calls for their immediate release. All 15 protesters who are in jail, including two elected representatives, two mothers, a baby and even a grandmother, should be released immediately. They have been imprisoned because they engaged in a peaceful protest of civil disobedience. I understood that peaceful protest was the hallmark of a civilised society.Sinn Féin is entirely opposed to the introduction of bin taxes because they are inequitable. This mess came about because local democracy was overturned. When a number of councillors refused to adopt unjust taxes, the law was changed to allow county managers to provide for such taxes.The destruction of local democracy can also be seen in the introduction of development plans and waste management plans that will allow for the introduction of incinerators across the State. When a host of local authorities refused to adopt waste management plans because they included the option of incineration, the Statute Book was  reached for and the law was changed. Local democracy was stood on its head. We have been told that local democracy is fine as long as local representatives vote in the right way and do the right thing. When local representatives exercised their democratic rights regarding waste management, this Government and its immediate predecessor reached for the Statute Book.It is important to point out that the opposition to what is seen as an unfair and inequitable tax is very sincere. The protests should not be seen as negative, as the protesters are defending public services and opposing the privatisation agenda. The refuse collection service has been privatised in many parts of the State. One should not doubt that all elements of the public service at local government level, including sewerage and water services and road maintenance and construction, will be privatised as well. Is that what we want for the State? Is that how we want to proceed? How can one expect people to comply with bad laws that are made by politicians who say one thing while doing another? If one examines places where charges have been introduced, one sees that the privatisation of refuse collection has resulted in all cases.I condemn the suspension of workers who refuse to pass pickets. Sinn Féin supports those bin workers who have taken the decision to collect all waste. The campaign is not directed at decent workers who deserve and will receive our respect. Managers who behave as if they are back in 1913 by suspending workers will get us nowhere. There has been direct contact between my party and unions and workers, many of whom feel that their jobs are threatened by the privatisation agenda, which is what this project is really about.What is the reason for the reductions in community employment schemes, which are also mentioned in this motion? They will push people into low-paid jobs where they will be more easy cannon fodder for multinational companies. Those on CE schemes had the comradeship of their peers and the comfort of some caring colleagues. This was essential for people with significant literacy and other difficulties. Essential services in communities, including child care, support for the elderly, youth services and services for disabled people, are being devastated. The Government should be providing such services, but it has abdicated its responsibilities in that regard. Communities have taken on such duties. The role of the Government in providing essential services that should be provided by the State has been done by the community and voluntary sector for far too long. The pittance that is Government assistance to such vital organisations is being reduced.Many people who have moved successfully from community employment to full-time employment have made an invaluable contribution to the economy. I do not doubt that many  Members are personally acquainted with such people. I know many of them and I am sure my colleagues could give similar testimony to my own. The promised mainstreaming of many services, which was due to commence in the second quarter of last year, has not materialised. I ask the Minister to clarify whether the promised mainstreaming of services, especially those for the disabled and the elderly, will proceed. If it will go ahead, when will it happen? We all know that elderly people are managing badly in many cases. Many of them are suffering greatly as a result of the harsh cutbacks. Sinn Féin agrees that the mechanism for providing many of these services is not the best. We agree that many of them should be mainstreamed. However, there should be no reduction in services until mainstreaming has been put in place. The Government's reductions in support services for unemployed people, who are trying to get back into the labour market, are completely inappropriate in light of the increasing numbers of redundancies in the last year.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The communities of many Deputies who will speak on this motion are being savaged by the cuts in community employment. I spoke yesterday to someone in Bawnogue community centre in the Dublin Mid-West constituency, which was recently opened by the Minister. I was told that it looks like the community centre might close as a result of cutbacks in community employment services. The Minister might be familiar with that example, but other speakers have mentioned the reductions in meals on wheels, services for the elderly, community training, disabled and women's groups, youth groups, carer's services, etc. When their backs are to the wall, members of Fianna Fáil resort to blaming the cutbacks on the Progressive Democrats element of the Government. We are told that the situation is under review, so that when one tries to explain the effect of the reductions on one's group, one is told that the matter is being looked after. The reality, however, is that something that is "under review" is something that has been put on hold. Nothing seems to be happening and services and schemes are closing down in the meantime.Many people who have worked on a voluntary basis in their own communities for many years have witnessed the devastation of services in the last two years. A number of issues were highlighted at a recent meeting in Tallaght, to which elected representatives were invited. The fact that the unemployment level in the area is above average was mentioned. A number of long-term employers in the area have closed down. It is bizarre that training schemes are closing down at the same time. The Ciscom group, which has trained thousands of people, depended on CE to get its training programmes up and running. It will close as a consequence of the cutbacks in ser vices. A community centre that employed 17 people at one time now employs one person on JI and one person on CE. This is seen as an attack on the community itself. More than 16,500 community employment places have been cut since 1999.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	469	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"– calls on Members of the House to fully respect the laws enacted by the Oireachtas and to respect the institutions of the State;– notes the significant reductions in unemployment and poverty since 1997;– acknowledges the valuable contribution which community employment, the job initiative programme and other labour market measures have made to reducing long-term unemployment in recent years;– recognises the important contribution that community employment and the job initiative programme have made to services for local community groups and organisations throughout the country;– notes the ongoing restructuring of community employment designed to maintain an adequate number of places in the context of the much improved labour market for job seekers;– notes that a number of reviews in relation to community employment and the job initiative programme are currently nearing completion and that a decision on the future funding and structure of these programmes will be taken in the context of the Estimates provision for 2004, having regard to the outcome of the current review process; and– commends the Government for ensuring that the tax burden on low income workers is the lowest in the EU and that maintaining this is essential to maintaining a low level of unemployment."I wish to share my time with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley.I thank the Independent Deputies for tabling this motion. Many aspects of the motion refer to legitimate policy issues but it has another aspect to which I was surprised to see so many Members of this House were prepared to sign their names. I will deal with that in a moment. The motion  clearly has the support of Sinn Féin and the Green Party.The motion is wide ranging. The community employment programme, which figures strongly in the motion and in the contributions made by most of the Deputies who have spoken, falls within the remit of my Department. I begin by knocking a myth on the head. Since 1997, when I was given responsibility for the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the budget for FÁS has doubled. Almost the only option for people who were unemployed, lone parents and others in the 1990s, when the economy was growing, was a community employment scheme. They had no option of being trained for anything that could give them a decent standard of living. It is untrue to say that less money is being spent on labour market intervention. This year we will spend close to €850 million on labour market interventions through community employment and training. That is a substantial resource in an economy which has an employment rate of 4.4%.Community employment, which succeeded social employment, was introduced at a time when the economy had 17% unemployment, mass emigration and no opportunities. It was introduced to provide opportunities for the huge numbers of people who were long-term unemployed and to provide transitional arrangements to help people to move from unemployment into work. When community employment was first introduced there was one CE place for every six long-term unemployed people. In 1997, when I took over at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, we had 40,000 on community employment schemes and more than 90,000 long-term unemployed. Today, long-term unemployment is down to 26,000. One has to respond to circumstances as they change and it would irresponsible of the Government not to respond to the situation that has emerged. Community employment was set up to deal with a problem which has almost been solved.Notwithstanding the fact that the unemployment situtation has changed substantially, we remain committed to supporting community employment, both as a measure to help people progress from unemployment into work and as an essential support for community services and social services on the ground. That is why, this year, there will be an average of 25,000 people on community employment and job initiative schemes. While, in some circumstances, the additional amount of money someone receives by going from unemployment benefit to an employment scheme is as little as €20, the average payment to people on community employment is €12,000 and not the sum of money mentioned earlier.More than 6,000 of the people on community employment are lone parents and for them the payment is substantially higher. Because of initiatives introduced in recent years different people receive different rates. The average payment to someone on the job initiative scheme is in the region of €19,000. That scheme was introduced by the rainbow Government between 1994 and 1997. It was recognised that many long-term unemployed people were not moving into work, nothwithstanding the jobs that were being created in the economy, and this was introduced as a more intensive employment scheme for a three year period. Many people have been on the scheme for eight years because I made the decision some years ago not to enforce the three year limit strictly. That, too, has its implications because when one does not enforce a limit one does not provide the opportunities for others to move in and move on.Notwithstanding what has been happening in the economy we have prioritised certain areas for community employment. There are approximately 5,000 CE schemes in RAPID areas, for example. Child care, health care services, personal assistants and others have been priorities. Recently we introduced more flexibility in relation to personal assistants because I recognise that someone who has had a personal assistant for a couple of years forms a close relationship with that person and may find it difficult to develop a relationship with someone else. We need flexibility in relation to those matters. We have also prioritised drugs task force activities. These areas have been prioritised because they are priorities in our communities. One can never have enough money to do everything. I seek to ensure that we chose strategic priorities that can help the country.I am conscious that a large number of people come to work in Ireland. It is estimated that 100,000 foreign workers are working in our economy. Almost 40,000 permits have been granted this year to people from outside the European Economic Area. Others, such as nurses, have come on work authorisations and many others come from the European Economic Area where no authorisation is required. The economy is generating the kind of employment opportunities of which many of us never dreamed. Ten years ago did any Member think we would ever be importing so much labour into this economy and that it could generate the kind of opportunities that would attract so many to our shores?A review of the community employment programme is under way. It was restructured in 1999 with the support of the Government in light of the changing circumstances and the priority areas I mentioned were earmarked at that time. We are looking further at the programme to see how we can make it more attractive as a measure to progress people into real jobs in the economy. We  all acknowledge that people, particularly young people, have better opportunities in real jobs. That is always a challenge. Many argue that we should keep the existing cohort of individuals on community employment and we have made exceptions in particular circumstances where the strict deadline has not always been applied. However, where we do that fewer opportunities are provided for others to move in.Discussions on the Estimates are currently under way with the Department of Finance and they will be published in November. Although next year will be another tough year I am confident that we will be in a position to have a substantial and comprehensive community employment programme. At the end of this year almost 25,000 people will be employed on community employment schemes, the social economy and the job initiative programme and we will have had an average of 25,000 on job initiative and community employment schemes for the entire year. That is a huge resource in addition to all the other community supports.We have mainstreamed positions in schools. It was unsatisfactory that as the beginning of the school year approached schools did not know if they would have caretakers, teaching assistants and so on. Initially mainstreaming was more expensive for schools but, more significantly, when given the choice schools generally did not employ those who had been involved in community employment schemes but made other choices. Concerns were expressed about that from Deputies from all sides of the House. Only today an Opposition Deputy spoke to me about this very matter. Sometimes when one mainstreams the people one wishes to help do not necessarily get the positions but, for a host of reasons, others are chosen. It is also much more expensive to mainstream activities which had previously been provided through community employment.The Opposition motion commends Deputy Joe Higgins for "his unswerving stand in the pursuit of equity in Irish society". I notice that a majority of those who signed the motion represent constituencies where people have been paying refuse collection charges for a considerable time. Charges appear to have become a big issue only when they were applied in Dublin. I say this as a Dublin Deputy. People in Cavan, Monaghan, Wexford and many other places have been paying these charges for a considerable time. I salute Deputy Gregory and others from the Dublin wing of the Independent group for managing to get their rural colleagues to protest against something their own constituents have been paying for a long time. Is it any wonder people in other parts of the country say things are unfair?

They are asking us to commend Deputy Higgins's activity in encouraging people in Fingal not to pay their refuse collection charges, which were approved by the democratically elected local council.Deputy Higgins tried to prevent council workers from going about their legal duties and sought to prevent householders who had paid their charges from having their refuse collected. When ordered by the High Court to desist from these activities, he defied it. I see little to commend in anybody who engages in this kind of behaviour. We are all legislators in this House and we are put here by the people to enact laws and expected by them to abide by those laws. Nobody has been imprisoned for peaceful protest. Clearly, they have been imprisoned for defying High Court orders.Democracy is not an à  la carte menu. One cannot decide to pay the taxes and charges one likes and to evade the ones one does not like. What if Deputy Higgins takes a dislike to other public charges and levies or decides that people should not pay their television licence fee? What if he decides that people should not pay their gas or electricity bills? If we were to go down this road we would be writing a recipe for anarchy. As elected politicians, it behoves all of us to act responsibly and to be honest with those we represent. Public services have to be paid for. To pretend otherwise is nothing but political opportunism and grandstanding of the worst kind.I have no doubt that Deputy Higgins has his own good reasons for taking the action which has landed him in his present predicament. His fans have been following me for the past few weeks. They were in UCD yesterday and in Bawnogue a few weeks ago. They are very committed to the Deputy and maybe he is very lucky to have them because they travel further than most of our pol itical fans. Furthermore, they are louder than most when making their point. I have no problem with this in the main as they are engaging in peaceful protest.The State is governed by majority vote in a democratically elected Parliament, not by the views of a single Deputy. If one substituted the phrase "income tax" for "bin tax" in this debate, I wonder how many Deputies would be cheerleading for Joe Higgins and his campaign.

It is ironic that an organisation that calls itself the Socialist Party now seeks to undermine the very concept of civic responsibility at local level. The refuse charges campaign has for long sought political cover as some form of tax reform movement. Its slogan has been, "No double taxation". This is entirely spurious. The tax system has been transformed. The PAYE sector has enjoyed very significant tax relief over the past six budgets. Statistics show that, after the last budget, some 680,000 earners are entirely exempt from income tax, which represents 36% of all the people on the tax file.This brings me to the charges in the motion regarding fairness and equity and the impact of Government policies on the lower paid. There is a notion that the coalition Government took power back in 1997 with the intention of robbing the poor in order to give to the rich. In this simple world of cartoon-strip politics, there are good guys and bad guys. The good guys – they are all on the left – are the only ones who care about the lower paid and the less well-off. The bad guys – they are all on the Government side – do not care at all about the lower paid and devote all their energies to helping the rich.

I am proud of the fact that we brought in the minimum wage.If the simple world of cartoon-strip politics I described was accurate, it would mean the Government was not just bad but mad. It is difficult to see how any administration in a functioning democracy could ever hope to succeed with such a policy.They say one should never let the facts get in the way of a good argument but I intend to give the House some facts. I intend to show what has been achieved in terms of tax equity over the past six years. We sometimes tend to live in a little world of our own in this country, blissfully unaware of what is happening elsewhere in Europe or of how other people see us. EUROSTAT recently published a comprehensive analysis of the tax treatment of lower-paid workers across the European Union. Specifically, it compared the tax rates for single persons earning two thirds of the average production wage in each country for the year 2001. The findings were interesting. The tax rate was 45% in Germany, 47% in Sweden and a whopping 49% in Belgium. These states are often held up as role models in social equity by left-wing commentators. The country that came out best in the EUROSTAT analysis was Ireland. We had the lowest rate of taxation for lower-paid workers of any country in the Union. With a tax rate of just 17%, we were way below every other member state. I prefer to regard this as evidence of Ireland being way ahead in its commitment to tax reform, lower-paid workers and real social justice. Some marvel at why, despite the international downturn, Ireland remains at or near full employment while other countries struggle with the effects of mass  unemployment. The EUROSTAT figures answer this.A similar picture is painted in a comparative study by the OECD which examined the direct tax burden of typical industrial workers with families. The tax burden was over 20% in Sweden, Belgium and Germany and was as high as 30% in Denmark. The direct tax burden on the average industrial worker with a family was lowest of all in Ireland. In fact, it was negative. In other words, when our very generous child benefit payments are taken into account, the typical industrial worker with a family is actually a net recipient of cash from the State.These are very significant achievements. They put us at the right end of the international league tables and show that the reform measures introduced by the Government over the past six years have had real effect. As leader of the Progressive Democrats and as deputy leader of the Government, I assure the House that my party and the Administration yield to no one in their commitment to social justice and fair taxation. It is a sad reflection on the left that its main political campaign is to ensure that the people of Castleknock do not have to pay refuse charges.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	496	The polluter pays principle is widely accepted not just around Europe but around Ireland. People recognise that waste collection is an essential public service and that it has to be paid for. They also recognise they should pay in line with the amount of waste they produce.Politics is essentially about the interplay of ideas, the competition between differing views of the world and different approaches to economic management. Throughout the developed world, the great battle of ideas is essentially between leftism and liberalism. Leftism is losing that battle all over the free world now and it is certainly doing so in Ireland.Irish success has been built almost entirely on the application of sound liberal values. We have reduced taxes on enterprise, investment and employment. We have opened markets to competition and reduced the role of the State in the economy. The net effect of these policies has been spectacularly positive. We have ended emigration, moved to full employment and achieved the effective elimination of long-term joblessness. We have used the proceeds of this economic growth to invest in new infrastructure, to fund better public services and to pay for huge increases in social supports for the less well-off in Irish society.We take it for granted that the old-age pension is worth €157 per week and it is hard to believe it was worth only €99 six years ago. We take it for granted that child benefit is worth €125 per month, although it was worth only €38 when the  Government took office. We also take it for granted that the respite grant for carers stands at €735 per year and it is hard to believe it did not exist some years ago. This success was achieved by giving the people the freedom to achieve their full potential and live and work in their own country.This progress was not achieved by taking the country up the political cul-de-sacs favoured by left-wing parties. We did not achieve success by nationalising companies, setting up hare-brained ventures such as the National Development Corporation or raising taxes to penalise personal progress. It is difficult to find any left-wing idea which has contributed anything to our social and economic prosperity in recent times. While left-wing politicians may have contributed something, left-wing politics has contributed nothing.Deputy Joe Higgins seeks to lead the left into the wilderness of waste charge campaigning. Deputy Rabbitte, on the other hand, seeks to lead the left in the opposite direction and I wish him well in that regard. Social justice is about lifting people out of poverty and giving people opportunities and a real stake in society, which we have done. We have successfully tackled the problem of mass unemployment and moved tens of thousands of people out of long-term unemployment and into new and worthwhile jobs.The key to this has been the low tax model of economic management pursued by this Government since 1997. Our approach is working for the people. It will keep the country at full employment, secure our future and do more to promote real social justice than any amount of opportunistic grandstanding by publicity-hungry politicians in relation to charges which have been democratically—

I have tried but it is difficult. Although he has made several speeches on the topic in recent years inside and outside this House, it is difficult to make any coherent sense of them. He is opposed to landfills  on the basis that local communities do not like them, incinerators on the grounds that they are unhealthy, private waste collection because it is profiteering and domestic waste charges because he regards them as double taxation. He has also voiced his opposition to the introduction of a 15 cent tax on plastic bags on the basis that it was, in his words, an unimaginative proposal.

I fail to understand how anybody could regard a simple 15 cent levy on a plastic bag as inequitable. Perhaps the Opposition Deputies could explain. The approach adopted by Deputy Joe Higgins offers no basis for the formation of a sound public policy in the area of waste management. I do not believe he was ever interested in making any serious contribution to the waste management debate. Rather, the whole campaign he and his allies in the Socialist Party have mounted has a great deal more to do with vote management than waste management.Democracy is all about rights and responsibilities. All of us in politics have the right to put our policies before the people, seek support for them and, if successful, implement them in Government. Equally, we have responsibilities, above all, to respect the view of the majority and abide by it, as it is reflected in legislation passed by the Oireachtas and financial motions passed by duly elected local authorities. All of us who hold elected office have to bite our lips from time to time when the Government of the day or the local council makes a decision with which we do not agree. Democracy works on the basis that we accept such decisions whether or not we like them, but breaks down if elected politicians refuse to abide by the basic rules of the game and set out deliberately to obstruct the implementation of democratic decisions, which is what Deputy Joe Higgins is doing. It is wrong and indefensible and I am surprised his actions should merit any support in the House, not to speak of the tabling of a full-scale motion of commendation.The House will be aware that the anti-charges campaign earlier today mounted pickets on council depots in the Dublin area and stopped refuse collection crews from going about their business. As a result, some 12,000 households in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown Council area had no waste collection service today. This is nothing less than a deliberate attempt by the Socialist Party to prevent ordinary working people from doing their jobs, householders from having their waste  collected and democratically made decisions from being implemented. I ask the Deputies who tabled this motion to think seriously about the action they are taking.Deputy Joe Higgins was booted out of the Labour Party because it could no longer stand him and his tactics. Like any decent political party it was not prepared to be dictated to by one idiosyncratic individual. All the parties in this House aspire to be in Government at some stage, to influence public policy and have their say in how the country should be run. Even the Independent Deputies, as recent experience has shown, can have an influence on Government formation and direction. What is the point of it all if a single Deputy can walk out of the House, turn up his nose at the rest of us and attempt to force his views on everybody?Deputy Joe Higgins and his supporters will not bring waste collection to a halt in this city or State. This simply cannot be allowed to happen and, as democrats, all Members should be giving clear leadership to the people. We all accept the polluter pays principle, that services have to be paid for and that special measures have to be put in place to help the less well-off. We cannot abandon all this in the face of bully-boy tactics from a single Deputy. It is hardly surprising that Deputy Joe Higgins is supported in his campaign by Sinn Féin, a party which has not been noted for its respect for the institutions of the State, its courts or police force.Refuse charges are collected by every council and there is fairly widespread public acceptance of the need for them, a reflection of the growing level of environmental awareness. There is an increasing movement towards pay-by-weight and pay-per-bag systems, which is a positive development as it gives much better effect to the polluter pays principle than the flat charge systems operated until now by most local authorities. Our waste management policy is moving in the right direction. While we are a long way behind the rest of Europe in terms of recycling and reuse, we are making progress. In my county, Limerick, we have made considerable progress in recent years. The same is true to varying degrees in most other areas.The future direction of public policy is clear. Recycling will increase, waste volumes going for final disposal will decrease and we will gradually fall into line with standard practice on the Continent, which is a long way ahead of us in the area of waste management. What we cannot afford is to reverse course at this stage. It has taken us several years to progress to the point where we have waste management plans and a coherent national waste management strategy. We cannot tell people that we are abandoning the polluter pays principle and they can produce as much waste as they like without any penalty as it would  throw our waste management policy into chaos and cause major difficulties for local authorities.There are now about 1.3 million households and the number is increasing with 50,000 to 60,000 new houses being built each year. The vast majority of households are complying with the law and paying the proper charges to have their waste collected. If collection charges are abandoned, we will see waste volumes rise and waste collection and disposal costs increase. Central government will be left with a hole of several hundred million euro a year to plug. Neither Deputy Joe Higgins nor his Socialist Party friends have come forward with any workable proposals as to how such a revenue shortfall might be met. If he is serious about his politics, he should level with people and say from where this money will come.No self respecting Member of the House can support this motion. It is fair enough for Opposition Deputies to attack the Government for its economic policies; that is part of the normal cut and thrust of politics. However, it is different for the House publicly and formally to commend one of its Members for defying the High Court in pursuit of political advantage.

#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I will discuss the community employment aspect of this motion. Community employment schemes have in the past made a huge contribution to people's lives through a wide range of services in health, education and the environment. The cuts in the past 18 months have had a devastating effect on the participants who lost their places on these schemes as well as making it impossible for voluntary groups to deliver services such as child care, care for the elderly and community environmental works.The Minister continually claims that many of the services provided through community employment schemes in the education sector have been mainstreamed into the education budget. The budget has been transferred from FÁS and some semblance of a similar service is provided. However, the new system is not as effective or flexible as when it was administered by the community in co-operation with the schools. Similarly, the mainstreaming of CE schemes into health and child care services is far from satisfactory. The money transferred from FÁS is lost in an already underfunded health and child care service. The value for money concept was better served by community employment schemes in these areas. Far from costing money, with a little restructuring they could have continued to offer worthwhile employment while providing excellent social services cost effectively.The Minister argued, correctly, that retraining for full-time employment should be the primary concern and objective of CE schemes. This should continue to be the main focus, particularly for young participants. However, regardless of whether the Minister acknowledges it, a substantial number of current and former participants will find it impossible to obtain positions in mainstream employment. Most of the people affected are over 50 years of age or are lone parents, people with disabilities or widows. The vast majority of the people in these categories find themselves back on the live register. All of them would be willing to participate in some type of social community scheme that would give them the dignity of a job and give their communities and neighbours invaluable support and services.Fine Gael has constantly advocated the establishment of a type of social employment scheme in conjunction with the community employment schemes which would be more suitable for both the participants and the communities they serve. We are told by the Minister that FÁS has been carrying out a review for the last 18 months. At our meetings with FÁS we have advocated this dual approach: community employment schemes which continue to focus on training and social employment schemes which are employment orientated towards the needs of community groups.In reply to a parliamentary question earlier this year, the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, assured me that an appraisal of the active labour market programme was under way and would re-orientate these programmes to target more effectively the needs of the disadvantaged groups, such as older groups, pensioners and people with disabilities. He said he had begun discussions with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on future options for older workers on the employment schemes. He assured the House that the labour market programmes would no longer be the only policy area, as this review would for the first time examine the potential for community employment schemes to provide a proper community service on a long-term basis.When pressed as to when this review would be completed and when there would be decisions and results, the Minister assured the House that by the time of the Estimates he expected to be in a position to have a new and effective community employment scheme in place. We are fast approaching that time. Will the Minister honour the commitments made to the House or are they just a continuing deception of the electorate, such as this Government practised during and since the last election?The major area that has never been addressed properly is the work being done by CE schemes in environmental projects in towns and villages, in Tidy Towns projects and in leisure facilities. Over the last ten years enormous amounts of  money were given to community councils to develop badly needed facilities. These projects are now at risk of falling into decay and ruin because there is no longer the possibility of servicing them adequately through community employment schemes. The Government has failed to set up any alternative.The Tánaiste said in a speech to the House earlier this year that the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, had been given responsibility for community services and that she shortly hoped to discuss with him the role that mainstreaming CE could play in supporting worthwhile activities. Nine months later one must ask what is meant by "shortly" and when the Minister's commitment will materialise. While the commitment by the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, might be possible to fulfil during the Estimates process, it is impossible for the Tánaiste to honour her commitment to mainstream the environmental schemes into any worthwhile organisation.The only organisation that could cope with this is local government, but we are well aware of its financial situation at present. As a result of the activities of this Government, its inaction, its refusal to finance local government properly and to compensate local authorities for benchmarking, every local authority is bankrupt. Mainstreaming the small amount of money from FÁS into local authorities to develop environmental schemes at this point would be ludicrous.The scheme is a shambles. Not only did the Ministers deceive the electorate before the last election but they blatantly continue to do so and to ignore clear commitments given over the last 18 months in the House.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	508	I will start with the lecture we were given by the Progressive Democrats a short time ago. The Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, failed to tell the House about the fastest growing industry in Ireland, which is the consultancy industry. One million euro per week or €200,000 per day is spent on consultants and consultants' reports. The Department of Agriculture and Food last year spent €13,700,000. It was €3 million over budget. That is just the Departments. Look at the county councils and one will find another layer of consultants. It is the fastest growing industry. It is no wonder people are sick and tired of what is happening.I do not support anybody breaking the law. However, I understand Deputy Joe Higgins's sentiments about refuse charges. In this country refuse must be paid for. We all know that, but €43 million of taxpayers' money has been squandered to pay consultants who are friends of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Those consultants get €200,000 per day.I listened to the Minister lecturing us regarding what old age pensioners get per week. She told  us that they were on €157. However, she did not tell us that, since last year, ESB bills have gone up three times, amounting to a total increase of 17%. She did not tell us that motor tax had gone up by 12%, hospital charges by 26%, the threshold for the drug refund scheme by 31%, VHI by 18%, cigarettes and alcohol by 15%, bank charges by 108% or bin charges by 30%. She did not tell us that college fees have gone up by 69%, with another proposal to raise them further in coming weeks. She did not tell us that parking fees, bus fares and the television licence had gone up by 40%. She forgot that. There is a major difference between someone on €157 per week being able to pay those charges and a consultant in the €43 million bracket getting €1 million a week, or €200,000 per day. It is easy for them to pay their charges for services from the county councils.In a month's time, the people of this country will realise that they have been conned by this Government since last year. The Book of Estimates will shortly be published for every single council in the country. I will give the Minister an example. In a small place in the west of Ireland called Aughagower there are three graveyards, three pubs, one shop and one post office. The pub incorporates the post office and the shop. Recently the owner applied for planning permission. First, the authorities wanted further information to deal with it. Then he was told that he had to withdraw the existing plan and come up with a new one. He had already spent about €10,000 on fees. I will tell Members what happened to him when he lodged the new application. When he got the planning decision last week, there was a bill of €16,500 for a community charge, with a further €8,500 for services. Living in a rural area, he does not have sewerage services and has to provide his own water from a group scheme. Yet the county council was looking for €25,000 before he had laid a single brick. Is that equality or fair play?We have people on €157 a week paying the same for their refuse as people who send out 20 tonnes, two tonnes or one tonne. It is wrong, and the councils are saying that they must now charge what the refuse service is costing them. Of course they must do that, as in some parts of the country we have inefficient local authorities. We have more high salaried engineers to be paid for as none of them works for less than €50,000 a year. In Newport we have a full-time engineer, I suppose on about €50,000 a year. Of course we, the people of Mayo, must pay him. People on social welfare must pay for him.This is all about equality and fair play. Someone on €100,000 or €200,000 a year can well afford to pay, but someone on social welfare of €157 a week cannot. The Minister will tell us that there are waivers. The county councils are very loath to grant waivers. I will give another  example. I had someone in my constituency office yesterday whose car was in a minor accident, having run down a hill. No one was injured, and nothing happened, but someone telephoned the fire service. Lo and behold, the following week, out came the bill. The man did not contact his insurance company, since no damage had been done to his car, yet the bill from Mayo County Council was for €1,000 for the fire service, which had been called out. The Minister tells us that we are getting better value for money and that it is good for democracy that services must be paid for. Of course they must be paid for, but it must be at a reasonable price.I would not mind if there were private sector services along with the public sector service in the area of refuse services, thereby creating fair play, but there is not. If the county manager decides in the next few weeks that the service in my county will cost €1,000 per week for every household, how do we evaluate that and secure value for money? How can we be sure that it is costing that much? Of course it costs that much when there is an engineer sitting there and ten or 11 people on the refuse service being paid for five days per week. It is not fair to expect the general public to pay that. We were told many years ago that the Government was increasing PRSI and that there would be no more service charges. People are absolutely prepared to pay if they get value for money and are told the truth. However, they were not told the truth last May or during the last year and they are sick and tired.In this country in the next few weeks, every county manager will be told by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that he or she must have a proposal before him by March 2004, but I can assure the people of this country that that will not happen until after June 2004, when the local elections are over. The county managers must now devise a way of collecting extra revenue. They are now proposing that for every new building, and every young person starting off in life applying for planning, buying a site and building a house, there will be a new service charge of €5,000 or €6,000. That is the new plan. They are also examining other ways of charging people money that they simply cannot afford to pay. That is why Deputy Joe Higgins and the people of Dublin are marching; they cannot afford to pay. They do not mind paying a fair price for services, but what is going on now is a rip-off.I return to the FÁS schemes, which worked well. The Progressive Democrats would not have much understanding for FÁS and its workers.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I bloody know that, as the Progressive Democrats do not represent many FÁS  workers. What is the difference between giving people a social welfare payment and an additional €25 on a FÁS scheme? It is great value for the State. The FÁS schemes have done more work and given us better value than any county council in this country through such initiatives as tidy towns and cleaning up graveyards and rural areas. They substituted for special needs services, home helps and carers when there was no help from the State and it reneged on what it should have been doing. It should have been providing money to the health boards and spending on education, but it reneged.Vocational training opportunities scheme courses are designed to get people back into the education system. Yet this year the Government did not cut back on the €43 million for the consultants or last week when we had the charade with the President. How many people went out? I intend to table a question under the Freedom of Information Act to find out how much that trip cost last week, as nothing is spared on State occasions, and there will be nothing spared for the next six months when this country holds the EU Presidency. There will be wining and dining and nothing but police cars flying up and down this city. They are not seen when they are needed, for example, when one's car is being broken into.I am reminded of the clampers. One sees them flying around the city morning, noon and night. They have cameras up on some offices in Dublin, and the minute one's ticket expires, one's car is clamped. Perhaps the Minister will tell me how those same cameras cannot be used when citizens' cars are being broken into or stolen. Why can we not use the same resources of the State to try to protect their cars? If there were revenue to be made out of them, by God, they would be protected. It is easier now to get a clamper than a taxi or a garda, but people are getting angry.The people are lying in wait for this Government. I warn the people to ask the serious questions of Fianna Fáil before the local elections, as major bombshells are coming in July 2004 when those elections are over. The Taoiseach said last week in Killarney that we had the best economy in the world. I believe that it was off the record, but that is how he was quoted. It might be the best economy for the super-rich, but not for the poor of society. The rich are getting richer, and those are the people whom the Minister represents. The poor are getting poorer, and the middle class is being squeezed. Remember one thing, however – they are waiting. On the last occasion, they felt that there was no choice, but on this occasion, there will be a choice.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. St. Brendan's national school, Blennerville, County Kerry, was closed on Thursday last because of rat infestation. One of the classrooms in which rat droppings were found is used for the teaching of infants. The principal had hoped to reopen the school yesterday but was advised by an environmental officer from the Southern Health Board that it could not be reopened until Monday next. Every room in the school must be sealed and sanitised before the children are allowed to return.St. Brendan's national school is 70 years old and consists of four classrooms, one temporary type classroom, which was provided in 2003, one portacabin, which is used as a resource teacher room and one portacabin which is divided in half, with one half used as a staffroom and storeroom and the other used as a learning support room. The campaign to have conditions improved at the school has been going on for the past ten years. In 1998, the Office of Public Works drew up a plan to renovate the school at a cost of approximately £300,000. This idea was rejected by the Department of Education and Science's building inspector who claimed that it would be a waste of time and money.In 2000, an application by the board of management for a new school was approved by the Department and the Office of Public Works was asked to purchase a suitable site. A senior official in the Office of Public Works, having had all the relevant tests carried out and arranged a number of pre-planning meetings with Kerry County Council regarding future planning for the school, successfully negotiated the purchase of such a site. The full report on the proposed site was presented to the Department of Education and Science by the Office of Public Works in December 2002. However, no apparent progress has been made since and St. Brendan's did not figure on the list of schools that was published by the Department of Education and Science earlier this year in respect of which works are to proceed.At present, there are 125 pupils, five mainstream teachers, one resource teacher and one learning support teacher, whose services are shared with another school, trying to learn and teach under these unacceptable conditions. The school is simply too small and the classrooms are cramped, generally half the size of a normal classroom. Toilet facilities are basic and are constantly overstretched and in need of remedial work. There is no storeroom for school equipment and valuable classroom space must be used for this purpose. The school is situated on the N86, a very  busy road, with no set-down area for parents dropping off or collecting children and there is no parking area provided for teachers' cars.St. Brendan's is on the INTO list of schools in need of urgent replacement. It is obvious that the school does not meet departmental standards. The school authorities are constantly paying out large amounts of money for its maintenance. They have spent over €5,000 since September to this end but the building is impossible to maintain. The principal and his staff are dedicated and conscientious teachers. They are highly regarded and respected by the parents of their pupils and have worked in totally unacceptable conditions for many years. It is time to cut through the bureaucracy and stonewalling, to purchase the approved site and to provide the much needed new school immediately.The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will reject the idea that a school could be rat infested in this day and age and will claim that the maintenance grant should be sufficient to ensure that no such infestation should occur. However, despite the fact that the authorities at Blennerville are spending more money than is provided by means of their maintenance grant, it is impossible to ensure that the school is not infested with rats. The problem is not their fault, the building is substandard, outdated and has long outlived its usefulness. Despite the best efforts of the principal and the teachers, it is simply impossible, in light of the current level of grant provided, to maintain this school to an acceptable standard.I appeal to the Minister of State to bring to the Minister's attention the embarrassment caused to the Department of Education and Science today when national newspapers printed stories about a rat infested school in Kerry. That is just not acceptable. The solution rests in the hands of the Department, the Minister and the Government.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, to outline to the House the position regarding St. Brendan's national school, Blennerville.St. Brendan's national school is a co-educational primary school. Enrolments have increased steadily in recent years, from 95 pupils in 1997-98 to 125 pupils in September 2003. The school has a staffing of one principal, four mainstream assistants, one shared learning support teacher and one shared resource teacher.The board of management of St. Brendan's national school initially applied to the Department of Education and Science in 1996 for refurbishment and subsequently applied for a new school in March 1999. Following examination of the application, it was agreed that accommodation should be provided for a six-teacher  school. A technical inspection of the school and site was carried out in 1999 and a recommendation was made that a new school, on a greenfield site, should be provided. The existing school site, at less than 0.5 acres in size, was deemed unsuitable due to the size of the extension required and the limitations of the site. The Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department of Education and Science in respect of the procurement of sites, was asked to investigate and report on suitable sites for the proposed new school. While a number of sites have been identified, the Office of Public Works has not completed its investigations in this regard.In order to address the interim accommodation requirements at the school, the Department of Education and Science grant aided the purchase of two portable structures which had been rented at the school. In addition, an application for the purchase of a portacabin was approved and included in the 2003 capital programme. The school was authorised to accept a tender in July 2003 and the purchase was funded in full in the amount of €48,000.The purchase of a site and the advancement of the school's building project to architectural planning will depend on the budgetary provision for 2004 and subsequent years, the rate of progress of existing projects in architectural planning and the priority afforded to each project by reference to the published criteria for prioritising large-scale building projects. The next schools building programme will be published early in 2004 and will outline details of projects for which funding is to be made available. In the meantime, it is the responsibility of the board of management to ensure the health and safety of pupils and teachers at the school. The school authorities should use the devolved grant to address any urgent works which arise, including the recent rodent infestation at the school.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important issue.I wish to strongly criticise the Government on its lack of real action in dealing with the crisis at St. Michael's House. People with intellectual disabilities are being forgotten again mere months after the Special Olympics, which is unacceptable. There has been a great deal of discussion about disability Bills and the rights of people. However, the people to whom I refer are being ignored by the Government.Let us consider the facts. There are 548 people on the waiting list for St. Michael's House. Of these, 263 are categorised as priority and urgently awaiting an immediate placement. They account for 40% of the total number of people waiting for  a residential place in the ERHA area. The people to whom I refer are adults whose parents are seriously ill or dead or who are elderly – in their 80s – and are unable to look after sons and daughters with intellectual disabilities. Some elderly parents are forced to accept services over 100 kilometres from their homes. I object to this and I strongly challenge the Government on this serious issue.There are currently 21 service users out of home, mainly due to the death of the final care giver, who are urgently awaiting a permanent residential placement. In order to meet this immediate need, they have to rent accommodation and take on additional staff. It has also been necessary to book eight respite beds. The blocking of respite beds had regrettably resulted in a reduced service to other service users and their families. The need to develop these additional services without Government funding has placed considerable pressure on the finances of St. Michael's House. With no money available for the development of any day care services, it has been difficult to meet the needs of service users who have completed their education programme which is funded by the Department of Education and Science, namely, graduates from the short-term training centre and special national schools.It has also been difficult to meet the needs of new referrals. The ERHA has allocated the additional funds to the three health board areas and I welcome that, as I welcomed its announcement during the summer. St. Michael's House has the longest waiting list for residential services of any organisation in the country. There are currently 548 service users on the residential waiting list. Of these, 263 are categorised as priority. These are urgent cases. These service users account for 40% of the total number of people waiting for a residential place in the ERHA area. No decision has been made by the health boards regarding the distribution of additional funds. The ERHA has requested the three area health board local development committees to submit a proposal prioritising those service users already placed in emergency residential care, for which there is no funding, and for young adults who have left school in June 2003 and now require a day service.St. Michael's House is represented on the local development committees of all three area health boards. Through its involvement on these committees, St. Michael's House has continued to highlight the immediate need to fund permanent residential places for the 21 service users already out of home and for service users who are currently in crisis requiring immediate residential placement.The need for funding for young adults requiring day places also needs to be highlighted. St.  Michael's will also continue to highlight the needs of new referrals to the services, although it has not been specifically identified as a priority by the ERHA.While I welcome the Minister's announcement to allocate additional funds for 2003, the campaign to secure adequate funds for 2003 has to continue. In order to meet the needs for residential services, we need to develop 85 new places each year for the next five years. Its ability to provide this level of expansion is conditional on Government funding.I urge all Members to support my call. I was elected on a disability platform and was a member of the independent health alliance. I cannot stress sufficiently the importance that funding be made available in the forthcoming budget for the development of additional residential and respite places. I urge the Minister to act and to act now.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	514	On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, I would like to thank the Deputy for raising the matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning the issue.Since 1997, my Department has allocated significant levels of funding across the disability sector which has resulted in significant and unprecedented developments in the quality and quantity of the health-related services which are being provided to people with disabilities. In July 2003 additional revenue and capital funding totalling €50 million was made available to services for people with disabilities. Included in this figure, additional revenue funding amounting to €20 million is being provided with a full year cost in 2004 of €30 million.Some €15 million was made available for services to persons with intellectual disabilities and those with autism to meet costs associated with emergency residential placements during 2003, the provision of day services for young adults who have just left school and some enhancement of health-related support services for children. Some €5 million was made available for services for people with physical or sensory disabilities to meet service pressures as identified by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in consultation with other relevant agencies.My Department has allocated capital funding amounting to €30 million to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in respect of minor capital works for services for people with disabilities. This included €15 million for services to people with intellectual disability or autism and €15 million for services to people with physical or sensory disabilities. This funding will allow the authority and the health boards to address such areas as the backlog of maintenance, refurbishment, re-equipping, replacement of  vehicles used within the services or works related to fire precautions and health and safety issues.The provision of the revenue funding in particular will provide around 175 emergency places and over 600 day places and will enable the authority and the health boards to address key issues of concern which had been identified by the various representative groups. The allocation of an additional €50 million is further evidence of the Government's commitment to these services and to supporting people with disabilities and their families.With regard to the matter raised by the Deputy, the Eastern Regional Health Authority states that it is aware of St. Michael's House having 263 of its clients requiring some form of residential care in 2003. Out of funding of €6.65 million this year, the ERHA states that it has commissioned, or is about to commission, 89 new residential places and give ten existing places extra funding to bring them to an appropriate level of care. It is anticipated that St. Michael's House will receive 24 new places at full-year costs of €1,754,120.It is important to note that St. Michael's House is in the same position as other intellectual disability agencies in so far as they all have clients requiring residential care. Furthermore it must be noted that although 510 clients are awaiting some form of residential care, this does not imply that there is a crisis with regard to all of these clients. In fact as part of the provider planning process between the Eastern Region Health Authority and the providers, each provider is asked to estimate the number of emergency placements anticipated for the coming year. In 2003 St. Michael's House estimated that there would be 24 crisis cases in which the organisation would have to intervene by taking a client out of home. To date in 2003, St. Michael's House facilitated 17 such crisis or emergency placements and has been allocated full-year funding by the Eastern Region Health Authority to meet these costs. St. Michael's House has funding for seven more emergency placements to year's end.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	515	To counteract the justified criticism levelled against the extraordinary indemnity deal given to the religious congregations – within whose ranks, let us remember, were numbered the perpetrators of gross abuse – the Taoiseach and other Ministers have repeated time and time again that their primary concern is for the victims of such abuse. One in Four has been one of the most successful groups assisting victims of sexual abuse.The One in Four organisation, thanks to Government ineptitude and possibly worse, is currently on the point of collapse. There can be no dispute about the bona fides of both the  organisation and its director, Colm O'Gorman. It is run by and for people who have experienced sexual abuse and provides a truly independent counselling service. It provides individual therapy, group therapy, advocacy and support, open evenings, help-line support and on-line message boards. Indirectly it provides support through campaigning, policy making, in-house research training and consultancy work.Its establishment in Ireland was encouraged, promoted and supported by the Government. One in Four set out in detail its proposed brief. From the beginning it set out its therapeutic role as being central to its work. Officials of the Department of Health and Children did not dispute this. After a meeting on 25 March 2003 with these officials, One in Four spelt out clearly the nature of its work and the nature of the agreement made with the Department in a detailed letter that was sent to the Department on 27 March and copied to the Department of the Taoiseach. The officials had sought an estimate of the costs of the counselling service. In August, One in Four supplied that information and within a week followed up with a breakdown of figures. From the letter dated 27 March until 15 September the Department did not, apparently, dispute the issue of counselling. However, the Taoiseach today claims that this information was not forthcoming. Today the Taoiseach stated that €208,000 was made available to the British-based operation. My understanding is that only €60,000 of that money was allocated to the British operation.Despite pleas from One in Four, the officials never signed a service agreement with them. In August, One in Four asked the Department's officials to meet it representatives. The organisation did not receive a reply to that request. It is clear from the documentation that the One in Four organisation kept the Department fully informed yet at no time until 15 September did the Department make clear any problem with its counselling role.This confusion raises serious questions about the professionalism and competence of the Department of Health and Children in dealing with an important service provider, the development of which it had encouraged. It is worth noting that the Finlay report recommended that it was not appropriate for counselling to be provided by the State but that an independent body was required. This principle is surely as valid in the area of sexual abuse. The Government has managed to spend €17 million on counselling since 1999, while the religious congregations claim to have spent €10 million on counselling services. The only truly independent counselling service of these three is due to collapse because €81,000 cannot be found and the budget which was promised for next year is now in jeopardy. There is no doubt that this is a desperately needed service. As one abuse victim said: "I saw  One in Four reach out where others had failed, giving us the necessary support to keep alive."I urge the Minister of State to make a clear statement of support tonight for the work of One in Four and of his commitment to ensuring that these matters can be resolved and that the future of this organisation can be secured.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	516	My Department has co-operated with this organisation since its establishment. To this end, One in Four has received a grant of €633,000 from May 2002 to date, a period of 17 months. Of this amount, €208,000 was made available to One in Four UK to assist it in dealing with calls from Ireland about clerical abuse.The remaining grant of €425,000 was made available to One in Four Ireland. This amount is made up of €302,000 for staff salaries, expenses, pensions and training. The staffing of the organisation, as indicated to my Department in its submission for funding comprises a director, an office manager, a receptionist, a therapy co-ordinator and an advocacy worker.The remainder is made up of €79,000 for premises, €5,000 recruitment costs and €8,000 volunteer costs. The full amount of agreed funding between the Department and the group for 2003 has been paid in three amounts and ahead of the schedule envisaged by One in Four itself.Many meetings have taken place with Mr. O'Gorman since April 2002, both on the establishment of his group and the inquiry into the handling of allegations of child sexual abuse in the Diocese of Ferns. I refute Mr. O'Gorman's assertion that my Department has been anything other than professional in its dealings with One in Four.At a meeting held in March 2003, the establishment costs for the organisation were agreed. At that time it was agreed that One in Four would submit details on the cost of providing counselling. The organisation never submitted these details. In August 2003, the group requested an additional €37,824 for counselling costs incurred this year up to the end of July and a further €43,200 to cover counselling costs from the beginning of August to the end of the year. Additional information was sought from One in Four in order for my Department to assess what costs it may be liable to cover.My Department responded on 11 September 2003 that it was willing to pay for counselling to institutional abuse victims and clerical abuse victims for which Faoiseamh had not been billed. This amounted to €4,032. One in Four already receives its counselling costs regarding clerical abuse victims from Faoiseamh, the church-sponsored counselling service. As I have already stated, my Department provides counselling services through the National Counselling Service for victims of all types of abuse. The costs of counselling incurred by the Department from  1999 to date amounts to €17 million. This is a quality-driven service as shown by the evaluation recently published. Clients of the National Counselling Service have indicated that they were extremely satisfied with the service provided. The Department also provides a similar service for those who are resident in the UK and were in institutions as children. Furthermore, it also provides private counselling for those who, as children, suffered abuse in an institutional setting and do not wish to avail of the State-sponsored services.I can confirm that a meeting with Mr. O'Gorman and One in Four has been organised for Thursday next, 16 October 2003, to discuss this matter. My Department is committed to retaining a constructive relationship with the One in Four organisation. The purpose of the meeting will be to set a framework within which One in Four will continue to successfully operate.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	517	As I have rarely attempted to raise issues in my constituency through the device of the Adjournment Debate, it can be taken that I view this matter extremely seriously. I thank the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for coming to the House to listen to my concerns.Finglas is a very large urban population centre of the same size as Limerick or Waterford. It has a large population of vulnerable elderly people, many of whom live alone. Huge improvements to the social and economic infrastructure in recent years have taken place and unemployment is quite low. The work of the Finglas-Cabra Partnership and the Finglas-Cabra drugs task force have done much to provide training and employment for many of the long-term unemployed. The FAN and youth diversion projects, under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, are doing much excellent work with young people at risk in the area. There are more people on vocational training opportunity schemes and other return to education programmes than anywhere else in the country. Home ownership is at about 80% and participation in further and higher education has increased, although it is still well below the levels of areas which are better off. The Dublin City Council has invested heavily in the Finglas-South regeneration programme and €25 million is being spent on a swimming pool, youth centre, child care centre, civic office and all-weather pitches, a project which is ahead of schedule and well within budget. It is projected that 5,000 additional housing units will be built over the next five years in the area.However, problems still remain. There are unacceptable levels of antisocial behaviour, breaches of public order legislation, intimidation  and recently, an increase in drug-related gangland activity. This is very similar to what went on in the late 1970s and 1980s, although it is much more violent now. The latest upsurge in violence is disappointing to the vast majority of good-living, law-abiding people in Finglas. They are appalled by the number of violent deaths, attacks and intimidating behaviour in recent months, acts perpetrated by a small group of people who see their group as a law unto itself and who will stop at nothing to ensure it remains that way.As I said earlier today, there are no "no-go" areas in Finglas and there cannot be. Yes, people are frightened but I compliment those like Fr. Seamus Ahearne, the Rivermount parish priest, for standing up and exhorting people to co-operate with the gardaí. The people of Finglas must be supported in these very difficult times. They cannot be left at the mercy of gangland thugs and I appeal to anyone with any information to pass it on to the gardaí or to someone they trust. I appeal to the small number of people who have been patently obstructive to Garda inquiries to stop doing so.I thank the Garda authorities for putting Operation Crossover in place and for vigorous and robust policing in recent times. I hope this strategy will lead to the apprehension, prosecution and conviction of these thugs, who are a menace in the area. I wish the gardaí well in their investigations and I sympathise with the families of the innocent victims of recent attacks and with gardaí who have been injured in the line of duty.I know this period will pass but it should never have come to this. Policing in any area is ineffective if it is not consistent. Stop-start, trial and error methods simply do not and will not work. There are horses for courses and not every garda is ideally suited to serve in every area of the country. The Garda authorities must consistently engage with the community in Finglas, not just when trouble starts. I urge the gardaí to be proactive and to work with community leaders in developing a policing plan for the area, a plan which is custom-made and not handed down from on high.Finglas Garda station was built at a time in the last century when there were crossroads dances and a maypole festival in Finglas. It is almost the same building now as when it was built 70 or so years ago and it is not customer-friendly; it must be a depressing building in which to work, lacking basic sanitation facilities for staff or prisoners. It must be difficult for gardaí to feel enthusiastic about their work when their surroundings are so depressing. All the current investigations are based in the Blanchardstown Garda station, as there are no facilities in the Finglas Garda station for such conferences. The gardaí and the community in Finglas deserve better than that. In the new plan for the regeneration of Finglas, an opportunity exists to build a 21st century station  and the sale of the existing building would go a long way towards funding the cost of a new station.CCTV was originally announced for Finglas in 1994. If the commissioning of the system for Finglas village could be expedited, this would be another weapon in the armoury of the gardaí in their fight against crime. I ask the Minister to engage with the Finglas community, the Garda Commissioner and his colleagues in this House to make sufficient resources and manpower available to ensure the current crime wave is defeated and that a long-term proactive policing plan is put in place for this rapidly expanding part of Dublin.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I agree with much that he said. It is true that Finglas is a community which has made huge strides in this area and it is well served by Deputy Carey. Many of the achievements and items of progress to which he referred owe much to his constant work on behalf of his constituents.I am aware that it is against the background of a number of serious incidents, including murder, that the Deputy raised this matter. With regard to a number of these incidents, the media have used the terms "organised crime" and "gangland killings" to describe their nature. The Deputy will appreciate that I do not want to say anything that would jeopardise the proper investigation of any incident by ascribing any particular motive to it. Regardless of whether these terms are appropriate, I assure the House that the Garda Síochána subjects all murders and violent crimes to detailed and lengthy investigation. I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are a number of ongoing investigations and that the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and other national specialist units provide assistance to these investigations as required.However, I will not understate the difficulties faced by the Garda Síochána in successfully investigating some such crimes. Organised crime, by its very nature, creates a climate of fear not only for the general public and the community but also for some of the criminals, those associated with them and those in whose company they perform criminal acts. There are potentially huge profits involved in organised crime, particularly the evil drugs trade. To those criminals, money is power and many are prepared to take whatever action is deemed necessary to protect their positions, including violence and murder in some cases.The use of violence and intimidation as a sanction by and within criminal groups is problematic for law enforcement agencies. In addition, there can be problems with incidents being unreported to the lawful authorities. Unfortunately, it is not a new phenomenon that criminal organisations  have used and will use violence to protect their evil business.I re-echo the words of a senior investigating Garda regarding a recent incident in the Finglas area – such crimes cannot be tackled without the help of the people of the area. In that context, I re-echo the words of the courageous parish priest to whom the Deputy referred. The people must get behind the gardaí if this problem is to be solved. That officer also understood that the fears of the people are real but publicly appealed to anyone who could help in the investigation to come forward. I reiterate that appeal.The gardaí are willing to meet people, whoever they are, in any part of the country and to guarantee them that their safety will be assured. While the Garda has reacted to recent incidents with patrols, including armed patrols, in the area, as the Deputy pointed out, the long-term solution lies not in such reactive measures but in the successful arrest and conviction of the criminals responsible.I have been assured by the Garda authorities that the local Garda management is satisfied that the resources available to it in the Dublin metropolitan region west division in which Finglas is situated are adequate to meet the policing needs of the area. There has been an increase of 16 personnel allocated to that division since the end of May of this year. The Garda authorities further inform me that the needs of the division, including those of the Finglas area, will be kept under constant review and, as additional personnel become available, those needs will be considered in the context of Garda resources nationally.On a broader level, I have met a number of times with the Garda Commissioner and other senior Garda personnel to discuss crimes which might be put in the category of gangland or organised crime and I am satisfied that the necessary resources, operational and financial, are being directed towards the containment and detection of such crimes.The establishment of specialist Garda units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the national drugs unit, operating under an assistant commissioner in charge of the national support service, has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime effectively. Other smaller units, including the money laundering investigation unit and a unit dealing with theft of computer components have also had considerable success in combating the activities of organised criminals.Another important strategic element in fighting serious crime has been the witness security programme. That programme was developed in order to prevent criminals from intimidating those who assist the authorities in bringing those criminals to justice and it has been used successfully to date in organised crime investigations.There are a number of other measures to which I could allude, if time permitted. I have spoken to the Garda Commissioner regarding the recent violent incidents to which the Deputy referred. I spoke to him about the matter today. He has informed me that the necessary resources have been directed towards those areas of criminal activity and that a continued proactive – not reactive – and integrated approach is being taken by gardaí to the investigation of cases where there is a suspicion of the involvement of organised criminality. He has assured me that no effort will be spared to solve these crimes and to bring those involved to justice.I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. I assure him that my commitment to dealing with the twin problems of drugs and organised crime is unwavering and I am constantly evaluating our response to this problem. I reassure the Deputy that I will meet him and other Deputies from his  constituency and I will ensure that their views are communicated to top Garda management. I record my determination in the forthcoming Garda legislation to put a formal linkage between public representatives and the Garda Síochána on a local basis in order that in future there will be a democratic platform from which Garda activities in any particular area can be dealt with. I will take whatever measures are necessary to deal with this menace. Significant progress has already been made in the investigation of a number of the serious offences to which the Deputy referred. I do not want to refer in detail to those operational matters, but anybody who thinks that nothing is happening, that no progress is being made or that investigations are floundering, is deeply mistaken. The Garda Síochána is well on the way to resolving a number of those particular offences.The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 October 2003.

Unfortunately, the nature of the projects involved means that disruption and inconvenience will be experienced by the public during the construction phases.I am informed by the Rail Procurement Agency that most of the work on laying Luas tracks at road junctions should be completed by Christmas and that this should alleviate matters. The work on upgrading the DART is being confined to weekends and is being undertaken in two phases to minimise the impact on traffic. However, as I said in my reply to a previous question I am pleased to say that Irish Rail has agreed to cease these works for December and resume in the New Year. Alternative bus services are being provided to minimise the impact and reduce private cars coming into the city at weekends.When the Luas services commence next year and the port tunnel and DART upgrade are completed in 2005, we will have made good progress towards providing the level of transport infrastructure that is expected of a capital city on the 21st century.

This examination must have regard to the prevailing budgetary circumstances, the current and projected implementation status of key projects, and the capacity of the construction industry. In this context, the NRA have indicated that the availability of additional funding in 2004 would facilitate more accelerated delivery of the programme. I have not, however, received a specific request for an additional allocation of €300 million in 2004.

It is my intention to proceed with these proposals in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government. At present, the focus is on the detailed preparatory work required to implement my restructuring proposals.I have met with the trade unions on a number of occasions to discuss the package of reform proposals outlined in my statement. While these discussions have dealt primarily with the regulatory issues, they also touched on the restructuring of CIE. The current discussions which my Department is having with the trade unions representing CIE workers are focused on regulatory matters.

These are the proposals concerning greater autonomy and independence for Shannon and Cork Airports and the commitment to examine proposals for a new independent terminal at Dublin Airport and to progress such proposals if the evidence suggests that such a terminal will deliver significant benefit.There has been a broad level of support for the Government's decision of July last to establish the three State airports as fully independent and autonomous authorities under State ownership. The new arrangements are designed to strengthen and expand each of three airports and to give both Shannon and Cork a fresh, debt-free start under strong and visionary new leadership. I believe that all three airports can perform even better than they have to date and, through more focused commercial operation, each can play a greater role in stimulating and supporting regional economic activity to the benefit of their customers, both airlines and passengers, and of Irish tourism, trade and industry.

The current average waiting time nationally for a driving test is 22.7 weeks. The pass rate, as at end June 2003, is 55.2%. In order to deal with the increased level of demand for driving tests, my Department has recruited eight retired driver testers who have commenced testing with effect from 13 October. In addition, a bonus scheme for driver testers was introduced in June 2003. Driver testers continue to deliver additional tests by working overtime on Saturdays and at lunchtime.

While the Department has not yet received the report, I understand that the consultants expect to submit a draft report shortly.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	525	The Railway Procurement Agency has submitted to my Department the business case, including a cost benefit analysis, for the PPP procurement of phase 1 of the metro. As the estimated costs were substantial, I asked for a number of additional aspects of the proposal to be further examined including the cost of the project, its potential impact on the general Government balance and the legal, planning and technical considerations based on practice elsewhere, particularly Madrid where the authorities have developed a strong international reputation for the speedy completion of the metro extensions at relatively low cost.My Department is currently finalising its evaluation of RPA's recommendations on how the PPP procurement of the first metro line should proceed and I will be bringing proposals to the Government shortly. Included in the revised proposal is RPA's estimate of the direct capital cost of the first line and an indication of the potential size of the annual availability payments to the successful PPP consortium. These annual payments will cover the construction of the metro and its operation and maintenance over a 26 year operating period. It must be pointed out that the actual cost of the metro and the level of availability payments will be largely dependent on the bids received from the private sector. However, a figure of €10 billion has never been mentioned by me in this regard. More than 30 parties have responded to the pre-qualification exercise launch by the RPA in May 2002, including a large number of major companies from around the world, 22 of which have pre-qualified.RPA has retained world-class consultants with wide experience of metro in a number of countries around the world. Additional skills and experience required for the procurement of the metro PPP by the RPA will be considered further when the Government decides to proceed with the procurement of the project. Professor Melis' offer will be considered in that context.I should also add that RPA has signalled its intention to appoint a panel of experts to advise on the project as it goes forward. This panel would include not only technical experts like Professor Melis, but also people with a successful record of delivering PPPs and people with a strong knowledge of local construction conditions.

Since the publication of the strategic rail review earlier this year, my Department has held a number of meetings with Irish Rail at which the company has reported on its progress in improving the performance of its freight business.Irish Rail informs me that the fortunes of its freight operations have improved considerably. It has secured two major contracts and is in the process of consolidating those markets which are financially sustainable. The company has stated that they are confident that the outlook for its freight business is good in the short to medium term.

A second round of negotiations is due to take place in Brussels in December. During these negotiations, a special committee made up of all member states will assist the Commission. Ireland is represented on this committee by a senior official from my Department.As I indicated in answers to questions earlier this year, the objective of the EU-US negotiations is to create a situation in which European and US airlines are not constrained as to the destinations to which they fly, just as they are not so constrained within Europe today.It is unclear how long these negotiations will take. There are signs that agreement can be reached on a wide range of issues. However, some other issues, such as market access, state aid, and ownership and control, will require more work. The next session of formal negotiations is scheduled for the second week in December in Brussels.

A copy of the report has been available in the Oireachtas Library since early last week and in addition the document is posted on my Department's website.The review has addressed all of the relevant issues and has been pursued against the background of the plans to provide for the metrication of speed limits by the end of 2004. It is proposed that any changes in speed limits will be implemented when metric units of measurement are introduced.I am currently giving careful consideration to the report and the recommendations that the working group has made. The implementation of new speed structures based on metric values will give rise to a range of practical issues. I have asked the working group to continue its work for the purpose of advising on that implementation programme including the mounting of a public awareness campaign. The working group has estimated that the road signage and public awareness campaign that would be required to support the metrication of the revised speed limit structure that is recommended in the report would cost in the region of €10 million.

As the predominant mode of internal transport it is clear that a good well functioning road network is critical in underpinning ongoing growth and development.The main strategic road infrastructure upgrade proposals identified in the national spatial strategy i.e. upgrading of the main inter-urban links and upgrade works on N2, N3, N4, N11, etc., are reflected in the National Roads Authority's current national roads development programme for the next four to five years.However, the national spatial strategy has a longer time perspective than the roads programme currently in construction and active planning. Much of this work however will extend beyond the current national development plan but will be taken into account in the forward planning of the roads programme. The national spatial strategy implementation mechanisms – regional planning guidelines, the integrated development frameworks for gateways and development strategies for development links – will also assist in ensuring that the national roads programme supports the implementation of the national spatial strategy.

The high level group on road safety has been tasked with the preparation of this new strategy.The preparation of the new strategy will take account of the achievements in meeting the targets set out in the Road to Safety Strategy 1998-2002, a comprehensive review of that strategy, and the evolving developments in relation to the proposed EU third road safety action plan. Preparation of the new strategy is well advanced and I expect to bring specific proposals for the strategy to Government later this year with a view to publication by year-end.Pending the introduction of a new strategy, my Department and all the agencies concerned with the implementation of road safety measures are ensuring that the successful measures brought forward under the road to safety continue to be implemented. The implementation of that strategy resulted in a reduction of over 20% in both deaths and serious injuries. That momentum has been maintained this year, as we have witnessed a further reduction in road crash fatalities. Provisional figures to 6 October 2003 show 262 road deaths compared to 303 on the same date last year. There is a need to build on the success of the first road safety strategy and the continued positive trends which we have been experiencing has been highlighted by the tragic loss of ten lives on our roads over the first weekend in October.

It is in this broader context that integration with Luas lines from Tallaght to Connolly Station – Lines A-C – will be achieved in the city centre.The first phase of the metro project as proposed by the Railway Procurement Agency would, subject to Government overall approval of metro, be a line from Dublin Airport to St. Stephen's Green. When this phase is built, passengers would be able to interchange from Luas line B to metro at St. Stephen's Green and from metro to Luas lines A-C in the O'Connell Street area. When Line B is incorporated into the metro system, passengers would be able to travel between any points on the Luas or metro networks with one interchange. I am considering all the options and will be bringing proposals to Government in the coming weeks for phase I of the metro.Considerable progress has been made in the construction of Luas. I understand from the RPA that construction will be completed by May 2004 for the Tallaght to Connolly Station Line – Line A-C – and March 2004 for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line – Line B. This compares with the original contractual dates of October 2003 for Line A and December 2003 for Line B. Following a period of testing and commissioning, passenger services will begin in August 2004 for the Tallaght to Connolly line and June 2004 for the Sandyford to St. Stephen's Green line.

To this end, we are concentrating on four key goals – making the necessary investment in transport infrastructure, bringing competitive tension to the market to provide customer choice, reforming systems, and delivering projects more quickly and efficiently.Sectoral plans are already in place for the various transport modes. What we need to do now is to set out and communicate an overarching vision for a more seamless transport network. In recognition of this, my Department is currently working towards the development of an integrated transport policy framework that will underpin Irelands economic growth and competitiveness and contribute to social development.

The report's findings will have a positive role in helping to alleviate growing congestion, reverse ever-increasing car dependency, maintain economic competitiveness and prioritise balanced regional development.The western rail corridor was one of a number of schemes that was evaluated in the review. While it was noted in the report that this particular scheme complements the objectives of the national spatial strategy, it did not perform well in the cost benefit analysis in the review and therefore was not included by the consultants in the recommended investment strategy.The review found that consideration of new railway proposals, such as the western rail corridor, would need to be supported by appropriate and complementary land, settlement and economic strategies, which would provide the economic, social and commercial rationale for the project.Recognising that the western rail corridor fits in well with the aims of the national spatial strategy, I provided the relevant regional authorities in the west with consultancy advice to ensure that they are fully aware of the necessary prerequisites that would need to be put in place before a rail feasibility study could be commissioned on the western rail corridor.

The scope and extent of the upgrade and the programming of the work involved is a matter for the NRA in the first instance having regard to the funding available for the national roads programme.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	543	The policy of tackling congestion requires particular focus on the promotion of public transport. A key element of this focus is the delivery of quality bus corridors in a more aggressive way. To date, we have nine QBCs in operation in the Dublin area – Malahide, Lucan, Stillorgan, Finglas, North  Clondalkin, Rathfarnham, Tallaght, Swords and Blanchardstown. Results have been impressive, with bus journey times cut by up to 40% in some cases.A quality bus network project office was established in 2002, with a project team dedicated to the implementation of an expanded QBC-QBN programme, including new radial and orbital corridors, extensions of existing corridors, as well as city centre bus priority measures and local bus priority measures where needed. Cycling facilities associated with the QBN network are also being provided.This year, my Department is investing about €19 million in traffic management grants in quality bus corridor-network projects. This follows a total investment of €72 million in QBC projects up to 2002. Next year we hope to invest €35 million in developing the quality bus network in Dublin.Alongside bus service provision, due attention is being given to our rail based commuter services. The first phase of the DART upgrade project is now under way, for completion by the end of 2005. This project will upgrade power supply to enable longer, eight car DART trains to run over the full DART network. It will also lengthen platforms at all DART stations and provide wheelchair accessible stations. The additional capacity will permit the introduction of 40 new DART cars. On the Kildare, Maynooth and outer or coastal suburban corridors, 80 new diesel rail-cars are currently being introduced. These rail cars will upgrade existing rolling stock as well as increase the passenger carrying capacity on these corridors.In the summer-early autumn of next year, Luas will commence operation, providing peak time services of 12 trams per hour, with capacity of up to 235 persons per tram on the Tallaght to Connolly line and up to 310 persons per tram on the Sandyford to Stephen's Green line. In addition to improving public transport infrastructure and services, the issue of demand management is being examined comprehensively by means of a DTO demand management implementation study which is currently under way; it is expected to be complete in early 2004. The outcome of the study will lead to recommendations for an agreed implementation programme for managing the demand for travel, particularly at peak times, and for more efficient use of Dublin's transport infrastructure.I am confident that these measures, together with the opening of the Dublin Port tunnel and the completion of the M50 in 2005, will go a long way towards addressing Dublin's congestion problems. With regard to Mr. Turner's reported assertion about congestion in Dublin vis-à-vis that in other cities, it must be emphasised that there are no comprehensive comparative data available to support or refute this claim.

Bus Éireann, in particular, is being affected by delays created by traffic volumes on certain of its inter-urban services. In circumstances where such services are delayed, the use by its buses of a part of the road that is generally not used for general traffic purposes would seem to provide a potential answer to at least some of the difficulties.In that regard, I have asked my officials to examine the potential for the use of hard shoulders at particular pinch points on various roads, including those linking Dublin and satellite towns. My officials are now engaged in discussions on the matter with the National Roads Authority, the Dublin Transportation Office, the Quality Bus Network Project Office and Bus Éireann. The legal and safety aspects are also being considered.

It established quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which was to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority was accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing.These are accepted both internationally and nationally as the three main contributory factors to road traffic accidents. The success of the first road safety strategy can be measured by the fact that both road deaths and serious injuries decreased by over 20% over the lifetime of that strategy.A review carried out by an international road safety expert on the first strategy indicates that these areas remain valid and that they should continue to be targeted. In this context, the new road safety strategy which is currently being prepared by the high level group on road safety will provide for a continuing focus on measures aimed at targeting these three contributory factors to fatal and serious injury accidents.

I am mindful of the significant work already under way on the integration of land use and transport through the drawing up of regional planning guidelines by regional authorities having regard to the national  spatial strategy. In the light of this development I am currently reviewing my proposals for a greater Dublin land use and transport authority.With regard to the proposed metro, I am aware of the considerable work involved in the referencing of land and identification of owners and occupiers, which is required before a railway order can be applied for under the Transport (Railway Infrastructure) Act 2001.At present, my Department is considering ways of accelerating and streamlining procedures for the delivery of major infrastructure projects. In this regard, the draft heads of a Bill are being prepared for a critical infrastructure (Dublin metro) Bill, which I hope to bring to Government shortly as part of the proposals for the development of the Dublin metro.

Indeed, the authority has met and in some cases surpassed its specific commitments in the Government's Road to Safety Strategy 1998-2002.I am satisfied that this level of expenditure has achieved and will continue to achieve substantial improvements in safety levels on the national roads network. It should also be noted that the main national roads improvement programme is also providing a substantial road safety dividend through the provision of higher quality and safer roads.The position on the provision of safety barriers is that the NRA is now providing safety barriers on the central reservations of all new motorways and dual carriageways where the reservation is 15 metres or less in width. The NRA has commenced a retrofit programme to provide safety barriers on existing motorways and duel carriageways where this standard warrants it. The position on motorways is that the NRA is currently reviewing the position in relation to the provision of rest stops-lay-bys.

The Act will facilitate the replacement of the current regulatory system applying to the licensing and operation of small public service vehicles – taxis, hackneys and limousines – and their drivers and the development by the commission for taxi regulation of new qualitative standards relating to the operation and driving of small public service vehicles. A competition to recruit a Commissioner for Taxi Regulation is currently being progressed by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission.With regard to the advisory council, the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 provides for the establishment of a council consisting of a chairperson and 17 ordinary members to advise the Commission for Taxi Regulation and me as Minister for Transport, as appropriate, on issues relevant to small public service vehicles and their drivers. The membership of the advisory council will be drawn from representatives of the taxi, hackney and limousine industry, local authorities, the Garda Síochána, consumer, disability, tourism and business interests and other relevant sectors. I have received nominations from a range of interest groups with a view to the selection of persons for appointment to the advisory council. I hope to complete my consideration of these nominations in the near future with a view to the formal establishment of the council under the new Act.On the question of accessibility in taxis, the position is that the Government is committed in An Agreed Programme for Government to continue the process of making taxis wheelchair accessible. However, a number of complex issues concerning implementation of this accessible taxi policy have yet to be decided. These include improvements to the existing wheelchair accessible taxi specification to accommodate the greatest possible range of people, issues surrounding urban-rural needs and the cost of suitable vehicles.

An implementation group comprising officials from my Department and Iarnród Éireann has been established to monitor the implementation of the main findings in the report.This group has been meeting at regular intervals since the publication of the review in April last. In response to the report, Irish Rail has recently submitted to my Department its proposed investment priorities in the medium term and at present these are being discussed with the company.

The objectives are to improve enforcement of road traffic law, to reduce the incidence of road crashes caused by excessive speeding and to enable the Garda authorities to redeploy resources from the processing of speeding fines to other policing priorities. A working group representing Departments and other interested parties is urgently examining a range of issues with a view to ensuring that the engagement of the private sector in managing a network of speed cameras will effectively achieve the objectives set out above.

The successful implementation of the road safety strategy which has resulted in significant reduction in road deaths and serious injuries is critically dependent on continued investment and co-ordinated action by various Government Departments and their agencies, including the National Safety Council. The Government has demonstrated its clear commitment to road safety providing the necessary supports for the development and implementation of a successful road safety strategy.

First, the procurement approach in Madrid was a conventional direct procurement approach, which is very different to the public private partnership, PPP, approach that the Government has decided upon for the Dublin metro. Secondly, metro de Madrid has more than 100 years' experience of building metros while we have no such experience in Ireland. Accordingly, the RPA has augmented its resources by engaging in the required experience to develop the project, both in the form of staff and of advisers who have such experience. RPA has retained world class consultants with wide experience of metro and PPP procurement in a number of countries around the world.To strengthen its approach to the management of the development of the metro, RPA has signalled its intention to appoint a panel of experts to advise on the project as it goes forward. This panel would include not only technical experts like Professor Melis, but also people with a successful record of delivering PPPs and people with a strong knowledge of local construction conditions.

In the licensing area I am examining a range of reforms to address the problem of long-term reliance on provisional licences and improve the standard of driving. Regarding driver testing, the Government has approved the heads of a Bill to establish a driver testing and standards authority and I expect to be in a position to introduce the Bill into the House in the current Dáil session. While the authority's primary task will be to deliver an efficient driver testing service, it will also be responsible for driving standards in general.The requirements of the practical driving test are set out in the relevant EU directive. A number of improvements to the practical driving test are in the course of implementation on foot of amendments agreed at EU level. These changes relate to random checks on mechanical aspects of vehicles which have a bearing on road safety such as tyres, steering, brakes, engine oil, coolant, washer fluid, lights, reflectors, indicators and horn. In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, is arranging for implementation of improvements in relation to truck tests, i.e. parking safely for loading and unloading at a loading ramp and coupling and uncoupling the vehicle.Under the relevant EU directive, further changes are also due to be introduced to the driving test by October 2005 related to manoeuvres to be carried out by motorcyclists.

The consultants estimated that the cost would be in the order of €20 million to €30 million.The RPA has recently communicated to the Department its views on the proposals put forward in the report and has estimated that a realistic cost of constructing a grade separated solution and the consequential costs arising from interruption of services is at least €50 million, with a minimum timescale of two and a half years.The NRA has today announced proposals that can achieve major improvements in the key traffic movements on the M50, including at the N7 Red Cow roundabout. The proposals will involve total expenditure of €300 million. Subject to approval of the necessary EIS and motorway scheme by An Bord Pleanála, it should be possible for the NRA to start construction of phase 1 of the M50 project in March 2005; this would mean upgrading the N7 roundabout and the N4 interchange at Palmerstown as well as construction of a third lane in the centre median for each carriageway between the two interchanges.

The question of the relationship that the corps will have with the Garda and in particular whether it will be under the overall control of the Garda Commissioner is central to the development of this proposal.The establishment of a dedicated traffic corps which is independent of the Garda would require the introduction of legislation, in particular to establish powers and functions of the corps and its accountability.A working group has been established to urgently consider the options available in terms of progressing this proposal. This group will be chaired by my Department and will comprise representatives from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Office of the Director of Traffic.

Data on the level of service on the national primary network is provided on a less regular basis as the analysis and modelling work necessary to provide this data is only now being undertaken on a regular annual basis.The position on the time savings expected to be achieved by end 2003 on the major inter-urban routes is as follows: M1 – approximately 23 minutes; N7 – approximately 12 minutes; and N8 – approximately ten minutes.In addition the relief roads provided at Enfield and Kinnegad on the N4-N6 have achieved journey time savings on these routes. The NRA is confident of achieving the travel time savings identified for each major inter-urban upon completion of the entire inter-urban route. The difficulty that exists in the meantime is that as traffic growth increases, end to end journey times are also rising. While new schemes will serve to reduce travel times, the full benefits, in terms of achieving projected time savings, may not be realised until the entire corridor is upgraded or at least until all major bottlenecks are removed from each corridor.

The mandate of group included reviewing progress on existing projects and identifying the future priority needs of an enlarged Union. The group reported to the EU Commission in June 2003. Ireland supported the groups report which identified four projects affecting Ireland (1) the road-rail corridor between Dublin and Belfast, (2) road-rail corridor between Dublin and Cork, (3) a road-rail corridor linking the west and Dublin, identified as an important project for territorial cohesion, and (4) a motorway of the sea of western Europe, leading from the Iberian Peninsula  via the Atlantic Arc to the North Sea and the Irish Sea. This latter project is the responsibility of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. On 1 October 2003, the European Commission published its proposals to amend the guidelines adopted in 1996 to give legal status to the various projects in the Van Miert report.

Under these standards, all of this earned income is effectively treated as an outflow being repatriated to direct investors whether or not there is an actual cash repatriation.The relevant figures for the years 1990-2002 are shown in the table below. This table also shows the breakdown of the overall direct investment income on equity attributable to foreign direct investors, that is, the parent enterprises, into: (i) the element distributed by way of dividends or branch cash repatriations; and (ii) the undistributed part of earnings that are reinvested in the Irish enterprises.Following the recent major overhaul by the CSO of its balance of payments collection and compilation system, the figures shown for the year 1998 onwards are not comparable with the earlier figures for 1990 to 1997. In the earlier period, manufacturing and primarily non-financial foreign-owned enterprises were covered by the statistics.

Reductions in insurance premia cannot be made by ministerial order. EU law prevents Governments or any other body from intervening in the underwriting policy of any insurance undertaking.The insurance reform programme that I announced on 25 October last comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. Initial indications are that the reform programme is having its desired effect. The Irish Insurance Federation reported in September 2003 that there has been an average reduction of 11% in motor insurance charges in the year to date.  More reductions are expected. Reductions are also expected in employers' liability and public liability insurance premia, which represent a significant burden for businesses.The 35% reduction in the cost of insurance, referred to by the Deputy is, I believe, a reference to an estimate by the Irish insurance industry of a 31% reduction that could be anticipated if all of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, MIAB, report were implemented. To-date 23 of these recommendations have been implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the other recommendations. The Government has approved the drafting of the general scheme of the Bill to place the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, PIAB, on a statutory footing. It is hoped to enact the legislation by the end of the year. The PIAB will reduce the cost of delivering compensation and thereby lead to further reductions in insurance premia, including employers and public liability premia.

Records received and maintained in my Department are normally paper-based, and are maintained on paper files which are themselves individually registered and tracked on a computer-based electronic system. Where electronic records are received, corporate policy demands that a hard copy is printed and maintained on file. The existence of a function-based system ensures that records are easily identified and recovered when required.All and any records are fully maintained in accordance with both the requirements and implementation of the Freedom of Information Act, and the relevant National Archives legislation.

Employing such a person or being in employment in the State, in the absence of a valid employment permit constitutes a criminal offence for the employer and employee respectively.If a person in the situation cited by the Deputy wishes to continue in employment after November 2003, they should ensure that the employer in question has a valid employment permit for the period November 2003-January 2004.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 191 to 195, inclusive, together.The community employment, CE, programme is currently under review. An overall appraisal of active labour market programmes, including CE, is being carried out under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market, which is chaired by my Department. This process involves consultation with the social partners, Government Departments and FÁS. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. The work of this group is well advanced. FÁS is also currently completing an internal review of CE and the jobs initiative programme, JI. A decision on the future funding and structure of CE and JI, including matters relating to the participation of disadvantaged groups such as persons with disabilities and older workers, will be taken in the context of the Estimates provision for 2004, having regard to the outcome of the current review process.The provision of funding for CE for 2003 is €274 million, which will provide for a year-end participation rate of 20,000 places. FÁS is attempting to allocate CE resources to individual projects and within regions as equitably as possible. Projects are prioritised based on the services provided. Drugs task force activity and childcare service provision are ring-fenced from any reductions and projects in RAPID areas are given priority. CE places in the health sector, which includes personal assistant services, are being maintained at existing levels to ensure continuity of the delivery of these services. A reduction in CE places of 20% on average around the country is being implemented by FÁS. However, the prioritisation of the essential services outlined will result in some locations taking a reduction in places above the average level.Over the past year, I have personally met with many public representatives and community groups from around the country. More formal consultation with the social partners is ongoing through the standing committee on the labour market and in other fora and I would expect this to continue for the foreseeable future.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	594	I have not had any discussions with the insurance industry specifically regarding the refusal of travel insurance for persons over 75 years of age. I have, however, met representatives of the industry on many occasions concerning the overall cost of insurance to consumers and business and the recommendations of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. Included in these is a recommendation that insurers adopt rating practices that allow sufficient credit for accident free driving experience rather than filtering out risks solely on the basis of age. The Irish Insurance Federation is addressing this recommendation in its new code of practice, which is expected to be published shortly.Furthermore on 1 May 2003, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, IFSRA, came into effect. IFSRA has a wide regulatory remit, covering consumer protection and prudential supervision of practically all of the financial services, including insurance services and products.

The budget for the programme in 2003 is €30.836 million. To date a total of 336 social economy enterprises has commenced operation with a total of nearly 2,400 employees.A review of the social economy programme is being undertaken and is expected to be completed shortly. This will inform the future direction of the programme.

Employment data for 2003 will not be available until the end of this year.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	597	Job creation is a day-to-day operational matter for the industrial development agencies under the aegis of my Department. These agencies are continuing their efforts towards the attraction of inward investment and the development of indigenous industry in the area.IDA Ireland is actively promoting the south Kerry region to potential investors in manufacturing and international services, through its network of overseas offices and project divisions. Site development works on the IDA Ireland's Business and Technology Park, 4.66 hectares, that is, 12 acres approx. at Tiernaboul, Killarney, County Kerry, has been completed. This work involved significant landscaping and site clearance work, which has resulted in the upgrading of the overall appeal of the location.In addition, a local group of business people under the BES have completed a new building of 14,716 square feet on a site acquired from IDA Ireland on its Business and Technology Park, Tiernaboul, Killarney. IDA Ireland is actively marketing this facility to potential investors. These investments will put south Kerry in a position to compete more strongly for inward investment in the ICT, software and international services sectors.Following the recent announcement by Wilson Sports Socks in Cahirciveen to cease its operations, the development agencies, in conjunction with Kerry County Council, South Kerry Development Partnership and other local community representatives in Cahirciveen are working on initiatives to enhance job creation in the area. FÁS has had a number of meetings with the workers being made redundant to offer its full range of services. Kerry County Enterprise Board maintains an office in Cahirciveen and its range of services is available to former Wilson Sports Socks employees and other individuals who wish to commence their own businesses.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.The 1990s was a period of unprecedented growth for the country and we continue to enjoy the benefits of the social and economic progress made in that period. The economy, however, is undergoing fundamental change and it must be recognised that Ireland is no longer a low cost location for investment. Nevertheless the country maintains important and key attractions as a base from which both indigenous and foreign direct investment can profitably do business.We already have a proven track record in nurturing indigenous enterprise and in attracting foreign investment in key growth areas such as biotechnology and the information and communications technologies. Furthermore, the Government is investing unprecedented funds in developing a world-class research community in the country, which will build on our strengths and help us adapt to the changing demands of a knowledge-based, research and innovation driven European economy.Fundamental changes are taking place both in our own economy and internationally, including increased competition from EU accession countries for mobile investment. Consequently, new foundations are needed for enterprise policies that will help create the conditions to support a sustained shift to a higher skilled, higher value added and a more knowledge intensive enterprise economy. However, any new business support measures will have to meet prevailing EU State aid regulations and EU regional aid guidelines.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	599	The Irish economy is undergoing fundamental change at present and Ireland is no longer a low cost location for investment. A key component of the Government's strategy to tackle the competitiveness challenge from countries with lower labour costs is to increase the levels of investment in research, technological development and innovation in indigenous industry. This will assist indigenous companies to move up the business value-chain and to safeguard employment. In recognition of the importance of this task, the budget for Enterprise Ireland, targeted at increasing research and innovation in Irish companies, has been significantly increased in recent years.In May last, a new financial support package for indigenous industry was launched by Enterprise Ireland, which is more suitable to clients, needs. The agency has also recently launched the €10 million competitiveness fund, which is designed to build competitiveness in small and medium enterprises. The development of export markets is a critical factor in sustaining indigenous companies and Enterprise Ireland's range of supports is designed to facilitate this objective.Fundamental changes are taking place in our economy and internationally, including increased competition from EU accession countries for mobile investment. Consequently, new foundations are needed for enterprise policy that will help create the conditions to support a sustained shift to a higher skilled, higher value added and a more knowledge intensive enterprise economy. In this connection, I have recently set up an enterprise strategy group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Eoin O'Driscoll. I have asked the group to develop strategic policy recommendations for enterprise in Ireland for the period up to 2010 and to report within six to nine months.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	604	The Deputy will be aware that there is no EU Defence Ministers Council. Meetings of EU Defence Ministers are held either as part of a General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting (GAERC) in association with Ministers for Foreign Affairs (decision making forum) or as an Informal Defence Ministers meeting (non-decision making forum). I have attended a total of 15 meetings of EU Defence Ministers. In addition, Deputy Cowen, Minister for Foreign Affairs; Deputy Brennan, Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Davern, Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food and Mr. Michael O'Donoghue, Assistant Secretary General of my Department have represented me at a further four meetings. I also received an invitation from the German Minister for Defence to attend a meeting of European Defence Ministers at Bonn on 28 May 1999 in order to, inter alia, exchange views on developments, such as the Kosovo crisis, in advance of the EU Summit at Cologne. Due to prior commitments I was unable to attend and Ireland's Permanent Representative to the Western European Union, Ambassador Eamonn Ryan, represented me at the meeting.Details regarding the informal meetings are as listed in the table below:

Details of these are contained in the following table.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	607	For all normal business type electronic records there are standard backup systems and record retention procedures in place. The recording systems in place in the Department (supported where appropriate by the use of computer filing systems) have facilitated my Department's compliance with the provisions of the Freedom of Information legislation and the relevant National Archives legislation.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	608	The person named submitted three applications in respect of a total of 77 animals for special beef premium in 2002 as follows: application dated 6 February 2002 in respect of 31 animals; application dated 18 April 2002 in respect of 11 animals; application dated 31/12/2002 in respect of 35 animals.The person named qualified for slaughter premium under the 2002 scheme in respect of 40 animals.The reduction in payment to the person named arose for the following reasons. Four animals on the December 2002 application were deleted from the application as no cattle passports were available for these animals. A further four animals on the December application were rejected for payment due to non-compliance with the cattle movement monitoring system (CMMS) notifications resulting in a consequential penalty of 3.66% across all bovine schemes (special beef and slaughter). A reduction of 12.5% applicable to all applicants who applied on in excess of 50 animals in 2002 due to the overshoot of the national quota for special beef premium.This case was appealed to the agriculture appeals office who upheld the Department's decision.All payments due have been paid to the person named.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	609	Recruitment to the veterinary inspector grade is a matter for the Office of the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	610	The installation aid scheme applies to farmers aged between 18 and 35 years on the date they are first set up in farming. Where land is jointly owned, it is a condition of the scheme that both parties must be aged between 18 and 35 years on the date of set-up. As the above named person was set up on land jointly owned with another person who was outside these age limits on the date of set-up he is, therefore, ineligible for aid under the terms of the installation aid scheme.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The following are details regarding the number of animal carcase burial licences issued:

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	613	My Department has licensed ten rendering plants throughout the country of which four are approved to take in fallen animals. These four are located in Counties Waterford, Cavan, Galway and Meath. The number of bovine animals taken in to the above four plants in 2003 is 173,023.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	614	The person named submitted two applications in respect of eight animals under the 2001 special beef premium scheme and also had one animal eligible under the 2001 slaughter premium scheme. Advance payment at the rate of 80% of premium has issued in respect of two animals under the special beef premium scheme and in respect of one animal under the slaughter premium scheme.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	615	I propose to take Questions Nos. 211 and 223 together.I have been concerned for some time about the issue of food labelling and, for that reason, I established a widely representative group to examine the matter which reported to me on 10 December 2002. On the basis of the recommendations of the food labelling group, I took a number of actions which included arranging for the centralisation of control of food labelling in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; pursuing with the EU Commission the question of extending the beef labelling regulations to the catering sector; and asking the consumer liaison panel to carry out market research to identify consumer requirements on the origin of meat, including beef. While beef imports to this country constitute a small fraction of our overall production and exports, it is absolutely essential that EU labelling requirements are applied to all beef sold on the domestic market, irrespective of origin. Where there is evidence that these requirements are not adhered to, then the agency responsible for controlling the particular sector and for implementing the legislation should take the appropriate action.As regards the beef slaughtering and cutting plants under the control of my Department, I have asked the Department's veterinary inspectorate to examine the procedures in place to ensure full compliance. It is a matter for the FSAI, in conjunction with the local authorities and the health boards, to address any alleged breaches in the retail and catering sectors. I understand the FSAI is following up the matters raised.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	617	The application in this case was returned to the applicant on 1 October. As an accredited paying agency for European Union funds, my Department is obliged to carry out checks on all applications. When this application was being checked, my officials noted that an incorrect land parcel identification system, LPIS, number had been included for rented land which formed part of the holding and an incorrect river catchment number had been included for owned land. LPIS numbers in particular are an important element in the controls which my Department must operate since they provide unique identifiers establishing which land parcels are subject to REPS farming practices. LPIS numbers are also crucial to ensure that no under or over-declaration of lands has taken place. It is, therefore, imperative that the LPIS numbers quoted in REPS plans are correct. It was for that reason the application was returned for correction. The error in the river catchment was also highlighted for the applicant to enable it to also be corrected. A revised plan was received on 8 October and is currently being processed for payment.Because of the large volume of REPS applications that my officials must process, together with the constraints imposed by the detailed control procedures approved by the European Commission, it is not possible at present to operate a less formal system for correcting errors. However, these procedures remain under review and I have asked my officials to consider how they can be streamlined in the context of the proposals for changes to the scheme which I will shortly put before the European Commission.

However, having re-examined this case my Department has accepted the herdowner's claim that these inaccuracies resulted from a genuine error on his part and his 1997 application will now be processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 118.50 hectares. Special beef premium payments will issue to the person named as soon as possible. The payments will be in respect of 89 animals, of which 70 were eligible for ten month premium and 19 were eligible for 22 month premium.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The person named included a land parcel on his 2003 area aid application, which was also claimed by another herdowner. Both herdowners were written to and the person named accepted that he was not entitled to claim area aid on the parcel concerned. However, in light of representations made by the person named, the area aid unit has accepted that the herdowner included this parcel on his area aid application in genuine error. His area aid application has now been processed with an area determined of 28.59 hectares of forage land. He will be paid his full entitlement under the 2003 area based compensatory allowance scheme shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The person named has been paid €3,524.09 under the 2001 area based compensatory allowance scheme. However, processing of the 2002 and 2003 area based compensatory allowance scheme applications was delayed because of inquiries by the Department's special investigation unit into dealings by the person named in respect of her livestock. It has now been decided that payments under the area based compensatory allowance scheme should be released. Arrangements are being made to have these outstanding payments made at an early date.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The person named participated in 2002 extensification premium opting for the simplified system for the purposes of determining eligibility. On participating he chose to observe a stocking density of less than 1.40 livestock units per hectare for each and every day of 2002. Under the terms of the relevant regulation the Department is required to carry out stocking density cross-checks against the CMMS animals database prior to payment to ensure that the stocking densities as chosen were not breached. Cross-checks were carried out on 19 May 2003 and 15 September 2003 and stocking densities 1.5583 and 1.6230 livestock units per hectare, respectively, were established. These stocking densities were calculated on a total forage area of 35.47 hectares found following an area aid administrative check. This area of 35.47 hectares was the area that remained following the withdrawal by the person named of a one twelfth share of a commonage land parcel that he had included on his 2002 area aid application.The relevant EU regulation provides for herdowners who participated in extensification premium under the simplified system to change during the course of the scheme year in question between the low and the high stocking densities and vice versa. In this case, however, no such request was made to the Department by the deadline of 31 December 2002. Since a request to change from the low to the higher stocking density was not made by the year's end, it is regretted that the person named cannot be facilitated in that regard at this stage.

It is tentatively estimated that the portion of this full year cost affecting the 2002 calendar year, including the impact on the first instalment of preliminary tax, is approximately €65 million. It is tentatively estimated that the portion of this full year cost affecting the 2003 calendar year is approximately €264 million.The full year cost of reducing the standard rate of corporation tax from 16% to 12.5%, as indicated in the December 2002 budget and provided for by section 71 of the Finance Act 1999, is estimated by the Revenue Commissioners at €305 million. It is tentatively estimated that the portion of this full year cost affecting the 2003 calendar year, including the impact on the first instalment of preliminary tax, is approximately €100 million.

In response to a request from Mayo County Council, the Office of Public Works has provided machinery and personnel to assist the county council in the initial clean-up of mud and debris. I understand a detailed work programme is now being prepared by the county council. A further request to Office of Public Works for similar assistance will be given favourable consideration.

The level of funding of the health service has increased by 150% since 1997 facilitated by the resources released by strong economic growth. A recent report in the Irish Banking Review found that public expenditure on health in Ireland is now the highest in the EU at 8.6% of GNP and, in per capita terms, it is third highest behind Denmark and Luxembourg. If we want to maintain economic growth in the future, it will be necessary to sustain a competitive tax system. As regards future health funding, that is a matter for the budget.

The relief is not available in respect of fees paid for second level education. The position is that tax relief, at the standard rate, may be claimed in respect of qualifying fees paid by an individual to an approved college in respect of full-time or part-time undergraduate courses in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU and postgraduate courses both in Ireland and abroad. Undergraduate courses must be of at least two academic years' duration, while postgraduate courses must be of at least one, but not more than four, academic years' duration. Tax relief is also available in respect of fees paid for training courses of less than two years' duration in the areas of information technology and foreign languages.Tuition fees paid by an individual on his or her own behalf or on behalf of a spouse, child or person for whom the individual is the legal guardian all qualify for relief. The relief is limited to tuition fees and is not available for maintenance or other expenses incurred. No relief is available for any part of fees which are met directly or indirectly by grants, scholarships, an employer or otherwise. The maximum relief that can be claimed is set by the Minister for Education and Science. It is currently €3,175 per year in respect of third level fees. In the case of fees for training courses in foreign languages and information technology, the maximum relief is set at €1,270 per annum and no relief is due where the fees for the course are less than €315.

The Civil Service is an equal opportunity employer. Recruitment to posts within the Civil Service is on the basis of merit and is contingent on applicants satisfying the stated eligibility requirements for open recruitment positions. These requirements are set out in the relevant statutory competition regulations and would include character and health in addition to academic and general ability.When considering an applicant's suitability to compete for appointment to a post in the Civil Service, the commissioners are conscious of their responsibilities and legal obligations. The commissioners operate under the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956 and section 17 of that Act obliges them to satisfy themselves in a number of respects before making an offer of appointment. Section 17(d) relates to suitability on character grounds. Having a criminal record need not necessarily prevent a person being appointed to a position in the Civil Service. Each such prospective appointment is examined on a case by case basis.

This agreement has yet to be finalised between the legal representatives of both sides. The persons covered by the settlement will be former female clerical assistants-clerical officers who made equal pay claims in 1997, as well as clerical officers, both male and female, who were serving as a clerical assistant or a clerical officer on 24 September 1997 – the  date of CPSU grade restructuring – and are still serving in the clerical officer grade on 16 May 2003, the date of the CPSU annual delegate conference, when the settlement terms were adopted. I estimate that approximately 6,800 people will be covered by the settlement which will result in a payment of approximately €5,000 per person. The outline agreement requires that a substantial majority of the 1997 claimants accept the settlement and withdraw their claims. If this condition is fulfilled, I hope that payments can be made in the current year.

However, I am aware of the campaign referred to and can address the issue in the context of my responsibility for public service pensions generally.As regards the background to this case, I am advised that a 1983 arbitration finding recommended that certain Garda allowances should be made pensionable with effect from 1 October 1982. The finding was applied only to personnel who retired on or after that date. The pensionability of the Garda unsocial hours allowance was treated in a similar way when it was introduced. It was applied, with effect from 1 January 1994, to personnel who retired or died in service on or after 1 January 1993. The position was consistent with that in other areas of the public service where in the context of making allowances pensionable the benefits were confined to those retiring after a specified date and did not extend to pensioners who retired before that date.

Since taking office as Minister for Finance in June 1997, there have been 79 meetings of the ECOFIN Council. Of these 79 meetings, I have attended 73 meetings. I have attended all the informal meetings.When I was unable to attend, the Irish delegation was headed up on one occasion by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, on two occasions by Ms Anne Anderson, Ireland's Permanent Representative to the European Union, on one occasion by Mr. Denis O'Leary, Ireland's former Permanent Representative to the European Union and on two occasions by Mr. James Brennan, formerly Ireland's Deputy Permanent Representative to the European Union.The Deputy will be aware that last year the Budget Council, which met twice a year to progress the annual EU budget for the succeeding year, was absorbed into the ambit of the ECOFIN Council. In accordance with normal practice, the Minister of State at my Department led the Irish delegation at Budget Council and now leads the Irish delegation at the twice yearly additional ECOFIN meetings specifically dedicated to the EU budget. The people in question are the former Minister of State, now Minister, Deputy Cullen, and the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. The Irish delegation at the Budget Council in December 1998 was headed up by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the former Deputy Byrne.The European Council of Heads of State or Government normally meets four times a year. From time to time, when there is a relevant item regarding finance on the agenda, I have accompanied the Taoiseach at these meetings. I have attended 16 of these meetings since June 1997.

With the transfer of supervisory responsibilities, it is now a matter for the authority to complete the transposition process under existing regulatory powers.** Prior to the latest amendment to the directive, transposition was by administrative action. It was expected that this amendment could have been similarly transposed. However, following direct contact, including meeting with the European Commission, earlier this year, clarification was obtained that legislation (Statutory Instrument under the European Communities Act 1972) would be required to formally transpose the directive. Furthermore, as the amendment applies to both public and private undertakings, it took some time to clarify the respective roles of the various relevant implementing agencies in this country.

In deciding on whether to proceed with such meetings, account is taken of the background both of the opposition group and of the representative seeking the meeting. It would, for instance, be inappropriate to meet with persons advocating or supporting terrorist activities.As the Deputy will be aware from my reply to a similar question on 1 October 2003, there have been a number of reports relating to the subject of his question which gave rise to concern about his background. It did not prove possible to satisfactorily allay these concerns. Accordingly, my Department was not in a position to accede to the request for a meeting. I am not aware of any official statement concerning this person having been made by the Government of Switzerland either immediately prior to his visit to Ireland or in the time which has elapsed since.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	650	The National Archives has statutory responsibility for records of Departments and oversees the ongoing implementation of the National Archives Act 1986 with regard to the preservation or disposal of such records and their transfer to the National Archives. In July 2003 an archivist with specific responsibility for electronic records was appointed to the National Archives. This archivist will develop strategies for the long-term preservation of electronic records and advise Departments on best practice with regard to the electronic records and draft guidelines in this regard.The Department of Foreign Affairs policy continues to be that the paper record is the official record of the Department and officers are instructed to print down all electronic records and to place the hard copy on the appropriate manual file. However, the Department's strategy statement for 2003 to 2005 identifies the need to develop and implement an improved strategy for the effective management, storage, retrieval and transmission of information in order to meet the business needs of the Department. The Department's ICT strategy also identifies a similar priority. It is expected that work on this will begin, in conjunction with the National Archives, after the Presidency of the European Union finishes.The Freedom of Information Acts 1997 and 2003 provide, inter alia, for the right to access official records held by Departments. The definition of records includes records held or stored manually or electronically. Although the Department's policy is that all records should be placed on manual files, there is always the possibility that, due to time-lags, manual files may not contain the most current papers. In this regard, the Department's freedom of information manual instructs decision-makers to extract relevant electronic records.In order to facilitate searches under the Freedom of Information Acts and ensure a properly maintained network, advice from the Department's ICT unit indicates that, in line with best practice, electronic records such as e-mails, draft memoranda, letters, etc. should be stored in dedicated folders rather than in general directories or in-boxes. By storing the information in such folders, searches for and retrieval of records can be carried out in the most effective and timely manner. In order to facilitate such searches, our e-mail and other software packages contain search facilities that enable searches to be carried out on a key word basis.

The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Kitt, has responsibility for overseas development and human rights and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, has responsibility for European affairs. The cost of providing transport in respect of the Ministers of State consists of the salary and subsistence costs of their drivers as well as payments for mileage costs incurred by the Ministers of State in the performance of their official duties. A breakdown of the costs involved, in respect of each Minister of State, is shown in the following table:Transport Costs for Minister of State Kitt from 6 June 2002 to Date

It is expected that approximately 120 staff will be  employed there and that the office will become fully operational by autumn 2004. Staff will move to Balbriggan on a phased basis during next year.Vacancies in the Balbriggan office will be filled, in the first instance, by internal redeployment of Department of Foreign Affairs staff. However, the number of departmental staff who will transfer to Balbriggan is expected to fall short of the total number required to operate the new office. The shortfall in numbers will be made up by the import of staff from other Departments. A circular will be issued on this subject by the Department of Finance in due course to the personnel sections of all Departments and offices. The circular will set out the grades in which vacancies will arise in Balbriggan and the conditions and timeframe under which applications may be made.The person to whom the Deputy refers should make contact with the personnel officer in his own Department in the first instance to indicate his interest in being considered for one of these vacancies if the opportunity should arise.

On my instructions, the Irish Embassy in London contacted the solicitor of the person to whom the Deputy refers and they have now been informed that it is not open to the individual to lodge an appeal against his conviction because he pleaded guilty at his original trial and was given a mandatory sentence. I understand, however, that his solicitors are now in the process of investigating the possibility of making representations to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, CCRC, seeking to have his case reopened. My Department will continue to keep in contact with the person to whom the Deputy refers and his solicitor and his family, and to provide all appropriate consular assistance and advice.

Although we must respect the internal Colombian judicial process, I expressed our hope that the issue would be concluded as soon as possible when I met the Colombian Foreign Minister, Ms Carolina Barco, at the recent UN General Assembly in New York. My Department will continue to follow this case closely and provide all possible consular assistance to the men.

The restrictions imposed by the Israelis on the movement of Palestinians in the occupied territories have resulted in severe stress on the Palestinian economy and social and economic hardship for the Palestinian people.In my statement of 9 September on the Middle East, I drew attention to the important Amnesty International report, Surviving Under Siege, which documents the effects of this policy and illustrates the futility of trying to ensure security through walls rather than resolute action for peace. The Israeli policy was also discussed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council held on 29 September. Ministers called on Israel to freeze the construction of the separation fence, which results in confiscation of Palestinian land, restricts movement of people and goods and hinders a just political solution to the conflict.

Since I became Minister for Foreign Affairs in January 2000, I have attended all meetings of the General Affairs Council – renamed the General Affairs and External Relations Council at the Seville European Council in June 2002 – with the exception of 11 meetings when urgent business obliged me to be elsewhere.I was represented on these occasions by the following: the former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kitt, on 18 September 2000 and on 29 October 2001; the former Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation, Deputy Eoin Ryan, on 22 January 2001 and on 18 and 19 February 2002; the former Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Hanafin, on 25 June 2001; Ambassador Denis O'Leary, Permanent Representative to the EU, on 19 March 2001; Ambassador Anne Anderson, Permanent Representative of Ireland to the EU, on 13 May 2002; and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche, on 22 July 2002, on 14 April 2003, on 21 July 2003 and again on 13 October 2003.Between June 1997 and January 2000, my predecessors attended each of the General Affairs Council meetings which took place during their periods in office, with ten exceptions. They were represented on these occasions by the following: Ambassador Denis O'Leary, Permanent Representative of Ireland to the EU, on 15 September 1997 and 26 January 1998; the former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Liz O'Donnell, on 24 November 1997; the former Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, on 12 December 1997 and 18 May 1998; the former Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, on 30 March 1998 and 21 June 1999; the former Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív, on 8 June 1998; the former Minister of State, Deputy Cullen, on 5 October 1998; and Mr. Gerry Corr, senior official, on 29 July 1999.My predecessors and I have attended all the informal foreign ministers' meetings which have taken place since June 1997, with the exception of the meeting on 6 May 2001, which I was unable to attend.

I am unaware of the reports to which the Deputy refers and in the light of the critical statements by the United States, Russia, the European Union Presidency and the Secretary General of the United Nations it would be difficult to interpret the Quartet reaction as any kind of approval. The position of the Government on Mr. Arafat's security was made clear in my statement of 12 September and is well known to the Government of Israel. That position is unchanged and was also conveyed in the Taoiseach's most recent letter to Mr. Arafat on 9 October.

The scheme also provides that grants may not be paid to candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing a second postgraduate qualification. Notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are progressing to a further postgraduate course at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the previous postgraduate qualification was attained, may be deemed eligible for grant aid.As the case cited by the Deputy does not involve progression at postgraduate level for purposes of the scheme, the student in question is not eligible for grant assistance under the terms of the scheme. My Department does not accept the points made by the student in question regarding postgraduate progression in the context of the scheme and a detailed response on the points raised will issue to the student.

It highlights a number of trends and issues of which we as policy makers must now be cognisant in pursuit of our national strategic priorities and my Department will be working with all of the other relevant agencies concerned in seeking to make progress on these. There are two major recommendations of immediate relevance to the biotechnology sector that have been referred to by the Deputy. These relate to the continuation of capital funding for the programme for research in third-level institutions, PRTLI, and the implementation of the range of recommendations of the report of the task force on physical sciences.In November 2002 I announced a pause in relation to all capital developments in the third-level sector, including capital projects under Cycle 3 of the PRTLI, pending clarification of the future funding position. I am well aware of the strategic importance of this programme. However, I have to balance the demand for resources for projects under PRTLI with the competing demands of many other meritorious programmes in the education area. My Department is currently engaged in the Estimates campaign with the Department of Finance, which will determine the resources available for the education sector. The allocation of the available funding on the basis of policy priorities can only be determined when the funding for 2004 for my Department is decided.

The application is being considered, along with many other applications, for inclusion in any expansion of the pilot devolved initiative. This initiative, which is focused on small, mostly rural schools, is aimed at devolving responsibility for the planning and construction phases of improvement works to school authorities.The school building programme will be published early in 2004 and will indicate projects which will proceed during the course of the year. The scale of the programme will be dependent on the level of funding being made available for capital projects through the budgetary process. It is not possible for my Department to purchase a site at Cahergal national school. The existing site will have to cater for a refurbishment and extension that could be delivered as part of any expansion of the pilot devolved initiative, or an extension to the site could be purchased by the school authorities from their own resources.

As a rule, post-primary school transport routes are planned so that, as far as possible, no eligible child will have more than two miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way, or be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as being part of the school transport scheme. As the family's level of service is within guidelines, it is not open to my Department to sanction a re-routing of service at additional cost.

My Department is currently re-examining this case and the school will be advised of the outcome in due course.

Since that time, the numbers have increased almost three-fold, with 127 psychologists now serving, including seven new entrants who took up duty since the beginning of this year. In addition, there are approximately 16 other educational psychologists in the wider educational sector, including Dublin city and county vocational education committees and residential institutions for young offenders, bringing the total number of psychologists in the system to 143.In light of the Government decision on Civil Service numbers, my Department does not propose to recruit any more psychologists before the end of the year. Government policy on public sector numbers, along with budgetary provisions in 2004 and subsequent years, will determine the rate of further recruitment of psychologists to NEPS.

These figures were compiled in April 2003. While five additional psychologists have  joined NEPS since that date, they are still on induction so the figures remain approximately the same. The following table shows the coverage of schools by region and the numbers of students with access to the service. NEPS has informed me that there is full coverage of all mainstream schools in County Kerry and in the Connemara Gaeltacht and practically full coverage in the east coast area. However, difficulty has been encountered in recruiting psychologists to a number of regions, notably the midlands, north west and mid-west.Percentage of schools covered by NEPS by Region (April 2003)

This enables schools that do not yet have access to the NEPS service to have children psychologically assessed in urgent cases. Details of the scheme have been circulated to all schools and are also available on my Department's website.

All such applications are referred to the national educational psychological service, NEPS, for consideration and recommendation of the nature and level of special support required in each case. A recommendation in the case in question has now been received and my Department will be in contact with the school authorities in relation to this matter very shortly.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	688	On 11 May 1999 the Taoiseach on behalf of the State apologised to the victims of childhood abuse and announced a range of measures the Government intended to introduce to assist victims.In 2002 the Oireachtas enacted the Residential Institutions Redress Act to provide a means for making financial awards to assist people who as children were abused while resident in certain institutions in which the State had a regulatory function.In framing the legislation, the Government was conscious that a significant number of former residents who were eligible to make an application for redress in their own right were in ill-health or elderly and that it was probable that some would pass away before they would get the opportunity to make an application to the Residential Institutions Redress Board.With this in mind and to avoid a situation where a person's application would fail on death, the Government took the proactive step of including section 9 in the Redress Act. This enables the spouse or children of a person who was entitled to make an application but died since 11 May 1999, the date of the Taoiseach's apology, to make an application.Essentially, the legislation is applicable from 11 May 1999. Therefore, it is not possible for the spouse or children of a person that died before that date to make an application as the person concerned was not in a position to make an application in their own right.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	689	I am happy to inform the Deputy that the team in the national educational psychological service, NEPS, that serves County Kerry is now practically up to strength. All mainstream primary and post-primary schools in the county now have access to the NEPS service.At the beginning of each school year, NEPS psychologists visit the schools assigned to them, discuss with the school principals the needs that are to be addressed and agree on a programme of work. The psychologists aim to divide the available time between casework with individual pupils and indirect interventions which have a more preventive focus.As part of this process, the school principal agrees with the psychologist on the number of pupils to be assessed during the course of the school year and the principal then identifies such pupils in order of priority. When making their service plans for the year, NEPS psychologists keep a certain percentage of time unallocated so that they may deal with additional or urgent cases that may arise.At this stage of the school year, the programmes of work are being developed by school principals and psychologists. To ascertain the number of pupils awaiting assessment for the purpose of allocating additional resources, it would be necessary to survey all the schools in the county. This would divert the psychologists from their core work in schools. However, I am confident that the NEPS team in Kerry is sufficiently resourced to be able to respond to the vast majority of cases of genuine need during the current school year.

This project is at stages four to five of architectural planning, namely, detail design/bill of quantities. It has been assigned a band one rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale primary school projects. This is the highest rating possible.Due to the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already under construction, projects in section 6 of the school building programme will not be authorised to progress beyond their current stage of architectural planning for the time being. The timing of when these projects can proceed to tender and construction is dependent on the capital allocation for 2004 and subsequent years.My Department is aware of the level of planned housing developments in the general Dublin 15 area. In this regard, following consultation with the local authority, a number of sites have been reserved for school provision, including a site at Ongar. While delivering accommodation in rapidly developing areas is a key priority of the school building section in my Department, the timing of this delivery is again dependent on the financial allocation for 2004 and subsequent years.

I do not, however, accept that there is a crisis in post-primary school provision in this area.Officials of the school planning section of my Department, in conjunction with the local authority, are monitoring developments in the area to assess the likely impact on school provision. Already, through the local authority, sites for post-primary schools have been reserved at Phibblestown and at Hansfield. Additional measures required to address any identified deficiency in post-primary provision in the area will be considered as part of the 2004 school building programme.

The criteria for the allocation of SEN resources are contained in Department Circulars 07/02, 08/02 and 24/03. Copies of these circulars have been circulated to schools and are available on my Department's website, www.education.ie

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	696	The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and Rule 64(1) of the Rules for National Schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she or he may be enrolled in a national school. Children of compulsory school-going age must have a place in a national school and, overall, there are more than enough places available.Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.My Department's inspectorate, in some instances, endeavours to source appropriate school placements for special needs pupils. In this regard, the parent of the pupil referred to by the Deputy may wish to contact the special education section of my Department setting out directly the details of the case.In certain circumstances, my Department allocates supplementary resources to schools to support pupils who have been clinically assessed as having special educational needs. It is open to the national school in question to submit an application to my Department for such resources should it be unable to support the enrolment from within its current staffing capacity.If a school placement cannot be facilitated within a reasonable period, a grant may be given to the parent of the child to fund tuition by a qualified teacher, where available, in the child's home. Any application for this grant should be made to the home tuition desk at the special education section of my Department in Athlone.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard, a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a certain area or of a specific age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy, a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000 which, subject to very limited exceptions, prohibits schools from discriminating against people in a number of matters, including the admission or the terms or conditions of admissions of a person as a pupil to the school.

The revised syllabus in leaving certificate home economics became the approved syllabus on 1 November 2002. The leaving certificate examinations in June 2004 will be based on this revised syllabus.The syllabus has not been changed since the 1970s. Perhaps the most important change from the point of view of quality of learning and teaching is the new emphasis on practical work. There had been a reliance on terminal examinations alone which is rectified in the revised syllabus.On foot of a Government decision of 6 March 2003, the State Examinations Commission has been established with statutory responsibility for operational matters relating to the national certificate examinations. This would include the deadline for submitting journals of practical work. Consequently I am referring the Deputy's question to the chief executive officer of the commission for direct reply.

The new services will be phased in and my Department has allocated a budget of €5.4 million to the board for 2003 to begin developing the services involved.A management team was put in place earlier this year. Some 36 new staff are being recruited which will bring the total number of staff delivering the educational welfare services nationally to 73. Five regional teams in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford will be established and the staff will be deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme. A service will also be provided in cases where children have been permanently excluded from education.Decisions relating to the assignment of educational welfare officers to specific areas are a matter for the board which is an independent statutory authority. I understand, however, that final decisions regarding the location of the newly recruited staff will be taken by the board shortly.

One is a policy on record management covering procedures relating to the creation, maintenance and eventual disposition of records. The policy includes the legal requirements relating to the preservation of records in accordance with the national archives legislation and procedures concerning the preservation of electronic records, including e-mail, computer-generated reports and documents prepared on personal productivity software, for example, word processing software.Another element is a policy on file maintenance which sets out the procedures for filing and associating records on individual files to ensure that records are stored correctly and can be retrieved as quickly as possible, particularly in the context of the Freedom of Information Acts.

The reduction in overall funding available to the Arts Council in 2003 was regrettable but unavoidable given the national economic context applying, and must be seen against the backdrop of increases in funding of more than 80% between 1997 and 2002.As for every year, funding for 2004 will be determined through the annual Estimates process, and in that context I will be putting forward the best possible case for the funding of the arts, including the Arts Council.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	725	As the Deputy is aware, I announced the national extension of BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme on 27 March, 2003. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the southern area will be located at South Infirmary/Victoria Hospital, with three associated mobile units. Counties covered include Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford and Tipperary South Riding. The BreastCheck clinical unit in the western area will be at University College Hospital Galway, with two associated mobile units. The area of coverage is counties Galway, Sligo, Roscommon, Donegal, Mayo, Leitrim, Clare and Tipperary North Riding. Under the extension, approximately 150,000 women in the target population 50 to 64 years of age will be eligible for screening. The programme expects to diagnose approximately 510 cancers per annum among this population.Under the business plan submitted by BreastCheck to the Department, the national expansion of the programme to the west and south is costed at €27 million, including €13 million capital costs. It is anticipated that additional costs will be incurred by the host hospitals and these are being assessed at present. Approval has issued for the establishment of two capital project teams to develop a brief for the capital infrastructure needed for the static units in the south and west. This approval will allow for the immediate commencement of the detailed planning for the national roll-out.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	726	As the Deputy is aware, last week I launched the report of the expert working group on the development of radiation oncology services in Ireland. I have arranged for copies of the report to be made available to Deputies. The report provides a detailed plan for the further development of radiation oncology services in this country. The Government has accepted the recommendations of this report.The Government agrees that a major programme is now required to rapidly develop clinical radiation oncology treatment services to modern standards. Furthermore, the Government has agreed that the first step of such a new programme should be the development of a clinical network of large centres in Dublin, Cork and Galway. I agree with the report's conclusion that this is the best model to provide a radiation oncology service to the highest standards. These centres will collectively have the staff and treatment infrastructure to permit a rapid increase in patient access to appropriate radiation therapy and will form the backbone of the future service expansion. This is the best model to rapidly provide a radiation oncology service. The development of radiation oncology services along the lines recommended in this report is the single most important priority of my Department in cancer services in the acute setting.

The first report of the working group was published in March 2001 and recommended the enhancement and expansion of the overall child and adolescent psychiatric service, including the recruitment of additional consultant child and adolescent psychiatrists.Additional revenue funding of €6.061 million was allocated in 2002 to provide for the appointment of additional consultants for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further €1.64 million was allocated in 2003. It is envisaged that these developments will have an impact on the waiting times for initial psychiatric assessment in the relevant health board areas.The first report also recommended that a total of seven child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units for children ranging from six to 16 years should be developed throughout the country. Project teams have been established to develop child and adolescent in-patient psychiatric units in Cork, Limerick, Galway and in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	731	My Department has recently developed a system  to support the management of its paper records but does not have an overarching system which includes electronic records and other media. Each functional area manages one or more dedicated storage areas which facilitate the efficient search and retrieval of records sought under the Freedom of Information Acts. The corporate computer and network usage policy includes advice to staff on the management of e-mail and the use of shared facilities to ensure that electronic documents are copied to secure backup. There are a variety of electronic records systems including those for the management of parliamentary questions, ministerial representations, and the requests under the Freedom of Information Act. Each of these has a flexible search facility. Other application systems in support of specific functions have their own records management structure and specific search tools. While the Department's backup arrangements preserve the records for future use, there are long-term archival issues relating to the obsolescence of technology which fall to be addressed by the National Archives.

Applicants, whether from this or another jurisdiction, must satisfy the provisions of an EU directive in order to be considered for such posts. Arrangements for the recruitment of suitably qualified general practitioners to fill vacant GMS posts are for the chief executive officers of the relevant health boards to make, having regard to the qualification and other provisions of the GMS contract. Accordingly, this particular case was referred to the Midland Health Board for investigation. I have been informed that while there are rare occasions when the board may temporarily take over responsibility for the management of a GP's GMS panel list, due to the unplanned resignation-retirement of a GP, the board makes every effort where practicable to appoint a suitable Irish doctor to the position.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	734	At the outset, I should point out that there are no plans to introduce legislation in this country which would permit the deliberate destruction of human embryos. At EU level, discussions are under way on a proposed EU directive which will set minimum standards for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells for human application. However, it should be noted that the proposed directive does not affect the decisions of individual member states to prohibit any of the aforementioned activities, including the use of any specific type of human tissue or cell. The Irish position and that of any other member state that wishes to prohibit activities such as embryo research where the embryo is destroyed, is therefore safeguarded.In relation to assisted human reproduction services generally, including embryo research, while there is no legislation regulating this area at present, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These state that the creation of new forms of life for experimental purposes or the deliberate and intentional destruction of human life already formed is professional misconduct. Against a background of concern about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate this area and with a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, and following a Government decision on the matter, I established the commission on assisted human reproduction in March 2000 with the following terms of reference:To prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area.When completed, the commission's report will provide the basis for informing public debate prior to the finalisation of any policy proposals. I understand that the commission's report will be completed within the next few months.

The board has informed my Department that there has been significant development of the home help service over the last number of years with 2.6 million home help hours being provided to clients in the board's functional area in 2002. In addition, the number of clients in receipt of a home help service increased from 4,000 in 2000 to 7,000 in 2002.In recognition of the importance of this service, the board has pointed out that funding of €30 million is being allocated for the provision of this service in 2003. This will enable the board to provide approximately 2.6 million home help hours to 7,000 clients in 2003, which is equivalent to the number of people who received a service in 2002. The board has further stated that expenditure on the home help service accounts for 25% of total expenditure on community services for older people in the board's area.The home help service by its nature is a flexible service which responds to clients' needs. As a result, therefore, the level of service required in individual cases will fluctuate from time to time. To ensure effective prioritisation of the service the board has advised my Department that assessments are undertaken at local sector level and are carried out in all cases by the board's public health nursing service with the service being targeted at high and medium dependency clients in accordance with their assessed need.

I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the SHB area and on a national basis.In the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services in 2001, of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. The SHB was allocated an additional €1.191 million in 2001 for orthodontic services of which €1.032 million was for the orthodontic initiative. The post of consultant orthodontist for Tralee was advertised through the Local Appointments Commission, LAC, on two separate occasions but unfortunately there were no successful candidates. The efforts of the board are hindered by the limited availability of suitably qualified candidates for the post.

To date, more than 7,200 patients have received treatment under the NTPF. The fund has the capacity to treat up to 800 patients per month predominantly in Ireland and in four hospitals in the UK. The NTPF will continue to identify capacity to treat those public patients who have been waiting longest for treatment. My Department has asked the chief executive officer of the NTPF to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the information requested.

The provision of health and personal social services to victims of sexual violence in Cork and Kerry is a matter in the first instance for the Southern Health Board. My Department has made considerable extra resources available in recent years to the health boards which has led to an increased provision of services to female victims of violence.Within the framework of the southern regional planning committee on violence against women, the Southern Health Board works closely with the Cork Rape Crisis Centre and the Kerry Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre and provides funding to these two organisations. I understand that the board is in discussion with each centre towards the development of service agreements which will include an examination of funding requirements in 2004.

The provision of a new 72 bed community hospital in Dingle has been prioritised by the Southern Health Board under the National Development Plan 2001-2006. The design team for this project was appointed in July 2001. A grant of planning permission was issued by Kerry County Council for the project on 22 July 2002. The stage three report consisting of the scheme design and cost plan was approved by my Department in June of this year. The design team are completing the detailed design and tender documents at present. It is expected that these will be completed by the end of this year and that approval will be sought from my Department to seek tenders as early as possible in 2004.

The Southern Health Board included a proposal to develop a 14 bed extension to Kenmare community hospital as part of its National Development Plan 2000-2006. This was scheduled to commence during the latter part of the plan. The board completed a draft accommodation brief for the project which was submitted to my Department earlier this year.My Department is at present examining the health capital programme for 2004 and beyond to ascertain what new projects can be progressed through either planning or construction stages, taking account of existing commitments and overall funding resources available. It is in this context that my Department will continue to liaise with the Southern Health Board regarding the proposed development at Kenmare community hospital in the light of the board's overall capital funding priorities.

The board included a proposal to develop a 50  bed community nursing unit in Tralee as part of its National Development Plan 2000-2006 which was submitted to my Department.A project team was established in May 2001 to progress this development. The project team has identified the preferred site for this development on land attached to Tralee General Hospital. The selected site is a three acre site, accessible from the Killerisk Road, which will allow for the community nursing unit to be developed independently from the general hospital campus.The project team has prepared a design brief and the cost of the project is in the order of €8.5 million at a September 2002 price base date, excluding revenue costs. My Department gave approval to the appointment of a design team in February 2003. The design team has submitted the stage two report which has been approved by my Department. My Department fully appreciates the importance of progressing this development and will continue to work closely with the Southern Health Board on this project.

This is usually secured by becoming a member of one of the two mutual defence bodies which operate in Ireland. The bulk of the cost of this cover is reimbursed to doctors by their employers. The obligation to compensate a person who sustains personal injuries arising from negligent treatment delivered by a doctor lies with the defence body of which the doctor was a member. I have made it clear to one of the defence bodies which has indicated to its Irish members that it may not meet the cost of these claims that the Government regards this position as unacceptable. I have further informed it that the Government will take whatever action is required to ensure that it fulfils its obligation to its Irish members.

Although these clinics have served the communities of Counties Galway, Mayo and Roscommon satisfactorily for the past number of years, the Western Health Board is obliged to keep up to date with best practice.Current best practice for cervical smear clinics recommends that they should be a doctor-led service and, in addition, that the results must be interpreted by a medical practitioner in the context of the patient's overall history. Medico-legal advice also confirms this view. The board has indicated that both nursing and medical practitioners have expressed the wish that best practice guidelines be followed.The Western Health Board has, over the last number of years, promoted the development of women's health and family planning clinics at general practitioner level. It should be noted that under phase one of the national cervical screening programme, smear tests are taken primarily in GP clinics as well as in family planning-Well Woman clinics. Clinical responsibility for smears taken in the clinics and their follow-up rests with the medical practitioner.The Western Health Board has indicated that a cervical smear testing service is available from GP practices; family planning clinics; Well Woman clinics and women's health sessions, which are provided by a number of GPs in the region for women who are medical card holders.The Western Health Board has further advised that women who have attended the public health nurse cervical smear service should contact their general practitioner for their results. The public health nurses who had responsibility for the cervical smear clinics will continue to provide public health nursing services throughout the Western Health Board.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	754	Many children with significant disabilities may already be covered by the medical card scheme having regard to their own particular needs and circumstances. My Department has not estimated the cost of extending medical card coverage to all children with a significant disability, since the term "significant disability" is open to many interpretations. However, as the Deputy is aware the health strategy includes a commitment that significant improvements will be made in the medical card income guidelines in order to increase the number of persons on low income who are eligible for a medical card and to give priority to families with children and particularly children with a disability. This should be viewed in the broader context of the strategy's emphasis on fairness and its stated objective of reducing health inequalities in our society. Due to the prevailing budgetary situation, I regret that it is not possible to meet this commitment this year but the Government remains committed to the introduction of the necessary changes within the lifetime of this Government. The situation will be kept under review. I remind the Deputy that additional revenue and capital funding of €50 million is being made available to services for people with disabilities in 2003.

Section 61 of the Health Act 1970 states that a health board "may make arrangements to assist in the maintenance at home of certain categories of people". Broad guidelines were then drawn up by the health board chief executive officers in order that the scheme could be administered in a flexible manner.The increase in expenditure on home help services since the year 2000 is 113.59%. The level of funding allocated to this service is determined by each health board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority from within their overall financial determination. In addition, my Department allocates, from time to time, specific additional funding to improve the level of home help service provided and, also, the pay of home helps. This has happened, in recent years, as follows:

As the Deputy may also be aware, the introduction of a home based subvention was recommended in the national health strategy Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You and in the report Review of the Nursing Home Subvention Scheme. This approach is consistent with Government policy of maintaining older people in their own homes in dignity and independence for as long as possible in accordance with their wishes. The introduction of a home based subvention scheme will be undertaken in consultation with other Government Departments, including the Department of Social and Family Affairs, and issues such as the payment of carer's allowance and means testing will be taken into account as part of the development of an integrated approach to the payment for care in the home.

The next stage of the process is an oral consultation which is being held within the next two weeks. One of the many issues being dealt with in the course of the consultation process is access to post-adoption information.

As part of the process of monitoring compliance with health and safety requirements, including the prohibition on smoking in the workplace, authorised officers from the health boards, the Office of Tobacco Control and the Health and Safety Authority will visit premises as part of their enforcement duties. I expect that the vast majority of employers, employees and the public will comply with the new health and safety measure which is being introduced primarily to protect people from exposure to toxic environmental tobacco smoke. Decisions on additional staff required to enforce and administer the proposed environmental tobacco smoke regulations will be finalised in the context my Department's Vote for 2004. A decision to call the Garda to a premises for whatever reason is a matter for the person in charge.

It has implications for every organisation in the system and there will, in some cases, be new structures. This will require a fundamental reform of the existing statutory provisions in relation to the roles, functions, organisation structure and management of the health system.In line with the Department's approach on the reform programme, an action project has been established to prepare this legislation, which will provide the statutory basis for the establishment of the new agencies, in line with the Government decision regarding the implementation of the Brennan and Prospectus reports' recommendations. The legislation will also incorporate any other consequential changes which may be necessary to give effect to the reformed health system. It will also incorporate legislative proposals arising from the other action projects. I envisage that I will be in a position to introduce the necessary legislation next year.

It should be noted that franchising is the mechanism of procuring public transport services not only in London but also in a number of other cities such as Stockholm, Copenhagen, Helsinki and Adelaide. The research studies, which underpin my approach to public transport reform, are departmental research carried out as a precursor to the consultation paper, A New Institutional and Regulatory Framework for Public Transport which supported the introduction of franchising; independent research conducted by the European Commission and published as the ISOTOPE report also supported tendering and led the Commission to introduce legislative proposals requiring competitive tendering for the allocation of transport subsidies; independent consultants, NERA and TIS, working for the public transport partnership forum carried out a comparative international review of public transport provision and regulation and also recommended in favour of the introduction of competitive tendering in the greater Dublin area.My Department continues to update its research so as to be aware of the latest developments and to learn lessons from the practical implementation of relevant regulatory models.

The question of the relationship that the corps will have with the Garda and, in particular, whether it will be under the overall control of the Commissioner is central to the development of this proposal.The establishment of a dedicated traffic corps which is independent of the Garda, would require the introduction of legislation, in particular to establish powers and functions of the corps and its accountability.A working group has been established to urgently consider the options available in terms of progressing this proposal. This group will be chaired by my Department and will comprise representatives from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Síochána, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Office of the Director of Traffic.

In the reply, I stated that I have asked my Department to examine moving to a permanent electronic record system and to advise me of the feasibility of same and report back to me.

This translates as a daily Luas patronage of approximately 60,000 passengers per day or 8,500 passengers in the morning peak hour.Based on current estimates of revenue from fare box and projected operations and maintenance cost for Luas, it is estimated that Luas will operate at approximately break-even during full operational years.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	779	The subsidy for Dublin Bus was €56 million in 2002 which equates to around €0.4 per passenger journey and to 36% of the passenger revenue.The operating subsidy for DART services was €15.5 million in 2002, equivalent to around €0.8 per passenger journey and 67% of revenue. These figures involve an apportionment between DART and other suburban services of shared costs and disaggregation of revenue and passenger revenues. Based on current estimates of revenue from fare box, projected operations and maintenance costs for Luas, the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, estimates that Luas will operate at approximately break-even during full operational years.Operating subsidy per passenger and as a percentage of revenue is a function of costs, fare yield per passenger and level of service provided. Given the work being undertaken in my Department on forthcoming regulatory change in the bus market and on fares increases, I am not in a position at this stage to provide the Deputy with projections which have a high degree of accuracy.

The cost per passenger on either tram is €7,060.Dublin Bus paid €270,000 per unit for the buses recently purchased, which equates to a cost per passenger of €3,000. The expected life service of a bus is 12 years, while that of a tram is 30 years. Accordingly, over the life of the asset, the average annual cost per seat per tram is €235 and that per bus is €250.

With effect from 25 August 2003, safety belt related offences by drivers of vehicles attract penalty points.In general, each occupant of a passenger car is required to wear a safety belt or an appropriate child restraint, as the case may be. The driver of a vehicle is obliged to ensure that an occupant of the vehicle who is under 17 years of age is either restrained by an appropriate child restraint or, provided he or she is four years old and upwards, is wearing a safety belt.The requirements to wear a safety belt do not apply in respect of the use of a vehicle in which the fitment of safety belts is not mandatory. For cars first registered before 1 June 1971 seat belts are not required in any seating position. Cars registered between 1 June 1971 and 31 December 1991 are required to have safety belts fitted to the driver's seat and the outermost front seat. Cars registered on or after 1 January 1992 are required to have safety belts fitted to all forward facing seats.Buses and coaches are not at present required to be equipped with safety belts either under Irish or EU law.In accordance with EU Directive 2003/03, I intend to make the wearing of seat belts compulsory in all goods vehicles and in buses and coaches other than those used on staged stop urban services, as soon as the necessary standards for safety systems including belts, seats, head restraints and anchorages have been agreed at European level.

The report of the taxi hardship panel recommends the establishment of a scheme to provide payments to individual taxi licence holders who fall into one of six categories that the panel assessed as having suffered extreme personal financial hardship arising from taxi liberalisation. Any payments to be made on foot of these recommendations will not represent compensation but rather compassionate payments in respect of extreme personal financial hardship.I am aware of the report of the EU Committee on Petitions regarding its fact-finding mission to Ireland in connection with the effects of taxi liberalisation. I met with the delegation from the committee on 4 April 2003 and outlined the background to taxi liberalisation and the establishment of the taxi hardship panel to it. I also explained that based on legal precedent there can be no legal duty on the State to compensate taxi licence holders in relation to open market licence values that may have existed prior to liberalisation. This position remains unchanged and I have no proposals for any payments beyond the recommendations of the panel report.Area Development Management Limited, ADM, has been engaged to administer and manage a scheme to implement the recommendations of the taxi hardship panel report.

The Act does not make specific reference to the provision of accessible buses. This Act is currently under review. It is proposed to replace it with a new statutory framework for the independent regulation of bus services.I am committed to a policy of making public transport accessible for all categories of people who have mobility impairment – the physically disabled, the sensory impaired, the elderly, parents with children, etc. It is therefore my intention that the provision of accessible buses by bus operators will be addressed in detail in the context of the proposed new regulatory regime for bus services.When licences are being issued under the Road Transport Act 1932, my Department requests private operators to use low floor buses with accessibility features where possible in the provision of licensed bus services. Where new vehicles are being purchased for licensed services, my Department requests that the buses accord with appropriate accessibility standards.

Irrespective of the age or model type of a vehicle a certificate of suitability is required before a small public service licence can be issued for a vehicle. The inspection for such a certificate, which is carried out by the national car testing service, involves assessing the suitability of the vehicle by reference to the requirements of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002 in addition to a standard NCT roadworthiness test. The ordinary NCT test is for the  purposes of determining the roadworthiness condition of a vehicle and does not involve an assessment of a vehicle for use as a taxi or hackney.

In common with most Eurocontrol member states, Ireland exempts all such flights, including military, from payment of the en-route charge.The authority has not yet invoiced my Department for September 2003. However, the amount paid to the Irish Aviation Authority in respect of exempt services for the period January to August 2003, inclusive, not including VAT, was €976,790.17. The equivalent amount for the same period in 2002 was €1,027,499.35. The 2003 figure incorporates an increase of approximately 33% in the IAA unit rate.While it is not possible to provide an exact breakdown of these totals between military and other exempt flights, it is estimated that the latter comprises a very small proportion of the total payment.

The cargo contained on these flights includes items such as helicopter parts, rockets, grenades and cartridges. The items are described using their United Nations, UN, classification codes, UN identification numbers, and ICAO technical packing codes rather than by brand names or mark types. Accordingly, it is not possible to say whether any of the munitions mentioned by the Deputy have been carried in cargo planes that have refuelled in Shannon airport.All applications for exemptions received, including details of the cargo, are submitted to the Irish Aviation Authority, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Department of Foreign Affairs for their observations, and to the Department of Defence for information. Should any of these bodies express an objection to the operation of these flights, I would refuse to grant an exemption under the 1973 order.

As part of this process, the above routes were enhanced by the allocation of high capacity coaches to provide additional passenger capacity. These services are constantly reviewed by the company to ensure that they respond to changing travel patterns. Bus Átha Cliath also operates bus services to Kilcock. The company has carried out regular passenger surveys and found that the services provided are adequate to meet the demand that currently exists in the area.

As a result, additional peak services were introduced, off peak services were increased and weekend services introduced. Iarnród Éireann informs me that it is currently taking delivery of 80 new diesel rail cars for use on all Dublin suburban services, including the Maynooth line. This will facilitate the withdrawal of old carriages and lengthening of trains. Peak capacity is being increased by 26% from 3,300 persons to 4,200 persons on the Maynooth line.

I am assured by the company that all of its services between Kildare and Dublin comply with all such requirements. I have advised the House on several previous occasions that there are no safety standards in existence at present at national or EU level in regard to the maximum number of passengers permitted on trains. Iarnród Éireann has assured me that crowding on some of its services, principally at peak travel times, does not compromise safety. However, I am very much aware of the discomfort and inconvenience crowding causes to passengers. The crowding problems experienced at peak travel times, particularly on suburban services, has developed because of the significant increase in passenger numbers using such services in recent years.In order to address this growth in traffic, significant funding has been, and continues to be, made available by Government to Iarnród Éireann for investment to improve the safety of the network, increase the passenger capacity of the system and improve the quality, reliability and speed of services. Iarnród Éireann has ordered 80 diesel rail cars for use on suburban services and all of these rail cars should be in service by January 2004. This new rolling stock will increase the available capacity to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the present crowding difficulties, including on the Kildare routes. However, pending this increase in capacity, the railway inspectorate of my Department continues to monitor developments in regard to crowding on trains. The inspectorate has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing its attention to the importance of keeping the issue of crowding under review.In addition, I intend to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage of the Railway Safety Bill to provide the proposed railway safety commission with the power to make regulations to address the problem of crowding on trains.

This review, which is due to be completed and submitted to my Department shortly, will assist in determining whether an increase in operational height is feasible and cost effective. On the basis of data currently available from Dublin Port Authority, statistics and a study by the National Institute of Transport and Logistics and on the basis of the operational height, 4.65 metres, of the tunnel as it is currently being constructed, it is estimated that between 0.7% to 1.7% of heavy goods vehicles entering and leaving the port might not be able to use the tunnel. Provision for those vehicles not able to use the tunnel is a matter for the heavy goods vehicle management plan being prepared by Dublin City Council. I understand from Dublin City Council that this plan will have three objectives. The first is to ensure the optimal use by HGVs of the port tunnel, the second is  to minimise adverse effects of remaining HGV movements in the city and the third is to manage the movement of vehicles not within permitted dimensions through permit systems.I understand that Dublin City Council will undertake widespread consultation before implementing any heavy goods vehicle management strategy. I have been informed that the current position in relation to the development of the HGV management strategy is that Dublin City Council intends to issue a preliminary consultation document identifying the issues involved in the near future.

With regard to the Ballybough area of Dublin 3, I understand that local Garda management is aware of an increase in vandalism to vehicles during the three month period ending in September, as compared with the previous three months. This increase is partly due to thieves taking advantage of the large number of vehicles parked there during match days at Croke Park.

To suffer from racial discrimination Travellers would have to suffer distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin. The Government's view  over the years, and repeated in the draft report under the UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination, has been that Travellers do not constitute a distinct group from the population as a whole in terms of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.In the preparation of equality legislation, it was considered that discrimination against Travellers would not be covered by the term "discrimination on the ground of race". Therefore a separate ground "membership of the Traveller Community", on which it is unlawful to discriminate, was put into equality legislation. This was not meant to provide a lesser level of protection to Travellers compared to that afforded to members of ethnic minorities. On the contrary, the separate identification of Travellers in equality legislation guarantees that they are explicitly protected.I understand that some of the pressure to recognise Travellers as an ethnic minority in Ireland arises from a desire for Travellers to be protected by international human rights instruments such as the International Convention for the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination, CERD. The Government is committed to applying all the protections afforded to ethnic minorities by the CERD equally to Travellers. For this reason, the Government has included in detail the steps taken to tackle discrimination against Travellers in an appendix to Ireland's draft report under the UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination. However, the Government is not prepared to include in the report a statement it does not believe to be true, namely that Travellers are ethnically different from the majority of Irish people.

The estimated annual cost of including the rent allowance element in the pensions of gardaí who retired prior to 1 October 1982 would be €217,212. The estimated annual cost of including the allowance in the pensions of garda spouses and children would be €204,826. The estimated annual cost of including the unsocial hours allowance element in the pensions of gardaí who retired prior to 1 January 1993 would be €5,280,912. The estimated annual cost of including the allowance in the pensions of garda spouses and children would be €931,594, giving a total estimated cost of €6,634,544 per annum.The background to this issue is that a 1983 arbitration finding recommended that certain Garda allowances should be made pensionable with effect from 1 October 1982. The finding was applied only to personnel who retired on or after that date. The pensionability of the garda unsocial hours allowance was treated in a similar way when it was introduced with effect from 1 January 1994. The position was consistent with that in other areas of the public service where in the context of making allowances pensionable, the benefits were confined to those retiring after a specified date and did not extend to pensioners who retired before that date.

These factors include considerations relating to the common good, the person's individual family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian considerations. In the case of a parent of an Irish-born child, particular regard is given to the Supreme Court judgment in the L and O case and the subsequent judgments in this area. The Minister is also required to consider the prohibition on refoulement which is contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended.

Specifically, the order is made following consideration of the 11 separate criteria as set out in section 3(6) of that Act and having regard to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 – prohibition of refoulement. Once an order is made it is served on the person, usually by registered post, with an instruction to report to the Garda National Immigration Bureau at a specified garda station at a specified time. The enforcement of the order, including the escorting of the deportee to the destination country, is an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.Details of deportations of non-nationals per month over the past two years is contained in the following table:

Consequently to import fireworks an importation licence granted by my Department is required. It is a long-standing policy that these importation licences are granted only for organised displays conducted by professional and experienced operators. Prior to the granting of an importation licence, my Department consults with the relevant local authority and the Garda Síochána to establish if there are any objections to the granting of a licence. Indeed, the relevant local authority and the Garda Síochána are empowered by statute to prevent any organised display from proceeding, if, in the opinion of either authority, it is not safe to do so. Importation licences are not granted to import fireworks for sale.In enforcing the regulations regarding fireworks, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they make full use of the Customs Consolidation Act 1876, the Casual Trading Acts 1980 and 1995 and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994. Every effort is made by the Garda Síochána to identify persons involved in the illegal importation and sale of all types of fireworks.

In assessing each application the visa officer will have regard to the information provided in the application and to such factors as the applicant's ties and general circumstances in their country of origin, his or her immigration history as well as the relative attractiveness and feasibility of his or her remaining in the State. My Department's approach in these matters is informed by past experience, including experience of abuse of the system. It is difficult to conceive of any scheme which would not be governed by these internationally recognised parameters. Common examples of previous abuse would be individuals who, although granted a visa to come on short visits to friends or relations, overstayed with a view to establishing themselves permanently in the State.These are difficulties faced by immigration authorities everywhere and there is of course a risk that a genuine traveller will be refused a visa because his or her "profile" is coincidentally the same as that of others who have abused the system. The immigration and citizenship division of my Department recognises that it must proceed carefully in order to ensure that genuine visitors are not disadvantaged, while at the same time having regard to the unprecedented evidence of abuse of the visa system not alone in Ireland but in other European countries.

This decision was in line with UNHCR advice to all states hosting Iraqi asylum seekers that processing of new and pending applications from such applicants should be suspended. In the region of 170 Iraqi applications are currently on hands, the majority of which were made in 2003.The commissioner has kept this policy under careful review, having particular regard to the UNHCR advice, which has since been reiterated. Any change in the UNHCR position will be taken into account by the commissioner in determining when to recommence processing of Iraqi applications.

This is a long standing principle of our system of justice. The role of the gardaí is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The question of whether a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the DPP. The director, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the garda find ings viewed against the background of common and/or statute law.The legal representatives of the person in question have contacted both the DPP and the Garda authorities. It would not therefore be appropriate for me to comment further on or to intervene in this case.

Gardaí in an unmarked patrol car responded and patrolled the park. I understand that they were not approached by any persons and did not observe anything untoward occurring in the park.I note from the details supplied with this question that the person in question has made a formal complaint to the Garda Síochána Complaints Board, which is currently the independent statutory body to investigate complaints by members of the public against the gardaí. As the board is independent in the performance of its functions it would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment any further on the specific incident referred to.As the Deputy will recall, I dealt with the policing arrangements for Fairview Park in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 1238 of 30 September 2003.

In the course of the review, it was argued that the Act should be amended to include the grounds of socio-economic status, including social origin or social origin as a separate ground, trade union membership, criminal conviction or ex-prisoner, ex-offender, and political opinion.In view of the complexity of the grounds suggested, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform commissioned research on international experience and legislation in the area and it is expected that the outcome of the research will be published shortly. The Government is committed under Sustaining Progress to completing the review of the discriminatory grounds.The research, when published, will inform future policy decisions in regard to whether extension of the discriminatory grounds for the purposes of the Employment Equality Act 1998, is appropriate. Review of the Equal Status Act 2000 will be considered within the context of the report and evaluation of its implications for the Act.

The Council reached agreement on a directive containing a definition of family which includes registered partnerships only where the host member state recognises such partnerships. The entry and residence of persons in such partnerships would, therefore, remain a matter for national legislation.Ireland's position was that an instrument dealing with the free movement of EU citizens and their family members should not affect the sensitive area of family law, in which the Community does not have competence and must remain a matter for national legislation. The agreed wording of the directive allows member states which recognise registered partnerships to do so for the purpose of free movement but does not oblige other member states to recognise such partnerships if they are not a feature of their national law.I am satisfied with the position adopted by Ireland with regard to this directive and my Department was fully involved in the discussions.

Funding for the programme, which totals almost €437 million, comes from both the European Union and the Exchequer.In August 2001, the group received an offer of a one year staffing grant of €63,487, which has been drawn down. At that time, the group was advised that further funding would be conditional to the group addressing a number of issues.A development plan was submitted in July 2003 and since then, Area Development Management Limited, which administers the programme on my behalf, has been in contact with the group seeking clarification of outstanding issues. I understand that outstanding information was received on 9 October 2003 and this will now be assessed by Area Development Management Limited on my behalf.

My Department has no function with regard to the siting of masts at individual locations.In July 1996 my Department issued guidelines for planning authorities on telecommunications antennae and support structures. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist planning authorities, An Bord Pleanála, operators of mobile telecommunications services and the general public by providing guidance on dealing with telecommunications masts and base stations within the planning system. The guidelines now have statutory recognition under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 which provides that planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála must have regard to them in the performance of their functions.It is not proposed to amend these guidelines.

The guidelines will be aimed at assisting local authorities on the practical and technical aspects of implementing the rural settlement policy framework set out in the national spatial strategy, as they follow through on overall policy in their own development plans and in the operation of the development control system under planning legislation. The guidelines will also be aimed, through the operation of the planning system, at securing greater public awareness of the issues involved in rural settlement policies and greater consensus on the practical implementation of those policies.

Introduction of the levy has led to a dramatic reduction in the number of disposable plastic bags provided to consumers with a consequent positive environmental benefit.However, I recognise the need to ensure that the efforts and commitment of the vast majority of retailers are not undermined by the non-compliance of a few. My Department wrote to local authorities in regard to the regulations and also met representatives of all local authorities to discuss enforcement and other aspects of the levy. A detailed circular on enforcement was issued to local authorities asking them to pay particular attention to the identification and follow-up of any non-compliance with the law.All complaints received in my Department concerning non-compliance are forwarded to the relevant local authority and the Revenue Commissioners. The operation of the levy is also subject to the normal Revenue Commissioners auditing arrangements.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	855	On foot of the success of the environmental levy on plastic bags, introduced in March 2002, which has resulted in a reduction in the dispensing of plastic shopping bags at retail outlets by over 90%, An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to consider the extension of the levy on plastic bags to other materials which may be problematic from a waste management and litter perspective.A recent report in July 2003 issued by the litter monitoring body, which is co-ordinated by my Department, provides valuable statistical data on litter pollution in Ireland. Chewing gum is identified in the report as the single largest litter component in the food litter category and – after cigarette related litter – is the second largest litter component nationally. Fast-food take-away bags and wrappers are identified as the largest litter component in the packaging litter category. ATM receipts are also identified in the report as significant elements of paper litter. The results of the recent litter monitoring body report provide a significant basis for considering appropriate measures to deal with the litter problems caused by chewing gum, fast-food packaging and ATM receipts.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	856	The Government affords a high priority to housing issues as evidenced by the range of policies and measures employed by my Department and other public agencies involved to ensure that housing needs are appropriately met.We have placed a strong emphasis on increasing housing supply to meet demand, particularly for first-time buyers, against a background of unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes.The measures introduced by this Government to boost supply such as significant investment in infrastructure, removing planning constraints, and promoting the increased residential densities are having effect. In 2002, there was the eighth successive year of record house completion, with 57,695 units completed, an increase in output of 9.7% on 2001, and an over 30% increase in the housing output in the Dublin area. Ireland is now building housing units at the fastest rate in Europe – close to 15 units per 1,000 population last year, which is an outstanding achievement.This positive trend in supply has continued into this year, with statistics showing that overall house completion for the first six months were up 16.5% on the same period last year, completions in the greater Dublin area were up 10.6% and completions in Dublin were up 13.8%.House price increases and the impact of these on affordability are a matter of continuing concern. While the rate of house price increases is still problematic, this has moderated considerably since the late 1990s, when price increases peaked at 40% per annum in 1998. In order to address problems associated with increases in price levels, the Government has worked to ensure the continuing enhancement of supply.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	858	The Government's strategy has been to increase housing supply to meet demand and to improve affordability, particularly for first time buyers. There is clear evidence that measures implemented to boost supply, such as the Government's investment in infrastructure, and the increased residential densities now being achieved as a result of the residential guidelines produced by my Department have been successful in addressing the strong demand for housing and moderating house price increases. Last year, 2002, was the eighth successive year of record house completion, with 57,695 units completed, an increase in output of 9.7% on 2001, and more than a 30% increase in the housing output in the Dublin area, and this positive trend in supply is set to continue for this year. Average year on year house price increases have been reduced from a peak of around 40% per annum in 1998, to more moderate levels currently.Affordability has also been assisted by a range of factors including high levels of economic growth which have facilitated lower tax levels and increased disposable income, increased employment, lower mortgage interest rates, and low inflation.

Consequently, the Department's ICT infrastructure has been upgraded to provide a storage area network, SAN, which provides high capacity resilient data storage, archive and data back-up facilities. In addition, a number of large electronic databases are in place for specific areas of the Department's business. These large databases, which hold the national vehicle and driver information, salaries and financial information and human resource files, have purpose built record storage and retrieval facilities.In other areas in my Department the paper file is the main record storage medium and the policy and practice is to print electronically created documents and place them on the file.

The guidelines currently prescribe a  maximum floor area of 6,000 sq. m. for gross retail floor-space for large-scale single retail warehouse development. This cap is now being reviewed, taking account of the need to ensure effective competition in this sector of retailing and ongoing developments in retail formats, while ensuring proper planning and sustainable development. Central to this review will be the potential impact of the national spatial strategy on the guidelines and the need to ensure that cities and towns have the range of retail facilities that supports their attractiveness and competitiveness for investment and population growth.To assist in carrying out the review, I invited interested parties to make submissions to my Department. The closing date for receipt of submissions was 3 October 2003. It is now my intention to assess all submissions received and these will be fully taken into account in considering further whether any changes are needed in the guidelines.

I replied by way of a letter dated 17 April 2003, which conveyed that I was in the course of putting arrangements in place for a review of the retail planning guidelines, which were introduced in 2000, and that there would be opportunity to make submissions in this regard in due course. I received a further letter from the company dated 12 May 2003, which acknowledged receipt of my letter. On 2 July 2003, officials from my Department held a meeting with a small team of executives from the company at their request.

Local and national information campaigns will be conducted to ensure that all voters will be fully informed on the use of the voting machines before polling day.The system is also designed to accommodate the four different categories of electors, for example, presidential, Dáil, European and local government electors. While the number of voting machines to be used in any location is a matter for each returning officer, it is expected that there will be one voting machine for each ballot box previously used. In urban areas particularly, there may of course be a number of polling stations in the same building. Extra voting machines may be used, where necessary, especially at peak voting periods.

Kildare County Council received a combined capital allocation of €1,642,000. It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the schemes in their areas from within their combined allocation.Authorities were requested to contact my Department if their allocation was either inadequate or surplus to their requirements to facilitate the re-allocation of funds and to obtain optimum effectiveness from the funding available. Applications for additional funding, including one from Kildare County Council, are now being considered in this context and a decision will issue as soon as possible to the authorities concerned.

It is Government policy to bring greater uniformity to these arrangements by requiring that all non-domestic users of water services meet the costs of providing them with these services on a metered basis by 2006. This is line with the proper application of the polluter pays principle and the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive.The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997 precludes the charging of domestic users of water services and there is no proposal for amendment of this provision.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	868	The Water Services Bill will consolidate and update the existing diverse body of water services legislation, much of which dates back to the 19th century, into a single modern enactment. In addition, it will provide for new administrative and supervisory arrangements to underpin planning and delivery of water services at national and local level, and  place duties of care on consumers in relation to water conservation and prevention of risk to human health and the environment. Proposed new licensing arrangements are designed to address current problems in the rural water sector in particular.It is expected that the Government will approve the draft Bill for publication in the near future.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-10-14 00:00:00	Prelude	869	Local authorities are independent bodies, democratically elected and accountable to their local electorate and are responsible for an extensive range of functions. The past few years have seen a major local government modernisation programme with constitutional recognition and guaranteed local elections; record levels of funding; strengthened political and management structures; an updated legal framework and an efficiency agenda focused on improved financial management, IT, human resources, corporate planning and customer service. Earlier this year legislation was enacted to end the dual mandate and a major independent study to identify future funding options for local government is now being commissioned.A key element of the modernisation process is the continued development of the county and city development board system. This gives local authorities a central role in bringing together at local level the various public agencies, social partners and local development bodies and in developing, overseeing and monitoring an integrated strategy for the economic, social and cultural development of their areas.It is my aim, over the lifetime of the Government, to build on progress to date and to carry forward a significant change agenda for local government including a wider role, improved effectiveness and efficiency and proper democratic input.

Detailed  statutory provisions are set out in electoral law and are supplemented, as appropriate, with guidance issued by my Department. In addition, the law and the practical arrangements in relation to the registration of electors are kept under review and updated in new legislative provisions as necessary. I intend to devote considerable resources to a publicity campaign to, inter alia, encourage maximum voter registration and participation in the upcoming European and local elections.

Some 7.3% of this total was spent on Microsoft products. The total does not include software that is supplied as standard with hardware products as suppliers do not distinguish between these hardware and software costs.Linux is currently used in my Department. However, my Department does not have a specific policy in relation to the promotion and use of open source software. Generally software is selected using a number of criteria, including its ability to meet the needs of the Department, the quality of support and overall costs including capital cost and ongoing support and licensing costs.

Under the Derelict Sites Act 1990, local authorities are required to maintain a derelict sites register, which includes the name and address of each owner and occupier, where these can be ascertained by reasonable inquiry, of any land which in the opinion of the local authority, is a derelict site. The register is kept at the offices of the local authority and is available for inspection at the offices of the local authority during office hours.
