          <p eId="para_2">Again this week we have had a very tragic situation. I refer to the deaths of two babies in the same maternity unit in the space of a week and to the news of the tragic death of a mother who lost her life in Holles Street on 8 May last. It has to be said that the vast majority of pregnancies in Ireland are safe and uneventful. Nonetheless, the recent deaths will create further uncertainty. It is clear that issues arise from them. These deaths follow earlier deaths in other hospitals, including Portiuncula Hospital and the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise. It is worrying that they follow four deaths in 2014-15. It is of particular concern that we have not yet had sight of the four reports that were done. In other words, we do not have a clear idea of what transpired because the reports in question have not been published. That is unsatisfactory. A former Minister, Senator James Reilly, indicated that he would ask HIQA to undertake an independent review into a death in Cavan, but that never happened. I note that in the Holles Street case, just one external person is involved in the internal review that is taking place. We need external reviews of these issues to provide certainty.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> I will explain why I am worried. I have read the two reports that were published following the review carried out at South Tipperary General Hospital and the review carried out by a management consultant at Cavan General Hospital in July 2015. I have also read the maternity strategy and the presentation made by Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith to the Oireachtas some time ago, in which he made the point that "Ireland had the highest birth rate in Europe between 2004 and 2013, yet we have the third lowest number of consultant obstetricians per 100,000 women in the population, among 34 OECD countries". All of the reports consistently refer to a lack of resources, to fundamental problems in the recruitment of clinical and managerial staff in the key obstetric centres and to fundamental manpower and resource issues. We have had many warnings and reports, but no comprehensive action has been taken to deal with the resourcing of our maternity hospitals. Does the Taoiseach accept that our maternity services are under-resourced? Does he accept that there is a need for urgent intervention and transparent action on the part of the Government?</p>

          <p eId="para_4">When a death like this occurs, either at birth or in giving birth, it is always a source of stress and tragedy for the families involved. Obviously, the death of Mrs. Malak Thawley in the National Maternity Hospital was a very stressful time for her husband, Alan, and their extended family. I am aware that in this case, the HSE has confirmed that the master of the National Maternity Hospital has commissioned a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Mrs. Malak Thawley. This is as one would expect. I want to stress the importance of patient confidentiality and sensitivity to the needs of this family at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> The Deputy also raised the deaths of two babies at Cavan General Hospital. On behalf of everybody, I would like to express deepest sympathy to the two families involved. The HSE has confirmed that the RCSI hospital group is conducting a review of both of these cases. I assure the House that the safety and quality of maternity services is a priority and will remain so for the Government and for the Minister for Health. Deputy Martin will be aware of the publication of Ireland's first-ever maternity strategy, which demonstrates a new and enhanced focus on maternity care at policy and service delivery levels.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">Every maternity hospital is now publishing a monthly maternity patient safety statement, as recommended in 2014 in the Chief Medical Officer's report on prenatal services in Portlaoise. I can also report that the draft scheme for the health information and patient safety Bill will provide for mandatory external reporting of serious reportable events that arise in the health service. The Bill, which is currently with the Chief Parliamentary Counsel for drafting, will require health service providers to report such events to the State Claims Agency, the Health Information and Quality Authority and the Mental Health Commission. The Department is aware of four infant deaths which occurred at Cavan General Hospital's maternity services between 2012 and 2015. Each of those deaths is the subject of a review. I understand that one of the reviews has been completed and two others are at an advanced stage. The early completion of these reviews is obviously important for the families concerned. It will ensure any lessons to be learned will be implemented in our maternity services. I will deal with the recruitment situation in my follow-up reply.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_16">The Taoiseach's response is unsatisfactory because it does not cut to the core of the question I asked about the under-resourcing of our maternity and obstetric services. My understanding is that maternity services received just €3 million in additional funding in 2016. I always said that last year's budget was a false and fraudulent one in terms of public figures. Adequate provision was not made for the implementation of the strategy. I put it to the Taoiseach that this is a recurring theme in all the key presentations to the Oireachtas by those involved and in the various reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">To quote Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith: "All of these factors combined have resulted in all hospitals having difficulty retaining and recruiting quality staff... resulting in an over reliance on locum and agency staff," and this is a key recurring theme.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> The Taoiseach made reference to the legislation and I put it to him that in situations such as this we should have independent reviews of the incidents rather than internal reviews. Legislation is not needed to do that. The Minister could intervene and ensure that it happens. HIQA or an external independent review of the incidents would give certainty and confidence. Does the Taoiseach find it acceptable that in the four deaths between 2012 and 2015 we have, as yet, no information regarding those and no published report?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_15">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T10:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_19">One of the reviews is complete, as I said, and two others are nearing completion. I am just as anxious that these would be expedited. With regard to independent reviews I believe it is important to first of all have the internal review completed under the systems that apply. If an independent outside external review is then necessary, that can happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> By the end of March 2016 overall health service employee numbers had increased by 5,856 over last year, an extra 1,300 in the first quarter of 2016 alone, and most of those are front-line positions. During the last 15 month period the numbers employed in acute hospitals increased by about 3,500 wholetime equivalents which represents a 7% increase in the workforce. Deputies are aware that the expenditure in the area of health is over €13 billion at the moment. Numbers in the medical dental category increased by almost 600 wholetime equivalents, or 6.5% during that period and nursing figures rose by 1,700. Yes there are shortages in areas like emergency medicine, anaesthesia and psychiatry but these are not specific to the Irish health system. Alternative marketing strategies are being developed by the HSE for these hard to fill posts to encourage people to take up employment. There has been a significant increase in the number of consultants working in the public health service. Since the establishment of the HSE the numbers have increased by over 850 to 2,761. This is a matter of considerable focus by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> A mediator has been appointed to look at the question of a difference of opinion between the National Maternity Hospital Holles Street and St Vincent's Hospital. Money is in place, planning permission is in place and rows like this should not impede the provision of proper, high standard, quality care for mothers using maternity services.</p>

          <p eId="para_22">It is clear that the Government intends to continue in this term exactly as it did in the last. Fianna Fáil stands indicted for giving the Government an opportunity to do this once again. Despite protestations to the contrary the Government clearly intends to ignore the real life crises faced by many people, just as it did before. The Government's responses to the crisis in our health services and the housing crisis, to deficiencies in An Garda Síochána, to the NAMA scandal and to the plight of rural Ireland are exactly the same as they were for the last five years. First of all the Government denies there is a problem and then it announces half measures wrapped up in fine rhetoric. Yesterday’s announcement of measures to tackle organised crime is a good example. These modest measures, while welcome, do not go far enough. Following the Regency Hotel murder, the Government line was that Garda resources were not an issue when it comes to tackling organised crime. The task force announced yesterday would be welcome if it meant additional and extra resources, but does it? In north inner city Dublin there are 140 fewer gardaí than in 2010. Unless there is an increase in Garda numbers this task force will be made up of gardaí brought off the front line elsewhere. This lack of resources is not an accident and is not unique to Dublin. It is an issue right across the State. It is a direct result of the policies of this Government and of Fianna Fáil before it and needs to be totally reversed. Will the Taoiseach indicate to the Dáil when the new measures announced will be in place and will there be additional gardaí and funding?</p>

          <p eId="para_28">The Deputy mentioned health, housing, rural Ireland and the Garda situation. Five years ago we inherited a situation where there was not any money, Garda recruitment had come to an end and Templemore was closed. There has been this festering situation in north inner city Dublin and in other locations around the country for quite some time. Government began to put resources, where possible, into the security forces in both Defence and the Garda. Templemore was reopened and began to recruit gardaí. In our programme for Government we set out an increase of recruitment through Templemore to have a real increase in Garda numbers to 15,000 and to cater for vacancies created by those gardaí who have retired on age grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> We have made it perfectly clear on many occasions that whatever the request made by the Garda Commissioner or the Garda authorities for dealing with gangland crime, those resources would be provided. One can only do that with a strong economy and that is why it is important for the management of the public economy be kept very clearly in sight. We discussed this at Cabinet having met with the Garda Commissioner and senior Garda personnel last week. The Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, made a specific request that the threshold which applies under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 should be reduced from €13,000 to €5,000 and we are going to do that. By way of regulation, the Government decided on the advice of the Criminal Assets Bureau to reduce the prescribed sum under which cash suspected to have been the proceeds of crime can be seized from €6,500 to €1,000 under section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act. Further proposals will go to Government to enhance and update legislation for the lawful interception of communications in respect of criminal activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Last week I said this matter goes beyond mere party politics. It affects the lives of innocent people and we understand the fear and pressure that these communities are under. The Garda will have the task force on crime for all of Dublin. We are going to respond with a task force for the north inner city. I expect to have consultations with Deputy Adams and Members of different parties who might have ideas about that and then go and talk to the community leaders and public representatives in the north inner city to look at the social disadvantage, the unfairness and lack of facilities in those areas for very many years. I am glad to see that the new primary care centre is about to commence in Summerhill and have a sod turned very shortly. However, it needs so much more because this is not something that can be dealt with overnight. There is a much longer term requirement for initiative and investment. Consultation and working with these communities, where very good people are committed to giving the children of the localities a life of opportunity, is needed. This means that whatever Garda resources are required, on the advice of the Garda Commissioner, will be provided. The Government has made that money available and is following through with these actions which will not of themselves put an end to this but they will help the Garda authorities, the gardaí on the ground and the communities to come to grips with this scourge.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">It is good news that the Taoiseach has discovered there are problems in some of our communities caused by criminal gangs and I am sure the people who are victimised by these gangs are delighted the Taoiseach has this new knowledge. I asked three questions. When will the measures announced yesterday be put in place? Will there be additional gardaí? Will there be additional funding? The Taoiseach did not answer any of the questions. It is crucial that additional gardaí are on the ground and that An Garda Síochána is resourced properly. However, this is not just a policing matter. There is a need for increased investment in education, job provision, drug treatment and crime prevention. Local communities are up for this challenge. Many have battled for their kids for generations against Government indifference and now the Government has discovered there are disadvantaged communities within earshot of the Dáil. The Government now needs to deliver, go beyond the rhetoric and put real measures in place. Last week I asked that a task force involving local communities be put in place, Government led but with full involvement of local activists and local people to carry out a comprehensive, multi-agency strategic plan for DubIin’s north inner city. When will this be put in place, how will it be resourced and what funding will be provided? I remind the Ceann Comhairle that the Taoiseach has not answered my original three questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">Let me reflect again for the Deputy. We already had the capacity to reopen the Garda College in Templemore to train new gardaí and dispense them around the country. The Government has decided to increase the Garda force to 15,000, but we cannot do this without a strong economy or providing proper training for young gardaí. As the Deputy will have known within the past few days, probationary gardaí are supervised in their training; therefore, we do not have situations which arose in the past when that was not the case. An extra €5 million has been provided to deal with the request from the Garda Commissioner in terms of the labour intensity of surveillance, dealing with gangland crime, interventions and the prevention of shootings or attempts to kill people. This is something with which the Garda force, in particular the Garda intelligence unit, has been dealing for quite some time. I accept that it is necessary for government as a whole to work with communities such as those in the north inner city to give them some chance and have a real opportunity. We would not be able to do this if we did not have resources in the economy to make some impact. In the past we have been blamed for being too focused on the economy. Believe me - we will go there, but we have to know how to link all of the agencies together, what the purpose of the north inner city task force is, what resources are required and what it is the leaders in these communities want.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_35">Dublin's inner city has had an horrific time recently. While other parts of the country have, unfortunately, experienced murders, I think we accept that it has been unprecedented in the north inner city. As Atticus Finch put it in <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>, one never really understands a person or a situation until one gets into their skin and walks around in it. That is what I am asking for - that the Taoiseach get inside the skin of somebody living in the north inner city. He or she looks out the window and there is no one on the street, yet, within two to three minutes, anything from 30 to 60 people are on it because the word has gone around that drugs will be available for sale. He or she could be sitting at home in his or her flat or walking down the street, perhaps going to buy the messages, meet neighbours or the pub for a drink, and, suddenly, shots ring out and somebody is gunned down and executed in front of him of her. He or she could have a son or a daughter, a brother or a sister, who got caught up in addiction and owes a massive amount of money to the dealers and he or she hears a knock on the door and is told either to pay up or else do a deed, commit a murder or set somebody up for murder or the consequences will be worse for him or her.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> Middle Ireland and wealthy Ireland have contributed to this also. They have also fuelled the drug trade and thus contributed to the murders and mayhem. We know that it did not happen overnight. It is continuing and will continue. As long as it continues, it will undermine the rule of law and democracy. Tackling criminal justice issues, increasing the police presence and enhancing the Criminal Assets Bureau are welcome, but that is only part of the answer. It will not resolve the more fundamental issues that have been neglected for decades. The bigger reality, as we all know and the Taoiseach said, is that people face disadvantage and inequality, whether in education, job creation, service provision or the environment, yet, as the Taoiseach also said, these communities have shown great resilience, pride and humour. I acknowledge the work that has happened. In spite of cuts of 30% to 40% for community, youth and addiction services, the work has continued in schools. There is also the role of the churches, as well as the community policing forum and community police officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Does the Taoiseach accept, as I am sure he will, that it is the duty of the State to protect its citizens? Does he accept that everyone - individuals, families and communities, regardless of where they live - has the right to live in peace, free of fear, intimidation and violence, and to live in a place where the State does not just talk about equality of opportunity but actually puts strategies in place that are well resourced and make a difference?</p>

          <p eId="para_38">I accept that, of course I do. I understand, from Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan's experience as a public representative and citizen, that she knows more than most and knows many of the people involved in the north inner city directly. I respect this. The agenda she has set out is part and parcel of what we have to do. It is, of course, the duty of the State to ensure citizens are protected. It is a duty of the State to ensure citizens can go about their daily lives free of fear and pressure such as that experienced in the north inner city. However, it also has a duty to connect all of the interdepartmental agencies together. Whether it be in justice, housing, education, training, upskilling or apprenticeships, an opportunity has to be provided for young people and those who in the past might have taken a different route. It is a major challenge. When this was done in Limerick, the restoration projects took ten, 15 or even 20 years and required an enormous amount of money. We have to start by resourcing gardaí to do their job. As the Deputy knows, arrests have been made and there are investigations ongoing into the unfortunate murders. There is much more evidence on the streets and people have been warned that their lives are in danger because of the intelligence being made available to gardaí. We hope it can and will stop. In so far as the Garda is concerned, its crime task force will be resourced and given whatever facilities the Commissioner requests. The State, public representatives, community leaders and communities will need joined-up thinking, backed up by resources, to provide evidence that, for these communities, having hope is not just an aspiration but can become a reality in terms of facilities, opportunities, the provision of training, paths to employment and hope for a better life.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T10:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_39">There have been numerous task forces, strategies and reports, many of which are gathering dust on the shelf. We are now talking about a new task force. As the Taoiseach said, it needs to have key players from the statutory organisations, but they have to be key players with direct access to Ministers. The Department of the Taoiseach also has to be involved, perhaps as the driver. There must also be experienced voices from the community and voluntary sector. Allied to this, to make a difference, there has to be an implementation, monitoring and evaluation team that will have specific short-term, mid-term and long-term objectives and timeframes. We need better and more effective international co-operation, which is vital to target assets.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> We need a better understanding of addiction. One of the unintended consequences of the police action is that the drugs supply for many with an addiction will be cut off. Here is an opportunity for them to get into recovery programmes, if treatment and rehabilitation services are available to them. There needs to be an increase in detox facilities, whether community or residential. We need more gardaí, but we also need more youth workers, community and outreach workers. Education is vital, while prevention and education present a major challenge. This means engaging young people, as we have done in the north inner city, in meaningful and non-judgmental conversations.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I acknowledge that this is both complex and difficult. There are no quick-fix solutions and it is going to be a challenge. Nonetheless, there is a real opportunity. This issue is going to move from the media because they will have other stories. However, we cannot afford to lose focus because, if we do, the trail of addiction and crime, including gangland crime, will continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I thank the Deputy for her contribution. I like to think the north inner city task force that will be put together will be different in the sense that I would like to see it modelled on what the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, brought forward formerly in the creation of jobs, where there was a timeline, it was action-proofed and responsible. In so far as my Department is concerned, we will be very happy to work with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> The Minister for Health explained yesterday that he hoped to be in a position, before the House rose for the summer recess, to bring legislation to the House dealing with prescriptive drugs, a matter mentioned by Deputy Róisín Shortall on a number of occasions and others. Before the end of the year we will have a national drugs strategy, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, will deal, in conjunction with other Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> The points raised by Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan are real and part of an agenda of opportunity for communities, but it is our job to make it happen. I hope to engage with the Deputy and others, including members of the Government with their different responsibilities, to address the need for joined-up thinking and to show that, where the Government applies itself with resources, it can make a difference to the lives of people.</p>

            <p eId="para_64">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_65"> In the programme for a partnership Government, the Government has committed to establishing a citizens' assembly within six months and without participation by politicians, with a mandate to look at a limited number of key issues over an extended period. These issues will not be limited to those directly pertaining to the Constitution and may include issues such as, for example, how we as a nation best respond to the challenges and opportunities of an ageing population.</p>
            <p eId="para_66"> The Government will ask the citizens' assembly to make recommendations to the Dáil on further constitutional changes, including on the eighth amendment, fixed-term Parliaments and the manner in which referenda are held, for example, whether super referendum days should be held, whereby a significant number referenda take place on the same day.</p>
            <p eId="para_67"> As regards the timeframe, the programme for a partnership Government states, as I have mentioned, that the assembly's mandate will be to look at a number of key issues over an extended period. This has not yet been defined, but clearly an issue such as the eighth amendment will take some time to consider fully.</p>

            <p eId="para_70">-----because it is a very messy subject as far as he is concerned but for thousands of women throughout the country it is a key issue. The Taoiseach just listed a host of issues the citizens' assembly will look into, including everything from fixed-term Parliaments to the ageing population but let us throw in the eighth amendment as well. The best that some of the Independent Deputies, who when on this side of the House last year voted to repeal the eighth amendment, could do is on page 158 of a 160 page document.</p>
            <p eId="para_71"> We know the Taoiseach will establish the citizens' assembly within six months but will he tell us when it will report? Will it do so in the lifetime of this Government or will he attempt to push this issue aside and kick the can down the road yet again?</p>
            <p eId="para_72"> I have an issue with the title of the assembly or committee. This issue does not just affect citizens. It affects non-citizens in quite an acute way because women who are pregnant in this country who do not have citizenship and who may have been working and living here for years do not have the same freedom of movement as other people and it is a very important issue for migrant women. The title should be changed. One in four of my constituents is from outside Ireland. Some of them are now citizens but others are not. It is quite a dangerous precedent.</p>
            <p eId="para_73"> How will the fine upstanding citizens to rule on these issues be chosen? How will the membership of the committee be chosen? Will it have a majority of women of childbearing age to deliberate on this topic? Will there be any bishops or religious representatives in the assembly? How exactly will the Taoiseach decide who is fit to decide women's personal decisions over their own bodies and futures?</p>
            <p eId="para_74"> Last year, when the referendum on marriage equality was taking place, many people really resented the fact a majority of people would make the decision over what would only affect a minority in society. I have a problem with this also. This should never have been put into our Constitution because these are personal matters. It does not matter to me if a majority agrees as it will only affect a particular cohort of people and it is their personal decision to make. The decision was taken 33 years ago at the behest mainly of a Catholic lobby as no other religious groups or people demanded it. I have studied this, as have many others. As that decision was taken, we are left with no option but to have a referendum.</p>
            <p eId="para_75"> I want to ask the Taoiseach about the democratic issue here. The only way a referendum can be triggered in this country is if a majority of Deputies in Dáil Éireann decide it can happen. This is not democratic either. In the context of the democratic revolution the Taoiseach planned in the last term, he might reconsider this. There should be some way the people of the country can petition for a plebiscite or referendum to be held because poll after poll has shown that anything from 78% to 80% of people believe there should be a referendum on this matter but the Taoiseach is preventing this from happening and he has now outsourced it to a committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_76"> I have an issue with this outsourcing. The Taoiseach is outsourcing water and housing and now he is outsourcing this issue. Why are politicians to be excluded from it? Is it because it is awkward for the Taoiseach because he bowed down to the so-called pro-life lobby a few years back and he does not want to make a decision on this? We are elected by people to make decisions, including difficult ones. Why should it be unelected people who decide how this issue proceeds? It should be a majority of people who were recently elected, who stood before the public on this issue. Many of us stood on a fully pro-choice platform and it did not inhibit us in any way from getting elected.</p>
            <p eId="para_77"> I do not think the Taoiseach recognises there has been a sea change in attitudes on this issue but I can tell him that there has because I have been on the streets at a number of stalls with ROSA and other groups. It is clear people have shifted and they recognise we cannot export women from this country any longer or deny the reality that every day in bedrooms throughout the country women take abortion pills which they ordered online because they cannot afford or are not in a position to leave the country for a very expensive operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_78"> Why did the Taoiseach choose to do this? Why are Independent Deputies Katherine Zappone, Finian McGrath and John Halligan, who stated they were pro-choice, willing to accept such a meagre recognition of this issue in terms of the citizens' assembly?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_51">
            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T11:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_79">Deputy Coppinger is incorrect when she states we do not like to see this matter raised. It has been raised on many occasions. We have set out a clear process in the programme for Government committing that a citizens' assembly should examine the question of the eighth amendment and other issues. Following the citizens' convention, which brought forward the proposition that there should be a referendum on dealing with the question of marriage equality, the process by which it came about was very clear and strategic and it brought about its own results.</p>
            <p eId="para_80"> It is not true to say that it is only, unfortunately, women who have to contend with crisis pregnancies who have an interest in this.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">This is about the people of the country having an interest in matters of life and death, and the Deputy is well aware that the Constitution belongs to the people, is created by the people, voted on or amended by the people and changed by the people. Nor is it true for her to say that politicians here do not have a say on this. When the citizens' assembly makes its recommendations and when they go through the Oireachtas committee and the expert group, it is the politicians here who will have to make a decision as to whether we proceed to have a referendum and what the nature of that referendum might be. I have already said from our perspective that if and when that arises, it will be the opportunity for Members to vote according to their conscience and vote freely in whatever way they wish to vote on the question to be put before them. It is therefore not true for the Deputy to say that the elected representatives of all parties and none here do not have a say on this because it cannot be put before the people, if a referendum is to be held, without a Bill to hold a referendum, and people here must vote on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_82"> The Deputy is well aware that in 1983, the eighth amendment introduced the section in article 40.3 dealing with the question of "the unborn". There were a number of court cases concerning the interpretation of that amendment and of the provision of information and referral to abortion services. We had several referenda but the people decided what to put in the Constitution. With the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill a number of years ago, the Government gave legislative effect to what the Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution to mean, and that was not without its inherent difficulties either. It is too facile to say we must have a referendum because one cannot change and amend the Constitution without the approval of the people, and one therefore must know what it is that one wants to do. Yes, the question of fatal foetal abnormalities has arisen, and yes, the question of incest and rape has arisen, and these are very traumatic, sensitive, personalised cases for people. The Constitution is what it is, and that is the reason why a citizens' assembly should reflect on the eighth amendment.</p>
            <p eId="para_83"> The method of adoption of a citizens' assembly will have to take into account gender, location, age, geography and so on and would need to be chaired by a very competent person. All of that can be arranged and made available through the commissioning of a polling company, as happened in the previous citizens' assembly, which was fair, regionalised, gender-balanced and age-balanced in the way it went about its business. That will all be put in place within six months, as committed to in the programme for Government, but it is not as simple as calling for a referendum to be held. It is much more profound than that.</p>

            <p eId="para_87">-----and has the interest of the vast majority of people in the country. Unfortunately, when the very traumatic cases of fatal foetal abnormalities or other cases are brought to public attention, they are very traumatic, very sensitive and very heartfelt. The Constitution, however, is the people's Constitution and cannot be changed without the people's consent. That is why the people in the citizens' assembly should be able to give their reflection both on the eighth amendment and on a number of other issues which should not be sidelined either.</p>
            <p eId="para_88"> The Deputy asks me when the citizens' assembly will report. I cannot answer that for her until such time as the assembly is put together and begins its work. The programme for Government is set out over the period of the lifetime of this Government, which is intended to be five years. The Deputy asks me will the assembly report before the end of the period of Government. It is provided for in the programme, so the answer to that question is that I expect that it should, but let us get it set up, with all the criteria that apply to it, let it begin its deliberations and let us see what the citizens say. We will then bring those deliberations back to the Oireachtas, where Members will engage with experts on the views of the citizens and see what is possible and what is not.</p>
            <p eId="para_89"> As I have said, it is not as simple or as facile as saying we should hold a referendum on the eighth amendment. We need to know what it is that we want to do. We need to know what it is that we can do or might do and we must have the support of the people. I have no great regard or appreciation for polls that I see about these matters. It is when they are being discussed in some depth that people begin to say just how profound the decision is.</p>

            <p eId="para_90">My question relates to the establishment of the citizens' assembly. I make the general point that I remain to be convinced of the model. The Constitutional Convention was an interesting process, people involved liked it and there was a nice, touchy-feely sense about it. In reality, however, a lot of what came out of it overall was left to one side. Some ridiculous issues were put before it, such as whether to extend the right to vote to those under 17 or 16 years of age or whatever, which was hardly the burning constitutional issue of the day. There are issues regarding the model as well. My general point is that this House is the people's assembly. The referendum on marriage equality is often referred to, but that was not actually an outcome of the Constitutional Convention. All political leaders, bar the Taoiseach at the time, were in favour of a marriage equality referendum well in advance of the Constitutional Convention. In fact, it took the Taoiseach-----</p>

            <p eId="para_124">It was not. It was a party political decision, and it took the Taoiseach longer than most to go with it. He was the last party leader, two years on, to eventually agree with it. Fine, he did, and I am happy that it worked. I do not want any divisive comment about it. It was a great day, and many people voted for it. Some had their views about it, to which they are entitled. People in my party, just as those in the Taoiseach's, were entitled to be reticent.

            <p eId="para_126">Regarding the eighth amendment, let me again state that the idea of a citizens' assembly is very curious. It should not be left to a citizens' assembly at all. It will take six months to establish. That is my point. Given the complexity of the issue, I believe that it is not clear at all how a citizens' assembly could work on an issue so dramatically more complex than anything examined by the Constitutional Convention. A simple repeal is not an answer, in my view, because we still face the core issue of what the law will be. Any proposition to the people has to be legislative. This means in the first instance that if one wants to delete it, one must bring something before this House, and the House must put it before the people. We have freedom of conscience in our party and each individual member will make up his or her mind on the issue-----</p>

            <p eId="para_128">I did not interrupt Deputy Coppinger and I would appreciate if she would respect my democratic right to make my points.</p>
            <p eId="para_129"> Freedom of conscience will apply, and the Oireachtas has dealt with this before through Green Papers that considered all the scenarios and options. I believe a judge-led commission initiative would feed into an all-party Oireachtas committee and would be the best route to deal with this. Irrespective of one's views on this, an Oireachtas committee has the capacity, with legal backup, to go through all the scenarios.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">There are legal, social, moral and ethical issues. It is not a simple straightforward issue, as some would portray it to be, and people have different views. Even the most liberal agree that there is a point at which a termination should be illegal. Maybe others do not accept that point but even the most liberal accept that it should be illegal at some point. There is no country without laws, be they constitutional or legislative, governing and concerning abortion.</p>
            <p eId="para_131"> The bottom line, as far as I am concerned, is that the Oireachtas should be centre stage in relation to it. I really would like an explanation from the Taoiseach as to how that core issue of what would replace the current law is to be addressed because, ultimately, whatever the citizens' assembly decides, it has to come back in here. I do not know whether the citizens' assembly will be decided by pollsters with some sort of polling company again being recruited to conduct an assessment of what it thinks reflects a sample. Polling companies and their samples have got it hopelessly wrong in the United States and hopelessly wrong in the United Kingdom. They got our election hopelessly wrong as well. I told everybody that for six months in advance and no commentator would listen but that is another day's work. There are significant issues with polling companies around sampling techniques, etc., and that is something that should be factored in here in terms of how the citizens' assembly will be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_132"> In terms of the eighth amendment issue, there is a legitimate question also of how the process can be run in such a way as to ensure that it is not just the loudest voices that get a hearing. I attended a hearing of the Constitutional Convention and I am not so sure what transpired on the day I was there reflected where the vast majority of the Irish people were in terms of those who were to advocate, make submissions, etc. A citizens' assembly is a wrong term. There is only one citizens' assembly, that is, the one elected by democratic franchise - direct election by the people. What tends to happen when such structures are established is that those who are selected - they are well meaning and I have no difficulty with that - very often become subject to the loudest lobby group or advocacy group of the day but the vast majority of people living in the country are going about their daily lives and are largely removed from its deliberations. That can happen all democratic institutions or public fora where matters are discussed but there was a sense of that in the Constitutional Convention and there is an issue as to how one can ensure that it is not just the loudest voices that get a hearing, particularly on an issue as sensitive as this one will be. If it is ultimately dealt with through a proper process in the Oireachtas, at least everybody in here is answerable to the people. The people can judge their elected representatives on how they speak, advocate and vote on an issue in this House. On balance, I would be of a view that a complex issue such as this, an issue that is central to how our democratic system works, should be determined by the Oireachtas, and I would put that to the Taoiseach.</p>

            <p eId="para_140">The vast majority of Deputy Martin's party went to ground during that referendum campaign, which was an expression of great joy, exuberance and enthusiasm by thousands of people. I think Deputy Martin misjudged the mood a little but I admit that the Deputy said his piece at his party's Ard-Fheis.</p>
            <p eId="para_141"> There should be no reason we should not consult with a representative group of people. The company involved in selecting citizens for the Constitutional Convention was not setting out polls on this. It was the method by which one would contact ordinary people from all over the country based on geography, age, gender, etc. The Constitutional Convention had the participation of politicians and citizens and there were claims the politicians would outtalk others and tend to dominate. This assembly will be citizens' only. Of course, they will be free to make whatever conclusion or recommendation they wish but it is in here that the eventual decision will have to be made, namely, if a referendum is to be held, in what form and asking what question. From that point of view, the commitment in the programme for Government is to set up the citizens' assembly within six months. It will be overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach and I will see that happens.</p>
            <p eId="para_142"> I cannot answer Deputy Martin's question on when the first report will come back because the citizens' assembly has not yet even been set up. However, when its conclusions on this matter come back to the Oireachtas committee, which will engage with experts and whoever, it is its conclusions that will come back in here to a plenary session.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">Correct. The point is that one engages with ordinary people around the country about an issue that is quite profound and it is in this assembly that Members will have to make their decision. The Members will have, as Deputy Martin states, the freedom of choice to vote in whatever way they wish, depending on the question that is to be put.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">It is interesting to listen to this discussion because it is being dominated by two men who are leading the two largest conservative parties in the country, and both of them avoiding what is really the key issue. The key issue is a woman's right to control her own body and the men do not want to face up to that.</p>
            <p eId="para_148"> I have been fascinated listening to this discussion. We hear that the Constitution belongs to the people and it is up to the people to decide what goes into and comes out of that Constitution. Does it every cross their minds that our bodies belong to us, as women, and that it is up to us to decide what we do with our bodies? Does that cause some kind of a conflict for them?</p>
            <p eId="para_149"> It is interesting that the women on this side of the House, who are pro-choice and who have the most to lose if a referendum on repealing the eighth amendment falls, are the ones who are advocating it the most. The reason we are advocating it the most is because we have lived most of our adult lives without the right to control our own bodies. We have lived with sisters, daughters, cousins, friends and all women across society who have been denied that right and very many of whom - in fact, 12 a day - have been forced to leave the State to procure abortions elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_150"> People now face the possibility of 14 years in prison for attempting to procure an abortion. That is what the law passed in this House last year states. It is draconian and the only way to end it is to move to a situation where the people to whom the Taoiseach refers and to whom the Constitution belongs make the decision. If the Constitution belongs to the people, then let them decide and give them a choice to have a referendum calling for repeal of the eighth amendment.</p>
            <p eId="para_151"> For 33 years of my adult life, I have lived with this amendment to the Constitution, as have other women and, indeed, lots of men in this country who are very dissatisfied with it. Is it not time, given all the statistics and all the polling, that the Taoiseach just holds the referendum? The Taoiseach does not have to decide what question is asked other than do people want to repeal the eighth amendment of the Constitution. That is a simple question. If the people say "No", then we are stuck with that decision. If the people say "Yes", then there are consequences and we will deal with them.</p>
            <p eId="para_152"> I want to put a case to the Taoiseach because he states there are a number of court cases that have looked at this issue and that have come up with various ways of looking at it and nuances to it. All of those court cases emanated from crises for women - the X case, the Y case and other cases. All of them emanated from serious crises in women's lives. If there are to be more crises in women's lives - there will be because of this amendment of the Constitution - how does one deal with, for example, emergency situations? </p>
            <p eId="para_153"> The following is not a facile question, and lots of words have been bandied about here about whether it is facile, traumatic or sensitive. The Olympic Games will take place in South America this year and the World Health Organization has just ruled that it will not postpone them because of the Zika virus.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">The Brazilian Government is advising the female population of Brazil not to get pregnant. What does the Taoiseach say to Irish sportswomen, participants and tourists who want to go to Brazil for the Olympic Games? Do the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, advise them not to get pregnant? If they get pregnant while in Brazil and are at risk of a deformed foetal abnormality, will they return to Ireland to be told they cannot have medical treatment here? What advice will the Taoiseach give female participants and spectators in the Olympic Games? It is very important. While that amendment remains enshrined in our Constitution, such situations will be repeated and will be continually faced by women in this country, whether they are Irish citizens or not.</p>
            <p eId="para_155"> The citizens' assembly of which the Taoiseach spoke sounds very nice, and he said the people chosen would be gender-balanced and age-balanced. Who will pick them? Will it be the Taoiseach, Fine Gael, the Independent Deputies who support the Government and who are against women having the right to choose? Who will choose the citizens who will make the decision and return to the House with a recommendation? A real decision can be made only by giving people a vote and putting the referendum to the people. What is the Taoiseach afraid of? What are the people who are against the referendum afraid of? Are they afraid the people might decide, after 33 years, that the amendment is problematic, discriminatory and denies women their basic rights?</p>
            <p eId="para_156"> Will the Taoiseach please answer my specific question on how he will advise our citizens who may attend the Olympic Games in the autumn?</p>

While the Deputy makes a very strong case, in 1983 the eighth amendment was introduced into the Constitution by the Irish people and it was a guarantee of the right to life of the unborn.

            <p eId="para_168">As the Deputy is aware, in order to change the Constitution, one must have the approval of the people. What question does she want to ask them? They have been asked the question before in respect of suicide as a basis on which to narrow the eighth amendment and they rejected it. There have been other referenda on abortion. It is perfectly in order to consult with a broad range of people who will not be selected by any party in here or by a polling company, which might say the percentage in the polls is up or down. They will be selected on the basis of objectively picking men and women in areas around the country on a very professional basis, putting together a citizens' assembly to reflect on this question and all the matters that arise from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_169"> This assembly, to which the people have elected party representatives and representatives who do not represent any party, will deal with the question. We do not have to accept the recommendation of the citizens' assembly, however if we want an analysis of what we might be able to do in respect of the eighth amendment, it must be decided here. We will have to vote on whether we bring forward a Bill for a referendum. The people elected must make the decision on a Bill to hold a referendum to ask the people the question or not. It is not as simple as repealing the eighth amendment of the Constitution, as the Deputy said. We speak as party leaders, and men, no more than women have an interest in the Constitution. The Deputy rightly pointed out that in the case of fatal foetal abnormalities, it is women who have to put up with the consequences of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_174">There is a need for comprehensive constitutional reform, as we all know. The Constitutional Convention worked. I attended many of its meetings and my only criticism is of the Government's refusal to implement the recommendations the Constitutional Convention made on many issues. I also do not understand why the Taoiseach has changed the format and decided to exclude politicians from participation. It was a useful experience and the proceedings were not dominated by any politician. The people who attended were delighted to be asked to go. They briefed themselves and were well informed on the issues they were dealing with. I do not understand why the Taoiseach would change something which worked. He should spend his time implementing the recommendations of the Constitutional Convention rather than experimenting with some other version of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_175"> Sinn Féin is very clear that the eighth amendment must go. Sin é. It is up to the people to decide. They must be the arbitrators on the issue and that requires a referendum. We will all be bound by the outcome of the referendum. Perhaps our position will not be supported by the majority of citizens. The only question is when the Taoiseach will have the referendum and give the people their say.</p>

            <p eId="para_176">I am glad the Taoiseach is going to consider gender as an issue. It is very generous of him. The last time I looked, only one gender on the planet could become pregnant, namely, women. There seems to be a gulf. The Taoiseach has been here 40 years and was in the Dáil when the eighth amendment was foisted on us. It should not have been put into the Constitution. There are issues that should not be in a Constitution. This is health issue that affects women. Many other issues are not in the Constitution. The Taoiseach does not seem to understand that women must make this decision. Nobody else can do it, given that nobody else will carry the pregnancy to full term, bring up a child, or whatever the circumstances are, whether the woman is too young, too old, does not have enough money or has health reasons. Nobody else can make the decision but women. All the Taoiseach is doing with this ban is forcing women to leave the country. Whether or not abortion is legal makes no difference to the abortion rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_177"> I thought I was listening to another party when I heard Deputy Micheál Martin talking earlier about how he led the movement for gay rights. There is a strange phenomenon whereby people are boasting about how they championed marriage equality and yet they do not seem to see a contradiction when they suppress women's rights.</p>

I find that really weird. This is very simple. The Taoiseach can complicate it all he likes but we need to repeal the eight amendment of the Constitution. As Deputy Bríd Smith and I have said, what we want is a referendum to remove what should never have been put into the Constitution in the first place and which is now way behind where people are in this regard. This Dáil would then legislate for the conditions in which abortion would be allowed.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">No. I have a significant issue with that. I am been informed by both our Whip and party that there has been absolutely no consultation with anybody regarding the restoration of the Bills. That has been dictated by the Government side alone in terms of what Bills are to be restored. Given the spirit of the new Dáil and what we are meant to be about, there should be consultation with all of the House as to what is to be prioritised. The Labour Party has significant issues with the Admission to Schools Bill. It has been unilaterally decided not to restore it. That is fair enough if the Minister has his position on that but there should have been consultation on what Bills should be brought back and what ones should not be. A business committee is about to be formed under Dáil reform. I would have thought it should have been brought together and that together the Members of the House would determine the priority as to what Bills should be restored and hear arguments as to which ones certain people may not want to have restored.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I agree. There has been much talk about ordering business in a different way and the agreement is that we are not going to do it through the old Whip system and that there will be a business committee which will set the agenda for the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">There was no consultation with us in regard to what Bills were to be restored. As a precursor to having the business committee, that would have been the normal issue. We have tabled an amendment in the name of the Labour Party Whip to restore the school admissions Bill, but there might be other Bills which Deputies have in mind that have already begun the legislative process in the Houses. It would be useful if prior to the Government Whip simply determining what should be back on the Order Paper, which will probably determine the business for next week, there were some consultation with other parties, as will be the norm when the business committee is extant.</p>

The Deputies tell me there has been no consultation about those Bills coming back on the Order Paper nor has there been any consultation about the Private Members' Bills other parties wish to put on the Order Paper. I do not want to have a row about this. For instance, in respect of the school admissions Bill to which Deputy Howlin refers, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, has already indicated that a new admissions Bill will be introduced as part of the programme for Government and he is working on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">The Minister for Education and Skills does not agree with the Bill. He made that clear to our spokesperson ten minutes ago. People are entitled to different perspectives on legislation and I do not have an issue with that. It is legitimate, but we should be very straight up about it. It should not just disappear off the agenda suddenly. It was alerted to me about 25 minutes ago that there was an issue around the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill. Generally speaking, the Dáil and the business committee should be prioritising what Bills we think are important. We only have six weeks or so before the summer recess. It is 1 June now and we may have two months. Realistically speaking, what Bills are we going to get through in the next two months? Is it not within the capacity of the Oireachtas to decide three or four Bills that will definitely be progressed before the summer recess and take it after that?</p>

          <p eId="para_246">The commitment in the programme for Government on a new dedicated armed support unit for Dublin, as serious crime requires a serious response, was made in February. The Minister has said that whatever responses are necessary, we will face down the activities of these ruthless gangs. Will new moneys be allocated in respect of the announcements made or is the funding to come from within the 2016 allocation to An Garda Síochána? When can we expect misuse of drugs legislation in respect of the issue of prescription drugs which I have raised consistently over the last two weeks? What is the timeline for the legislation to reduce the thresholds above which the Criminal Assets Bureau can intervene and take action? I think it is to go from €7,000 to €1,000. When can we expect that?</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> There is a commitment in the programme for Government to build on North-South co-operation for the benefit of both sides of the Border. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Theresa Villiers, and others have given mixed messages about free movement between North and South in the event that the people of Northern Ireland and Britain vote to exit the European Union. Can the Taoiseach clarify his understanding of the implications for cross-Border controls and, ultimately, cross-Border co-operation? Does he agree that if Britain were to exit the European Union, it would have a negative impact on cross-Border economic activity?</p>

          <p eId="para_248">Interviews are being conducted in respect of the new task force on crime. An allocation of €5 million has been made available on foot of discussions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the task force on crime will be up and running as soon as possible over the next couple of months.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> In respect of North-South bodies, I would not like to see the return of customs points along the Border in the event that the electorate in Britain were to decide to leave the EU. However, I would not have any control over that, albeit it would be our wish not to see it happen. I listened to the managing director of a company based in Monaghan yesterday saying that much of that company's machinery moves through Britain and that this would mean extra paperwork both into Britain and exiting through Britain which would be bureaucratic, inefficient and cost time and money. Clearly, I have a difference of opinion here with the Secretary of State. If the decision is to leave, it would be our wish in the subsequent two-year negotiation, which would probably be a preliminary period, to avoid that happening. However, one does not have control over it in that the attitude of other countries in Europe towards Britain is unknown. The agreement reached at the European Council on the propositions put forward by Prime Minister David Cameron was done on a one-off basis. If the electorate in Britain decides to remain as a member state of Europe, those changes become effective immediately. If they decide to leave the European Union, we are into a complex and long series of difficult negotiations the outcome of which is uncertain. While I would like to think that we will not end up with border controls and customs points, I find it hard to see how, in that event, one could avoid having some measure of that applying. It is not something the Government would be in control of.</p>

          <p eId="para_252">What is the status of the work of the expert panel which was established in February to examine the issue of defective concrete blocks in the construction of homes in Donegal and Mayo? The panel's terms of reference cover only private housing. Last night, "Prime Time" revealed the profound failure of State regulation of the industry and the very deep trauma this has caused for the families affected. Potentially, hundreds of council homes may fall victim to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The Government is insisting on Donegal County Council meeting what could be a major bill. This would impact on the provision of other local services in that disadvantaged county. Will the Government amend the terms of reference of the expert panel to cover publicly owned property?

The Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, will travel to both counties to look at the situation at first hand and speak to the householders involved. He will report to the Minister on what we can do here. I know that, when this issue was examined before in dealing with the pyrite problem in the greater Dublin area, it was considered to be outside the terms of reference. The Minister of State is to visit both locations and the Minister will report. We will give Deputy Gerry Adams the details.</p>

Given that this issue is of such importance to us, will the Taoiseach consider tabling an all-party motion next week in the House, one that would be signed not only by all of the parties but by all Deputies also, calling on Irish voters and those with Irish connections in the United Kingdom who have an entitlement to vote, as well as UK citizens living in this jurisdiction, to vote in favour of the United Kingdom remaining in the European Union and explaining in a debate how that would be in our strategic interests?</p>

          <p eId="para_268">When in the next 30 days will the Minister attend the House to attempt to justify the extension of the FEMPI legislation? It must be renewed before 30 June if the Government wishes to renew it. I have tabled a motion which is on today's clár calling for its repeal. On day one when it was introduced in 2009, we were told that we were in a state of emergency and that the Government needed to introduce emergency legislation to reduce public sector workers' pay. I have just looked up whose was the famous quote, "Never let a good crisis go to waste," but it has been attributed to a few people, including Winston Churchill and Rahm Emanuel, both of whom stated one could do things in a crisis that one would not normally get away with. One could argue that we were in a crisis in 2009, but the Taoiseach's party has been declaring since the general election that we are now in recovery. That recovery is being felt by some but not by the majority and certainly not by workers. The repeal of the FEMPI legislation would mark the beginning of what we believe would be payback for workers. If we are in recovery, why do we need emergency legislation and why will we continue to penalise public sector workers after 30 June? The penalties are significant and mean that many of them cannot afford to put a decent roof over their heads during what is an accommodation crisis. There would be a major payback for the economy were public servants to have their pay restored, as they could spend it in the local economy and begin to generate activity. It is important to know, therefore, whether the Government intends to extend this emergency and repressive legislation. If it continues one of its hallmark emergency Acts that is punitive for the public sector while claiming that the economy is in recovery, it does not bode well in seeking to build confidence in the economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_269">I thank the Deputy for her comments. The programme for Government is very clear. It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_270">We will establish a Public Service Pay Commission to examine pay levels across the public service, including entry levels of pay. We will support the gradual, negotiated repeal of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts having due regard to the priority to improve public services and in recognition of the essential role played by public servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">As the Deputy will be aware, this is already under way. It is an orderly, negotiated repeal of the FEMPI legislation. I remind the Deputy that, because of careful and prudent management of the economy and not without difficulty, the unemployment figure yesterday was 7.8%, down from just over 15% five years ago, which represents a very significant improvement, but we need to do more. Obviously, as resources come into the economy, one can spend and divert them into areas of disadvantage.</p>

          <p eId="para_275">The school transport scheme appears to be undergoing changes. At this point in the year parents are beginning to worry that there will not be a seamless arrangement in September. Many rely on this service, particularly concession passengers in going to work. Will we be given the information in a timely manner if there are to be changes, in the light of the difficulties this issue can cause during the school holidays?</p>
          <p eId="para_276"> Given the importance of the Irish Glass Bottle site and the large proposal in that regard, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has indicated that it has concerns.

          <p eId="para_277">The Irish Glass Bottle site has been confirmed as a strategic development zone and being an essential part of the programme for Government in the provision of housing, accommodation and for commercial activities. Dublin City Council has to put together a master plan. The question the Deputy raises in respect of the anxieties or concerns people might have is for the city council to deal with in the context of the management plan. Obviously, the Government has made its decision. This is seen as a very strategic development that will improve the opportunities for business and the provision of accommodation, as well as life opportunities for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">The city council will deal with both the strategic plan and the concerns mentioned by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_279"> In respect of school transport, obviously a report has indicated a review is to be conducted in the next school year in regard to implementation, if applicable, in the following academic year. People will say that just because there is a review does not necessarily mean certain outcomes. School transport has been an essential part of the education system since its introduction back in the 1960s. Clearly, the Minister will be careful in his review so students will continue to have the opportunity to travel to school and receive a proper education. It is for some time in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_280">On the same issue, the briefing the Minister got in the Department of Education and Skills pointed out there was significant work under way already with Bus Éireann with a view to making the changes that are proposed. This is even before a review. There was a review announced in the programme for Government but before that announcement there seems to have been significant work going on. Is it likely to happen?

          <p eId="para_287">It is on jobs and rural development, on page 42 of the programme for Government. Large payments of VAT and other taxes due to the principal contractors whom the subcontractors work for are being delayed, in many cases for long periods, by the Revenue Commissioners. The delay is rumoured to be caused by a shortage of staff in the Revenue departments. This is causing a vicious circle whereby the smaller operator at the end of the line is waiting too long for his €2,000 or €3,000 to pay wages to staff or make other payments. Such people cannot survive and are going under.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> New regulations from June 2015 mean that subcontractors cannot be paid until the principal contractor logs the details with the Revenue Commissioners. How can one log in, in rural Kerry or other rural areas, when one has nothing to log in to? There is no broadband available there.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">I wish to refer to the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and, in particular, the supply and pricing of medical goods under it. Last week, the HSE indicated to pharmacists that it would no longer fund a drug called Camcolit. This drug prevents manic episodes and it is a mood stabiliser for people suffering from bipolar disorder. It arrests aggressive and self-harming incidents. The HSE has recommended an alternative drug called Priadel, which it says is interchangeable. However, eminent psychiatrist Dr. John Hillery stated it is not interchangeable due to the pharmacokinetic differences in the drugs. This is a reference to how the body deals with, absorbs and releases the drug.</p>

In the meantime, the Minister has written to Westmeath County Council refusing to take on board the wishes of the democratically elected members of that council regarding the county development plan, stating their amendments are premature pending the publication of the wind energy guidelines. Two years after promising the publication of those guidelines, we are still waiting for them. Perhaps the Taoiseach will update the House on when we will actually see them.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_456">and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_457">(<i>m</i>) the Committee shall meet as frequently as appropriate to fulfil its remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">This motion is real evidence of the new Dáil responding to the message the people delivered at the recent general election. The message I heard loudly and clearly in my role is to put the benefits of economic success to work for people to deliver the services that matter to them. However, the people also gave us the challenge of finding a new way of working together and responding to this challenge presents an historic opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> The new Dáil is diverse but need not be divided. Together we can achieve one thing that has never happened in health policy, namely, a long-term consensus on its fundamental principles. I am excited about this and grateful to everyone who has agreed to this motion. I acknowledge, in particular, the role of Deputy Róisín Shortall in liaising with me on the motion on behalf of the Opposition. Opposition Members presented a motion on this issue and we worked together to arrive at this hybrid motion, if one likes. </p>
          <p eId="para_460"> While members of the public and the people who work so hard in our health service have no lack of appetite for reform, they are certainly fatigued by piecemeal reforms that do not really change anything and the shifting priorities that often come with political change. The work of the new committee will mean members of the public and those working in the service can have a sense of certainty that there is a long-term strategy agreed by political consensus and, I hope, societal consensus that will not change no matter what the make-up of the next Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> We all know the health service faces many challenges. Moreover, the programme for partnership Government acknowledges that we have an ageing population who are living longer and whose needs will become greater and more diverse. We also have the highest birth rate in Europe. As citizens, all of us at some point in our lives will need to access health services. Therefore, we have a common interest in finding a common way forward for improving and developing our health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> The Government comes to this motion with a clear objective in sight. As set out in the programme for partnership Government, the Government is committed to the goal of universal health care, a concept endorsed by the World Health Organization, United Nations, OECD and European Union. As an overall goal to improve our health services, universal health care involves four main objectives, as set out by the WHO, namely, reducing unmet health needs; reducing inequalities in access to health goods and services; improving service quality; and improving financial protection, which means patients must not face catastrophic or impoverishing levels of health spending as a result of seeking health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> The World Health Organization notes that no country fully achieves all the universal health coverage objectives for 100% of the population, 100% of the services available and 100% of the cost, without waiting lists. However, it believes that every country can improve efficiency, reduce waste and increase value from its health spend. By doing so, we can advance the cause of universal health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> In striving for the optimal single tier health service for Ireland, there are inevitable policy trade-offs to be confronted. These trade-offs often involve tensions between efficiency and equity or between comprehensiveness and cost control. In all countries, not only Ireland, the trade-offs centre on three basic dimensions of the health service which must be confronted when designing a health service. These are the proportion of the population to be covered, the range of services to be covered and the proportion of the total costs to be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> We also know there are factors outside of the health service which affect universal health care, including housing, employment and education. This requires a whole-of-Govemment, health in all policies approach and this is echoed in the Healthy Ireland framework. There are, therefore, tough policy choices, trade-offs and decisions to be made, especially in terms of managing resources, addressing performance and ensuring accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> The previous programme for Government, 2011-16, committed to a major programme of health reform, the aim of which was to deliver universal health care, with access to quality services based on need and not ability to pay. In April 2014, the White Paper on Universal Health Insurance, UHI, was published. It proposed a competitive, multi-payer model of universal health insurance as the means to achieve universal health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Having reviewed the results from the UHI costing project, it was concluded that the high costs associated with the White Paper model of UHI were not acceptable and further research and cost modelling were needed before definitive conclusions could be drawn on the best means to achieve universal health care. This is the current position and whatever approach we adopt, there is a need for consensus on the direction of health policy. The new committee offers a great opportunity to try to achieve this consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> One of most important features of any country's health service is how it is funded, both in terms of the amount of money required and the manner in which it is financed. These are difficult questions to answer and will clearly be central to the deliberations of the all-party committee. Making changes to funding levels and financing methods takes time and requires careful management, not least to avoid disruption to what are vital existing services. That is one reason it is important to take a long-term view of how the health service can be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> The 2016 health budget is €13.1 billion and increases in the health budget have been possible in the previous two budgets.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">It is the Government's intention to work with the Oireachtas to sustain these annual increases going forward, basing health expenditure on multi-year budgeting supported by a five year health service plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> One aspect of the motion we can all support is the need for a decisive shift within the health service towards primary care and the effective delivery of primary care in every community. The more intervention we can have for patients at the earliest possible stage and as close to home as possible, the more likely there will be a better outcome for patients. To do this, it will be necessary to build up GP capacity to respond to patient's needs and the expansion of chronic disease management in general practice. We will continue to support the provision of mental health and disability services within the community where appropriate. Developing primary care services and integrating primary and secondary care services is a vital component in any strategy to address the issues facing our hospitals, in particular emergency departments. In developing models of person centred, co-ordinated care, we can draw on the work of the national clinical programmes, in particular the piloted integrated care programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> While the new committee will have many health service challenges and difficulties to examine, which should not be underestimated, we should also acknowledge that the health service has been changing and it would be wrong not to acknowledge where success has happened. For example, we have seen life expectancy in Ireland increase by two and a half years since 2004 to where it is now above the EU average. We have seen mortality rates for circulatory system and respiratory diseases fall, an improvement in cancer care, a reduction in the in-hospital mortality rate following admission with a heart attack, a decrease in the average length of stay in hospitals and significant progress in reducing tobacco consumption. Progress has been made in many health areas and it is important to recognise that progress along with recognising those who work so hard at the front line.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> There is much more to do, particularly in regard to prevention and integrated care. However, there are important changes already under way on which we can build. Universal health care is not just something to implement but is a direction and a journey. Ultimately, how far and how fast we proceed in the direction of universal health care is a question of choices and how we make them. I pledge my full support as Minister, and that of the Government, to assisting the committee in any way we can. I passionately believe that if we can arrive at a political and societal consensus about our direction of travel for a universal public health service, we can provide a degree of certainty to citizens, patients and those who work on the front line. I look forward to working with people on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_475"> Fianna Fáil supports this motion because we believe we need a discussion at both parliamentary and societal level about how we should fund health care in the years ahead. We talk about universality and access to health care as a right and entitlement but we must acknowledge that the State's capacity to fund that creates difficulties in regard to achieving that goal and ambition. </p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Previously, rather than talk about the delivery of health care, we have talked about structural reforms. Our constant obsession with structural reforms, without knowing clearly and definitively what direction we intend to go, has undermined confidence and morale among those who provide health care services across the country and has sapped the ability of the organisation meant to deliver health care. If we are committed to a public health service, we need a public service that can deliver health care. Fianna Fáil is committed to a national public health system. Currently, the HSE has responsibility for delivering health care and while there have been many challenges in regard to its ability to manage and deliver health care, we must acknowledge that even if we change the name or structure, we will still require a national organisation to deliver health care. I hope that following the discussions and deliberations of this committee, we will be able to come to a political arrangement as to what direction we intend to go in terms of delivery of health care. I hope that once we have reached that consensus, regardless of political outcomes after general elections, there will be a single pathway towards our goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> We must acknowledge the huge demographic pressures beginning to build in this country. I do not believe we are adequately prepared for these. The demographics show there will be a major increase in the number of people over 65, 75 and 85 in the next ten to 15 years. We must put clear strategies in place now to ensure we have the capacity, both in terms of physical infrastructure and clinical delivery, to cope with this in the years ahead. To date, we have been unable to consider how to put these structures in place. We talk about the issues but we have been unable to deliver. Take for example our deliberations on primary care. We have had a primary care strategy for more than ten years but as far back as 1988, when then Minister, Rory O'Hanlon, took on the health portfolio, he spoke about five key principles in the delivery of health care. The overriding import of what he said then was the importance of primary care. We have travelled a long way since then in terms of time but our primary and community care structures are not fit for purpose in terms of the delivery of modern, 21st century health care, medical and clinical outcomes. We must accept that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> I welcome the fact the committee will discuss a ten-year strategy and blueprint for how we will deliver health care. This is an ambitious undertaking as we have provided just a six month timeframe to meet all the stakeholders and come up with an interim report on the direction. The issue of how we will fund our health care service in the future will certainly arise. Currently, half of our population has private health care. Private health care and people who take out private health insurance make a significant contribution in the sense that they lighten the obligation of the State in regard to providing health care. Without private health insurance, if those now willing to pay for health care were all dependent on the public health system as it stands, the system would collapse. We must be honest and acknowledge that the public health system as it stands does not have the capacity to deliver health care for all 4.6 million citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> We need to talk about a sustainable health service. We should remove ourselves from ideological debate on the type of health service the various political parties and individuals want and focus on developing a clear pathway to universal health access and ensuring funding is put in place to provide that. Currently, the State does not have the financial wherewithal to deliver on this immediately, so we need a stepping stone process. Take for example the roll-out of free GP care. We debated this issue on many occasions in the previous Dáil. I am not opposed to the concept of universal, free access to GPs. However, we are going about it the wrong way if we prioritise one cohort over another and disadvantage those who most need health care in the stepping stone process towards that. The rolling-out of free GP access should be based first on those in greatest need and means tested to the point where by some stage in the future, everybody will have free access to GP services.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> In talking about the capacity of primary care, we cannot expect a service to provide the best clinical outcomes when it is completely overwhelmed and incapable of delivering the care we wish to ensure. We have talked about moving the focus from the acute hospital setting to primary and community care but at the same time, we have not bolstered the capacity of personnel and infrastructure in these areas to ensure we have proper primary and community care services that will lighten the burden on acute hospitals. Day in, day out people are referred by GPs to acute hospitals throughout the State because they cannot access diagnostics in the normal course of events. People are consistently referred to emergency departments for X-rays, radiography services and other diagnostics. There must be another way to access diagnostics rather than through the acute hospital setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> We have talked about the grand plans of hospital groups and this Government has focused on hospital trusts, something we have major concerns about. However, the practical changes we could make over the next number of months, which should not be too costly, could make a huge difference in regard to the capacity of the acute hospitals to deal with the issues they should be dealing with and the capacity of the primary and community care units to deal with issues they should be dealing with.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">I hope the committee will not get caught up on addressing a strategy that has a ten-year outlook without first acknowledging that, in the meantime, we could make key structural changes, such as access to GP services for diagnostics without referral through the emergency departments. We should enhance the services as this is the best way to deliver health care in the years ahead. </p>
          <p eId="para_483"> I have been thinking about the fiscal rules for some time. A focus on preventative care will require front-loaded investment but there are fiscal rules relating to budget deficits and I believe there should be some discussion with the European Union with a view to showing that by front-loading investment in preventative medicine we will produce cost savings in the years thereafter. Within the strict budgetary parameters it will be difficult for any state to invest in preventative care without running huge surpluses. With investment in education programmes about lifestyle changes to address areas such as diabetes, obesity, cardiac problems, COPD and many others, we can create huge savings, both financially and in human terms, in the coming years. We have to look at this if we want to strategically invest in a preventative health care programme. We have spoken about health and well-being as constituting the new emphasis of how we deliver health care. In this context preventative medicine, while it comes with a front-loaded cost, does create potential savings.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> Mental health has been described as the "Cinderella" of our health services for many years. We have to be honest with ourselves and question how much of A Vision for Change has been achieved. We have to admit that we have not grasped the issue of mental health and well-being in society in any serious or meaningful way. There are significant challenges in the area and the committee should also focus on them. </p>
          <p eId="para_485"> The other key area where society and policy makers have failed in the past few years is disability, especially in the case of getting people with disabilities into the workplace. Even during the Celtic tiger era, when we had 4% unemployment, we failed to move these people into the workplace.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">I look forward to embracing the spirit of this motion but we should focus on a few areas in the short term in order to encourage the Government to change its policy direction on access to health care, as well as develop a vision for the delivery of health care in the years ahead.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LouiseOReilly" eId="spk_256">
          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T12:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_488">I congratulate Deputy Finian McGrath on his appointment, and Deputy Simon Harris, who is temporarily out of the House. I also thank Deputy Shortall for her initiative in this area, which has been somewhat overlooked in some of the press statements, particularly those coming from the Government. I acknowledge her efforts to bring all parties together.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Everyone wants an efficient, fair and humane health service. Politicians from every political party and none have called for this in every single election since the inception of this State. However, what we have is a two-tier system in which individuals and families face years, if not months, of waiting for treatment or diagnosis. Trolley numbers have spiked and it is only a few years since Senator James Reilly, the former Minister for Health, told us we would never again see 569 patients on trolleys. The words were only just out of his mouth when the target was breached. Waiting lists stretch into years and medical staff, nurses and health professionals trained at home are leaving in droves due to poor working conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> Deputy Billy Kelleher referred to mental health services as the "Cinderella" of the health system but this is not a pantomime, it is very real. The people who depend on the mental health services and the men and women who deliver them have reached breaking point. Our health system is in a state of perpetual crisis. We all know people who have been let down and failed by the two-tier health system. We know people who cannot afford health insurance but have borrowed money to avail of private health care because they cannot bear to wait for as long as they are expected to. We know people who can neither afford insurance nor borrow for health care and who have to wait in pain and in fear. We have seen public patients with late diagnosis die where private patients survive. The tragic part of this is we know that this is now the rule in the Irish health system and not the exception.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> This crisis can be boiled down to two key failings on the part of successive Governments. First, is a fundamental inequality in how patients are treated, differentiated on ability to pay and geography. Second, is the sheer incapacity of the system to deal with demographic pressures, evidenced particularly in our emergency departments and in maternity care. No two patients are identical. However, some pay more than others for the same care. Families in one part of the country get access to necessary services denied to those in a different HSE region. The less well off die younger and live less healthy lives. This is not acceptable. Inability to pay should not deny anyone the opportunity to lead a full, long, healthy life. We need to increase investment in the health system, not simply to provide more resources and capacity but to directly challenge and eliminate these structural inequalities. Building adequate capacity across our health system and eliminating the unequal barriers to access will require significant and sustained public investment. Sinn Féin is committed to the realisation of a world-class system of universal health care, accessed on the basis of need, free at the point of delivery and funded by progressive taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> The task we face in the coming period will not be an easy one. The clock counts down from the moment of our first meeting and we only have six months to present a report, which is to be discussed in this House. Politicians have never been able to agree on health across the decades. If the members of the committee can agree a strategy in six months it will be a miracle but we in Sinn Féin will work hard to ensure that the committee does its work efficiently and in a spirit of co-operation. The internal dynamics of the committee and the work it does are only one part of the puzzle. What happens after we discuss the report? What happens to the report, its recommendations, the stakeholder input, the expert opinions and evidence, and the possible funding models?</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> It was said that many Ministers for Health commissioned so many reports that one could paper the inside and outside of Leinster House with them and we do not need another report. We do not need another photo opportunity, another trip to the plinth to talk to journalists. My concern with this process is that the report, the recommendations, the expert opinion, potential models and stakeholder engagement will all be discarded if they are seen to run contrary to the Government's policy. Can the Minister assure us that this will not be a futile exercise in that regard? Are we tying up members, stakeholders, academics and others into a process that will just consign the report to a library afterwards?</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> There are very large parts of the programme for Government to which Sinn Féin cannot sign up. I will not sign up to an agenda for privatisation, whether it be outright or through the back door. This is completely at odds with the realisation of a universal health care system. If the Minister is serious about this committee coming together to work collectively on a vision for the health service, we must be clear that any moves to privatise the health service in the form suggested by the programme for Government need to be shelved. The committee cannot gain legitimacy and respect, or develop a comprehensive programme of work, if it is precluded from its work by contrary plans pursued by the Minister at the outset. It is important the Minister make a full statement on this matter. </p>
          <p eId="para_495"> This issue will not be easily addressed within the six-month timeframe. Many factors need to be considered, including the demographic profile of the population and its geographical spread, demand and what constitutes health spending. When we talk about prevention and early intervention, we must be cognisant that this will impinge upon other Departments, and that there needs to be a whole-of-Government approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">It is not clear how the ten year plan will work with other Departments. There are broader social issues at play. Will the Minister of State convene a ministerial committee to reflect on the work being done by the health committee? Will other Departments be involved? We will propose that the Minister for Health in the North, Ms Michelle O'Neill, be invited to discuss adopting an all-island approach to health care delivery. I strongly suggest this be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">That is good to hear. I have met many stakeholders since my appointment as health spokesperson and there is one common thread - people talk consistently about the need for prevention. It is welcome that the motion mentions prevention, early intervention, self-management and primary care. It seems that across the service this is where we are falling down. Too often we allow situations to reach crisis point, leaving personnel fire-fighting and doing nothing more. We take our eyes off the bigger picture in terms of policy-making and budgetary processes. In the race to reach fiscal targets or as the HSE struggles to stay within budget, we long-finger important interventions and initiatives that could prevent crises from occurring in the future. It is easy to leave the health problems of the future to the politicians and decision makers of the future, but the committee should transcend that thinking. We need to spend mention on preventive care services and it is not just a case of throwing money at initiatives. How does one prevent children from needing multiple extractions under a general anaesthetic, given that they cannot access dental services while at school? How does one ensure timely discharge from hospital in the absence of proper community rehabilitation services, sufficient home care supports or access to therapies? In that context, it is welcome that we are discussing this motion. I welcome the establishment of the committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_499"> As a package of reforms, including the establishment of a committee on the budgetary process, there is the potential to frame a new dialogue, but there needs to be a blueprint and a plan. I hope, therefore, that the committee will not be just an exercise in electoral platitudes or photo opportunities. I will play my part on it and will be advocating strongly for access to health care as a right. The model of universal health care Sinn Féin is working to achieve includes general practitioner and other primary care services. Quality of care is essential and must be at the heart of the service. Such a new comprehensive system will not be achieved overnight, but a start must be made. That requires political will and a fundamental change in the direction of policy, away from the piecemeal, inequitable, semi-privatised and crisis management approach that has perpetuated the many problems in the health service. How this debate will be framed, how we move beyond the dominant political ideology of recent years which has seen public services starved of funding, how we report, present and act will be the litmus test of the success of this parliamentary exercise. We need to be honest with ourselves. When agency staff cost more than the staff directly employed, regardless of whether we have an ideological bent towards the market and market forces, we need to be able to say the use of direct labour is right, more efficient, cheaper and represents better value for money for the taxpayer. It is not good enough to say a hospital can recruit if it has the money. If it does not have the money, a moratorium is effectively in place in the health service. That is happening and needs to be addressed. </p>
          <p eId="para_500"> Six months from now the real work will begin. The committee will deliver a vision for the health service. Delivering on it will be the biggest task facing the Department, the Minister and future Governments. Many people are depending on us. We cannot let them down and should not sell them short.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T12:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_501">We welcome the motion to develop a single long-term vision or plan for the provision of health care. I add my congratulations to those of others to the two Ministers and acknowledge Deputy Róisín Shortall's singular vision in creating the motion. We are in positive mode in relation to the potential of the committee and will engage productively with it. I welcome the tone of the Minister's speech in that there appears to be a genuine willingness to engage with all parties and all Members in this Dáil in seeking a meeting of minds on how we can figure out and instigate a proper vision for the provision of health care into the future. If we are honest, we can reasonably assume that there is much common ground between us on the needs of citizens. There has to be a particular focus on the continuum of care as between primary, secondary and tertiary care. </p>
          <p eId="para_502"> The one question I have on the creation of the committee is how it will dovetail with the commitments in the programme for Government. Will it be a tool of Government policy into the future or what mandate will it have if it comes up with a set of recommendations that do not tally with the commitments in the programme for Government, of which there are many? Given that approximately €13 billion is to be spent this year alone in the health sector and considering the many commitments made in the programme for Government from primary care through to secondary and tertiary care, including mental health, the issue of resources will have to be addressed within the remit of the committee. If we are to aspire to having a comprehensive continuum of care between primary, secondary and tertiary care, including community care and mental health service provision, it will cost a good deal of money and clear choices will have to be made. To be fair to him, the Minister mentioned this in his contribution when he referred to the trade-offs between efficiency and equity and comprehensiveness and cost control. This is something that will merit further interrogation. </p>
          <p eId="para_503"> I welcome the document Better Health because it provides a good template and sets out the parameters within which we are operating. Some of the challenges in health care provision include the fact that the number of people aged over 85 years in Ireland is, according to CSO estimates, increasing by approximately 3.3% each year. This presents a major challenge for all of us in the management of demographics. Some 38% of Irish people over the age of 50 years suffer from one chronic disease. Chronic diseases account for 80% of all GP visits, 40% of hospital admissions and 75% of hospital bed days. </p>
          <p eId="para_504"> The Minister speaks strongly about focusing on primary care and trying to intervene as much as possible at that level. That is something on which we all agree. The aim of such a policy should seek to ensure people are kept out of tertiary care facilities for as long as possible and that interventions are made at community level. That would have a major impact in patient care and would also create the ability to reduce costs and be more efficient in the use of resources. On the flipside, it would require a massive injection of capital into the primary care system. If we are to manage the demographic challenges and the ongoing challenges in chronic care services, as I have outlined, in that paradigm primary care facilities will need resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Speaking as a former Minister of State with responsibility for research and innovation, the last Government created a health innovation hub. We created a demonstrator model whereby we sought to utilise the best research that exists from a geographical perspective in terms of medical devices and services. We sought to inculcate the thinking that exists based on the research that is ongoing within our academic institutions as a means of seeking to ensure those greater efficiencies. I am not sure where the health innovation hub stands at present now that there is a new Government formed. However, I believe that innovation and engagement with stakeholders in the academic space is going to be vital. We will need a proper analysis of population figures and a sense of inculcating some of the thinking that exists within academic institutions to determine how we are going to provide the vision that is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> I believe that the primary care centres are one mechanism by which we could link up with academic institutions to try to drive innovation and to ensure, as Deputy Kelleher stated earlier, that more diagnostics take place within the primary care settings so as to prevent people from presenting to secondary and tertiary care facilities and to keep them at home for longer. The data that is used can then be analysed and partnered with medical device companies, innovators in the health care provision space or academics to try to analyse the data so that we can then produce policy outcomes that deliver the efficiencies that are necessary for the system. We need more of that within the system. It is a case of mainstreaming that into the system because currently it is peripheral.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> We need to have a greater interrogation of the relationship between the HSE and the Department of Health. There is still some siloed thinking in how the HSE, this House, the Department of Health and the Minister interact. We need a greater interrogation of that relationship to ensure that there is more transparency around it. We also need to look at why there is a constant need for a Supplementary Estimate on an ongoing basis. I say that objectively. Taking this year for example, if there is provision made at the start of the year for €13 billion, will this committee have a remit to examine and interrogate the deployment of resources more closely? We need to look at it in terms of seeking efficiencies for the system in order that the citizen can have confidence that he or she will have access to the services that are necessary, whether he or she presents to a GP, a secondary care facility or a tertiary care facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> We need to look at the whole issue of health insurance and we need to talk to the health insurance providers. We need to look at why there is spare capacity within secondary care facilities, such as Mallow or Ennis, where more elective surgery could be done. We could take much of the constraints that are in hospitals such as Cork University Hospital and radiate more services out to secondary care facilities. With regard to mental health, we need to have a proper discussion on how A Vision for Change is implemented and resourced.</p>

          <p eId="para_512">This issue is something that is very close to my heart, but more importantly, to the people of Galway, the country and the patients who are on waiting lists, trolleys and who have not got a health service. I know Deputies have complimented the Minister for Health and I really would like to be positive, but I despair of such statements as "Universal health care is not just something to implement but is a direction and a journey". It is not a journey or a direction. It is a basic human right to have public health. It is a basic human right to walk into a hospital and be treated with dignity and respect and not be sitting on a trolley for three or four days. Even on an economic basis, it is nonsense to make elderly people sit on trolleys. The research clearly points out that somebody over the age of 70 who is on a trolley for two days will inevitably spend a longer period of time in hospital and will therefore cost more. Even on an economic level, we have no choice but to do something about our creaking health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> I have had the privilege in a long career in local politics of sitting on the regional health forum along with 39 other dedicated councillors from Donegal down to Tipperary. I am more than familiar with the health service and its inadequacies. Deputies could come in here in every debate and point out the long waiting lists. I can tell the House that they are extraordinarily long in Galway. At any given time, we have up to 30,000 patients on an outpatient waiting list waiting for basic health services. On inpatient lists, the figure varies from 5,000 to 9,000. One has to ask why our health service is creaking at the seams. Why are we in the position of establishing a committee consequent on many reports up to now, yet we are still in trouble with our health system?</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I wish to pay tribute to Deputy Shortall for her initiative. I have no difficulty in supporting the initiative with regard to the committee. However, I have some concerns with the direction that the committee might take in spending time looking at models of funding for a health service rather than making the health service accountable and available to all our people. In contrast to the Minister, I do not think funding is difficult at all. Funding for our health service comes from our taxes. When I knocked on doors, I did not meet a single person who wanted their taxes reduced. They wanted a health service. I do not know why we need to go down the route of looking at funding. I hope that the committee will look at how to make the health service available as quickly as possible. I hope it will listen to the people on the frontline, the nurses who have never been listened to, the cleaners, the porters and then the consultants on how to improve our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> If I analyse what has happened in my time as a councillor on the regional health forum, there were cutbacks in 2006 during the height of the Celtic tiger. Only the language was different. The Government of 2006 talked about bed refurbishment measures to justify bed and ward closures in Merlin Park University Hospital and the regional hospital. It talked about cost containment measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> We had many failed initiatives. I despair when Fianna Fáil champions the National Treatment Purchase Fund. In my time, we have had at least four failed initiatives without any analysis of the fundamental problems. We had the co-location of private hospitals on public lands led by the former Minister for Health, Mary Harney. It took all of our effort in Galway to fight that appalling initiative to co-locate a private hospital on public lands. We then had the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which in effect channelled public money into private hospitals to keep the private for-profit hospitals making a profit while, at the same time, depleting our public health system. On top of that, we had a special man in Galway for three years on a special salary to deliver the special delivery unit. Again, that channelled public money into private hospitals, allowing waiting lists to build up and then paying public money to treat public patients in a private for-profit hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> I apologise if I am parochial in speaking about Galway, but it is the microcosm of what is happening in the country. Only last Friday, there was an announcement that two DEXA scanners were closed. These are vital pieces of diagnostic equipment in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. They were closed because there was no staff. We had professors speaking out against it and we had the embarrassment of hosting a conference in Galway on that very topic when we could not use the DEXA scanners.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">I have heard indirectly that some effort was made and that one of the scanners has opened again. However, the fundamental problem in regard to lack of staff has gone unanswered. While the Minister tells us there is no embargo, and in any speech he appeals to the HSE to employ further staff, we have the HSE making a statement that it cannot employ any staff until three leave, when one can come in.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> We go from crisis to crisis. Again last week I put down a question in regard to a new public hospital in Galway. I did not do this off my own bat but because the clinical director of the hospital in Galway, which serves the region, has said a new hospital is absolutely necessary and that we must begin planning for it. Under the new politics and in the new atmosphere prevailing in the Dáil, I tabled a question asking, in view of the clinical director's statement, what steps the Minister intended to take. What I got back was Civil Service-speak, although, again, I place no blame on the civil servants. The Minister is paid a very good salary to deal with the questions put. He neatly sidestepped that question and continued on with the old politics in the guise of the new politics. I find that unacceptable. I am sorry he is not present in the House. I thought he would have addressed the serious issue of the lack of capacity in Galway, which is the top risk factor. It was a very serious statement in that the clinical director said the congested site in Galway is simply fire-fighting with each additional building. I listed the buildings involved and he acknowledged the hospital is simply fire-fighting. It is past time to plan for a hospital at Merlin Park, where there is 150 acres of land.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> There are very good consultants in the health service. As he did not ask for his name to remain confidential, I am going to quote one of them, Dr. Peter O'Rourke from Donegal. He took the trouble of writing a two-page letter to all Deputies and he then gave us a document highlighting how practical solutions can be used pending the decision of the committee. That has not been mentioned by the Minister, who received a copy of the letter, as did all Fine Gael Deputies. Dr. O'Rourke makes very practical suggestions in regard to medical day units, five-day wards, diagnostic services and access to simple X-rays. If these measures were implemented, it would reduce the situation pertaining in Galway and in every other hospital throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> I will speak later on the issue of mental health. In Galway, every month 300 patients, including patients suffering from mental health problems, simply leave accident and emergency because they will not be seen. They walk out, lacking the patience to wait. Nobody could have the patience to wait the length of time they have to wait in Galway, notwithstanding the best efforts of the staff. On a monthly basis, 300 people walk out of accident and emergency because no service is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> On top of that, people with mental health problems are trying to access a congested site and an overworked department of psychiatry by going through accident and emergency. We need to ask ourselves a question. Which of us would like to do that? It is okay to make fine speeches in the Dáil but which Deputy would like it if they, or their wives or children, were suffering mental health problems and had to go through a packed accident and emergency department? Which Deputy here today has spent time on a trolley? I have not. That would guide the direction of the conversation and the urgency of recognising that universal health care is a right - not a journey, not a decision, but a right. I will happily work with the committee if it is considering implementing that right as a matter of urgency, dealing in a practical way with the problems and listening to the people who know best.</p>

          <p eId="para_524">In 1948 a leaflet was delivered to every home in the United Kingdom. It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_525">Your new National Health Service begins on 5th July. What is it? How do you get it? It will provide you with all medical, dental and nursing care. Everyone – rich or poor, man, woman or child - can use it or any part of it. There are no charges, except for a few special items. There are no insurance qualifications. But it is not a “charity”. You are all paying for it, mainly as tax payers, and it will relieve your money worries in time of illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">The National Health Service was introduced in Britain by a Labour Government, very different to the Labour Party of today, responding to pressure from a working-class majority population, determined after the Second World War never to go back to the poverty of the 1930s. Today, nearly 70 years after the introduction of the British NHS, the Irish capitalist State has failed to introduce anything that might compare with it. Here, with a health service which prioritises treatment for those who can pay and which dumps thousands of patients on trolleys in overcrowded emergency departments each winter, the State struggles to even provide free GP care for all of its under-sixes.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> In what direction does the Fine Gael Government now aim to take the nation's health services? The programme for Government tells a tale. First it will seek to progressively dismantle the HSE. Second, it will seek to establish hospital trusts with stand-alone finances and third, it will open the door to private finance for sections of hospitals and to outsourcing to private companies. In other words, it is a programme of creeping privatisation and the continuation of neoliberal policies in the Irish health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> The Minister praises the idea of a ten-year plan but if it is to be a ten-year plan going down the Fine Gael road that would be a disaster. On the other hand, if it was a ten-year plan which started by breaking with the current health care model, quickly establishing an Irish national health service, and then strengthening it progressively through the years, that would be something very different. In concrete terms, what would that mean? It would mean the State becoming the provider of the health care needs of all. This would be funded from a pool provided by the taxpayer within the framework of a progressive taxation system. There would be free GP care for all, free dental care for all, free access to good mental health services for all, free operations and hospital care, and free prescriptions at the pharmacy. In other words, there would be genuine universal health care, free at the point of use.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> The Minister charged with overseeing the introduction of the NHS in Britain, Nye Bevan, said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_530">The National Health Service had two main principles underlying it: one, that the medical arts of science and of healing should be made available to people ... irrespective of whether they could afford to pay for them or not [and] the second was that this should be done not at the expense of the poorer members of the community but the well-to-do.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">That is the way it should be done here. The introduction of a 2% millionaire's tax would raise €2.7 billion, enough to reverse all of the health cuts of recent years; a 10% increase in the effective rate of income tax paid by the top 10% of earners would raise the same amount again; and to cut corporate welfare by just 10% would raise another €1.5 billion. That would provide nearly €7 billion with which to kick-start an Irish national health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> The Institute of Obstetricians has recently expressed concern that the National Maternity Hospital will be governed by St. Vincent's Hospital when it transfers to the St. Vincent Hospital's campus. St. Vincent's is owned by the Religious Sisters of Charity, there are nuns of the board of directors and doctors must sign contracts promising to adhere to the religious ethos of the hospital. For example, St. Vincent's prohibits female sterilisation as it conflicts with that religious ethos. This is a disgrace in a modern health service in a modern state in the year 2016. Hospitals funded by the taxpayers must be owned, controlled and run by the people, in other words they must be State-owned and democratically controlled.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Hospitals funded by the taxpayer should not be run by religious orders. We are for a national health service in this country but this can only work in the context of a genuine separation of church and State.</p>

        <speech by="#GinoKenny" eId="spk_265">
          <from>Deputy Gino Kenny<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_534">It is good we are having this debate because this issue affects everybody, regardless of who they are and where in the country they live. The perpetual crisis of our health system mirrors the glaring inequalities of society in Ireland today. According to public health experts, health outcomes and our general well-being are deeply affected by inequality in income and inequality in access to health services. Access to health care when needed is a fundamental human right. From the moment we are born, in the course of life's challenges, somewhere along the way we will all need a health system that takes cares of us at our time of need. The Department of Health has been compared to Angola but even Angola managed to dig up its landmines and find a peace settlement to resolve the bitter civil conflict that ravaged that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The recent report by the Irish Cancer Society that waiting times for life-saving tests for cancer patients are up to 25 times longer for public patients than for those paying privately is distressing and shocking. The report highlighted striking differences between access for public patients and private patients, with GPs reporting that some public patients have to wait up to 480 days for an ultrasound. That means waiting for well over a year for a cancer investigation. The report also quoted an Irish College of General Practitioners report that delays in accessing diagnostics force many patients to pay for scans and tests privately to secure diagnosis and as a result, a patient's ability to pay is linked to his or her ability to access diagnostics used to detect cancer in a timely manner. The report gets to the heart of what is wrong with our health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> I would go even further and state that this way of dealing with cancer patients amounts to negligence and a violation of a basic human right to health care. In its crudest form, those with the ability to pay can skip the queue and access early intervention for cancer and a better life outcome. Health care should not be about queueing for years. It should not be about how big a person's wallet is. It should be about the delivery of universal health care that is not based on someone's ability to pay or any discrimination based on income or social class. If it was any other form of discrimination, such as based on ethnicity or sexual orientation, this health system loophole would have been quite rightly closed down by now. It is no coincidence that successive right-wing Governments, led by Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, have created a two-tier health system. Both parties have applied the logic of the market to water, housing, transport and health. For them profit always comes first even if, such as in the tragic death of Susie Long, patients die waiting.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> Another example of Government failure in early intervention in our health service is waiting times for children with special needs. According to the reply to a parliamentary question I tabled a number of weeks ago, the average waiting time in Dublin Mid-West for a speech and language therapist is 12 to 18 months and for an occupational therapist it is 18 months to two years. These waiting times are only for assessment and do not include the further wait for treatment. This is clearly unacceptable. Children cannot be routinely expected to wait more than half their lives for intervention that needs to be made as early as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> Inclusion Ireland has stated that Ireland is in breach of the recommended number of children who should be assigned to each speech and language therapist. It commented that the recommended caseload size is 30 to 65 children per therapist but in Ireland the national average is an unbelievable 162 children per therapist. To meet international standards, the number of speech and language therapists working in children's disability services would have to be tripled from its current level of 283 speech and language therapists to 800. Inclusion Ireland and other agencies report that, increasingly, hard-pressed families are incurring financial hardship by having to pay for services they cannot access through the public system.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> It is good that we are having this debate about the Irish health service. I hope that by adopting this motion we will make a start at abolishing the two-tier health service that is not fit for purpose. I have worked in the health service for the past 16 years. I know that the fault does not lie with the staff who are very dedicated and extremely professional in what they do. Most people will say that when they use the health service, their experience of front-line staff is incredibly positive. Having gone through numerous pay cuts and cutbacks in the past eight years, it is a testament to the dedication of health service staff that we have a functional health service. Ireland spends more on our two-tier health service than any other European country but we do not get as good a service as countries which spend more on public health services and less on private services. It is time to move away from profiteering and away from buying and selling health care for profit and follow the international evidence that one-tier publicly funded not-for-profit health care is best by far.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelHarty" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Deputy Michael Harty<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_540">I commend the motion to the House. I thank Deputy Róisín Shortall for tabling the motion and the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, for accepting it. I also thank the 150 Members of the Dáil who signed the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> The Irish health service needs a long-term vision. It needs a framework that can build an efficient, effective and functioning health service. At present, unfortunately, in many areas our health service does not function properly. Year on year planning is not delivering an effective acute service. Our service tends to fire fight and respond to crises rather than anticipate crises and problems. Every year, we have a trolley crisis with up to 500 or 600 people per day on trolleys. This should be anticipated. Unfortunately, our trolley numbers are not falling back to zero at present and we continue to have people on trolleys. Today, 250 people are on trolleys but we are in the middle of summer. Each year, this situation deteriorates and the number rises to 500 or 600 people. We should build a service that can anticipate these problems and deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> The HSE delivers some very good services. We have excellent acute cardiovascular services. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, feels there is a deficit in Waterford but throughout the country, and certainly in the mid west, we have wonderful acute cardiac services. We have wonderful breast, prostate, skin and lung cancer services. Our laboratory services for haematology and biochemistry are excellent. Our medical and surgical assessment units work extremely well, provided they are not used as an overflow for casualty during very busy times. These are very positive aspects of the HSE and we should recognise this.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> There is a huge deficit when it comes to communication and integration between community and primary care services on the one hand and casualty and hospital services on the other. There should be a seamless transition between primary and secondary care and one of the most important areas the committee should examine is how we integrate primary and secondary care. This is the view of major medical organisations, including the Irish Medical Organisation and the National Association of General Practitioners. We are looking for solutions and accountability on planning decisions. Quite often, decisions are made in the health service which are devoid of input from those who deliver the service on the front line. This makes no common sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> We must think laterally and differently about how we deliver our health services. In Ireland, 3% of the health budget goes on general practice. This needs to increase to approximately 10% over the next ten years, in line with other European countries. General practice is the engine which will deliver health care reform but, at present, general practice has severe capacity issues. GPs have suffered severely as a result of the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation. They were affected disproportionately because of the manner in which general practice is funded. GP incomes were hit but funding to support and develop general practices was reduced by 38%, which is unsustainable. Many areas have lost GPs and many areas which still have a GP will find it very difficult to replace that GP when he or she retires. New GP graduates are not going into general practice because our contract is out of date and not fit for purpose.</p>

            <p eId="para_546">Mar is eol don Teachta, rinneadh athbhreithniú sa bhliain 2014 ar riachtanas na seirbhíse aeir seo, i gcomhréir le rialacháin an Aontais Eorpaigh. Cuireadh tuarascáil chuimsitheach faoi bhráid mo Roinne a chlúdaigh an tréimhse ó 2003 go 2013. Rinneadh measúnú sa tuarascáil sin ar leibhéal agus ar threocht na gcostas don tseirbhís aeir agus ar an gcomhréireacht idir an oibleagáid seirbhíse poiblí agus riachtanais forbartha eacnamaíochta an réigiúin. I measc nithe eile, léiríodh sa tuarascáil go raibh caiteachas bliantúil mo Roinne ar an tseirbhís aeir tar éis méadú faoi 136% le linn na tréimhse athbhreithnithe, cé gur fhan líon na bpaisinéirí a bhí á n-iompar mórán mar a chéile. Ar an mbunús sin, dúradh sa tuarascáil go raibh sé riachtanach breathnú ar roghanna éagsúla chun luach níos fearr a fháil ar airgead don Státchiste. Is sa chomhthéacs sin a d'ullmhaigh mo Roinn, i gcomhar leis an Oifig um Sholáthar Rialtais, an t-iarratas ar thairiscintí atá faoi chaibidil. Ar ndóigh, thug mo Roinn faoin obair seo in 2015 chomh maith ach, de bharr éiginnteacht faoi stádas Aerfort na Gaillimhe nach raibh ar fáil do thréimhse an chonartha, cuireadh deireadh leis an bpróiseas áirithe sin.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> Sa phróiseas tairisceana atá ar siúl ag mo Roinn faoi láthair, is é Aerfort na Mine amháin atá luaite mar phointe imeachta ar an mhórthír.

Ní mór do mo Roinnse, ar ndóigh, na rialacha maidir le tras-fhóirdheonú agus státchabhair a shásamh sa phróiseas seo uile. Mar a chuir mé in iúl don Teachta mar fhreagra ar Cheist Uimh. 173 uaidh ar 26 Bealtaine, tá spriocdháta den 17 Meitheamh 2016 chun tairiscintí a bheith faighte faoin bpróiseas tairisceana atá ar siúl maidir leis an tseirbhís aeir d’Oileáin Árann.</p>

Dúirt an tAire Stáit an tseachtain seo caite go raibh sé ag scrúdú gnéithe uilig an cháis. An cheist atá agam ná seo: an bhfuil sé i gceist aige é seo a chríochnú roimh an 17 Meitheamh? An bhfuil seans ann go dtarraingeoidh sé siar an t-iarratas ar thairiscintí? Chomh maith le sin, an bhféadfadh sé a rá liom nó a dheimhniú go bhfuil an Roinn tar éis tairiscintí a lorg don tseirbhís gan réamh-shocrú a bheith déanta maidir le costas na seirbhíse ó thaobh an aerstráice sna Mine? An nglacfaí leis go bhfuil an costas nó na táillí atá i gceist a ghearradh ar na hoileánaigh agus ar thurasóirí i bhfad ró-ard?

            <p eId="para_561"> Following the High Court's ruling, progress on the 1916 commemorative centre and conservation project on Moore Street has ceased and arrangements are being made to have limited works, as approved by the court, carried out as soon as possible to preserve and protect the buildings at 14 to 17 Moore Street for the time being. The objective of the works will be to safeguard the buildings, in so far as possible, until a permanent solution is identified. In that context, I am continuing to examine the court's findings in so far as they relate to the Moore Street project and the general operation of the National Monuments Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">I am also examining, in consultation with other Departments, whether there are broader planning and development implications nationally, especially in terms of potential impacts on infrastructural projects such as housing, roads, broadband and other utility developments. I am not at liberty at this juncture to go into further detail on whether the High Court ruling in this case will be appealed.</p>

            <p eId="para_564"> Most Irish people will say the arts, culture and heritage are central to who we are as a people, that they are intertwined with our identity. Many will be shocked, therefore, to hear that the arts and heritage have been added to this Frankenstein Department and that the investment in this Department is only one fifth of that in other European countries. The battlefield site on Moore Street is an example. It is nearly three months since the court ruled on this issue. With regard to the disconnect between the Government and the people and the High Court, what plans does the Minister have to develop a new cultural and heritage plan for the battlefield site on Moore Street?</p>

            <p eId="para_565">I have two decisions to make. I must look at the site on Moore Street in the context of the judgment and I must also look at its wider potential implications. I need to look at whether there are broader planning and development issues nationally. I am still assessing the potential impacts and consulting other Departments. I am also taking legal advice on the matter. I am, therefore, not in a position to give a definitive answer on the issues around the legal case and until that decision is made, I will not be able to say what we plan to do in the wider area. I understand this is an emotive issue, but we have made considerable progress in dealing with it. This is the first Government to have acquired 14 to 17 Moore Street.</p>

            <p eId="para_566">The Minister's first port of call is public opinion on this issue. This is the centenary year of the 1916 Rising and public opinion on the issue is clear. It is also important, being in a minority, that the Government consider the opinion of the Dáil. From what I understand, the positions of Fianna Fáil and my party are close - that everything needs to be done to prevent the travesty of a shopping centre being built on one of the most important heritage and historical sites in the State. This generation has an opportunity to preserve one of the central spaces in the 1916 Rising. My other concern in this regard is that the loans of Chartered Land, the company which is proposing to build a shopping centre in this space, lie with NAMA. If NAMA was to appeal the decision, the State, in effect, would be funding a second appeal against a decision of the High Court which fulfills the will of the people and the Dáil.</p>

            <p eId="para_567">I accept that the location is evocative. I want to see us preserving the buildings which include the final headquarters of the 1916 leaders. The intention always was to restore the buildings, 14 to 17 Moore Street, to their 1916 state in order that visitors would be able to take a step back in time. I am consulting other Departments and whenever the decision is made on the ruling in the court case and what steps we should take in that regard, I will be happy to sit down and have a conversation with my colleagues in the Oireachtas on the best steps forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_569">Funding across the public service, including that which could be provided for investment in culture and the arts, was severely impacted on by the economic crisis. However, since my initial appointment as Minister with responsibility for the arts, I have succeeded in securing increased funding for the sector year on year. The allocation for the Arts Council in 2016 is €60.1 million, an increase of 6% in the past two years. The allocation for the Irish Film Board in 2016, at almost €14.5 million, shows an increase of 3.6% from last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_570"> In terms of capital investment, in January I announced a new €9 million investment scheme for arts and cultural centres to run over the next three years, focused on upgrading the existing stock of such centres around the country. The funding is being made available as part of the capital investment framework 2016 to 2021. Significant refurbishment and expansion projects are also planned or under way at a number of the national cultural institutions, including the National Gallery of Ireland, the National Archives of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_571"> A Programme for a Partnership Government contains an important commitment to work to progressively increase funding to the arts, including the Arts Council and the Irish Film Board, as the economy continues to improve. I will be engaging with my colleagues in government and the Oireachtas to seek to advance this commitment in the context of the forthcoming Estimates and budgetary processes.</p>

            <p eId="para_572">I wish the Minister well in her brief. I asked if she would support the Labour Party's campaign to ensure the capital allocation for the 1916 Rising commemorations, which involve important work at cultural institutions such as the National Gallery of Ireland, was maintained in future years as a national endowment for the arts. I do not know whether she is aware that salaries, for instance, in the arts are low, particularly among women. I am not sure whether she is aware that turf cutters receive more of a mention in the programme for Government than the arts sector. Given that the arts are so important to us as a nation, will she support the Labour Party's campaign to have the funding maintained as a national endowment to promote the expansion of the arts?</p>

            <p eId="para_573">I have already stated I want to retain as much as possible of the additional funding for commemorations in the 2016 budget for the cultural sector. It is something on which I am keen because there was significant investment in the arts during the recent 2016 commemorative programme. The arts were very much at the centre of the commemorative programme which has done a tremendous job in getting people more involved in the arts, not only in the cities but across the country. When one looks at the local authorities programmes, in every county there was involvement by the arts in the commemorative programme. In fact, I had the pleasure of attending one launch at which young schoolchildren acted out Ms Grace Gifford's marriage.</p>

            <p eId="para_574">Has the Minister had discussions with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Finance to maintain the funding, both capital and current, allocated for the 1916 Rising commemorations? The Minister has cited examples of good events which we all have attended, but we need a serious national endowment for the arts. They suffered disproportionately, partly because a lot of the funding was diverted by the Minister's predecessor to deal with the issues around turf-cutting. That is fine, but the funding diverted and the national endowment for the arts needs to be restored.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">Recently, the Taoiseach attended a major event at the Kennedy Center in Washington where he praised the arts, given that it is our calling card when we go to the United States. However, as Lenny Abrahamson said, the arts are not just a photo opportunity for politicians, they are much more important for us as a people and in how we present ourselves to the world.</p>

It will provide a framework for considering a range of important issues, including improving access to culture, breaking down barriers in areas of social exclusion and disadvantage, and how culture is enriched by greater cultural diversity. Another priority is the continued implementation of the arts in education charter and encouraging local authorities to strengthen the role of arts and heritage officers by building stronger links with local development groups. This will also feed into my expanded brief covering regional development and rural affairs. I will also prioritise opening the new capital grants scheme for applications to provide for upgrades of existing regional arts and cultural centres around the country. There is €3 million for the scheme in this year's budget and a total of €9 million over three years. Other priorities include boosting supports to regional museums and facilitating increased loans between the national cultural institutions and the network of regional museums, working with the Irish Film Board, Screen Ireland, to ensure Ireland is maximised as a location for international film production, and further encouraging strong, mutually beneficial links between the business community and arts organisations.</p>

While I congratulate her, I am disappointed at what most of the arts community and I see as the demotion of the arts within the Department. While I appreciate the priorities the Minister outlined, the former Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht has been increased to include regional development and rural affairs and encompasses responsibility for the roll-out of broadband and the development of the An Post network. We fully understand the need for a dedicated Department for regional development and rural affairs. My colleague, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, was Minister for just that from 2002 to 2010. However, during that time a separate Department for the arts had a lead portfolio. I am very fearful, like most of the nation, that the arts may be left behind and forgotten about in the Minister's miscellaneous responsibilities. What reassurances can she give on this?</p>

I am looking forward to taking up the new role. To assist me, I have the Ministers of State, Deputies Seán Kyne and Michael Ring. With a bigger Department comes more staff and resources which I can use for the benefit of the arts, given that they are part of a much bigger Department. I am very committed to working to improve them across the country. Culture is so important and so much part of what we are as a people and we must invest in it.

We believe the Government's downgrading of the Department of Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht is wrong and the arts community is frustrated about it. The arts constitute a very important industry which creates many jobs and has a major impact nationally, as we can see from the year we have just had. Will the Minister assure us of her commitment and say the arts are a priority? Until the portfolio is restored to the lead role it had for almost a quarter of a century, there are real doubts about the Government's commitment. Will the Minister suggest to the Taoiseach that he reconsider and include the arts in the Department's title?</p>

The Deputy will be familiar with the new, state-of-the-art Garage Theatre in Monaghan which is a very important amenity for the local community. We also have the Ramor Theatre in Cavan and the wonderful Tyrone Guthrie Centre in Annaghmakerrig.

            <p eId="para_595">My Department has had extensive engagement, including significant pre-planning engagement, with Galway County Council on the projects referred to by the Deputy. My Department has continued its considerable engagement following An Bord Pleanála’s consent for the Oughterard to Maam Cross section of the road project. Some eight method statements have been received to date on the project, with initial statements approved within two weeks or less. Recent statements received have been particularly complex and key information was omitted or the statements had not been approved by the council, as required. Senior officials of my Department arranged a meeting earlier this month with Galway County Council to address these issues and this positive engagement will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">There is no doubt that the overall N59 development is a complex project. It is incumbent on my Department to balance its regional development objectives and its environmental obligations in seeking to contribute to a positive outcome for the people of Galway West, Connemara and the region in general while seeking also to avoid the project falling foul of legal challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_597"> I remain available to meet, as necessary, with public representatives on this matter. I have had meetings with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, on the matter and he has briefed me on it and impressed upon me the importance of this road to the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_598">This road is included in Transport 21. I insisted on the coastal secondary roads being included in it. Since planning was given for the project virtually no progress has been made on the stretch from Oughterard to Maam Cross. We will not have a rural Ireland with its unique cultural heritage if we do not provide basic infrastructure. In view of the offer of the Minister of State, Deputy Kyne, to meet us on Friday in the Department's office in Na Forbacha to discuss the air service, could a parallel meeting be arranged that morning with the Minister's officials, the county council and the Teachtaí Dála and the Seanadóirí for the area to once and for all discuss how we can collectively progress this project, which is of vital interest? I do not believe that the environmental challenges are half a big as the Minister has said. What we will possibly gain in terms of the environment we are losing in cultural and other heritage in the Gaeltacht and in west Connemara.</p>

            <p eId="para_599">I understand the importance of this road for the area. It is good for the region, for tourism and for the people who live in the area. The Deputy will understand that I have obligations, under EU law, around nature conservation. I have to try to balance these in order to contribute to a positive outcome for the region. My officials have been working with the local authority to progress the matter and will continue to do so. They are available to meet interested parties. The Deputy requested that and I give a commitment that my officials with meet him. I trust Friday will suit and, if it does, that can certainly happen. There is no reason they will not meet the Deputy. Is it this Friday that my ministerial colleague has that meeting?</p>

            <p eId="para_602">I welcome the Minister's commitment to consider Friday for such a meeting. It would be very convenient for everybody to once and for all get around the table and resolve this issue. Environmental heritage is important and nobody doubts it, but the road from Maam Cross to Recess was widened many years ago and a railway line was built through Connemara. Despite that we still have this fantastic ecology that the Minister is preserving. It seems disproportionate that after four years of negotiations between the Minister and the county council, we cannot resolve what we need to do. The project is not the building of a new road but the widening of the existing dirt track into a road. Many people in Connemara are tempted to put up big signs with the words "horses and carts from here on in" along the route. It is ridiculous and I ask the Minister to organise a meeting for Friday. This is now a matter of crucial importance. The Minister of State will be able to brief the Minister on how offended are all of the preservers of the environment of Connemara who live there at the top-down attitude being taken by officialdom here and in Brussels towards their heritage.</p>

            <p eId="para_603">I understand the Deputy's concerns but he will understand there is balance to be struck here. It is about trying to work towards a solution and striking the right balance. The European Commission has written to me on this project indicating a particular concern with respect to the pearl mussel and we cannot ignore that. This is all part of the habitats directive. My officials are prepared to meet the Deputy. I give a commitment that they will meet him on Friday and they will work with the local authority to find a resolution. I understand the Deputy's frustration about this.</p>

            <p eId="para_605">In response to Deputy Casey's question regarding rural and regional development, details of the reassignment of responsibilities among Departments, including my own, were outlined by the Taoiseach in his statement to Dáil Éireann of 6 May last. Officials of my Department have been engaging with their counterparts in other relevant Departments to establish the precise details of the functions to come under the remit of my Department and to identify the associated personnel and other resources to be transferred. This process is well advanced and I anticipate that the formal reassignment of the rural development functions from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government will take place in the coming week. This will include responsibility for the Leader programme; natural rural development schemes; rural recreation, including the walks scheme; implementation of the report of the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, and the Charter for Rural Ireland; the town and village renewal scheme; the Western Development Commission, dormant accounts; social enterprise; and the Tidy Towns competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_606"> Discussions are yet to be completed regarding the transfer of functions and resources in regard to the rural post office network and rural broadband. I can confirm, however, that I am already working closely with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to advance delivery of key elements of the national broadband plan and to accelerate and prioritise the roll-out of the programme in rural areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_610">The timescale for all of this process is important for people living throughout the State. It is more than three months since the election. I understand it will take a number of weeks to centralise all these responsibilities in her Department, which means we will be up against the summer recess period. Over that period, we, as Opposition Deputies, cannot table questions to the Minister, therefore, it will be difficult for us to carry out our responsibilities in holding the Minister responsible for a period that may be up to six months duration following the general election. </p>
            <p eId="para_611"> We live in a two-tier economy where much of the State is suffering from below par economic activity, low incomes and poverty etc. To rebalance that in terms of development, we will not be able to help reorientate policy possibly for months to come. I would like a clear response from the Minister on when exactly the Department will be fully understanding of its direct remit.</p>

            <p eId="para_612">I will answer Deputy Tóibín's question first. Most of the functions will be transferred next week. The transfer of all the rural affairs functions from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will be done next week. The broadband provision and rural post offices functions will be done very shortly, and probably the following week, but the transfer of the rural affairs functions will definitely be done next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_613"> To answer Deputy Ó Cuív's question, I will not have responsibility for rural transport or school transport. We will have responsibility for the CLÁR programme. However, we will have an action plan for rural Ireland and a special Cabinet sub-committee will be set up. I will co-ordinate the responses of all the Departments with respect to rural Ireland, and there will be a new cross-Government plan to drive investment and regenerate rural Ireland in terms of the action plan for rural Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">This will ensure there is ministerial oversight and rural-proofing of Government decisions. I want to see Departments discriminate positively towards rural Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_615">Will the Minister explain to me the rationale behind not transferring one programme that had the word "rural" in its title to her Department, that is, rural transport? That is what it says on the can. Will she tell me whether she will press for the reinstitution of the decentralisation programme which was so important to bringing jobs to the regions? If she is not getting the big spending parts of the rural development plan, other than Leader, what is the Minister getting out of the rural development plan?</p>

            <p eId="para_616">Rural transport remains in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport but I will be co-ordinating all of the Departments in terms of the focus on rural Ireland. Rural transport is a tremendous benefit to rural Ireland. We all have our local transport companies and one sees how successfully it regenerates small towns when people are brought in on pension day. It is great for towns and we must continue to build on that. In my county, work with the health service is being built on. I want to impress on the House how important rural transport is. We have the Leader programme but I do not have the part of the rural development fund that relates to farming, which belongs to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We also have the rural economic development zones and that is something that has been developed.</p>

            <p eId="para_621">The work being undertaken by the State to honour the 1916 leaders was designed to fully conserve Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street and to provide a 1916 commemorative centre on the site. The intended works would have involved major underpinning and stabilisation of the buildings as well as re-roofing and a programme of comprehensive repairs that would have retained all pre-1916 fittings, fixtures and structures. The intention was to have the project completed and the commemorative centre open to the public during the current centenary year. The historical significance of No. 16 as the final headquarters of the 1916 Rising was the determining factor in the decision to place a preservation order on Nos. 14, 15, 16 and 17 under the National Monuments Acts in 2007. Collectively, Nos. 14 to 17 represent the most original, complete and continuous section of substantially intact pre-1916 buildings on Moore Street. This was also a significant factor in the Government’s decision to acquire the buildings in 2015 and to initiate the restoration project in the absence of any other prospect of the increasingly essential and urgent conservation works being carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_622"> Following the High Court ruling, progress with the commemoration centre and conservation project in Moore Street has ceased and arrangements are now being made to have limited works, as approved by the court, carried out as soon as possible to preserve and protect the buildings for the time being. The objective of these works will be to safeguard the buildings, in so far as this is possible, until a permanent solution is identified. In that context, I continue to examine the court’s findings in so far as they relate to the Moore Street project itself and to the general operation of the National Monuments Acts. I am also examining, in consultation with other Departments, whether there are broader planning and development implications, especially in terms of potential impacts on infrastructure projects such as housing provision, roads, broadband and other developments.</p>

            <p eId="para_623">As the Minister knows and as Deputy Tóibín said succinctly, the Government and the public are very far apart on this. We discussed this issue and my belief is that irrespective of the legal issue, which is a complex one we must park for today, there is a need for people to sit around a table, express the different views and try to build a consensus. Will the Minister consider some process of engaging with all the different views, including the different views among the political parties, many of which do not share the Government's view on this, to see if we can move this forward in a way that satisfies the vast majority of people? In my view, the Government has lost public opinion on this one.</p>

            <p eId="para_624">The Minister will recall that as Tánaiste, I fought very hard to get the funding to have the particular houses taken over, which was a very significant step. Now that there is a new Government and the Minister has returned to the Department and given what she said about the significance of heritage, is there not an opportunity at this point to open the dialogue out? As probably the only Deputy from the north inner city in the House at the moment, I note that from the point of the view of the Rising, much of what is between the canals is historic and significant in terms of the history of Dublin and locally. I suggest to the Minister that there is an opportunity here to have an opening out to a concept of Dublin as a historic battlefield site in the context of the core areas affected by the Rising.</p>

            <p eId="para_625">I want to see a solution here. As Deputy Burton said, I have already committed to buying, and got agreement from Government to buy, Nos. 14 to 17 Moore Street. I have committed taxpayers' money to this important and historic project. As a Government, we were taking four buildings which were the national monument. They are the ones that were designated as a national monument. We spent €4 million purchasing them and we are looking at between €7 million and €8 million to carry out the works to restore the four buildings. To be clear, that is what we have been trying to do. I was operating on the basis of the national monument at the time.</p>

            <p eId="para_626">The facts are clear enough. The Department believes it should preserve a small number of buildings and the public believes the block bounded by the two lanes should be preserved and developed in a sympathetic way. My question is whether the Minister is willing to consider some process or forum or other way forward which is very inclusive to try to get common ground on how we resolve this issue. In the absence of that, our next option in opposition is to proceed with the Bill we put forward by bringing it to the committee and, through it, to the pre-legislative process and then into the Oireachtas. It appears that without a forum that is the only way forward. As an alternative to that, is the Minister willing to consider an open dialogue with the interested parties, including representatives of the main political parties, so that we can try to marshal all the facts on every side and then find a common way forward?</p>

            <p eId="para_645">Delivering the national broadband plan is a top priority for the Government, as reflected in the programme for a partnership Government. The allocation of new responsibilities at Cabinet level signals the Government's firm intention to address broadband and other telecoms challenges in rural Ireland. To this end, I will be working closely with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to deliver key elements of the national broadband plan and to accelerate and prioritise the roll-out of the programme in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> Under the new arrangements, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will continue with the procurement process for the State broadband intervention, which commenced in December 2015. The next stage in that process is to qualify potential bidders and to invite those short-listed to engage in detailed formal dialogue. Meanwhile, my Department will focus on establishing county-regional broadband task forces in which local authorities, local enterprise offices, Leader groups and other relevant agencies will immediately engage with communities and the telecoms industry in order to eliminate delay factors in advance and enable effective rural broadband delivery once a contract has been awarded under the procurement process.</p>
            <p eId="para_647"> As committed to in the programme for a partnership Government, within the first 100 days a mobile phone and broadband task force will be established, co-chaired by my Department and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. It will include other relevant Departments, ComReg, the County and City Management Association, relevant agencies and the telecoms industry. The task force will address existing barriers in the areas of infrastructure planning, road opening-reinstatement and environmental consents, industry investment and any other measure that could address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_653"> What role will the county and regional broadband task forces have if the contract is awarded to eir or Vodafone-ESB? My understanding is that as neither would require wayleaves, given that both already have them, the talk of ancillary works and facilitating planning is a nonsense.

            <p eId="para_654">A procurement process is ongoing and I am working closely with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, on this matter. It is important that the procurement process proceed. As Deputy Ó Cuív knows, it is a complicated one. Approximately five consortia will bid for three lots. This process will deliver the national broadband plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_655"> Where I come in is in the rural aspect. Once the tender has been awarded, responsibility for the rural elements falls to my Department. In the meantime, there is much that I can do with local authorities to prepare for the national broadband plan once it is ready to be rolled out. I will meet the local authorities' chief executives shortly to determine what roadblocks must be cleared away. What everyone in rural Ireland wants, including the Deputy and me, is broadband. That is the most important thing.</p>

            <p eId="para_656">I beg to differ, as the Minister avoided my simple question. I do not want broadband. I want fibre broadband. Does the Minister agree that 30 Mbps is no longer considered high-speed broadband and that the only future-proof technology is fibre? Does she agree that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources should stop messing about with 30 Mbps and opt instead for providing fibre to every home and business? These are simple questions. The Minister now has responsibility for rural development. What part of the national broadband plan does not relate to rural Ireland? My understanding is that urban areas are to be left to the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> Regarding mobile telephony, will the task force that the Minister is setting up be able to recommend to the Government that it should, if necessary, make money available to the telecoms industry, having taken much money from it via licences and required a low threshold of coverage, so that the industry ensures that every road and house in the State is covered by mobile telephony as is required and as is the case in Scandinavian countries, which have sparser populations than we do?</p>

          <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_345" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Arts,_Heritage_and_the_Gaeltacht">
            <from>Deputy Seán Kyne<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_667">The Deputy will be aware that my Department developed the two airstrips referred to with a view to commencing a scheduled air service between the island of Inishbofin and the mainland. However, due to the changed economic circumstances, a decision was taken in 2013 to dispose of both airstrips and surrounding sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_668"> I can inform the Deputy that the Office of Public Works, OPW, has undertaken a feasibility study at the Cleggan site of the possibility of developing a base there for an Irish Coast Guard station. I am advised that the OPW intends to seek planning permission for a temporary Irish Coast Guard station, with the possibility of a permanent station being developed at a future date. There are discussions between Galway County Council and the OPW on land for this purpose and land ownership. Obviously, the Irish Coast Guard is important. Only this week there was tragedy in the Connemara region with a death at sea and another incident today at Inverin consequent to which the Irish Coast Guard was called. I fully support the development of the Irish Coast Guard station.</p>
            <p eId="para_669"> Against this background, my Department has no immediate plans to complete the development of the airstrips with a view to making them operational, nor are there plans to provide funding for a regular service between Aerfort Réigiúnach Chonamara and the airstrips. However, I have asked my Department to undertake a consultation process as soon as possible on the disposal of these two airstrips.</p>
            <p eId="para_670"> Being new in the job, I asked the officials in the Roinn to engage immediately with the local communities to determine their wishes on the service. Obviously, the airstrips have been built. In his previous role Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív had a large role to play in this. I appreciate that. Local business people and the community were also involved. The long-term aim has to be to develop an air service between Cleggan and Inishbofin. As I stated, I have no immediate plans, but that is not to say I do not believe it should be done, nor does it mean that I will not take up this issue in the very near future. While waiting, I have asked my officials to start a consultation process that will take place quickly and not be prolonged. It is to obtain the views of the locals, be they in business, members of the island community or the community development body on Inishbofin or other interested individuals, to ascertain what they believe should be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_671">In response to the first question, the Minister of State said the service to the Aran Islands was important and that he fully subscribed to that view. Since Inishbofin is a lot further from Galway, why would an air service to that island not be of equal benefit to the islanders? Will the Minister of State assure me that there is absolutely no question of disposing this State infrastructure that was put in place with the people's money to provide a vital service to an island? Would the Minister of State be willing to examine the potential cost of providing a reasonable service from Aerfort Réigiúnach Chonamara, where the project could be completed at a marginal cost because there are airplanes and an airstrip available? There could be flights both to Cleggan and Inishbofin, perhaps three or four days per week initially. This could be done at a marginal cost since all of the infrastructure is in place and pilots are available. The Minister of State knows all of the arguments and Aran islanders would explain them to him. Therefore, will he answer my three very specific questions? I look forward to the answers.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">The Deputy is correct that the people living on Inishbofin have the same right as those living on every other island off the west coast. Obviously, we have responsibility for providing services to all of them, including, for example, the helipad on Tory Island which has been in place for the past few years. A decision was made in 2013 on the disposal of the airstrips. As I said, I now wish to seek the views of the communities affected by it. Obviously, any such decision would have to be agreed to by the Government. Issue arises in the disposal of State assets. There was a considerable investment in these projects and it is something that would have to be agreed to. I do not believe Government approval should be sought until such time as we hear from the communities on what they want.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> With regard to having a reasonable service from Aerfort Réigiúnach Chonamara, that issue could be examined. If it is part of the recommendations or the people's views in the consultation in which I am engaging, it can certainly be examined. If there is a low-cost service that could be provided, it could certainly be considered within the budgetary constraints. Obviously, the Deputy, with the rest of the Members, will have a role in the budgetary process on these matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_674">Do I understand from the Minister of State that he will immediately seek to establish what it would cost to provide a service such as a service three days a week to Inishbofin in order we can have a realistic debate on real costs? Will he clarify whether he is ruling out or still holding open the possibility of selling this vital infrastructure to private interests? He seems to be leaving the door open to the sale of the assets, which I obviously oppose. Does he agree that depopulation is a challenge on islands? As the population drops, it imposes a huge cost on the State, as he knows. Does he acknowledge that the best way to keep people on islands is to provide very efficient infrastructural services for them? They are provided at a minimal cost to the State compared with other transport services around the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_675">I agree on the issue of depopulation. Obviously, the better the service in any rural area, be it on an island or anywhere else, the more depopulation is prevented. As part of the programme for Government, we hope to examine issues concerning a rural resettlement scheme. I certainly believe - I have touched on this with my officials - the islands should be very much a place where it should be prioritised and implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_676"> On the sale, as I said in my reply, a decision was taken in 2013 to dispose of both airstrips and surrounding sites. I have asked the Roinn to initiate a discussion on this matter with locals and those with vested interests. Obviously, disposal was the decision made in 2013. It would have to be examined and agreed to by the Cabinet were it to go ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_677"> On the question of costs, if the possibility of a service emerges from the consultation process, it will need to be examined in the context of our budget discussions and budget preparation.</p>

            <p eId="para_684"> Chomh maith leis sin, tá mo Roinn ag maoiniú na struchtúir bhainistíochta ar na hoileáin neamh-Ghaeltachta agus tá sé i gceist agam go leanfar leis an obair thábhachtach seo. </p>
            <p eId="para_685"> Beidh sé i gceist freisin ag mo Roinn éascaíocht a dhéanamh, feadh a cumais, do sholáthar seirbhísí níos éifeachtaí agus níos comhtháite do na hoileáin, go háirithe trí údaráis áitiúla agus trí ghníomhaireachtaí eile Stáit.</p>

            <p eId="para_686">An bhféadfadh an tAire Stáit a rá liom an mbeidh na cistí bunstruchtúir ag aistriú ar ais go dtí an Roinn? Mar is eol dó, sa deich mbliana sular tháinig an Rialtas deiridh isteach caitheadh €100 milliún ar bhunstruchtúir ar na hoileáin – rudaí ar nós céanna, ionaid sláinte, áiseanna spóirt agus caitheamh aimsire agus mar sin de. An mbeidh ciste bunstruchtúir aige agus an mbeidh freagracht aigesean as cistiú a leithéid de chéanna ar oileáin agus ar uile? Má tá i gceist go mbeidh, an bhféadfadh sé a rá liom cé mhéad airgid a chuirfear ar fáil dó le haghaidh na hoibreacha sin?</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> An mbeidh ionchur ag an Aire Stáit i gcúrsaí cosúil le hoideachas? An mbeidh ionchur aige i gceist na scoileanna beaga oileánda agus na bunscoileanna a chailleann múinteoirí agus nach bhfaigheann an dara múinteoir arís go dtí go mbeidh 15 duine sa scoil má thiteann siad faoi bhun ochtar dalta? An mbeidh ionchur aige sna rudaí sin, maidir le fadhbanna atá ag na meánscoileanna agus maidir le cúrsaí sláinte ar na hoileáin? Céard é an t-ionchur a bheas aige sna rudaí sin?</p>

          <p eId="para_697">As I was saying before the debate adjourned, general practice is under severe pressure as a result of the cuts introduced under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Act, as well as the undermining of general practice and the failure to support it properly. If general practice is to be part of the solution to problems in the health service, and I believe it will be central to that solution, it needs to be supported. Many areas have lost their general practitioner and many general practitioners who will retire in the near future may not be replaced. Some 33% of general practitioners are aged over 55 years and 20% are aged over 60 years. New graduates are not taking up general practice because the current GP contract is not fit for purpose. A new contract must be urgently negotiated as part of any new framework for future health care and the cuts made under the FEMPI legislation must be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_698"> Patients spend 99% of their lives living in their communities where they are cared for by their general practitioner, public health nurse, community intervention teams and community therapists such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists, and supported by community pharmacy colleagues who supply essential services. If these services were to be fully developed, many patients could be looked after in the community and unnecessary hospital admissions avoided, thus taking pressure off overstretched accident and emergency departments. This could be achieved by managing chronic illnesses and old age in the community. </p>
          <p eId="para_699"> Ireland's demographic trends are frightening, with 20,000 people reaching the age of 65 years each year. Furthermore, patients aged over 85 years account for 14% of bed occupancy in hospitals but only 1.4% of the population. It is clear, therefore, that demographics are causing severe problems in hospital capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> It is essential that bed capacity in hospitals is increased. Hospital bed numbers are currently approximately 500 lower than what is required. Hospitals work most efficiently when operating at 85% capacity and yet many of our hospitals are operating at 100% capacity, which causes inefficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> We must also develop home care services and packages. Despite being highly cost effective, these services are the first item cut when the Health Service Executive seeks savings. This approach creates a false economy. Cutting home care hours and packages has a negative impact because people end up as patients on trolleys or occupying expensive hospital beds.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> Services must be integrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">We need ambulatory care and medical assessment units. We should be investigating patients to ensure they will not be admitted to hospitals, rather than admitting patients to hospital to be investigated. Many acute illnesses cannot be avoided and these are the ones that should be dealt with effectively and efficiently in our cluttered accident and emergency units.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> In order to build a proper health service we need to reverse the measures introduced by the FEMPI legislation and to support general practices in rural, urban and deprived areas. A new flexible contract for general practice is essential. If we are to introduce free GP care for everybody, we will need to double the number of GPs we have in our service. If the service is to be efficient, we need to see an integration of primary and secondary care. Increased access to diagnostics is essential. Many of our diagnostic services operate between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m from Monday to Friday and close over the weekend. This is inefficient. Patients are staying in hospital over weekends waiting for scans which should be provided during that weekend period, thus allowing them to be discharged.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> We need to properly fund chronic disease management - diabetes, heart failure and chronic respiratory illness - and increased community supports must be put in place to help elderly patients with multiple morbidity issues. Primary care needs to be the engine that drives major health care reform and I hope that will be part of the new committee's remit. The bed capacity issue is exacerbating the accident and emergency unit crisis, but the emphasis in the proposed health reform must be to keep people out of hospital, thus freeing up accident and emergency units for essential cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> I commend the motion to the House. Reform should be solution driven and should produce recommendations that centre on patients, are transparent and provide accountability. Input from those who provide front line services is essential.</p>

        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_707">I wish to acknowledge the ready support for this motion from Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, Independents4Change, People Before Profit, the Green Party and a number of Independent Members. In total, 89 Members from the Opposition benches supported the motion and I thank them for doing so. I also welcome the fact that once the new Government was in place, the new Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, was happy to come on board, with some minor amendments to the motion. He pledged the support of the Government, Fine Gael and the Independents who support the Government. Quite unusually therefore, we now have a motion before the House that is supported by almost 150 Members. This unprecedented circumstance is an indication of the willingness of everybody to work together in a collaborative manner to try to find solutions to the many problems that dog our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> I will not take up time speaking about the many problems in the health service, because we are all too familiar with them. Our wide-ranging health services cover a significant number of different areas, in most of which we find difficulties. There are many reasons for this. Historically, there have been funding issues, but the main problem is that we do not have any overall coherent plan for the health service, in contrast to what happened in the United Kingdom after the war when the Labour and Tory parties agreed on the National Health Service. While there have been ups and downs with that service over the years, by and large people in the United Kingdom are proud of the NHS and would not contemplate its abolition. This applies in the political arena also and although the Conservatives may have cut funding at times, there has always been agreement on the model of health service and nobody has suggested the NHS should be abolished. The problem here is that we have no agreement on the model for our health service. Down through the years, our health service has evolved in an <i>ad hoc </i> way, to the point where it is now quite dysfunctional. There is no political consensus on the kind of model we need for the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_709"> This has resulted in a situation where every time there is a change in government or a change of Minister, each new Minister introduces a new plan. However, that plan does not have political consensus and when the Minister begins to implement it, that causes an enormous churning within the health service. Over the past 20 years therefore, the health service has been in a constant state of flux. This is bad for the health service and for the patients who depend on it. However, it is also very bad for those charged with delivering the service, because there is huge uncertainty about what the future holds. By an large, people are not quite clear where they fit into our quite dysfunctional health service. This is a major factor in regard to the ability of the State to retain staff in the service and to attract staff who have emigrated to return. The service does not make Ireland an attractive place to live in and it is not a good model for the delivery of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> We have an extraordinary situation where some 38% of the public are dependent on the public health service and they encounter long waiting lists for practically every service. On the other hand, some 46% of the public pay thousands of euro every year in health insurance. This health insurance amounts to significant additional taxation. This kind of two-tier health system is unheard of in any other European country and would not be tolerated elsewhere. It is unknown in any other European country that sick people would not get speedy access to proper health services. Health services function in other countries and people have a right to expect their governments to take responsibility for basic health services and for ensuring there is a good quality health service in place that is available to everybody, irrespective of whether people can pay for it. This is the standard in the rest of Europe and there is no reason we cannot have a similar high quality public health service here. Any talking down of the Department of Health or description of it as a ministry nobody wants or as an Angola is a political cop out. Irish people are entitled to a quality public health service that is available when they need it and there is no reason we cannot provide that kind of service.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> It is important there is cross-party agreement on this kind of approach. If people sat down together to design a health service, they certainly would not design the kind of dysfunctional service we have here currently. That is the reason we now need to come together politically to identify the most important things we need to deliver in terms of our health service and decide how to go about achieving that. The most important section in our motion is the recognition of the need to establish a universal, single-tier health service which treats patients on the basis of health need rather than on the ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> In setting out to achieve this ambitious objective - one realised in most other European countries - I hope the new committee will work on the basis of considering the high level issues that come into play in this regard. Over the coming weeks, the normal Oireachtas committee on health will deal with day-to-day issues arising in the health area. However, we need to have a high level debate and to reach agreement on what our health service should deliver and how we can achieve the kind of health service that will provide a universal, single-tier health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">We must also consider how we can transition from the current system to the new single-tier system over a period. How can we do that in a planned way so that, irrespective of whether there is a change in Government or of Minister, it will not all be thrown up in the air again? We must work towards an agreed consensus.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> The other aspect of the motion deals with the need to reorientate the health service. Our health service is very hospital-centric and provides care predominantly at the most expensive level, that of acute hospitals. This puts an emphasis on preventative medicine and early intervention to ensure that, as far as possible, people can access the health service locally in their own community through their primary care services. There is no doubt that an approach where there is a front-loading of primary and community care delivers the best health outcomes and the best value for money. </p>
          <p eId="para_715"> In short, the second high-level objective is to introduce a single-tier health service, to agree on the most appropriate funding model and on how we reorientate the health service towards primary and community care and to model that and phase it in over a reasonable period. Everybody agrees there should be more emphasis on primary care as it will save money and there will be better health outcomes but we need to work out how we are going to go from the present system to the new system in a phased, ordered way. We need to work out how we can do it in a way that ensures services are not diminished in any way and that we move smoothly so that resources are switched from hospitals to primary care. </p>
          <p eId="para_716"> It is a tall order to come up with recommendations within a six-month period but it focuses people's minds. I would hope that all members of the new committee would approach this task on the basis of looking at the evidence, rather than listening to the many vested interests that have dogged our health services down through the years. We need to look at objective evidence to see what works, what our experience has told us and what is best practice in other countries, from which we can learn. We should do it in an open manner and in a way can keep the vested interests at the door. We should use the resources available to us in the shape of the ESRI, the department of public health in Trinity College Dublin and a number of other experts in the field and there is plenty of expertise around.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> Finally, it is important the committee be resourced properly so that we have access to the best possible research and evidence to underpin the recommendations and so that we can move forward to achieve the single-tier health service that Irish people deserve.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kate O'Connell<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_718">This motion is perhaps one of the most important to come before this House in recent times. How we fund, govern and manage our health services over an extended period of time may be the most useful initiative that has been taken by any government in the past 30 years, and presents us with a unique opportunity to challenge forever the way we address our health needs as a society.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> We have ten years to save a generation. Devising cross-party agreement on the direction of health policy in Ireland will hopefully give us long-term clarity on funding, staffing, contracts and the hospital network organisation. I hope it will also remove opportunities for political opportunism that prevent us from making good decisions about where to allocate resources. It is vital that there is recognition of the impact of socioeconomic deprivation on health. Now that we are finally entering a period of relative economic stability and growth, I believe that there is scope to address the inequality of access that exists for service users and that this committee will move to establish a universal, single-tier service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than on ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> We are moving towards being the most obese country in the world if we do not change course. We have an emergence of food poverty where there is an inability to afford or gain access to a healthy diet. Low income households, due to a combination of lack of money, education and access, often have diets made up of cheap, poor quality, calorie dense foods with little nutritional value. This is the root cause of the spiralling obesity epidemic. Obesity is a risk factor in four of the five biggest killers in this country and it affects all sectors of society, but disproportionately the poorest people. We have the lowest breastfeeding rates in Europe. We are witnessing a battery-fed population. A generation is coming on stream that will, for the first time, live shorter lives than their predecessors if we do not intervene. Cancer mortality is three times higher in disadvantaged areas and it is the second most common cause of death. Patients in disadvantaged areas often struggle to manage these conditions whilst facing other social and financial pressures. People who are the most likely to die have the least access to the health service. This is fundamentally wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> This happens when services are distributed according to number and not need. If you have the same number of services, for example, per 1000 people, regardless of where they live, those in the most disadvantaged areas get effectively half the service as they are twice as likely to get sick. In the case of primary care, there is not even the same number of doctors per head of population in disadvantaged areas. The average number of patients per GP in this country is 1:1,600. In the north west of Dublin, which has three times the cancer death rates of the most affluent area, the ratio is 1:3,600. Public patients from that region wait 11 months for vital tests diagnosing cancer, whereas in south east Dublin it is two months. I represent the south east of Dublin, and I consider two months an outrage, so what must the people and the Deputies of north west Dublin think? </p>
          <p eId="para_722"> As a student I worked as a hospital cleaner and ward aid in Tullamore Hospital in order to pay my way through college. Upon qualifying as a pharmacist I worked as part of a multi-disciplinary team in the NHS alongside hospital consultants, nurses, physiotherapists and others to enable a clear pathway to recovery for each patient on a case by case basis. Believe me, the NHS is by no means perfect, but we must look to it and learn from its successes and mistakes. We have an opportunity here to replicate all that is good in other countries' health services while tailoring it to the needs of our nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> Everyone in the health system, from consultants to the cleaner, are working for the best outcomes and to deliver the service that patients require. We have gone to great lengths as a country to set up hospital networks, yet these networks are not functioning coherently, either for emergency or elective care. In a network where the primary care sector channels patients towards the major hospital in a region, that network as a whole should be responsible for the hospital-based care of its catchment population. Unless they have a clear idea of whom they have responsibility for, specialists in the major hospitals cannot plan and then deliver their service. Patients should not therefore have to cross network boundaries in order to access the care they need, other than in cases where the service they need is not available in their own network. We cannot remain in a situation where we do not know what we have, where it is, and who is in charge. </p>
          <p eId="para_724"> We have ended up with a situation where the quality of outcomes has been compromised because patients from all over the country are arriving at hospitals that have neither the clinical nor the financial resources to deal in a timely fashion with the volume of patients coming through their doors. In a recent conversation with a consultant surgeon, he described the dangerous deficit of theatre capacity to me in the major specialist centres, including in the Dublin children's hospitals. He told me how common it is that young, healthy patients suffer needless long-term disability as a result of delays in access to theatre. He described the service as irresponsibly inadequate. Apart from the lifelong harm that individual patients suffer as a result of all these challenges, there is the economic cost that runs in tandem with the human cost. As patients wait, occupying beds, waiting for delayed treatment, their conditions are deteriorating to a point where they then require extra operations to deal with the consequences of totally avoidable infection.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">We need to accept that illness does not take the weekend or evening off. If we are to provide the best outcomes for people, we need to recruit skilled staff. A good outcome for a patient depends on the entire team being involved in his or her care in a routine, organised and regular manner. This simply does not happen in Ireland. There has been a noticeable loss of expertise in the system. This has been accompanied by poor resourcing of hospitals, worsening terms of employment for staff and improper administrative planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_726"> The cornerstone of any progressive health service should be the delivery of local and accessible health and social services in the community to a defined population. We cannot continue to depend on the goodwill of health care professionals in the primary care setting to advance this objective. Investment in primary care as a unique entity is required. Those of us who work in the community setting currently see it as an add-on to our roles. All evidence suggests every €10 spent in the primary care area saves the State €100 in the long run. The introduction of a functioning and universally employed information technology platform would greatly enhance efficiency and communication, decrease the current paperwork load and speed up the process from the point of access to the point of delivery and on to aftercare in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> Primary care remains under-utilised and under-valued. Morale is on the floor. When this new committee is formed, it will need to address the concern and confusion regarding the future of primary care. Now is the time to create a vision for that future, while the wider health care community still has the willingness and the energy for health care reform. In the past 15 years I do not think I have gone a day without speaking to multiple people involved in the provision of health care. Everyone engaged in active health care provision wants the system to be fixed. The passion among these professionals to deliver a world-class health service is driven by a fundamental desire to improve people’s lives. In the light of the recent tragic events in Cavan and Holles Street hospitals, it is imperative that the national maternity strategy be implemented as a matter of urgency. The patient is the central focus in the delivery of maternity services under the strategy, which is long overdue. If the patient is not the central focus of care, who is?</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> I could stand here all day listing the inadequacies of the health service. I could try to assign blame to those whom I believe contributed to getting us to this crisis. Such political opportunism would neither be constructive nor of any benefit to the thousands of citizens who require adequate care right now, as we sit here fit and healthy. I hope today we have a platform to a new dawn. We have a chance to be part of something constructive, rather than destructive. Collectively, we must face the challenges and save a generation. It is with great hope that I support the motion that the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and Deputy Róisín Shortall have commended to the House. I urge Deputies of all parties and none to unite in supporting it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesBrowne" eId="spk_359">
          <from>Deputy James Browne<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_729">I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. I welcome the proposal to establish an all-party committee to devise a cross-party agreement on a long-term vision for health care and health policy. Fianna Fáil will support the motion which seeks to build a cross-party consensus on health. We believe in a publicly funded and delivered health care service that emphasises patient care above structures. We are also committed to making primary care the bedrock of the health system. For too long, the country's health care system has been based on fire-fighting. We welcome the intention to agree a strategic plan to address these issues. The current health system is neither fish nor fowl. It is neither public nor private. We often hear about the two-tier health system, but we know that there are many more tiers. There are separate tiers for medical card holders, GP-only card holders and the working poor who are not entitled to any kind of medical card or support, even though they cannot afford private health care. It is important that this new committee is not used as an excuse for inaction by the Department of Health. There are many obvious, acute and immediate failings in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> Discrimination in service provision based on one's address is particularly insidious. I will talk about the area I know. Wexford psychiatric services are tied in with the services in Waterford. A person in Wexford who has an acute psychiatric event is not allowed to go to the emergency department in Waterford, even though he or she is living in the Waterford-Wexford area. He or she has to go to the emergency department in Wexford. If this happens out-of-hours, the person in question will be seen by a triage nurse who will contact the service in Waterford by telephone. If a psychiatrist in Waterford can be contacted, an assessment will be made over the telephone. If the person is refused at this point, he or she will be sent home after spending three, four or five hours in the Wexford emergency department. If he or she is accepted, he or she will have to travel to the emergency department in Waterford and spend another three, four or five hours waiting to be seen by a psychiatrist. That psychiatrist will have to make a decision on the basis of whether the person's case deserves to be prioritised over those of others who need to be admitted, rather than on the basis of whether he or she needs to be admitted. If he or she is not admitted, he or she will be sent back home into the care of his or her family if he or she is lucky enough to have family to take care of him or her. Otherwise, he or she will just be cut loose.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> The admission of children to adult psychiatric units needs to be dealt with immediately. The Mental Health Commission's reports on approved centres were released a few days ago. The commission reported that nine children had been admitted to an adult centre at St. Luke's Hospital in Kilkenny and were, therefore, placed at high risk. According to the report, "the approved centre was deemed non-compliant as there was no evidence of required Children First training or any other relevant training for all staff". This centre "was not suitable for the admission of children", but they were admitted nonetheless. As far as I know, this was not the first time the centre in question was deemed to be insufficient. We are continuing to admit children to high-risk facilities. I accept that the parents of these children signed consent forms, but I suggest they did so out of desperation and under duress.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> I would like to speak about some other issues that have been highlighted in the reports on mental health approved centres. Some hospitals have no toilet rolls. Others have no shower facilities, or have facilities that are covered in mould. All of these issues could be addressed quickly and readily without the need for a committee to report. The lack of services for children with disabilities is another such issue. There is a shocking lack of the availability of services for children who need speech and language therapy. A significant part of mental health suffering is related to connectedness - people need to feel a connection to those who love them. If they feel isolated, it can develop into mental health problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> Many young children cannot access the speech and language therapy they need to enable them to communicate. I am talking about children who might have other issues. If they could develop their speech and language facilities, at least they could communicate with their parents and families. The same parents have to fight for everything. People have to wait up to two years for needs assessments. They might have to wait another two years after that to access inadequate services. Bizarrely, they are the lucky ones. There are many conditions the HSE simply refuses to recognise. It seems to have a policy on health conditions that are treated with medicinal creams. Children with rare conditions such as ichthyosis need significant care and support from their parents. Many children and adults need to have medicinal creams applied to them three or four times a day. In some cases, they have to sleep in bandages. People in such circumstances have to go back to their GPs and the HSE every three months to beg for medical cards. It seems that they are deemed eligible for short-term medical cards only. DNA testing can be used to identify the conditions to which I refer. It is easy to prove that someone has one of these conditions which cannot be cured. Across the water in England, people with these conditions receive all the services they require as if they had any other medical condition. We are refusing to recognise them in the same way. Ultimately, any health system must be rights-based and have regard to availability and need while taking account of ability to pay.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> I would like to speak about the role of the proposed committee in the area of mental health. Fianna Fáil believes any attempt to devise cross-party agreement on a single long-term vision for health care and the direction of health policy in Ireland must prioritise mental health and well-being. Our vision is built on five key principles. First, public policy ought to ensure people with mental health problems are included in society and enabled and assisted to play their part in it. Second, the recovery model of mental health care is the most appropriate in terms of the well-being of individuals and enhancing their ability to defend themselves as citizens of the country. Third, mental health should be taken as seriously as physical health in the deployment of resources and other areas such as health and safety and planning. Fourth, there should be an emphasis on early intervention and early action. Most mental health conditions are readily treatable if there is early intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Even when they reach crisis point, as I have outlined earlier, the supports are not there.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> Fifth, mental health policy must be mainstreamed across society in order to promote mental health well-being and to lessen the risks to mental health. There has already been a ten-year plan for mental health that had cross-party support but it has not been fully implemented. As we all know, that plan was A Vision for Change. Its time is nearly up but it needs to be fully implemented while a review is carried out as to what to do for the next ten years. It needs to be integrated into the overall health policy. Ultimately, we need to reach a point where mental health is not distinguished from health and is treated with the same respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_737"> Over the last number of years, community care teams have not delivered on the partnership approach and have instead moved the services that were provided in the hospital out into the community in a "ward in the community" approach, with treatments still being primarily limited to classic psychiatric-led treatments. Mental health policy is in need of a reboot in 2016. Fianna Fáil believes that Government should carry out a full review of what is still left to be achieved and commit to the reinstatement of a plan to achieve that in the period 2016-26, taking into account any deficiencies identified in A Vision for Change<i>
						</i>by a review group. The Government needs to ensure that the critical feature of that review will be the holding of a mental health summit of all key stakeholders and must direct the review group to consider placing particular attention on the need to stress non-medical approaches to dealing with mental health issues, including talk therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> The Government must ensure that the recovery model's ethos is placed at the centre of mental health policy as expressed in the policy document that will follow and build on from A Vision for Change. It must re-establish the implementation review group to issue regular reports on the progress in delivering the 2016 to 2026 plan. A Vision for Change envisioned a partnership model between health professionals and service users that would have an equality of respect at the heart of its approach. This has not been followed through, with a regression from initial progress in that respect. Service users need to be put at the centre of any future programme. Access for 24-7 crisis supports for all ages needs to be delivered irrespective of geography.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> My central point is that mental health must be a fundamental part of this new committee that is put together and not simply shunted to the side.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_360">
          <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_740">I welcome this motion to establish a special all-party committee to develop a single, long-term vision plan for health care. This is a positive step, albeit one that should have been taken a long time ago. For too long, our health system has been in crisis. This crisis can be boiled down to two key failings on the part of successive Governments: first, a fundamental inequality in how patients are treated and differentiated on their ability to pay and their location and second, the incapacity of the system to deal with even demographic pressures, as evidenced particularly in emergency departments and maternity care.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> Universal health care, and not universal health insurance, is the solution. I welcome therefore the reference in this motion to "the need to establish a universal single tier service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than on ability to pay". Sinn Féin has long been committed to the realisation of a world-class system of universal health care accessed on the basis of need, free at the point of delivery and funded by progressive taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> As my party's health spokesperson over the past 14 years, I have consistently argued for such a system of health care delivery. I am encouraged by the growing number of voices adopting this position and by the albeit slow but hopefully real movement by Government away from the health insurance model, whether multi-payer or single payer. Welcome on board. Fáilte ar bord.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> I hope that the new plan will have a particular focus on disability services and their prioritisation. It was very worrying to hear yesterday that there are proposals, once again, to raise the age of those entitled to disability allowance from 16 to 18 years. This, we will all recall, is the same proposal on which the former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, was forced to make a U-turn in 2013. Once more, we see the most vulnerable in our society being used as easy targets. This must not be allowed to happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_744"> Changes should be made immediately to ensure that a full medical card is granted to every child qualifying for the domiciliary care allowance. My party colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, will be seeking the support of Members for the adoption of this proposal. Despite the findings of the Keane report, the horror stories continue of seriously ill children being refused medical cards and the lengths to which distressed parents are being forced to go to secure a medical card. The Government must urgently introduce and implement a schedule for the extension of full medical cards to people with serious illnesses and disabilities without a means test, working towards a universal entitlement year on year.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> I note and welcome the reference to the focus that needs to be taken on the changing demographics and on how best to re-orientate the health service on a phased basis towards integrated, primary and community care. A greater emphasis on community-based care has the potential to reduce the number of older people requiring nursing home care. However, this has not been quantified because, as the Department of Health report on the nursing homes support scheme makes clear, the further development of community-based care is dependent on new approaches. I hope that is exactly what we are about here today.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> Sinn Féin estimates that as many as 13% of nursing home residents, possibly as high as the 30% figure given by ALONE, would be able to stay at home if the appropriate services were put in place. We are committed to the provision of health care services and social care services as a right, with equal access for all based on need and to the greatest extent that resources allow. This right is especially relevant for older people and the provision of supports for older people is becoming increasingly important as our population ages.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> We should see improved health and longevity as an opportunity as well as a challenge, with older people contributing more and more to our society. In the words of the democratic programme of the First Dáil Éireann, we are committed to the care and support of Ireland's older people "who shall not be regarded as a burden, but rather entitled to the Nation's gratitude and consideration".</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> I wish to thank and congratulate all Members of these Houses, both the Dáil and Seanad, who have openly demonstrated their support for the Green Ribbon campaign throughout the month of May. The wearing of the ribbon is no longer required since it is 1 June, but our collective efforts to address and support the mental health needs of our population is a daily and yearly need. I hope that the establishment of this committee will not simply provide a talking shop but rather a gathering of people with ideas, vision, and most importantly, solutions, to bring about the changes that are so desperately required in our health system today.</p>

        <speech by="#PeadarToibin" eId="spk_361">
          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_749">I join in commending Deputy Shortall on her proposal. It amused me today to see Deputy Seán Sherlock play political footsie with Deputy Shortall on the idea, given the fact that the Labour Party allowed Deputy Shortall to walk the plank in her battle with the former Minister for Health, James Reilly.</p>
          <p eId="para_750"> Access to health care has to be key to this new committee because it has ground to a halt over the last number of years under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Let us take for example the ambulance service. Just this week, a 75 year old person in my county had to wait 35 minutes for an ambulance to arrive to be brought to a hospital because the ambulance was in Cavan when it was needed. That is not unusual because in the period of one year, 40 people contacted me in County Meath stating that it took over an hour for an ambulance to attend to their particular crises. In seven of those cases there was a fatality involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> Access to health care can also be seen in the difficulties of getting a bed through accident and emergency departments. Last year in the hospitals of Navan and Drogheda, 9,000 people spent time on a trolley. That is the equivalent population of Trim, in our county, who were on a trolley in the last year. We know that if one is on a trolley, one receives substandard treatment. One receives delayed treatment, which is not as good. Therefore, one has a sub-optimum health outcome. That means that some people remain injured or ill for longer and, in some cases, lose their lives. The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine stated that roughly 350 people a year lose their lives due to accident and emergency department overcrowding.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">That is roughly one person a day and a startling indictment of Government health policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> There are 490,000 people on public hospital waiting lists. That is equivalent to the population of the cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford being refused access to the health service and made to languish on waiting lists. In my constituency access to the doctor on-call service is becoming more difficult and sometimes it is not available during the night. We have heard there is the possibility of a Skype doctor replacing the doctor-on-call service, with a doctor, from a distance of 50 miles, remotely diagnosing and treating a patient in crisis during the night, which is quite shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> A common thread of all of these stories is that there is no capacity in the system to meet demand. One would expect the capacity we have had to be maintained, but, unfortunately, that is not the policy of the Government. I am cathaoirleach of the Save Navan Hospital campaign, probably one of the most successful campaigns in the State. We have brought some 40,000 people onto the streets of County Meath in the past six years, in which time we have battled hard to ensure the emergency department will remain open. However, it is stated Government policy, in its framework for small hospitals, that it will be made into a minor injuries unit. I would love if that was not the case. I ask the new Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, who is from County Meath to publicly state it is not the case and that we will have a functioning emergency department in Navan hospital long into the future, as well as a full ICU, coronary care and anaesthesia service to back it up. I will wait for the Minister of State to make that statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> Capacity is obviously dependent on a number of factors. It is dependent on efficiencies, better management and keener input costs, but it is also dependent on investment. This is the area which is going to be difficult for the new committee into the future. This is the ideological fault line between my party and the likes of Fine Gael which believes private funds have a part to play in this regard, but private funds need profit and profits in health care provision create inequalities. Sinn Féin wants to ensure health care is funded with public money to ensure there is equal provision in public health care services. That is why, at this stage, I am sceptical about the likelihood of success with this new committee into the future. Nonetheless, I wish it well. I hope the Government means business when it states it will adhere to the outcome of the committee's deliberations.</p>

          <p eId="para_758">The state of the public health service is a scandal and a disgrace. In so far as this new committee can contribute anything, its contribution will be to moving away from a failed policy that has been pursued for the past decade at least and pursued consistently by the last Government in pursuit of the mirage of universal health insurance, a policy it has finally abandoned. If only it had listened to the criticisms we presented to that model right from the beginning, but finally, five years on, the previous Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, had to admit we were right and that it would cost more. We had said in 2011 that it would cost more, but the Government just did not listen. I hope, despite it having gone down that cul-de-sac, the new committee offers us some vehicle to look seriously at the problem and abandon failed policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> The list of ills and crises and the catalogue of suffering and failure to provide services for those who need them are simply too long to list. I will just mention in passing some of the key areas that urgently need to be addressed. They include, for example, the disaster in emergency departments, the latest manifestation of which is the figure of 50,000 people who walk in and then walk out of emergency departments. Could there be a more severe indictment? One can add to that number the people who did not even go in because they were afraid to do so, given that they knew how bad the situation was. </p>
          <p eId="para_760"> There are chronic waiting lists of people in chronic pain or in chronic need of hip replacements and of children waiting to see ear, nose and throat specialists. There is a shameful situation in mental health services, where we do not have the 24/7 emergency services we need for persons who are suicidal. In particular, there is the absence of sufficient resources to provide for individuals who go into emergency departments and say they are suicidal, only to be told, "Sorry, we are not treating you because you have alcohol and drink problems," which is in itself disgraceful when we need dual diagnosis and the resources to deliver such a service. In contravention of European directives, children and young people are being placed in adult mental health wards. There are outrageously long waiting lists to see occupational and speech and language therapists. We hear about the deaths of mothers and babies in hospitals because of the lack of consultants and other staff. I could go through the list, but I do not have the time to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> Can we address all of these issues? The only way we can address them, as we have been saying for five years, is by taking profit out of the equation. When we talk about the need for a national health service from the cradle to the grave and funded through progressive central taxation, the other side often says it is a fantasy and asks from where we would get the money. Of course, we have had the answer to this question provided recently by the OECD, when it revealed the fact that we actually spent more on health services in this country than almost anywhere else in the world; we spend way above the average. Where is that money going? Some €13 billion comes directly from the Exchequer into the public health service which is in pieces, but another €5 billion is also being spent on health services. Where is that money going? The CSO helpfully tells us. Some €2.68 billion is going in household, out-of-pocket payments, mostly in private health insurance which is going into the pockets of the private health industry. Another €2.7 billion is spent on pharmaceuticals and drugs. Therefore, an extra €5 billion is being spent on unnecessary administration or going into the profits of for-profit health services, whether in the production of drugs or the private health care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_762"> In a way, one can see this happening. The two-tier system and the waste of money on private, for-profit health services are very obvious when, as I have said on a number of occasions in the House, patients go to St. Vincent's University Hospital or St. James's Hospital. They find a war zone and are told they will be waiting 12, 24 or 36 hours, but they then hear on the radio an advertisement for the Blackrock Clinic: "Come here; you will not have to wait, as long as you can pay". How many such private clinics are there? They are all over the place. We have the capacity, but, shamefully, only a tiny proportion of the population can access it, while we, the public, are subsidising it and lining their pockets. What we need to do is take that profit element out of the equation and redirect the money into the public health service in order that we would have a national health system available all on the basis of medical need. It is not difficult.</p>

          <p eId="para_763">I refer to a case to which I have been alerted by a constituent. It sums up the problems people are experiencing in the health service which the new committee should examine and research. Obviously, the Minister and the HSE also need to provide answers. I have checked the details of the case with the constituent and they want to have this issue aired publicly. People want to have such details aired publicly in order to get answers but also to ensure these things will not happen again.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> There was a catalogue of errors in the treatment of the woman in question, Mrs. Margaret Breen, who had a stroke in February. Her husband, Felix, has raised these issues with the hospital and the HSE. On Saturday, 20 February, Mrs. Breen suffered a stroke. Her husband rang for an ambulance from Huntstown, Mulhuddart at 1.48 p.m. The times have been confirmed by the National Ambulance Service. Despite there being an ambulance and a fire station located nearby, the ambulance came from Maynooth, County Kildare.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">It arrived at the house an hour later at 2.44 p.m. According to reports on the ambulance service, it has eight minute and 19 minute response targets for ECHO and DELTA but this family had to wait an hour while the wife was clearly suffering a stroke. There must be answers to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> To add insult to injury, the driver did not know the area, being from Kildare, and decided to go through Blanchardstown town centre on a Saturday afternoon, through the traffic and shoppers, adding to the journey time. It was <i>en route</i> to Connolly Hospital when it was discovered there is no stroke treatment there at weekends. The ambulance then had to make its way to the Mater hospital. Obviously, it arrived very late.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> When Mrs. Breen was being treated at the Mater hospital, that was fine but in a specialist stroke unit, she suffered her second stroke on 23 February 2016 at approximately 6.15 a.m. The HSE needs to explain to all of us and to her family why somebody in a specialist stroke unit would be left unaccompanied to go to the bathroom and not checked when she failed to return. There was a 20 minute delay before anyone even noticed Mrs. Breen had suffered a second stroke in a specialised stroke unit. There was a further delay in her examination by the medical team, who did not review her until 6.55 a.m. These are all official times. A CT scan was ordered at 7.06 a.m. but did not take place until 7.57 a.m. Why does it take 51 minutes for a CT scan to be done on somebody who has suffered a second stroke in a specialist unit? We also need an answer as to why there was a delay in the ambulance transfer to Beaumont Hospital. Mr. Breen was telephoned at 8.10 a.m. to be told his wife had been transferred to Beaumont Hospital for an operation on her brain. He was told an ambulance had been called but no ambulance call went through until 8.41 a.m. A 999 call was made instead of a 2222 call and there were many other issues. Mrs. Breen did not arrive at Beaumont Hospital for the procedure to begin until 10.15 a.m. Four hours had elapsed between the woman having a stroke in a specialist stroke unit and being treated properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> Mrs. Breen has had intensive rehabilitation but she has lost her short-term memory. We do not know what effect those delays have had on this woman's future quality of life and short-term memory recovery. Why put out ads telling people to respond within minutes to a stroke if an ambulance will not arrive for an hour? Why put out ads with taxpayers' money if ambulances cannot respond when people do notice a stroke? There is an increased prevalence of stroke in society among young people. This is a very serious issue and the committee, the Minister and the HSE must answer to this family with regard to why a woman waited four hours to get the treatment she needed. Eventually, she had to have a brain operation. There are real questions for the ambulance service. I am running out of time.</p>

          <from>Deputy Hildegarde Naughton<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_773">I very much welcome this debate and the proposal to establish this special all-party committee. It is past time some long-term structure was given to our health service. I will refrain from criticising the HSE and its predecessors for not putting in place such a plan. This is because for decades health authorities in this country have been chasing their tails fire fighting one problem after another rather than planning for the future. This fire fighting was the result of, in a circular but predictable way, a lack of any long-term plan for the health service in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> If a service is pared down to its most essential parts, as happened during the recent financial crisis, it becomes easier to see where the problems are. This is for another day, however, and the committee has ahead of it probably one of the most important jobs in recent generations. There is nothing more important where we stand now in 2016 than tackling our health problems. What is required now is political maturity and an ability to work together and not stick rigidly to fixed ideological positions. All that matters in any committee deliberations are patient outcomes and a process that leads to a modern, efficient and cost-effective service for everyone, notwithstanding their means.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> I wish to make one point in this debate which will resonate with Deputies whose constituencies cover rural areas such as mine, or areas of the country outside Dublin. Yesterday, I saw a very interesting figure, that 41% of Irish people live outside urban areas. An urban area is defined as one with a population greater than 1,500. Dublin's population, city and county, is approximately 1.25 million. Dublin, therefore, has just more than a quarter of the entire population of approximately 4.65 million. I mention this because many Deputies in the House would feel the majority of the citizens of this country are playing second fiddle when it comes to infrastructural investment, particularly in health care. Dublin is bursting at the seams in terms of transport, a lack of housing and other areas. Billions can be invested in the cross-city Luas, an airport extension or new hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> While I did not agree with much of what the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance, John Moran, stated in a recent article, some of it made sense. There is a huge lack of infrastructural investment outside Dublin. This is simply a fact. Health care is one of the most obvious areas. University Hospital Galway is shoehorned into the middle of a medieval city, with no room to park or to expand and no plan for the future except for necessary but short-term replacement building projects. It is supposed to be a centre of excellence but I would try persuading either the staff or the patients going through the accident and emergency department of this. Cancer patients have to queue for hours or even days to be admitted. I could go on and I am sure other Deputies have similar issues in their constituencies. In Galway, we have all of this and an underutilised hospital campus of 150 acres of State-owned land at Merlin Park, a few kilometres away from University Hospital Galway. This is an example of the issues the committee needs to examine. We badly need vision in our health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> I do not for one minute advocate a one for everyone in the audience approach. I fully realise that expertise in a given field has the best outcome for patients if centralised in a specialist centre. I do not advocate a centre of excellence in every town and village in the country. What I advocate is that the committee takes a good hard look at the services offered, how and where they are delivered and imagine our health system in ten years' time. Imagine a system which does not have 90 year old patients endlessly waiting on trolleys, cancer patients endlessly waiting for admission or nurses and doctors at their wits' end trying to cope.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> Earlier I stated the committee has a hugely challenging task ahead but it is one with huge rewards. This committee, and subsequently this House, have a generational opportunity to create a health service on which all our citizens can rely and of which they can be proud.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_371">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_779">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and the establishment of the special all-party committee to develop a single long-term plan for health care. As the Minister, Deputy Harris, has already said, now is the time to put the benefits of our economic success to work for the people so that we can help deliver the public services this country deserves.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Today, there are still too many people on hospital trolleys in accident and emergency departments waiting for a hospital appointment or a surgical procedure. With the make-up of the current Dáil, we now have an historic opportunity to work together, take a cross-party approach and develop a long-term plan for health services that will deliver the services we all want for this country. I firmly believe we should all work together on this and we can develop a plan with a vision of how health care can be delivered to the entire population.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> Coming from County Louth, I am acutely aware of the challenges facing the health services. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda is, unfortunately, regularly in the news for the wrong reasons. Hardly a week goes by when we do not hear the number of people on trolleys in its accident and emergency department is among the highest in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">While I agree that one person on a trolley is one too many, I do not agree with the regular commentary which seems to judge Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital based on the number of patients waiting on trolleys as opposed to the services they ultimately receive. Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital is one of the top hospitals in the country and its staff are excellent. I am basing this opinion on the views of people who have been treated in it. I have met many people during the course of my constituency work who have been treated or cared for in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and the overriding consensus is that once one gets past the initial admission procedure, the treatment received is second to none.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> In my home town of Dundalk Louth County Hospital has never been busier. Last year alone more than 25,000 patients were treated. This is despite the fact that the hospital was downgraded by the previous Fianna Fáil Government and that at one stage it was feared that it would be closed completely. Far from being closed, it is growing the list of services available, including the number of acute services. </p>
          <p eId="para_784"> In line with A Programme for a Partnership Government, the minor injuries unit in Dundalk will see its opening hours increase and the age at which patients can be treated extended. </p>
          <p eId="para_785"> One of the most significant problems I see in Dundalk with health services is the fact that too many people are still not aware of the many services available in Louth County Hospital. Too many are still going to the emergency department in Drogheda when they could simply go to the minor injuries unit in Louth County Hospital. By using the minor injuries unit in Dundalk as opposed to the emergency department in Drogheda, substantial improvements could be achieved in both hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> In the past few years I have worked closely with the previous Ministers for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar and Dr. James Reilly, to ensure a primary care centre is opened in Dundalk. I now look forward to working with the new Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and his Department to ensure this much-needed primary care centre will finally open in Dundalk.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> Getting back to the motion, I firmly believe, as does the Fine Gael Party, that universal health care is the way forward. It should also be noted that this approach is supported by the World Health Organization, the United Nations, the OECD and the European Union. A successful universal health care programme, as described by the Minister, will have four main objectives: reducing unmet health needs, reducing inequality in access to health goods and services, improving service quality and improving financial protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> I fully support the motion on establishing an all-party committee to develop a single long-term plan for health care. What I would not like to see happen is old-style party politics dominating the committee. We have a unique and an historic opportunity to work together across the House to develop a plan that will shape the future of health care in Ireland. We must not expect results to happen immediately; nor must we expect that simply throwing money at them will solve all of the issues. For this vision and plan to be successful, it must consider all aspects of health care systems from the ground up. We must consider work practices within the health service, what is working and what is not. We must not be afraid to make hard choices if the end result will be a world-class health service that will be fit for purpose and service all of the people.</p>

          <from>Deputy Robert Troy<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_789">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate and wish to begin by congratulating the two Ministers of State and wishing them well in their new roles. It is a sign of the times that we are having this debate and that the Government, which is made up of Fine Gael Ministers supported by Independents, acknowledges that there is wisdom in all areas of policy formation other than that found on the Government benches. We have lived through a period of five years when whatever was said by anybody on this side of the House was usually rubbished, when Opposition Deputies were accused of scaremongering and saying things for political advantage. In fact, sometimes Members on this side of the House were merely raising awareness of some of the critical issues faced by men and women in the communities we represented. To strike a note of caution, perhaps if Members on the other side of the House had listened to Members on this side a little more often during those five years, they might not be relying on Members on this side to ensure the adoption of policies into the future. However, I welcome the new composition of the Dáil and look forward, as the previous speaker said, to engaging constructively with the Government on how we can make the necessary improvements that will ultimately benefit the people whom we are fortunate enough and honoured to represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> To strike another note of caution, I hope the new committee is not being set up ultimately to deflect responsibility if the necessary improvements are not made in the lifetime of the Government. Unfortunately, when one looks back at what was promised in 2011 and what was delivered by 2016, many of the improvements in the health service were simply not delivered. Elderly people are now waiting possibly three times longer for standard hip or knee replacements than in 2011. Only last week an elderly person aged 81 years from County Longford contacted me about the severe pain he was in and looking to find out whether there might be any way his operation might be expedited. I wrote to a particular hospital about this patient and stated he was quite visibly in awful pain. To my surprise, on Monday the surgeon in that hospital rang me to tell me that he could not disagree with one thing I had written in my letter. He asked me to use my position as a Member of Dáil Éireann to say the hospital did not have the money to carry out operations and that he could be performing five operations a day but was currently only allowed to perform two. I asked him innocently how long it took him to perform the two operations. I remember that I asked him at about 11.45 a.m. by which time he said he had performed the operations to be performed that day. I asked what he would do for the rest of the day. He said he would have his lunch and probably read the <i>Medical Times</i> and then go home because he did not have any more work to do. Surely no one in this House can say that that is appropriate. Surely no one can stand over not giving highly qualified staff working in publicly funded hospitals and being paid from taxpayers' money the necessary funding to carry out the work that needs to be done, given that all the time people are suffering, in pain and on long waiting lists. The two Ministers of State will need to address this issue speedily.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> I wish to take the opportunity to speak about the disability sector. It is yet another sector that needs radical attention. In my constituency two people have been evaluated separately and had personal assistant hours approved. One lady aged 43 years is practically confined to bed and totally reliant on her elderly parents to provide full-time care. The HSE acknowledges that she needs assistance and has awarded her a number of hours but - wait for it - it does not have the funding to actually give a personal assistant for these hours. It states, however, that if she wants to go into a nursing home, she can avail of the fair deal scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> In a similar case a 62 year old man had a stroke more than 15 years ago. His wife provided full-time care for him. Unfortunately, she passed away from cancer three months ago. Who is to look after him now? The HSE has been contacted and evaluated his case. Again, it has confirmed that for this man to continue living in his own community where he has been cared for the past 15 years, he needs a home care package. It has approved such a package, but, lo and behold, the patient has been told the necessary funding is not available for the package to commence.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">If he wants to enter into a nursing home and apply under the fair deal scheme, he will be possibly looked upon favourably. That is ludicrous. There is no joined-up thinking. Each department is working in silos where every department is looking at its own individual budget with no thought of the consequences on other budgets. It makes sense to keep people in their home for as long as possible. It makes social sense, it makes moral sense and, if one wants to look at it in brass tacks, it makes economic sense to provide the certain supports to keep people in their own home rather than putting them into institutions. We must look at how the various elements within the department are working and how each section is utterly focused on its own budget and makes decisions on its own budget with no interaction with the various other sections within the HSE. That is something that needs to be looked at by the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> I take this opportunity to focus on the area of mental health. I listened to the Minister, Deputy Harris, this morning on the issue of the €35 million in funding transferred to other services. It annoys me when people talk about time-saving measures. The reason those people are not employed today is because somebody did not advertise in time. They talk about the period of time it takes to advertise and go through the recruitment and that as a result, they will not be hired by the end of the year. If they knew the funding would be there, why were the advertisements not issued in time, why did the process not start in time and why are the staff not recruited? There was a conscious decision taken somewhere - it might not have been in the Department and it may not be the Minister's fault - that they would not start this process so that they would be able to peel off a certain amount of this funding and put it into another section within the HSE. That is wrong. From what I understood from listening to "Morning Ireland" today, the Minister stated that the decision was not set in stone and is under review. I hope it is under review and I hope the Minister and the Minister of States use their positions of authority to ensure it is stopped and that, even if those necessary professionals cannot be employed by the end of the year, the money is spent where it should be, on the provision of mental health services.</p>

          <p eId="para_795">This is a welcome and timely debate. I fully agree with the motion. If we can all sign up to changes and if we can sign up to a ten-year plan or a plan of whatever length in terms of the cycle of change, I do not have a problem but the changes I would like to see would not take ten years. They would not take ten days, if we attach the importance to them that we should.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> The HSE is an unaccountable organisation. It is accountable only to the Oireachtas committees and to the Minister for Health. There is no accountability, to me and every other Deputy in the Louth-Meath Cavan-Monaghan area, other than by written request or by meeting an official. Given the significant controversies that are arising, as we see in Cavan hospital, and as we see regularly in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and in County Meath, etc., we ought to go back to the system of accountability of the HSE at regional fora of Members elected to the Oireachtas. That would be useful. Such meetings should be held quarterly, where one could receive reports into the care provided by hospitals in one's region and could also raise, directly and publicly, the issues that arise as a result of those concerns. That is something that is missing in the formula in terms of accountability. If one could bring in before the regional Oireachtas Members the officials of the health board in a transparent, accountable way and hold them to account for the issues that arise, it would be constructive for both sides. One needs that creative tension between the administrators of the health service and the public representatives. It would be a two-way process because the administrators would be able to clearly identify to us directly the changes that they believe are necessary as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> Does it take somebody to be dying to get a medical card? That is the question I must ask today. In the past week I have had contact with two constituents who are terminally ill. One of them has serious cancer and most of their bowel and stomach has been removed. The other person has terminal heart disease and will be dead, the person tells me, probably within six months at the most. In both cases, their income is higher than the limit for medical cards. Both of them have been kindly turned down by the HSE medical card appeal system for a discretionary medical card. It is a shame and a disgrace that somebody who is terminally ill should be deprived of the comfort of the concern of the community. Such people should be given a medical card if they are terminally ill, regardless of their income. It would recognise their importance as a human being. It would recognise their battle to live as long as they can in the best way that they can. It is a shame and a disgrace that constituents are telephoning me with those concerns in the past week. I note, from listening to other Members in the Oireachtas, it is not unique to my good self. We need to look again at the discretionary medical card applications. The HSE needs to be much more empathetic towards families and the seriously ill. It is unforgivable and unacceptable that the current system prevails.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> The other element missing in the health service is advocates for the elderly, for those who are terminally ill and for patients who are in hospital about whom families have concerns. One telephones the hospital and leaves a message and perhaps the call will be returned or perhaps not. One talks to the liaison staff and maybe they will or will not be sympathetic to the point one is making. What we need in the HSE are advocates whose full-time job is to deal with the bureaucracy for and on behalf of the patients who lie in those beds who are not getting the treatment that their families feel they need or who need to be in hospital and are not, and who will be accountable to the patient and families. I recognise and welcome the work that the patient liaison staff do but I am not convinced that they are on the side of the patient. What we need is a clear, absolutely committed and fully funded advocacy service that will reach out and meet the needs of those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> Never is this more important than when people have dementia. I and every Member of this House are aware of people who suffer from dementia, the problems in the families and in the homes, and the fear that people outside of the immediate family have about getting involved. It is like the way cancer was treated many years ago. People do not know what to do or what to say. We need to reach out much more to people with dementia and to the families who support them. One should not forget the family gives day and night support, 24 hours a day seven days a week, to keep them in their home. If anything must change in society, it is the way we treat people with dementia and the way we interact and support the families who are caring for people who have that illness. In particular, I welcome the nomination of a representative from the Alzheimer Society of Ireland to the Seanad. I do not know whether it was Fianna Fáil. Whoever made the nomination, it is a welcome place where the person can articulate views on what should be done in this area. I would fully support such concerns and views.</p>

          <p eId="para_801">I do not mind. I am happy that it happened. I welcome it. It is a positive, constructive appointment to the Seanad and it is essential in terms of informing our thinking. We need to articulate their needs on a national level.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> Returning to the wonderful HSE, it is more a hide and seek than a HSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">For two years, I have been trying to get at the facts regarding a death in County Louth and find out what went wrong with the ambulance service that night. For some reason, no ambulance turned up and the poor, unfortunate patient died tragically. He was brought to hospital in a Garda car. It was New Year's Eve, and a critical member of the ambulance crew had not turned up for work, which meant the service was one ambulance down. The absent crew member went and worked in the private sector as a private ambulance worker on the night on which the man died. I do not know how it impacted on the events in the Louth, Meath and Cavan area.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> I have been frustrated by the HSE and the system. The case is before the Information Commissioner for the second time in an attempt to get at the facts of the case. I am not seeking the name of the ambulance driver concerned. I want to know what happened, and why and how we can ensure it never happens again. It is unacceptable for somebody to leave the ambulance service and work in the private sector on the busiest night of the year. I do not know why the young man died. I do not know whether he could have been saved had an ambulance reached him in time. The fact that concerns me most is that no ambulance came within the required period of time. I want to get at the truth of it. It has taken two years to get this far, but I will find out.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> It is a disgrace that we must go through this and that the transparency, knowledge and accountability of the ambulance service is the way it is. This is why I return to my point regarding accountability in the Louth, Meath, Cavan and Monaghan region. The old health board system was not bad in terms of accountability. We are not talking about interfering in the process but about asking the questions. At the health board meetings one could ask directly what was going on, which we cannot do now.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> I am very concerned about the treatment of the elderly in nursing home care, both private and public. Shameful and disgraceful acts are still happening to our elderly in many institutions. I will return to it very soon in the public domain. We need more inspections. HIQA is doing far fewer inspections than it should. One is lucky if it visits a nursing home once a year. HIQA must be far more active and involved in what is happening and we need much more transparency and accountability. For whatever time is left to me in this House, I will push this.</p>

          <from>Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_807">I thank all the parties and Independent Deputies who have signed up to the motion before us. There is much concern about the fact that we have a minority Government, and those concerns may, in time, prove to be well-founded. While I hope they do not, they may. However, the minority situation also provides the Dáil with a voice it has not had before. It provides the Dáil with the opportunity to table motions and legislation and build cross-party coalitions for good ideas. While the Social Democrats initiated the motion before the House, it is a motion of the Dáil, supported by all parties and groups. Hopefully, through this cross-party approach, we can achieve some important breakthroughs in health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> The motion calls for the establishment of a committee to examine four specific health care challenges, namely, the existing and forecast demand for health services; how to progress a model of health care that advocates the principles of prevention and early intervention, self-management and primary care services, and integrated care; the different funding models available, which I imagine the committee will spend much time on; and how best to reorient the health service from an acute-based system towards an integrated, primary and community care system.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> The motion outlines “the need to establish a universal single tier service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than on ability to pay”. It is a very serious statement for the Dáil to make. It is a cross-party statement signed up to by all the Independent Deputies. It is a major departure from today's health care system and I very much welcome the fact that the statement has got such agreement in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> There is more that most, if not all, Members agree on. They agree that our health care system should provide a high quality, modern and timely service which should be provided as close to the patient as practicable. They agree our health care system should be cost-effective and should invest in prevention and early detection. They agree our health care system should protect people’s dignity, which our clinicians try to do every day but which, sadly, they are not always able to provide, for a variety of reasons. They agree that our health care system should be a rewarding and exciting place for clinicians and non-clinicians to work in and that it should be open to change, responsive to concerns and accountable for its work. I, and many Members of the House, would argue that this is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> It is important to recognise some of the successes we have had in health care, including the great success and progress in paediatric leukaemia treatment during recent years. However, the system is struggling. International comparisons do not suggest Ireland does very well. For example, the European Health Consumer Index ranks us 21st out of 35 countries, which puts us close to the bottom of the middle group. The index also found that we have the longest waiting times for emergency care in Europe, which we must take very seriously. Today, nearly 300 people are on trolleys. In west Wicklow and Kildare, more than 1,800 people are awaiting speech and language assessments. The vast majority of these are children, and the waiting time is 18 months to two years. By the time some of those children receive care, much of the opportunity to provide help has been missed. Over the weekend, we heard the bone density scanners in Galway University Hospital have been shut down. We have two high-tech machines that had been running five days a week, and both have been mothballed due to lack of staff. We cannot allow this.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> The Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital has seven operating theatres which used to operate every day and a surgeon in a given eight hour list could do approximately seven procedures. Two of the operating theatres have been closed indefinitely and another two have been closed for refurbishment with no understanding as to when they will re-open. Only three of the seven operating theatres of the Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital are being used. It is worse than that. A given orthopaedic surgeon takes one of the three operating theatres for a given day. The surgeons are being told they can have a theatre only every second or third Monday, for example, given that only three are available. They are also being told not to do as many procedures as they could. For example, rather than doing seven procedures, they are told to do only four, and then go home. The HSE will still pay the €22 million it costs to run the hospital, and will pay the surgeons, theatre teams and all the costs. The reason the surgeons must go home is that the only thing the HSE will not pay for is the implants.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">We have a hospital, surgeons, technicians, operating theatres, wards, a car park and insurance. We are going to pay for all of these, but we will just not pay for implants. Therefore, rather than having seven operating theatres within which six or seven procedures could be carried out each day, we have three within which perhaps four procedures are performed each day at more or less the same cost. We paid €22 million for the hospital and some of the €1.5 million for implants. That is what is happening in the hospital system. Consequently, those who can afford it can avail of private care. The waiting time to see a surgeon to whom I spoke recently was 18 months in the case of his public list but only six months in the case of his private list. Therefore, there is a two-tier system. There is health care for those who can afford it but not for those who cannot.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> What is frustrating is that it is not due to a lack of funding. It is not that there is not enough money going into the HSE. We have the second highest expenditure ratio on health care in the OECD. We spend money, but we do not get the service we should for it. The issue is not clinicians. We have some of the best trained clinicians on earth, as well as some of the best doctors, nurses and surgeons. We have the second highest expenditure ratio on health care, yet we are effectively telling the National Orthopaedic Hospital to close more than half of its operating theatres, and not to carry out as many procedures as possible on patients with deteriorating conditions which will result in their ending up in wheelchairs because we do not have the money for implants. That is what is happening on a daily basis. </p>
          <p eId="para_815"> There are many reasons for the low performance rate in the health system. There is a lack of local autonomy for hospitals and there is a poor level of accountability and transparency in the HSE. There is little econometric analysis to show where we need to provide health care. We do not have integrated ICT systems for the management of patient records. In many places we have silos rather than continuous and holistic care pathways. We have a deep culture of mistrust between clinicians and managerial staff across the health care system. It is corrosive. However, such a culture does not prevail in other countries in which I have worked. There is little access for patients to clinical quality data. Consequently, they do not know which hospitals are good and which are bad. Some are good and others not so good, but we are not allowed to know which is which. There are also poor working conditions for clinicians. The list goes on.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> Each of these operational challenges is solvable, but they are not being solved. Why? It is because behind it all there is a lack of vision. We cannot achieve success in health care because we have not agreed what it is. We cannot give managers and clinicians the tools they need to succeed because we have not told them what we want them to do to succeed. We need a unified strategy for health care, but for that we need to know what it is to achieve and right now we do not know what that is. That is why the motion is important. It will bring together a cross-party group to which we can all bring political ideas, but I hope it will not be used as a political football. We can bring the group together to ask some of the following questions. What are the health care services we need and where are they needed? How do we support prevention and early detection programmes? How can we move to an integrated primary care system? How much money are we willing to spend on health care, as we can spend as much as we want to spend on it? How will we raise the money? If we can make progress on these questions, we can put a long-term system in place with agreement on what it is we are trying to achieve, how we are trying to achieve it and, critically, how we will pay for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> We need to be honest about some uncomfortable political truths which the committee will have to examine. One is that a modern health care system requires an increasing amount of money because it is becoming more sophisticated and people are living longer. Another is that a modern health care system is of a scale which makes it impossible for all services to be delivered everywhere throughout the country. We will have to have a serious conversation about that issue. Another truth is that some hospitals are simply better than others and that people have a right to know which are doing well and which are doing badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> We need a vision for health care for which we need cross-party support. We must also learn to start trusting clinicians and managers in primary care centres, hospitals and hospital groups. </p>
          <p eId="para_819"> I wish whoever will serve on the committee well. They will face some very difficult technical and political issues. If the committee can succeed in bringing back to the House a vision for health care and real options in terms of how much it will cost and how we can fund it, we can start to move on and accept that if we are to spend more on health care than almost any other country, let us have the best health care system in the world for that money.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy)<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_821">I will speak first. I am delighted to speak to this all-party motion to establish a committee to devise a long-term strategy for health care. I hope it will be as successful as the Sub-committee on Dáil Reform on which I served since the first meeting of the Dáil and which was chaired most ably by the Ceann Comhairle. All members of the sub-committee represented the Members elected to the House. It was very constructive and positive and while its members held different views, they came to a consensus. If we can achieve the same with the new committee that is being established with the Members who will serve on it seeking to achieve something positive for the population that will ensure the delivery of health services will be much improved, that will be a very good outcome. I urge Members who have not thought of serving on it to put their names forward and to serve on the committee if they get the opportunity to do so. It will be an enriching experience for them and I hope the outcome will be one of which we can all be proud and that we can all look forward to implementing its recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_822"> Much of the focus of the health service is on the difficulties that arise within it. However, any of us who has had occasion to experience the health service has found that once one is in the system, one is looked after very well. The front-line staff are fantastic and patients receive exceptional care. The focus will be on whether there are delays in emergency departments and whether there are patients on trolleys to try to come up with strategies to reduce such delays. </p>
          <p eId="para_823"> The focus of the Government is on improving people's health and well-being to keep them out of the health system. This is a positive direction to take. We want to put strategies in place that will ensure people will take positive steps to improve their health and well-being and that of their children through schools and in communities and through taking responsibility for their own health helped by public information programmes, the HSE, Departments and cross-departmental efforts to ensure people will become more physically active and cut out or cut down their alcohol consumption and tobacco use. Some of the figures are stark. When we consider all of this, we note the importance of focusing on what we can do for ourselves, ably assisted by the agencies charged with responsibility of assisting us in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_824"> The level of obesity is of great concern. I am conscious of it as a parent who has reared children and I also see its high incidence among young people. Unfortunately, one in four children and around 60% of the population are obese. I will have to look into my own heart on this one. I always thought I was curvaceous, but I have been told I am obese; therefore, I had better do something about it. We are getting older and need to maintain our cardiovascular health to try to resist developing conditions that will leave us prone to having a stroke, a heart attack or developing cancer and to all of the other difficulties that we all know only too well having seen family members suffer from some of these conditions or bad health outcomes. Obesity levels are, unfortunately, also higher among those in the low income bracket in society.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">That is something we need to be concerned about. We need to look at the type of food people are eating and to encourage them to eat better food and to avoid fast food. Actions will be put in place in the coming months in terms of our obesity strategy which we will, hopefully, launch very soon. There will be actions in terms of the public alcohol Bill which will address among other things preventing young children from being exposed to advertising and the marketing of alcohol. There is quite a lot of action taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_826"> If we look at obesity again, "Operation Transformation" on RTE is partnered by the Department of Health. There are also partnerships with the GAA in terms of getting young people active and moving. All of these things are very beneficial because physical activity is good not only for one's physical well-being but also one's mental health. Reading into my brief recently, I came across a figure on alcohol consumption and its impact on people's mental health. As it is a depressive, people who are hoping for a lift might only get a temporary one. In the long-term, however, they will not get any benefit from it. In fact, the incidence of alcohol in relation to suicide shows that it is involved in more than 50% of cases. That is something we need to take care of because it is of great concern to me in my new role. The national physical activity plan, which I touched on earlier, is also of incredible importance. It is something I urge everybody to have a look at to see how they can use the ideas contained in it to encourage those within their communities to engage also.</p>
          <p eId="para_827"> There are many challenges but I am very optimistic. If we can focus on a practical level on keeping people out of the health system and have them take positive actions in terms of their own health, it will cost a lot less and we will all have longer and healthier lives. That is what all of us want for ourselves and our children. I hope sincerely that when the committee is established, there will be a very positive attitude to it and that people will adopt a very constructive approach. At the end of it, I hope we have something we can all stand over, be proud of and see delivered into the future.</p>

        <speech by="#DannyHealyRae" eId="spk_379">
          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_828">I wish Deputy Simon Harris the very best in his new role as Minister for Health. I ask him to take charge of all aspects of health to ensure that there is accountability in our health service. I think back over the years and my time as a member of Kerry County Council and it seems to me that former Ministers for Health were not really accountable for health at all. They threw it back to the HSE. In reply to any question asked in the Dáil, a Minister would say he or she would refer it to the HSE. If one was at the HSE forum in the County Hall in Cork and asked the HSE to account for something, it would refer it back to the Department. The buck needs to stop with somebody. I ask the new Minister, who is a fit young man himself, to take charge of the Department of Health to ensure that the service is properly run and overseen.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> Are there too many officials in the HSE rather than front-line staff? Front-line staff in the hospitals in Kerry, including nurses and those on the floor especially at night, are, and have been, under tremendous pressure. There are clearly not enough nurses. At University Hospital Kerry in Tralee and at Killarney Community Hospital, staff are visibly under pressure every day of the week. If a nurse goes off sick on a ward, which happens, the rest of the staff are under severe pressure for the duration of the shift. We need more nurses and that must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> There is a problem with recruiting GPs in rural areas. I highlight Rathmore in Kerry where it is a real issue now. Graduating GPs are not inclined to stay in our country. They cost a great deal to educate but in one year - 2014 - 89 of the 91 who graduated left the country. Something has to be done to rectify that and, as such, I call on the Minister to ensure it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> Every morning an account is given on radio in Kerry of the number of patients on trolleys. It happens all over the country. Why is that so? Why can we not sort it out? In Kerry, it appears the reason is that so many of our wards are closed. At University Hospital Kerry, two or three wards were closed completely four or five years ago because they could not be staffed. Staffing is the issue. The new community hospital in Kenmare is only half open as is Dingle Community Hospital. The grounds for the hospital in Dingle were given over by the landowner for free to build a community hospital for the people of the area and yet a lot of its accommodation is being used as office space for the HSE. I deplore that because it is not why the hospital was built. </p>
          <p eId="para_832"> Turning to mental health, a new unit has been built at Deer Lodge on St. Margaret's Road in Killarney. It has been completely finished for almost 12 months but there are no staff available for it. Sadly, close to my home in Kerry, four people have committed suicide. I am not saying the opening of this unit would have prevented that but the unit has been built for a purpose and is not serving one as long as it remains unopened. I ask the new Minister to address that issue immediately because the unit in Killarney is needed by all of the people in Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> We had what we were told was a reconfiguration of the ambulance service two or three years ago. "Reconfiguration" is a terrible word because I take it to mean a reduction in service rather than a reconfiguration of the service. In Kerry, and I suppose it is the case nationally, the rule is that an emergency hospital ambulance cannot take a patient to a district hospital. We had a case on the Muckross Road in Killarney where a patient could not be taken by the emergency ambulance to the district hospital in Killarney. The man took his last drive in the world in the back of a builder's van when the doctor involved secured a wheelchair to put him into it. We are supposed to have intermediate care vehicles to take care of that situation but in the south, sadly, there are no staff to operate them. I ask that the issue be addressed. There is no point having vehicles if there is no one to drive them.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> What is happening with home help is a serious issue for me. Home help is vital to keep elderly and disabled people in their homes for the last years of their lives but it has been seriously cut. A great many people are in contact with my office each day to ask about hours or to say that the hours that they already had have been cut. In one case, an elderly woman of 88 years of age was getting five half hours over five mornings but that has been cut to two half hours. The woman was born in 1928 and has given her life to the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">After spending her life rearing her family and doing her best for everyone she met, this is how she is being treated. Her home help has been cut from five half hours - a half hour each morning - to two half hours. A blind man in another part of the constituency has had his home help removed at the weekends. On Saturdays and Sundays, he gets up and tries to put on his clothes but because he cannot see, they are upside-down and inside-out. He burns himself with water whenever he tries to make himself a cup of tea. He lives alone and his neighbours are worried about him.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> It is not fair, as people do not get better at weekends or on bank holidays. It is sad to think that on Christmas Day, St. Stephen's Day and New Year's Day, when all of the world is operating under the guise of peace and good, or on any other bank holiday, there is no home help for some people. This matter must be addressed. Surely doing so would be cheaper and easier than putting people into nursing homes. Some of them die after a few weeks of being in a nursing home. If they could be helped to stay in their own homes, it would mean so much to many and save the country a great deal of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Kerry has a separate issue and is under more pressure. People are as entitled to live in Kerry as in any other county. A few weeks ago, we had the case of a patient whose address was given as Ballydesmond, Mallow, County Cork. While that is her correct address, she is actually on the Kerry side. If she was on the Mallow side, she would get 20 hours of home help per week but because she is on the Kerry side, she only gets ten hours per week. We are in the same country, so everyone should be treated the same. All of the children of the country should be cherished equally. This matter must be addressed. There are no ifs or buts about it and I will not settle for anything less. People who need home help should get as much of it as possible and it should be distributed equally to everyone.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Finian McGrath)<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_839">I thank colleagues for their contributions to this debate. It has been a valuable experience, as I have heard many good and different ideas and positive contributions. A number of Deputies proposed solutions to a number of the problems in our health services. The committee has significant potential to develop further solutions to some of the issues that have been raised in this debate and it can bring a clear plan to the House. As many Deputies stated, however, any recommendation from the committee must be implemented. Health is an important issue and must be placed at the heart of Government and Government policy. I will do my best to ensure that this happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> The funding, reform and management of our health services are important matters. As such, I confirm my support for the motion establishing the committee on the future of health care. One of the motion's key aims relates to achieving the best health outcomes and value for money by reorienting the model of care towards primary and community care where the majority of people's health needs can be met locally. This is of particular importance in supporting people with disabilities. According to the motion, the committee will examine how to progress a changed model of care that advocates principles such as early intervention, self-management, greater use of primary care services and integrated care. These are important principles for any health system.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> A key Government aim is to provide services and supports for people with disabilities that empower them to live independent lives, provide them with greater independence in accessing services of their choosing and enhance their ability to tailor the supports required to meet their needs and plan their lives. This commitment is outlined in the programme for a partnership Government and is guided by two principles, namely, equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities. As part of our commitment to equality of opportunity for all citizens, we will support people with disabilities in maximising their potential by removing barriers that impact on access to services, education, work and health care. Particular focus will be placed on supports at key transition points, namely, going to school; progressing to further training or education; commencing employment; and moving into new homes. These are key elements of our plans for the coming months.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> This is a time of major change in the delivery of services and the Transforming Lives programme has already been embarked upon. I urge all Deputies to examine it. Meeting the needs of the individual is at the heart of our disability services and the aim of the Transforming Lives programme is to put people with disabilities at the centre of everything we do. Its implementation will mean a seismic shift in how disability services are funded and provided, moving choice and control from professional administrators to where it rightly belongs, that being, the individual with the disability and his or her family. Services and supports will be delivered with greater efficiency, transparency and accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> These issues are covered by the programme for a partnership Government but so is another important issue, namely, cystic fibrosis services. We will endeavour to ensure that everyone with cystic fibrosis will get a top-class service. Capital investment in emergency departments is also required.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> To speak more broadly, I will discuss children with disabilities and people with serious illnesses. On page 56 of our programme for Government, we plan on extending medical cards to the approximately 10,000 children in respect of whom domiciliary care allowance is received. A number of Deputies rightly mentioned mental health services. We must bring further capacity to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, CAMHS. We need more 24-hour supports in primary and emergency care. We must consider those in our wider society who need our help. As such, the Government is examining the idea of increasing the disability benefit, allowances, carer's benefit and the blind person's pension. As Deputies probably know, the €1,700 respite care grant resumed this week after it was cut. Some 17,000 carers are on the register for this grant but there are many other carers who are not. My colleagues might highlight this fact. I am also considering the introduction of a new mobility scheme and since we are discussing reform, it is important that we ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The programme for Government contains many other things that we all want to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_845"> The new committee has the potential to cause a seismic shift in the long-term vision for health care and health policy. I look forward to the committee's development of a political consensus on a long-term plan for health services and the health of citizens, especially the most vulnerable in society.</p>

          <p eId="para_847">Since I was elected in February this year, the issue of mental health has been raised by a huge number of my constituents. The issue is central and fundamental to us. Mental illness is one of the most serious social issues facing our country today. There is not a townland or housing estate that has not experienced the horrific, silent funeral that a suicide brings. We all have attended funerals where the grief of the family is immeasurable.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> This Dáil, the Thirty-second Dáil, has a great responsibility to make meaningful progress on this issue. It is generally accepted that the mental health service is the poor relation of the HSE. This was brought home to us when the talks on the formation of the Government were taking place. At the time money was diverted again from the mental health budget. As Minister of State Deputy Finian McGrath said in his speech, the mental health service has to get extra resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> In 1950, 76 suicides were recorded in this country. By 2011, this number had increased more than sevenfold. From 2001 to 2007, there was a significant reduction in the suicide rate but, unfortunately, suicide has since increased very significantly. This can be linked to the lack of funding being allocated to the mental health service. We have the fourth highest youth suicide rate in Europe. It is very hard for us as elected representatives to see young people looking for help and not being able to gain access to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> My constituency, Tipperary, feels it has been seriously hit by the lack of resources. It is hard to believe that a county with 160,000 people has no psychiatric beds. If one is in the south of the county, one has to go to Kilkenny to gain access to a psychiatric bed. If one is in the north of the county, one must go to Ennis. In my town, Thurles, there is a clinic that serves 34,000 people but it is a clinic only in name. It has no occupational therapist and no psychiatric counselling. Only medication is provided for the patients who attend. If we are to be serious about mental health and access to mental health facilities, we must put the resources in place to ensure people can avail themselves of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> A decision was taken a number of years ago to close St. Michael’s in Clonmel. I hope that in the lifetime of this Government we can again have psychiatric beds available in our county. In the past couple of weeks, the HSE took the decision to close Mount Sion in Tipperary. It is a residential facility for people with mental illness. At its peak, the facility was able to cater for 19 patients. There are now nine patients domiciled there. Recently, elected representatives and relatives of the patients in Mount Sion met representatives of the HSE, who gave us a commitment that they would re-examine the decision to close the facility. I appeal to the Minister to meet the relatives and hear at first hand the good work the facility is doing. If Mount Sion is closed, another part of the infrastructure in Tipperary will be taken away. It will make our job of providing proper facilities for people with mental health problems all the harder. I hope the HSE will reconsider its decision and keep the facility open.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> The HSE is telling us the larger units are not the way forward but the reality is that the facility has worked well. It worked well when it had 19 patients and residents. Now the HSE is saying the infrastructure is not up to HIQA standard but a very small investment would bring it up to that standard. I appeal to the Minister to have the HSE revisit its decision. I hope a positive outcome will emerge.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy)<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_853">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter. That we are now openly talking about mental health is an example of how we are moving forward in society. We are identifying that people’s mental health is not always as good as it could be and that we should not be afraid to seek help. If one sprains one’s ankle, one seeks help. One goes to the doctor or the physiotherapist until one is fixed, after which one can walk fine again. For too long, people were afraid to speak out about how they were feeling. Then the way they were feeling became normal and they probably did not realise in the end they were not well. People around them may not have realised they were not well and needed help. It is wonderful now that we can actually speak about this and ensure our loved ones are looked after. It is the Government’s responsibility to ensure the services required to help them, irrespective of their age, are put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> I was serving as Acting Chairman when Deputy Troy spoke about his feelings on a previous occasion in this debate. When he spoke, I felt a little like what he described. That weekend, I was speaking to some friends and my family and I said there was a very interesting contribution in the Chamber. My friends and family said they also feel a little like what I described. It dawned on me, having thought quite a bit about it, that we all experience anxiety, nervousness or depression at one level or another. Some days one might be down, which is normal enough, but it is when one cannot get back up again that one could be getting into trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> Post-natal depression is a big issue for women. Sometimes women feel there should not be such a thing as post-natal depression and that they should be full of joy with their new bundle of joy that is creating such love in their family. Perhaps they feel so bad that they feel so bad. It is important that people begin to realise that not feeling great is quite normal and that one can actually do something about it. They should not be afraid to do something about it and they should speak out about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> We need to be more careful with one another. I hear people use the word “bullying” in a context that is a little facetious or in the wrong context. The word “bully” has very strong implications, whether it is used in the school yard or workplace. If the word is just thrown around and becomes commonplace, it does not receive the emphasis it should receive, and it is not recognised how wrong it is. It is not recognised that actions need to be taken to deal with bullying. I urge people to be careful about how they use the word “bullying”.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> We should be leading by example in this Chamber. We should be careful with one another also. We have to mind our own mental health. I find dealing with social media very challenging. One should note the negativity, vilification and viciousness tossed at public representatives as if they were figures of stone, did not feel the same as everybody else and did not have a family the same as everybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> During the general election campaign, I gave up looking at social media altogether. It is hard to believe but my life was actually threatened on social media. I do not believe the person who threatened my life had any intention of carrying anything out but, at the same time, it was not very nice to believe there was a man somewhere in the county who felt the world would be a better place without me and that he would be prepared to do time if I were removed from the world. It is a horrible thing to take in as a public representative and a citizen who is free to move around. It is entirely wrong that this type of behaviour from adults is tolerated. We would not tolerate it in the playground from children. Adults are leading by example on social media. Children are on social media more often than they are probably in the playground. Their screen time is enormous. If they are looking at adults behaving in this fashion on social media, they will copy them.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> Social media has no rules and involves entirely new technology. We are only learning about its potential and the positive and negative aspects of the Internet. If adults believe it is okay to call one another names on social media, what will be next? Will we start calling one another names on the television and in public debates or here in the Chamber? Is that where we are going? I feel very strongly that, as adults, we should be leading by example and show the children how to use social media in a way that is positive and constructive for them because it has so many benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> This brings me to the topic of children, young people and the challenges facing them. I believe there are children being bullied on social media in ways that we cannot even contemplate because we did not go through it ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> We experienced childhood differently and were able to manage in the schoolyard and so on. Social media is a whole new experience. If I had a teenage child, I am not certain if I would be able to manage or even be aware of what he or she was experiencing. In the past, the bully could be left behind in the schoolyard or playground. Nowadays, the bully can follow a child into the bedroom of his or her home, supposedly the safest place we can be. While parents need to be vigilant, society must also recognise that this issue needs to be addressed. It is of critical importance that services are provided to support young people and that adults lead by example. </p>
          <p eId="para_862"> Suicide was not widely discussed in society in the past. The issue touches everyone, whether through extended family, friends or the local community. Suicide is so devastating that people want to do everything in their power to prevent it from happening again. We must reach out to people who are experiencing difficulties in life and let them know there are people who can help them. </p>
          <p eId="para_863"> According to the Central Statistics Office, men accounted for 391 of the 487 people who took their lives in 2013. Men need to be able to talk to each other and should not be afraid to reach out. Family and friends must also be sensitive to and support them. </p>
          <p eId="para_864"> Connecting for Life is an excellent strategy. Launched in June 2015, it will be in force until 2020. Empowering communities and individuals to improve their mental health and well-being is a good thing. If the strategy is implemented over the 2015-2020 period, we will be in a stronger position to ensure people can live positive, healthy lives and will recognise that while not everything in life goes well, mechanisms are available to provide help in such circumstances. Connecting with other people, physical activity and alternative practices such as meditation can be positive and should be encouraged. </p>
          <p eId="para_865"> Funding for suicide prevention has been increased from €3.7 million in 2010 to the current level of €11.55 million. This is a significant increase which demonstrates how serious the Government and society is about helping people to overcome difficulties in order that they can have the positive and productive life to which we all aspire.</p>

        <speech by="#PatCasey" eId="spk_385">
          <from>Deputy Pat Casey<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T18:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_866">Listening to the debate on mental health services, I have been impressed by the unity of purpose and sincerity shown by Deputies. This problem requires a continuous national response by the Government and a local response by wider society and non-government actors, such as the community and voluntary sector. Mental illness is widespread and there is not a family on the island which has not seen a loved one struck down by one of the conditions of the mind. In too many instances, these conditions have resulted in the ultimate act of despair, namely, death by suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_867"> Suicide is not a choice. It does not imply that a person has failed to adapt or has given up. It is the terminal stage of mental illness. My colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, bravely and movingly put into words the crippling physical and emotional symptoms of mental illness. All Deputies wish him well in his recovery and thank him for the public service he provided in sharing his story.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> The way in which we conduct our political and public lives must become an example that will help create a society that is respectful of the truth. Regardless of what walk of life we are in and what differences exist between us, we are all human beings on the journey of life. Too often, I have watched news reports from the Dáil showing supposedly adult politicians shouting insults at the other side as they engage in personal point-scoring. While passionate debate is welcome and to be encouraged, all those involved in public life, particularly in politics and the media, have a special duty to engage in debate in a manner that shows respect for difference and informs fellow citizens of the complexities of our problems. Debate should not be driven by shallow headlines.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> The mental health crisis is a symptom of the society we create and will become greater if we do not view prevention as equal to curative measures. The Department of Health and the Health Service Executive must introduce a major mental health initiative and treat mental health on a par with cancer and heart disease. It is only by having such a deep and broad focus that mental health will become the priority it clearly deserves to be. </p>
          <p eId="para_870"> Modern society is too self-obsessed with perceived winners and losers. We have too much black and white when shades of grey are much more common. The pace of life is also increasing as we race to find the right school, children engage in the points race and people seek the right college and the perfect job, partner and house - in short, the illusion of the perfect life. These aspirations are all sold by a consumer society that portrays a shallow view of perfection, one that is unobtainable and is a contributory factor to the strains being felt in the area of mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> A positive and preventative approach is a vital pillar of delivering a coherent mental health strategy. In this regard, young people and men must be targeted by a holistic plan which empowers them to be partners in the maintenance of good mental health. I have been highly impressed by the Jigsaw project, which emanated from the Headstrong initiative. Jigsaw is a network of projects designed to ensure that every young person has somewhere to turn when in need. It does this by having centres in hub areas and pop-up clinics and centres to ensure hard to reach young people have relative ease of access to services. It recently managed to provide a service throughout County Donegal. I hope it will be able to provide county-wide services in counties Wicklow and Carlow. While the Health Service Executive is the main funder, holistic and mental health programmes for young people must involve the Department of Education and Skills and all local authorities. I am pleased to report that Wicklow County Council and the Bray Area Partnership are working to establish a Jigsaw service for County Wicklow. Both bodies can be assured of my support, although I will insist on the programme being rolled out beyond the major centres of Bray and Greystones to reach into smaller towns such as Wicklow, Arklow, Blessington and Baltinglass as well as rural areas where mental health problems are escalating at an alarming rate. </p>
          <p eId="para_872"> Purposeful mental health services for everyone and the beginning of the end of the silent suffering of mental illness can be the lasting legacy of this Dáil. I hope that, as elected representatives who are in close agreement on this issue, we can achieve this objective early in the lifetime of the House. This would send a strong signal to the naysayers and doubters that politics can be a force of real and positive change. For my part, I will lead by example.</p>

          <p eId="para_874">I congratulate the Ministers of State, Deputies Helen McEntee and Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, on their appointments. Today, I was appointed the Fianna Fáil party spokesperson on old people, public health and health reform and I look forward to working with both the Ministers of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> Every year, thousands of students start a new chapter in their lives when they move to third level education. This is a very exciting time for most students as it is probably the first time they have lived away from home. For some students, however, reality sets in when the initial excitement of moving away from home and into new accommodation with friends without a night time curfew fades.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> The number of students in third level education seeking mental health services is mounting every year. I recently met Professor Willie Donnelly, president of Waterford Institute of Technology, to discuss university status for Waterford. I was shocked to learn that the institute of technology loses 20% of its first-time students every year. Last year, for example, 400 students out of a total cohort of 2,000 left the college.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">This cannot all be linked to mental health issues, as some students make the wrong choice or pick the wrong course. Cuts to the number of career guidance counsellors can also be linked to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> Mental health issues for third level students have become more prevalent. The waiting lists for counselling services are growing but these services are already over-prescribed and underfunded. College life should be enriching and rewarding for all our students. However, many students are struggling through their studies. Many students find the transition to college life and living away from home extremely challenging. This is having a detrimental effect on the mental health of students in colleges and universities around the country and often leads to problems with alcohol, drugs, body image, self-harm, bullying, anxiety, low self-esteem and difficulty coping with loss and grief.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> Colleges and universities offer services for those suffering with their mental health, including counselling services. Unfortunately, this is not enough. The student body is ever growing. These students come from more diverse backgrounds and cultures, speak different languages and have different traditions, which can exacerbate the problem. Despite the ever increasing student population, counselling services in colleges and universities have not kept pace with the growing numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> Recent statistics have shown that in some colleges and universities, there has been a 16% increase in enrolments while the numbers attending counselling services on campus have increased by 33%. Research has shown that over the past six years, the number of students presenting themselves to mental health services has steadily increased. The anxiety disorder figure has increased from 19% to 32%. The figure in regard to those suffering from depression has increased from 9% to 24% and there has been an increase in academic related issues from 19% to 29%. Despite these figures, there has been no increase in funding. Counselling services in our colleges are vital, essential and expected. The lack of these services, coupled with waiting lists - in some colleges there is only one counsellor available, backed up by a pastoral care team - is having a severe impact on students' health and well-being. Improved services are well overdue. Counselling services in our universities and institutions must be increased and funded.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> It is time for us to take an active approach to students' mental health because if we do not deal with the issue at this level, we are only kicking the can down the road, which will result in problems later. The issue of mental health must be addressed. There is no longer a stigma. If people break an arm, they get the problem sorted. The same approach needs to be taken for mental health issues. These issues cannot be buried in the basement of a hospital as if they do not exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> In Ireland, suicide is a leading cause of death among young people. The rate of youth suicide in Ireland is the fifth highest in the European Union. That is 15 youth suicides per 100,000 15 to 24 year olds. The suicide rate for teenage girls is higher in Ireland that in any other EU state. That is a damning statistic. There are not many Deputies here tonight to hear this but I will repeat that the suicide rate for teenage girls in Ireland is the higher than in any other EU state while the rate among young men is the second highest. I was shocked when I read this. This is a staggering statistic and the issue must be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> I am pleased there is consensus among all parties on the seriousness of this issue. I look forward to working with the Minister of State on the issue in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Carey<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_884">I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, on her appointment as Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people. I also congratulate Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy on her promotion to Minister of State with responsibility for health promotion. I wish both Ministers of State all the very best in their new roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> As a Member of this House for more than nine years, I see it as very positive that every Member has had an opportunity to contribute to this debate and it is encouraging that so many Members have done so. At this stage, virtually all Members have contributed. Over the past number of weeks of debate, I have listened to many contributions. Some constructive proposals have been made by Members from across the House and I have no doubt the Minister of State will take them on board and seek to have them implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> It is essential that when people seek help, help is available. In the area of mental health, it is vital that people are able to find good quality services and supports. It is ten years since A Vision for Change was published but, unfortunately, the recommendations contained within that framework document have not yet been fully implemented. There is little doubt that now, more than ever, there is an increased demand for mental health supports. It is not acceptable that waiting lists are allowed to continue to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> For example, the waiting list figures for mental health services for children, teenagers and young people in County Clare are stark. The HSE recently confirmed the following waiting times for routine referrals. Some 54 children are waiting up to three months; 31 are waiting between three and six months; and 18 are waiting between six and nine months. In addition, 19 are waiting list for nine to 12 months; eight are waiting 12 months; another eight are waiting 13 months; six are waiting for 14 months; and one is still waiting 15 months on. The HSE chief officer for community care in the mid-west region has recently confirmed that there is no waiting list for emergency cases, as children, teenagers and young people are dealt with on an emergency on-call basis. However, every effort must be made to reduce the waiting lists associated with routine referrals for children, teenagers and young people as these waiting times are now stretching into years.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> Significant positive participation has taken place through community initiatives, such as the Darkness Into Light and the Cycle Against Suicide movements. These initiatives are primarily driven by young people. In so doing, they are raising awareness about mental health issues. I also want to compliment groups like Console and the Samaritans, which do marvellous work in County Clare and throughout the State. It is important that people know that it is okay not to feel okay and that it is okay to talk about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> The biggest challenge in the battle to improve mental health facilities and services is presented by the shortfall of approximately 3,000 key staff. If we are to tackle this issue and reduce the waiting lists, a dramatically enhanced focus on recruitment is required. A root and branch review of staffing right across the mental health service is long overdue. Funding for a new recruitment drive needs to be ring-fenced. In this regard, I was very disappointed to learn that funding of €12 million identified for mental health staff recruitment is to be used in other areas of health. If the Minister of State takes one thing from my contribution to this debate, it should be that we must have a clear strategy in regard to the recruitment of key front-line staff, coupled with a budget that is ring-fenced to be used for the engagement of key staff, as identified in A Vision for Change. I wish the Minister of State well and I look forward to working with her in dealing with the area of mental health in the future.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Brassil<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T18:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_890">I congratulate both Ministers of State on their appointment and look forward to working with them on this issue, which I see as not just an issue for the Government but for every Member of the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> I will use the brief time I have available to concentrate on mental health and early intervention strategies at the education level. When it comes to mental health, prevention is better than cure. That is the reason we need to equip children at a younger age with the skills that teach them self-awareness, self-worth and resilience. The National Policy Framework for Children and Young People 2014-2020 recognises as a national aim that children should be "achieving full potential in all areas of learning and development" including "social and emotional well-being". It also states that we should be working towards "rebalancing resources to place greater emphasis on prevention and early intervention".</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Early intervention is not only cost effective in the long term, it is also the best way to mitigate risks in future behaviour and promote positive outcomes for children andyoung people. We have a duty to prepare children with the life skills to be able to face challenges in the future. Education should be holistic so we need to look at a multi-strategy health promotion project which uses a whole-school approach to promote resilience in children of primary school age. This strategy needs to link into the curriculum and one of the best ways to do that is to introduce health promotion as a compulsory subject in our schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> In the Australian curriculum, students develop personal and social capability as they learn to understand themselves and others and to manage their relationships and lives while learning more effectively. Effecting change at an early age is the best way to equip our children into the future with the skills to avoid mental distress, to recognise the signs of being unwell and to reach out for help when they are in trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> Adolescence is often described as the peak time for the onset of mental health difficulties with up to 50% of all cases occurring prior to the age of 14. This relatively early onset points to the need for early intervention to prevent difficulties. Using schools as health promotion sites poses difficulties. The induction of teachers and professional development to deliver the curriculum in this process are paramount but this in itself poses challenges. We need to look at developing a compulsory curriculum that goes beyond the formal learning process. Schools provide an important setting for this. The evidence outcomes from the Australian model reflect this and it is something that needs to be duly considered for the Irish education system. </p>
          <p eId="para_895"> We need to show immediate commitment in this area. The cuts to counselling in our schools over the past number of years need to be reversed. The spend on mental health as an overall percentage of our health budget needs to be brought in line with our EU counterparts at between 10% and 12%. GPs are inundated with problems and often have to resort to short-term medication and, as a pharmacist, I do not see that as an ideal solution. We need a holistic long-term approach. Early intervention and a new curriculum in primary and secondary school are a long-term project that will require commitment and investment but will yield results and will benefit this generation and the next generation through their entire lives. I ask the Minister to take this proposal on board in developing a new strategy for the future. If he does, it will benefit the entire population.</p>

          <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_896">I congratulate the Ministers on their appointment. We all face a challenge with regard to mental health. Every day, Deputies meet people with varying levels of mental health problems and we have come across the ultimate situation where somebody commits suicide, leaving families devastated. The question is what we can do about this problem and how we can reduce the numbers. It is very important that we apply ourselves to this task as we applied ourselves in a previous time to reduce the number of people killed on the road, which we have done quite successfully.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> We must look at every facet of this subject. One thing is certainly true, namely, that acute medicine has a much better ability to attract funding than continuous preventative medicine, which requires continuous investment without a very specific outcome. This House has to support the ring-fencing of budgets for mental health. We should also look at models of best practice. Suicide numbers have gone through the roof in the past 30 years but there may be good reasons for that. Some of it might be because of pressures in society but we must also take into account the much larger number of people who were locked up in psychiatric homes, although thankfully we do not treat these people in that way any more. We have to see whether there is a third way that does not go back to the totally unacceptable first way nor leaves us with the present situation. I have seen some examples of very good practice which are basically community based and very local. All of these require funding and there is a tendency in the system to prefer money to be spent on a certain number of procedures rather than on continuous care. The Minister has a major challenge in that regard but we also have a role to play. If we insist on all the funding going into acute care, we cannot complain when it does not go into continuous care.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> I will touch on two other issues. One is that we seem to be living in a world where bureaucracy is becoming more and more codified and where people have to conform to the code, whether that is in housing or in something else. The code becomes more important than the personal or the individual circumstances. There is an inability on the part of people to deal with all sorts of things in life, such as farm forms or housing, health and social welfare issues, while the system always wants things to be done its way. Very little discretion is given to officials even when it is clear somebody has a health issue and this is something we have to look at. We need to get back humanity and have discretion, particularly when dealing with people who quite clearly have health issues which mean they cannot deal with things in the way other people can.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> I believe in humanity and the benefits of dealing with people on their own terms. One of the great shocks I had was finding out that one cannot legally get a medical card if one has no income, which sometimes happen on account of mental health issues. Even when it is absolutely clear there is no cheating going on, people cannot get their card, which is bureaucracy gone mad. It is inflexibility gone mad. Students with problems who opt out of exams and want to go back to college are charged the full fees again. If they can prove by a certain deadline that they had a medical issue, they can avoid this but people with a mental illness often do not follow all the rubrics, instead getting themselves into a total mess. It is not just about the medical services but about society's attitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> The third issue is our large prison population as compared to 1950. I raised this issue with somebody very senior in the Prison Service and he said the explanation is that we had a huge population in mental institutions at that time. If the Minister wants to test this theory, he should go down to the female prison, the Dóchas Centre in Mountjoy Prison, where he will find many people who should not be in prison because the issues that put them there are purely to do with mental health issues, in some cases allied to drug addiction. To criminalise what is basically a medical problem is totally cruel.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy David Stanton)<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_901">I wish my colleagues well in their important work. I worked for quite a number of years as a guidance counsellor in a second level school and I also did a lot of training in counselling with the Cork social and health education project, so I have a personal interest in mental health.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">As others have already said, schools have a significant role to play in this regard. I suggest that guidance counsellors, in particular, have a fairly large role to play. The power of a significant adult in the life of a young person cannot be under-estimated. It is important to recognise that anybody - a parent, an uncle, an aunt, a teacher or a counsellor - can be a significant adult.</p>
          <p eId="para_903"> I am great believer in the role of youth services. We should be supporting Foróige, Youth Work Ireland and other youth services, including the guides and the cubs, because they perform a huge function out there. Quite often, a trained youth worker can identify a young person who is under pressure or stress and intervene to help him or her to get counselling or any other assistance that may be required. The presence of a captive audience of children who might not want to be there, or who might be embarrassed, can sometimes make programmes in schools somewhat artificial. Out-of-school informal education through youth services is very powerful and is something we should further develop. The self-esteem of young people who are involved in sport and physical activity can be improved by the camaraderie and teamwork involved in such endeavours. Similarly, we should encourage and help those involved with the President's award, Gaisce.</p>
          <p eId="para_904"> We must not forget that alcohol can play a major part in this whole area. Alcohol is a depressant, as we know. Unfortunately, it is a factor for many of the people I come across who are affected by mental illness. Many, although not all, of those who commit suicide are drunk or hungover prior to doing so. I would have a big worry and concern about the role of alcohol in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_905"> Loneliness can play a big part as people get older and are sometimes on their own. That is why we should be supporting and encouraging organisations such as Men's Sheds, which can often encounter difficulties in finding premises and places to carry out their work. It is said that men often help each other elbow to elbow or side by side. They can talk when they are working on something together. I think women can build up stronger networks, which is a strength. Men often find it difficult on their own. I think that is an area we need to focus on.</p>
          <p eId="para_906"> I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív that mental health is a continuum. We are all on that continuum. Some of us are strong at times. Every one of us can go down the other side when we are under pressure. Politicians, in particular, can be very vulnerable. We can get a lot of abuse. It is hard to take. It can be personal. I detect far more camaraderie in this Dáil. There is not as much aggression as there was in previous Dáileanna. I think we need to work together. That is happening more and more now. We are listening to each other a little better. Society needs to try to cut down on the aggression. The media have a role to play in this regard. When politicians are in the media, it can be gruelling to deal with people who want to catch us out and say "gotcha". That seems to be the approach. Rather than trying to find out what the issues are and having a proper discussion on them, some people prefer to take the "gotcha" route. I ask the media to move away from that. People need to try to move away from that. We need to focus on the positive rather than on the negative.</p>
          <p eId="para_907"> William Glasser, who was involved in reality therapy some years ago, spoke about four areas of life that we should be strong on. He spoke about the need to love and be loved, which is quite important for everybody. If one is missing that, one is in trouble. He also said we have a need for power. This involves feeling worthwhile and achieving things. Glasser's other two needs were the need for freedom and independence and the need to have fun. He maintained that a person who was not having those four needs met was in trouble. There are many different approaches to this issue. Adler looked at the outcome of behaviour as a means of explaining why someone behaves in a certain way. I could go on. Durkheim was concerned about <i>anomie</i> and withdrawal from society. There are many approaches to this issue. As someone said earlier, counselling and talking therapies are very important. Rather than going for the bottle and the pill all the time, it is crucially important to build self-esteem, self-worth and self-image.</p>
          <p eId="para_908"> As I have responsibility for equality and integration in my new job, I am conscious that mental health issues can feature strongly in debates on inequality and integration. As we have seen, some of those coming here from abroad are experiencing trauma as a result of the unspeakable things they have seen and gone through. Already this week, it has been reported that up to 900 people have drowned in the Mediterranean. That is two 747s. We are complaining about things here when these people are facing such trauma.</p>
          <p eId="para_909"> The high rate of mental health issues facing members of the Traveller community is of particular concern to me. My Department is currently undertaking a three-phase consultation process with a view to putting a new Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy in place. This will involve the development and implementation of a range of cross-cutting policy matters in order to address the issues facing the Traveller and Roma communities. One of the key issues to have emerged so far from the public consultation on the draft strategy is the high rate of mental health problems experienced by members of the Traveller community. In 2010, the all-Ireland Traveller health study showed that the suicide rate among Traveller men is seven times higher than the rate among men in the national population. The reasons for this are multifaceted. When the strategy is completed, it will address those mental health issues by way of specific actions to be implemented on a cross-departmental basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_910"> I would like to speak about the positive side of these matters as well. When I attended the Traveller Pride awards earlier today, I was impressed, inspired and moved by the array of wonderful skill, talent and dedication in the Traveller community. It was clear to me that Travellers have huge potential to contribute fully to Ireland if the barriers to their participation in society could be removed. The overall winner at today's awards was a young lad of 14 - an amazing guy - who is a world handball champion. I also met four young lads from Skibbereen who are going to do very well after making an absolutely fabulous model of one of the old Traveller barrel wagons and then deciding to mass-produce such wagons in flat packs to sell them. They cannot keep up with the orders. It is amazing. The music played at today's event was absolutely inspiring. Finbar Furey was there. There is a great deal of work to be done in the Traveller community with respect to mental health. Any group that is marginalised like that will have problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_911"> There is a huge amount of work to be done in this area. I wish my colleagues well in their work. We can make an awful lot of progress. We can start here in this House by being a bit kinder to each other. It does not cost anything to be nice. It does not cost anything to listen to people. Deputies should engage with people in a positive way rather than trying to put them down all the time. If we start by adopting such an attitude here, maybe that can permeate outside. Perhaps I am being naive or innocent but we should have a go. I am already detecting or sensing that the new Members who have come into this Dáil, and some of the older Members, are inclined to listen. Maybe it is because this is a minority Government. Perhaps we all have to listen now because we do not have what we had in the past. We have to work together for the good of everybody because everybody can contribute in a positive way. I am glad to have been able to speak in this debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_914">I am pleased to have a chance to speak on this very important and sensitive topic. I congratulate the Ministers of State, Deputies Corcoran Kennedy and McEntee, on being appointed to their respective ministerial posts. I also congratulate the previous speaker, my constituency colleague, Deputy Stanton, on his appointment as a Minister of State last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> In my constituency of Cork East, I deal on a daily basis with parents who are under great strain. Many of them have children who are waiting to be assessed to see if they have Asperger's syndrome or autism. Waiting lists for children to be assessed have spiralled out of control in my constituency. It is clear that despite the great work of the child and adolescent mental health services, they are unable to deal with the current backlog of applicants who require assessment. Parents have informed me that their children have been on waiting lists for assessment for up to 18 months. This has placed many parents under a great deal of stress. We all know that stress is one of the greatest causes of mental health illnesses. The recurring message I am receiving from my constituents is that children and their families are being messed around. A mechanism needs to be put in place to see how waiting lists for assessment for early intervention can best be reduced. Many of these children require urgent assessment, which will in turn allow them to receive the best possible treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> I recently spoke to a 47 year old man who has been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. He told me it was as if he had been given his diagnosis and then wished the best of luck.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">It is evident that the supports to those who receive diagnoses are limited, such as in this instance. We now need to provide appropriate services for all ages so that people can receive the necessary care they require.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> It is high time the Government recognised that those who suffer from mental health issues do not stop suffering at 5 o'clock in the evening. Parents and families who have children and siblings who require care will tell us that it is not a nine to five job for them. Voluntary organisations throughout the country and in my own constituency do their utmost to be on the other end of the phone 24 hours a day. However, many State services that are supposed to provide such support vanish after 5 o'clock in the evening. As as result, many volunteer organisations now find themselves under great strain because of the ever-increasing workload and limited resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_919"> We often associate the word "stigma" with mental health. I pay tribute to the mental health awareness campaign that ran through the month of May. We all had the green ribbon on and I see some of my colleagues are still wearing it today. It was a good initiative that was put in place. It is the 1916 centenary and we like to think that the words "stigma" and "mental health" do not have to be associated with each other. However, the actions of some will mean that this will be never be the case. I heard recently about a girl of 16 years of age who was taken into a hospital in Cork in handcuffs because she had tried to commit suicide. The staff and gardaí were quizzed by onlookers who were informed that it was a protocol for those situations. What would anybody in the Chamber do if we witnessed this happening to one of our loved ones? If this is the protocol, I suggest we devise a new one.</p>
          <p eId="para_920"> We all agree that this Dáil must find a new way of conducting business. I firmly believe that on the issue of mental health, the way forward is something on which this Dáil must, and can, form a cross-party consensus. I have no problem acknowledging the work that my constituency colleague, Deputy Pat Buckley, does to raise awareness on suicide, nor do I have any problem in acknowledging the work that the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, did during her term of office with regard to mental health. I am also aware of the good work that Adam Harris, brother of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, does in raising awareness for those with autism. However, there is now an onus on us all in this Chamber to develop a mental health service that is fit for purpose. I look forward to working with the Ministers to make my contribution.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Byrne<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_921">Táim buíoch do Theachta Eamon Ó Cuív as ucht a chuid ama a roinnt liom. I am delighted to be able to contribute to the debate. I already spoke on the issue of mental health in the debate on health which took place before this one. I congratulate the new Ministers of State, Deputies Helen McEntee and Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, on their appointments and I wish them well. There is a huge job of work to do on this issue in both of their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> We can all talk about what we each think is best in this sector but we must leave it to the professionals. Some very important people who are hardly mentioned in the debate at all are the psychiatric public health nurses. They do tremendous work and are certainly life-savers for some people. They are at some people's beck and call. That service is patchy throughout the country and it is one I would like to see improved on. The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, mentioned guidance counsellors. We have an agreement with Fine Gael to bring back ex-quota guidance counsellors and we want to see it implemented as soon as possible. That is very important for students at that age.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> The implementation of A Vision for Change must be given leadership. There are practical consequences throughout the country. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will know that a psychiatric unit is being moved from Navan to Drogheda, which has caused controversy. I do not want to add to that controversy. If someone tells me that it will actually improve the service for patients, I will accept it. Unfortunately, with the HSE over the years, we have been told certain things, particularly in regard to the removal of doctors. We were told it was in the best of patients but that turned out to be simply untrue. I am sceptical of that move and it needs to be better explained. Better leadership needs to be given on that issue. If it will improve the service for people who are in dire need, it will be accepted. Notwithstanding that, people parts of County Meath are worried that the move will have negative consequences. It has to be explained, at the very least.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> I assure the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, that I am not going to ramp up political pressure on that particular issue if I am satisfied it is in the best interests of patients. However, I am not yet satisfied as it has not been explained to me properly. I would appreciate a written brief from the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to explain exactly why it is happening or a meeting between the HSE and Members to explain the move and how it is in the best interests of patients. That has not happened yet. There are people who are happy to exploit any mental health issue but I am not going to do that in this case. If it is not explained to me properly, I will do everything in my power to make sure that a better service is provided in case this is simply a cutback. I note that it does involve a cutback to the number of beds in the north-east. We are told that this is what A Vision for Change recommends but nobody has sat down with Members and explained that to us. If that was done, it could alleviate the concerns. The public will accept a better service. Drogheda and Navan are not too far apart but it is a worry for people, particularly in the west of County Meath. It is incumbent on us to look at these issues carefully and strategically and to deal with them properly. We cannot always make political points, especially on this issue or on health issues in general, but nobody has made the case to me yet in regard to this move.</p>
          <p eId="para_925"> I would like to address a number of other issues that have been addressed in the debate, which has been very useful. As politicians, we have to make sure that the services are delivered. We have had very helpful interventions from a number of well-known people. Other people have come forward to say they were suffering in silence. I suspect a number of people have been suffering in silence. It is the very nature of the taboo in regard to mental health. We all know many people who suffer in silence from mental health issues. They will get the supports through their GPs, public health psychiatric nurses and, in some cases, through residential care in psychiatric hospital settings. The funding has to be there to pay for that. I do not want to see the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, having to deal with what the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, had to deal with over the past few years in constantly battling for money. Fianna Fáil has suggested a mental health authority. The purpose of it would be to ring-fence the money and to make sure the cash is available for mental health services, as promised. The money would then presumably be spent in the best way.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> Those are my thoughts. None of us has a monopoly of wisdom on this issue but I suspect that practically all of us have experience at some level or other in this area. Some people speak about it while others do not and that is their choice. Each person's choice should be respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> I wish the Ministers of State well. I am not speaking directly about the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who is only in the job a week or two but in terms of the situation in Meath, leadership is needed to explain the move because otherwise, it will become another political football where the best interests of patients are forgotten.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_928">I understood I was sharing my time with Deputy Brendan Smith. If he arrives, he can take five minutes. If not, I will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue and congratulate the Ministers opposite. The fact we have Ministers with responsibility for mental health is indicative of the fact that this is an issue that has become much more prominent in the public mind and in the minds of politicians. I recall growing up as a young man when mental health in Ireland was kept in a shrouded place. People went to hospital but it was not discussed. It was very difficult for people to be publicly acknowledged as individuals who suffered from mental health issues. Fortunately, we are getting over that now. People now recognise that mental health issues are as much a problem as any physical health issues. We need to be open about it and must get away from the past of people being embarrassed about mental health issues in the family or in respect of themselves. </p>
          <p eId="para_930"> I welcome the fact there is a change in public attitude to mental health issues. I suspect the prevalence of mental health issues is greater now than 50 years ago but that may be difficult to appraise accurately because people kept it quiet. We have pressures in our society that previous societies did not have.</p>
          <p eId="para_931"> I want to talk about pressures on a certain cohort of our people who I believe are subject to many pressures. I am talking about people between the ages of 15 and 25. The reason I refer to that group of individuals is because they are at a particularly important and consequential age in their development.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">It is an extremely important phase in somebody's progress through life, for a variety of reasons. First, people between the ages of 15 and 25, particularly at the upper end, begin to realise that life may not present the opportunities they thought it would present to them, and life may not be as productive or profitable as they thought it would be for them. In many respects, as people reach their mid-20s, they are sometimes faced with a reality check about life which may not be consistent with what their ambitions are or were. That is one reason I believe there are pressures on people between the ages of 15 and 25.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> Another reason was alluded to by the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton. It is the age when people start taking mind-altering substances. As people get older, it is probably easier to deal with substances like alcohol because they have a stability in their life but the mental development of people between the ages of 15 and 25 is fragile and frail and they are vulnerable. That is why taking mind-altering substances, consuming excessive amounts of alcohol or taking serious hard drugs that induce psychosis give rise to potential instability in people of that age. It is something we must be aware of and it is why we need to concentrate on people of that age.</p>
          <p eId="para_934"> A third reason I believe that group of people needs to be concentrated on is due to the pressures this society imposes on them. It has now become accepted wisdom that, for example, every young girl has to be intelligent, beautiful and popular and have a fantastic boyfriend - that is the message we send out from society. Similarly, every young boy who is becoming a man is supposed to be an outstanding sportsman, academically gifted and successful and is supposed to go on to become a millionaire. That is too much pressure to put onto people of that age.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> As a society, we need to start telling people of that age that they do not have to be exceptional and they are perfectly entitled to be normal. The norm in Ireland is that people are in the middle and are average and we need to respect that. We must stop putting pressure on people by saying they have to excel all the time. The reality of life, as we all know, is that the vast majority of people do not excel. The vast majority have normal abilities and cannot achieve the ambitions and overcome the pressures put on them by our contemporary society.</p>
          <p eId="para_936"> As a final point on mental health, I have recently attended funerals of people who have taken their own lives. We have to send out the message that no matter how bad mental health issues are, that cannot be an option.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanSmith" eId="spk_397">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Smith<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_937">I take the opportunity to congratulate the Ministers of State, Deputies Helen McEntee and Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, on their appointment. I spoke to each of them individually and I wish them well in the very important jobs they have ahead of them. Others have referred to the work of the former Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, and I want to echo the support for the work she did. In the previous Dáil, the former Deputy for Laois-Offaly, John Moloney, also did excellent work as Minister of State. He was particularly strong in advocating the need to implement A Vision for Change rather than just having it as a strategy. He did very good work with the Oireachtas health committee at the time, with the support of colleagues on all sides of the House. A Vision for Change, which is a 2006 strategy, now needs updating but, most importantly, it needs to be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> Mention was made earlier of career guidance and the unfortunate reduction in supports for career guidance services in second level schools some years ago, which I believe was a retrograde step. We all know of the excellent work career guidance counsellors do. In many instances, the first port of call for young, school-going students who are meeting particular difficulties is the guidance counsellor. I believe it is a service that should not be reduced and, in fact, it needs extra support. In our constituencies at the time the former Minister, Ruairí Quinn, reduced the funding and the ex-quota allocation, all Deputies met with guidance counsellors who were really committed to their profession and were doing excellent work. We knew this from the pupils who had gone through the various schools, from principals and from the wider school community. It is an area that needs support and I hope the reduction in support can be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> I represent two very rural counties. In the past two years, in particular, there has been huge pressure in regard to housing and, unfortunately, more people are coming to us every week who have lost or are on the verge of losing their home. We all know - in many instances, we have heard this from GPs and those in the general health service - that the pressures on housing are causing huge mental stress for people. At a time like this, we need to ensure there is access to counselling. A number of constituents spoke to me at the weekend to outline the huge delays in regard to being recommended by a GP to a counselling service and this has not yet been provided. The delay in being able to access that first assessment or counselling session is far too long and, unfortunately, in many instances, it comes too late.</p>
          <p eId="para_940"> I refer to the whole area of alcohol and drug abuse. Unfortunately, Cavan and Monaghan have a serious problem with addiction to heroin and other psychoactive substances. I met the Cavan-Monaghan Drug and Alcohol Service recently. It is a voluntary organisation which is given some support by the HSE but not enough. A small number of people are doing excellent work in trying to provide a service with the support of some pharmacists and GPs. The Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will be very familiar with east Cavan and part of south Monaghan. I hope we have the opportunity to have a meeting in regard to the situation in Cavan and Monaghan because that area, in particular, is facing serious difficulties. Unfortunately, it is an area that has not had the provision of a good statutory service to deal with drug and alcohol addiction. I hope it will be possible to make some progress in providing necessary services, both in terms of personnel, such as the different clinicians that are needed, and financial support for the work of the different voluntary organisations.</p>
          <p eId="para_941"> What was clearly stated to me at the meeting by people who work on a voluntary basis as directors of the association is that heroin is a serious and growing problem in the region, as are new psychoactive substances, but the level of funding they receive is nowhere near commensurate with the scale of the problem. They primarily see adults but they do their best to make a part-time counsellor available for those under 18. They also cite the lack of residential homelessness support services and note that when they are trying to help a homeless person, they have to use bed and breakfasts and hotel accommodation. This is not the most useful accommodation at such a time, when other residential services would be much more beneficial, if they could be accessed.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> These are the particular issues that need support. We want to ensure the voluntary groups that are doing excellent work are given the support they need through additional funding and through the appointment of professional personnel.</p>

          <p eId="para_943">I congratulate the two new Ministers of State, Deputies Helen McEntee and Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, on their appointment. Guím gach rath orthu ina róil nua.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> I wish to be positive and a Deputy on the Government side has asked that we be nice to each other, which is very important. It is also vital to look at why we are in this state during these statements on mental health. I have sat through all of the debates to date and I wonder why we are not holding the system to account because that is our role. A Vision for Change was introduced in 2006 but, not alone that, it was based on "The psychiatric services - planning for the future", which was published in 1984. The central recommendation at that point was a new model of mental health care but because of the slow progress over a 22-year period, it was necessary to re-look at the service, leading to A Vision for Change, which was published in 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> Therefore, there is a history to A Vision for Change. There were urgent reasons that it was brought in and there is a background to it. The 2006 document, which I have before me and which I have read in detail, as I am sure the Minister has, detailed a comprehensive model of mental health service provision for Ireland for the ensuing ten years, including providing a framework for building and fostering mental health across the entire community and providing accessible, community-based specialist services for people with a mental illness.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">We are beyond the stage of making statements in the Dáil, making positive statements or making our own suggestions, because A Vision For Change was based on the findings of an expert group established in August 2003 in recognition of the need to review long-standing policy in this area and formulate a blueprint for a modern, comprehensive, world-class service to meet the mental health challenges facing our society, not least of which is our significant suicide rate, particularly among young people.</p>

          <p eId="para_947">Last Thursday or Friday, when I first saw the motion tabled by the Labour Party it was as if the past five years had not happened. We have had a disastrous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government. We know from all of the reports and evidence from the OECD, EUROSTAT, TASC and all of those who have examined income inequality and poverty levels that income inequality has increased. Inequality rose and workers' rights were diminished as a consequence of the policies of the previous Government. We also know the wealthy and the elites were protected and cosseted by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. The poor, disadvantaged and working classes were abandoned. Workers in many companies were locked out of their jobs. From 2011 onwards, basic rights were denied to many workers throughout the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"> When I think of the previous Labour Party-Fine Gael Government and its track record on workers' rights, I recall the workers in Lagan Brick, Vita Cortex, TalkTalk in Waterford in my constituency, La Senza, Clerys, Dunnes Stores and many more companies who were denied basic rights and had to engage and sit-in protests. Guess what? They received no support whatsoever from the previous Government. They received no support from Fine Gael or the Labour Party. We had an era of sit-in protests as workers, through no fault of their own, had to occupy their places of work. This is what I remember about the Labour Party-Fine Gael Government and what happened in the past five years. We had a continuation of the neo-liberal policies of Fianna Fáil by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> We have had an election and the Labour Party got what it deserved because it betrayed the people who voted for it. True to form, after it received a lashing from the electorate having provided a crutch to one of the conservative parties, it has come back to prance about in opposition, throwing radical shapes and pretending to be different and caring about workers, their rights, equality and all of the issues it did not care about during the past five years. If anything, the motion is a good thing because it represents a long list of failures of the previous Labour Party Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_951">It is an acknowledgement of all of the things it failed to do during the past five years. I accept that the Labour Party has at least used its motion to outline all of these failures. This must be said because the Labour Party cannot come to the Chamber, present the motion and pretend the past five years did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_952"> There is a need to strengthen workers' rights. We brought forward many Bills in the past five years which sought to protect and enhance workers' rights but these were rejected by the previous Government, of which the Labour Party was a part. We have an ongoing situation whereby many trade union officials are being denied the right to access places of work to engage with their members. This is happening in many retail outlets throughout the State. The issue of right to access was not dealt with by the previous Government. Is the Labour Party now stating that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will do it, even though it already had the chance to do so? The previous Government had a massive majority but it failed to take action in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> We still do not have trade union recognition. Many companies refuse to engage with trade unions and will continue to do so. Tactical insolvency is not a statutory or criminal offence. We can wash our hands when these things happen, as was the case with Clerys, but unless we change the law and introduce legislation, nothing will happen. We are preparing legislation - similar to that which we introduced in the past - with solutions to these problems and we will bring forward. I hope on this occasion when we do so we will have the support of the party which tabled the motion yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> We must end the abuse of if-and-when contracts. This is something on which we campaigned and we tabled motions in the past which were not supported by the Labour Party. We need to combat bogus self-employment. We need to do much more. A number of reports need to be implemented. Last year, I published a report on low pay, decent work and a living wage in consultation with all parties represented on the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. I hope the report will be published, along with the Cahill-Duffy expert examination and review of laws on the protection of employee interests. These reports need to be implemented as quickly as possible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Maurice Quinlivan<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_955">I congratulate the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and I hope to work with her in the course of the lifetime of this Dáil. It goes without saying that I welcome any motion which seeks to protect workers' rights. In this instance, however, the hypocrisy of the motion is staggering. In its opening lines the motion calls on Dáil Éireann to stand up for working people and ensure employees secure a fair share of national prosperity. These are fine statements any decent person should support, but this is no ordinary Private Members' motion. It is sponsored by a party which, until recently, was a partner in the most right-wing Government since the foundation of the State. In government, the Labour Party and its neo-liberal ally, Fine Gael, went, vulture-like, after the incomes of ordinary working people and waged war on the living standards of the most vulnerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> The policy of austerity stretched beyond people's pay packets. Underpinned by a harsh and brutal right-wing ideology, funding for key public services was slashed and the State's industrial relations architecture was dismantled. The end result of five years of the Labour Party and Fine Gael in government is that across the board, in the public and private sectors, workers' pay and conditions dramatically deteriorated. The bottom line is that, when in government, the Labour Party not only failed to protect workers but consciously and deliberately introduced policies which increased levels of deprivation, inequality and in-work poverty. These policies were bad for workers and bad for society in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_957"> During this period, in television interviews, the media and its own policy document, the Labour Party repeatedly described itself as a party for work, as distinct from what Connolly intended, which is a party for workers. In the five years the Labour Party was in government we witnessed a proliferation of precarious work practices and a dramatic increase in the number of workers on so-called if-and-when contracts. We saw the decimation of unionisation and decent work practices in the construction industry and the growth of bogus self-employment practices. Under the watch of the Labour Party, the workers in Clerys, Connolly Shoes and La Senza were robbed of their livelihoods without warning, while unscrupulous, vampire-like business people stripped any available assets. Under the watch of the Labour Party, vulnerable and low-paid workers in Dunnes Stores and their trade union, Mandate, pleaded in the AV Room of Leinster House for legislation to be introduced to protect vulnerable workers from exploitative and vindictive employers.</p>
          <p eId="para_958"> After five years of the Labour Party-Fine Gael Government, Ireland has the dubious distinction of having the second highest number of low-paid workers in the OECD. On top of this, we must add the decimation of key public services, such as health, the provision of social housing and public transport. In the Ireland of 2016, people go to work and live in emergency accommodation. Workers cannot afford to go to the doctor and their children languish on waiting lists for services which are available on demand in other European countries. This is the legacy of the Labour Party to working people and the exasperated working and middle classes who have nothing more to give. When the Labour Party proposes a motion such as this on workers' rights, it can only be described as a pathetic shift in tactics from a foundering party. If the Labour Party was genuinely concerned about workers' rights, it could have supported the Sinn Féin Private Members' motion last year calling for the legal entitlement of workers to full-time work and banded-hour contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Instead, in the middle of the Dunnes Stores dispute, the Labour Party supported Fine Gael and voted against the Bill. If the Labour Party was genuinely concerned about workers' rights, it could have introduced collective bargaining legislation, compelling employers to recognise and engage with trade unions. Instead, it voted against the Sinn Féin Bill and introduced watered down legislation with the result that unions representing Tesco workers have no automatic right of access to the workplace and there is still no obligation on employers to recognise trade unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_960"> The Labour Party's new-found concern for workers is fooling nobody and can only be described as political amnesia at its best.</p>

          <p eId="para_961">In 2011 and 2012 workers from Vita Cortex in Cork city endured a sit-in lasting 161 days simply to secure the redundancy entitlements that had been agreed to between management and them. That campaign and the dignity and resolve shown by the employees during the sit-in were an inspiration not only to the people of Cork, but also to workers throughout Ireland. Unfortunately, workers having to sit in to secure basic statutory rights and redundancy to which they were entitled was a hallmark of industrial relations during the term of the previous Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_962"> The motion refers to "protecting workers in "informal" insolvencies and collective redundancies", and that is welcome. However, I recall a Sinn Féin Bill brought forward during the term of the previous Dáil, the Protection of Employees (Amendment) Bill 2012, which would have provided for ensuring redundancy payments in cases of informal insolvency and better notice periods for employees in cases of collective redundancy.</p>

          <p eId="para_964">Faraor, vótáil an Rialtas agus an Lucht Oibre i gcoinne na reachtaíochta sin ar bhonn teicniciúil. The Government and the Labour Party voted against that legislation on technical grounds. That is a pity because if the Bill had been allowed to progress to Committee Stage and perhaps strengthened and improved by amendment to the taste of the Government, the workers at Clerys and other workplaces where there were collective redundancies and informal insolvencies might have enjoyed greater protection. However, that did not happen. Workers upon being made redundant do not have adequate protections, and I urge the Minister and the Government to act on this. The German model of redundancy with payments approximate to pay and complemented by training is worth considering.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> I wish to address briefly the issue of bogus self-employment, which has been for a long time a significant issue in the building trades. However, it is creeping more and more into other forms of employment, including IT, and across many employment agencies. In January of this year the Irish Congress of Trade Unions calculated that this loss to the Exchequer is roughly €80 billion per year, or circa €680 billion since 2007. Bogus self-employment allows the company to make an illegitimate saving on tax and employer PRSI, which increases profit by roughly 11%. It has been suggested that bogus self-employment has been allowed to flourish because the system of electronic relevant contracts tax, eRCT, is a default set-up. In many ways it has consequently facilitated employers in declaring a worker as self-employed instead of the proper designation of "employee". The entitlements of the worker in general have become somewhat eroded over the past few years, but with bogus self-employments these rights are practically non-existent: no entitlement to holiday pay, sickness or maternity benefit or even pension contributions; no redundancy; no notice of termination; and no recourse when it comes to a case of unfair dismissal. These workers are entitled to the same rights as any other workers.</p>

          <p eId="para_966">As someone who represented workers under the previous two Administrations, I find it laughable that the Labour Party is talking about workers' rights. It had five years to make a difference to the lives of working people. I do not mean the difference it made when it followed Fianna Fáil's lead and cut the pay of serving public servants, I mean a real, positive difference to the lives of workers and a discernible difference to the lives of public servants for the better. I will focus my remarks on the issue of precarious work in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> Until relatively recently, I earned a living representing public servants in both the education and health sectors, so I speak from personal experience when I say that while Fianna Fáil might have been the first to introduce precarious work, it rose at a rate of knots under the stewardship of the man who now leads the Labour Party. Teachers, nurses, university lecturers, tutors, porters, child care workers - there was hardly a profession or job in the public service where the Labour Party did not facilitate the casualisation of labour, either through refusing to support mandatory union recognition or allowing Departments and agencies to issue the kind of contracts that would make William Martin Murphy blush. Sinn Féin supports mandatory union recognition for all State contracts because where the State spends money, workers' rights should be protected and upheld.</p>

They should begin the long and arduous task ahead of them by saying sorry to those workers whose rights they trampled on through the arrogance created on foot of the previous Government's majority. They should look at the result of the most recent election. They should look around them at their depleted ranks and reflect on the reason for this. It is not all about water.

          <p eId="para_975">As someone who has been a shop steward all my working life and who continues to take up workers' cases, I had to check the calendar to make sure it was not April Fools' Day when I saw this motion. After five years of Labour in government, we witnessed the spectacle of the Minister for Finance getting up to deliver the previous budget and bragging that 700,000 workers were being taken out of the USC net, meaning 700,000 workers in this State have annual incomes of less than €13,000 because of the race to the bottom that has taken place under Labour's watch. The Labour Party Deputies have some neck bringing this motion forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> I welcome and will support the Sinn Féin amendment before the House, which rightly recognises the failure of the previous Government to defend and protect workers' rights. If we do not acknowledge that at the start and know where we are coming from, we will not be able to point to where we are going. It is correct to talk about Clerys, but there have been many other cases during the past five years. Workers have been locked out of their jobs, denied wages and redundancy payments and in some cases intimidated and sacked as a result of their union membership, often by companies making handsome profits. The amendment correctly points out that we do need strong labour laws, which I support, but even Labour's motion itself exposes how divorced the party is from reality.</p>

          <p eId="para_978">It states, "[A]s economic conditions continue to improve, [Dáil Éireann] will stand up for working people". It is absolutely jaw-dropping in its ignorance. The job of a party that defends labour and workers is to stand up for working people, no matter what the economic conditions are. In the bad times there is actually an even greater need for a labour party to do that-----</p>

          <p eId="para_980">Does the Labour Party think that when Jim Larkin arrived in Dublin he turned around and said, "Do you know what, lads, I'll come back in a few years because the economic climate isn't quite right at the moment."? Of course he did not. He fought for workers because workers' rights were not granted by any noble being. Workers' rights were fought for in this State. In that respect, I salute the workers who have been engaged at the coalface of the defence of their rights, be it the Tesco workers, the Dunnes Stores workers, the Luas drivers or any of the others who have had to take this battle on. It is their struggles that will change the face of workers' rights in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> I opened a newspaper this morning and saw a piece by John Fitzgerald about the problems of austerity and the type of economics brought in by the previous Government, of which the Labour Party was part. He made the point that women workers were hardest hit. Being the lowest paid and in the most casual employment, women workers suffered most under the Labour Party's watch.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">Today, I received a phone call from a woman in my constituency. She has been on a temporary contract for the past five years doing work outsourced by an agency on behalf of the HSE. She is on a zero-hour contract, with no hope of permanency and no guarantee week to week of how many hours she will receive. She cannot get credit from a bank and when she tried to take up an educational course to increase her skills, she could not obtain a loan to pay the fees relating to it. The House should remember what the Labour Party said about college fees as well, but that is another story.</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> The practice of outsourcing and privatisation is at the heart of this race to the bottom that is under way. Outsourcing good jobs to private companies undermines workers' conditions and job security. It also undermines the efficiency of the services that are to be delivered. We could mention many examples but I will just mention that of the laundry department at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, where the HSE has systematically cut funding to on-site services and has had to alternatively outsource the latter, in a piecemeal fashion, to a private company. It is not efficient, it costs the HSE more and it undermines workers' jobs. Of course, it is no wonder that is happening when we see all of the labour activation schemes that were facilitated by the previous Government - the discredited JobBridge and Gateway programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> When we consider all of the companies that have shafted union members, it is a bit rich for the Labour Party to move this motion. I will end by referring to the Greyhound dispute. A company registered in the Isle of Man, which refused to publish the profits it made from the privatisation of waste collection, slashed the wages of permanent workers, enforced new contracts overnight without consultation, locked the workers out and blatantly hired scab labour to undermine their jobs. Labour did nothing. It is too late for that now. I fully support the Sinn Féin amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T19:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_985">I have lost count of the number of ironies evident in this Private Members' motion on workers' rights and which has been presented by the very party that participated in degrading those rights during its five-year stint in power. It is disconcerting to think that instead of standing up for labour rights, the Labour Party actually degraded workers' rights and conditions during the five years it was in government alongside Fine Gael. In fact, it is incredible the rate of degradation that occurred during the Labour Party's tenure. The labour market is unrecognisable today, just as the Labour Party, as it presents this cynical piece of work referring to working people in Ireland, is unrecognisable. Workers across Ireland deserve more respect than this mockery. Instead of presenting a list of demands in its motion, I believe workers deserve to hear an explanation as to why the Labour Party, on numerous occasions, refused to increase the level of protection for workers. Why did the Labour Party allow the disintegration of workers' conditions to occur, why did it not ensure enough resources were allocated to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court for enforcement of recommendations and why did it simultaneously cut back on income supports designed to address income security?</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> It is timely that we are discussing this motion. The trade union Unite published a report today labelling Ireland as a low-pay economy with high levels of income inequality compared to other prosperous countries. Pay increases since 2010 have disproportionately benefited higher-earning groups and Ireland was found to have the second highest level of wage inequality in the EU-15 after Portugal, with living standards 15% below the average. A striking aspect of Unite's report is that it indicates that poor pay is compounded by low levels of employer's social insurance, which means Irish workers have to pay more to access services such as health care. It dispels the myth that Irish wages are too high and uncompetitive. According to the report, both the social wage and employer's social insurance are very low in Ireland. The report also outlines the high cost of public services and low in-work supports for Irish employees. The social wage would have to more than double to even come near that of the EU-15 average.</p>
          <p eId="para_987"> That is why income security is so important but the Labour Party made drastic cuts in respect of this as well. Cuts to jobseeker's benefits, the farm assist scheme, income disregards and reductions in subsidiary allowances have affected many low-paid workers in my constituency in Donegal. Seasonal workers, in particular, have borne the brunt of these brutal cuts. These workers are reliant on social welfare payments for the parts of the year when they do not have any work at all in order to try to supplement their incomes but those payments were cut savagely when the Labour Party was in government. Budgetary cuts in 2012 have left the situation for seasonal workers even more precarious. They might work in the hotel or restaurant sector for a period and then be unemployed for much of the remainder of the year. They are obliged to rely on social welfare payments at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_988"> Ours is a low-paid economy and the Labour Party, when it was in government, subsidised low pay through the social welfare system. Today, there are over 60,000 families dependent on the family income supplement payment, which is a direct subsidy to low wages.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> Legislation alone will not tackle the culture of exploitation evident in many of our workplaces, and it will not tackle the level of vulnerability that workers suffer through exploitative practices. Enforcement, and creating an environment which obliges the employer to comply with labour law, needs to be the main part of the solution. However, employers such as Tesco have refused to even attend Labour Court proceedings. We have seen a lack of enforcement of Labour Court recommendations. The balance is tipped in favour of the employer, which is a real sign that workers' rights are at an all-time low. Many employers simply ignore recommendations. An employee would never be given this leeway so why should employers be given it? There is a lack of enforcement in dealing with employers that simply lock up the shop and walk away leaving their workers without any compensation. Those same employers then go on to set up new companies the following day and still get away without paying any of their former employees. There are many cases of this and practically all of them involve non-unionised workers who are known to be so by their employers and, therefore, are the first to be exploited.</p>
          <p eId="para_990"> The way to strengthen workers' rights is through ratifying economic, social and cultural rights. My Bill on the Order Paper, which I introduced in the past week, to seek to have these rights enshrined in the Constitution specifically would address workers' rights and the right to collective bargaining. I would hope that the economic, social and cultural rights will be recognised as a way to promote the issues we address in the Dáil today and ensure that the next time the Labour Party is in government, it will be constitutionally barred from attacking workers' rights.</p>

          <p eId="para_993">I am sharing time with Deputy Mick Barry.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> The issue before us says a lot. Everybody has expressed their outrage at the record of the Labour Party in the previous Government. To me, it is like Jekyll and Hyde. Hyde was in government and during that time, it is worth reminding ourselves that, particularly in the public sector, Labour created havoc in terms of workers' pay, allowances, pensions and workers' rights in general. That sets the trend and spills over into the private sector where employers automatically, by osmosis, feel they have <i>carte blanche</i> to start implementing all sorts of austerity measures on their workers. Why would they not? If the fish rots from the head, then there is the rotten fish on the Labour Party benches because that party started the rot in terms of workers' rights, not that we ever had very many of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> A good friend of mine died nearly two years ago. He was a union official all his life but was doing favours for people after he retired, and he asked me to complete a case for him of a migrant worker who was owed hundreds of euro in overtime payments by a well-known fast-food chain. The employer did not cough up. We waited two years for that case to come up. After Brendan died, the case came up. Frank won his case before the rights commissioner. It took two years. The employer appealed it. It took a year and a half for the appeal to be completed. He won his case again. Now the employer is refusing to pay. The only redress this migrant worker has is to take civil action in the courts. This is not protection for workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_996"> On Thursday last, Transdev, a company well known to all Members, illegally deducted 10% of wages from 180 Luas drivers. The company broke the Payment of Wages Act 1991. I read that Act again today and nowhere does it allow for employers to deduct money from workers on the back of legal trade union industrial action they have taken. Not a dicky bird was said, either inside this House or, indeed, by the leaders of the trade union movement, many of whom are members of the Labour Party, about this complete breach of legislation that is supposed to protect workers. What we need is very strong legislation. I do not believe that what is contained in the motion or legislation alone will suffice.</p>
          <p eId="para_997"> We also need tight and deep levels of trade union organisation. Last week we had a presentation from Unite in New Zealand about how it legally banned zero-hour contracts. One of the interesting points about that presentation is that Unite needed legalised access to workplaces and that was one of the first rights it went after. I very much welcome the section in the Sinn Féin amendment which states that unions must have legal access to workplaces and workers in order to represent them properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> The Government should not be let off the hook. I want to examine its amendment. It refers to upholding a strong economy and a fair society. We have never seen a more unequal society, even when the economy was much stronger under the previous Government. As the economy gets stronger under this Government, we still have gross inequality. The Government's amendment refers to a gradual negotiated repeal of FEMPI. We discussed it today and we will talk about it more in the House, given that we have put down a motion for its repeal. If somebody robbed one's house, would one tell the robber it would be okay if he or she gradually returned the money and jewellery he or she had stolen? This is what has happened. The Government has robbed public sector workers and is talking about gradually repaying them. The Government did not gradually bail out the banks or gradually cut social welfare under the previous Government. We must tackle head-on the sort of language the Government has used in its amendment to the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> The Government has said it will respect and fully support the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. The establishment of the WRC, which is very recent, included a 20% reduction in the levels of staffing in a so-called new system. The old system was already creaking with years of waiting lists and 3,500 outstanding cases. There is no sincerity on the part of the Government to deal with the question of equality, workers' rights and fairness for employees. We must tackle this head-on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> Even Margaret Thatcher, for all her notorious union bashing, gave, under legislation, the right to trade union recognition if 50% of employees were signed up. Where is trade union recognition in this country, 103 years after Larkin and Connolly led the struggle to achieve it? What successive Governments have done is outrageous. The motion does not go far enough. I support the two amendments, and not the Government amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#MickBarry" eId="spk_421">
          <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1001">I welcome the workers, trade union activists and trade union officials who are in the Visitors Gallery. Today, the union Unite published a report entitled The Truth About Irish Wages. The report shows that Ireland is a low-pay economy and has a high level of income inequality. It showed that low-paid employees constitute a disproportionate percentage of the Irish workforce compared to other wealthy European countries and that almost a quarter of Irish workers are in low-paid jobs. The report confirms what we know from other reports. Some 23.3% of full-time employees are low-paid, which is a greater percentage than in any other OECD country except the US and South Korea. In Tesco, where workers are battling wage cuts of up to €6,000 per annum, more than 1,000 workers are already so low-paid that they must survive on family income supplement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> Against this backdrop, we must consider the Labour Party proposal for a "programme of incremental increases in the national minimum wage". The national minimum wage stands at €9.15 per hour. How many years do the Deputies envisage the programme of incremental increases will take before the national minimum wage reaches 60% of median earnings, which would be slightly above €12 per hour? The AAA-PBP amendment seeks to increase the national minimum wage to €12 per hour this year, immediately, as a step towards €14 per hour by May 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003"> Workers cannot wait for years to reach 60% of the median wage, which is the European decency threshold. A worker living in Cork city, earning the minimum wage and working a full 40 hour week would earn €17,420 per year, after tax. To rent a house, he or she would need to spend €1,003 per month, 69% of his or her take-home pay. To rent a one-bedroom apartment, he or she would need to spend €748 per month, more than 50% of take-home pay. The rent increases in both sectors during the past year were greater than the increase in the national minimum wage last year. This means the increase has been more than totally wiped out by rent increases alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> The minimum wage of €9.15 per hour is way too low. The €9.65 rate which Sinn Féin advocated last year is way too low. Workers forced to survive on those wages are among the more than 80,000 workers who live in real risk of poverty, the working poor. They should not be forced to live in poverty. In any event, the rent will not wait to be paid. Today, the Irish secretary of Unite the Union, Jimmy Kelly, said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1005">Fine Gael were the main reason for diluting what the trade union movement needed [the previous] Government to do, and the Labour Party had to go in a direction that would be favourable to Fine Gael interests. So we ended up with something that is not really true collective bargaining.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">We are putting forward the idea of a statutory route to union recognition. This route must be clear, straightforward and speedy. While the situation in the UK is not perfect, it is better than we have here. The amended 2015 legislation does not go nearly far enough. We need mandatory collective bargaining, access to workplaces for union officials, space for and recognition of shop stewards, and facilities within companies that will allow the unions to go in.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> Last night, the leader of the Labour Party said Sinn Féin and the Trotskyists had a critique but no solution. Sinn Féin can speak for themselves. I find it ironic that the founder of the Labour Party, James Connolly, was an admirer of the 1905 Russian Revolution led by Mr. Trotsky himself. We will not take any lectures on workers rights from the party that introduced JobBridge. We ask the House to support the AAA-PBP amendments. We will support the Sinn Féin amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1009">I am delighted to have time to speak on this. During the past weeks we were mixed up about which groups were trying to get time. I wish comhghairdeas to the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor and the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Breen. I wish them well in their portfolios. I thank the Minister for engaging with me on a very sad issue in Tipperary in which workers were treated appallingly after a recent closure. I thank the Minister's office for engaging and arranging a meeting with the IDA and Enterprise Ireland. It is a tús maith, a good start. Every person's job is very important to that person and his or her family.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> I have been a small employer since 1982 and understand some of the vagaries. I have an excellent workforce and have had a good relationship with my employees through many years. Some have left, some have returned and some have gone to greener pastures. No business could function without a very skilled, willing and able workforce. There must be respect, and it works both ways. Employers must respect employees in what they ask them to do. I am in a service industry and my employees must respect the customers with whom they engage. It works both ways; it is a two-way street.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> While I see where the Labour Party is coming from with the motion, as a small employer I am unable to support it, given that we must make haste slowly. In a recovering economy, which everybody tells us about - some of the messages we received during the election were misleading - the growth is very delicate and must be nurtured. We must examine it from all aspects and try to nurture it along. Other speakers have spoken on this, as they are entitled to, and demanded that we jump to the new level immediately. However, it is not easy. They got the increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> We must also be very careful regarding the taxation system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">It is one thing to give a wage increase but in some cases, as has happened in past, it puts an employee over a certain income limit and into a higher PRSI bracket. A detailed examination of this area is required. In such cases employees bring home less money than they had before they got their wage increase. That is a farce. We must examine the taxation system. We must have an incentive in the system for people to work and it must be rewarding for them to work. It must be based on the premise that they have to get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. People must be enabled to go to work. It costs money to go out to work. They have to travel, they need work attire and must have many other needs met to go out to work. I salute the many employees who go out to work and keep this country functioning day in, day out, many of them working in this House, in other buildings and in other areas of the public service. They provide a tremendous service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> There have been many cuts, taxes and attacks on people's incomes and many pressures as we well know. Workers have commitments and have to provide for their families and pay rent or a mortgage on their homes. They have had to cope with the high cost of property, and rent allowance was the subject of a major debate during the term of the previous Government but, thankfully, in this programme for Government something is being done about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015"> I urge caution on this important issue. I have no truck with or respect for the likes of Tesco and such companies. The Acting Chairman might tell me I should not mention names but it is obvious that there are issues in that company and the granting of zero-hour contracts is totally unfair to workers. There are many other big chains. We saw what happened in a flagship company in O'Connell Street.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> There have been many cases, as happened in a company in Tipperary two weeks ago, where the workers came to see me six or seven weeks ago and told me they were concerned about their jobs, but they were kept in the dark and not told anything. I could not get any engagement with the company or through any of my Oireachtas Member colleagues. The workers were then called to a meeting of a Tuesday at 12.30 p.m. to be told that they would have their P45s on Thursday. That is disgraceful treatment of any worker. Some of those employees were with that company for 36, 40 and 43 years. They had given a great number of years service and were a dedicated workforce. That type of practice cannot be allowed. We need a strengthening of legislation and the competition authority and other areas need to be stronger to stop takeovers and mergers that are only done for one reason, namely, to make profit and to try to get rid of the workers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1023">I very much respect what the Labour Party is seeking to achieve in its motion before us. I always saw my role as a public representative as one where if I could put money into the pockets of the people I represent, that is what I would like to do, and the same would go for other Members, but I would want to do that in a practical, sensible and affordable way. Like Deputy Mattie McGrath, I must declare that since 1985 I have been a small employer. I have a number of different businesses on the go and I have been fortunate to have very good people working with me over many years. All I try to do at all times is to keep those small businesses going, and to do that I must balance everything. It is all a balancing act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> Businesses face a number of problems. One is insurance costs. My insurance costs for public liability and other areas have increased by 44% in the past 12 months. With respect to there being a hike in wages, I would be delighted if an employer could afford to do that, and if an employer is making money, he or she would be delighted to pay such an increase, but if an employer cannot make money, they cannot pay such an increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025"> I come from County Kerry where tourism is one of the major employers. There are big hoteliers in Killarney who are big employers. They tell me that if there was an immediate hike in employment costs, they might not manage to pay their employees' wages. We have to balance everything. On the one hand, we desperately want to ensure employees have enough money to raise their families, pay their bills and cover the cost of the payments on their houses, but we cannot hit the employer in a way that it will not be manageable for him or her to keep their business doors open. Without the small business, the corner shop, pub or restaurant, we are going nowhere. We must foster an environment that those people will be able to create employment. I know it is populist to say that it would be great if employees could be paid €15 an hour straight into their hands. We would all be delighted if that could be done, but is that profitable or achievable?</p>

          <p eId="para_1029">The Government party Members are ordinary people the same as I am and I ask that they take account of employees' household costs. If the Government during the next six, 12 or 18 months could find ways to reduce the costs and burdens on families, that would be another way to assist families to balance their budgets. A great deal of extra taxes and burdens have been imposed on families and if, through one method or another, they could be reduced, that would be another way to increase the families' household incomes. The Government has to examine such issues to try to assist struggling families in particular.</p>

          <p eId="para_1031">Yes. We will share on the basis of four minutes, four minutes and two minutes, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032"> I would like to start by setting out what we would like for workers. There is a good deal of detail in and much merit to the motion. We want people to be able to work for a week and earn enough money to lead a dignified life, that they can work with security in their job, with certainty that they will have a job, that their hours will not be changed around, and that they will be treated with respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033"> The Social Democrats are committed to supporting the phased introduction of a living wage based on the real cost of living; on banning zero-hour contracts; on addressing the prevalence of if-and-when contracts, as identified in the University of Limerick study; in supporting the ICTU charter, including the right to representation and collective bargaining, respect, equality and ethics at work and fair public procurement; and in closing the quite outrageous legal loophole in company law that lets a company split its obligations to its staff from the assets of the company, which is what we saw happen in Clerys. That should not be allowed. It needs to be remedied and I hope it is one of the issues the Minister is seeking to address quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034"> The two big problems that this motion seeks to address are as follows. The first is the divide between how much money many workers are left with in Ireland at the end of the week or the end of the month and how much it costs to lead a dignified life in this country. The second is the increasing lack of security and certainty being faced by many workers and their families due to factors such as the rise in the prevalence of zero-hour contracts. We need to address these issues but we also need to do much more. We need to reduce the cost of living. It costs 20% more to live in Ireland than it does in Europe on average. Our child care fees are the second highest in the European Union and are now over one quarter of an average family's income. Insurance costs have gone up by about one third in the past year. Rents in my constituency have gone up nearly 10% in the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">All of these rises are impacting harshly on living standards, in particular for low and middle-income families with young children. They undermine the ability of many people to make ends meet. Simply cutting taxes or increasing the minimum wage will not address the cost issue. In fact, cutting taxes is likely to increase the cost of living in the country. If we aspire, as we should, to a country where everyone has enough money on finishing a week's work for his or her family to lead a dignified life, we must reduce systematically the cost of living. It is just too expensive to live in this country. The other thing reducing the cost of living would do would be to greatly reduce the need for social transfers. There is massive wage inequality in Ireland, second in the EU, which is averaged out through huge social transfers. That is not how it should work. People should be able to work for a week, take their wages and lead decent lives. They should not be reliant on these social transfers. Indeed, their counterparts in other countries are not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036"> The Social Democrats consider that a great deal needs to be done in terms of the issues laid out in the motion. We also need to look at the cost of living and we must look at the costs of doing business. We must address them all to get to a position where people can lead dignified lives based on what they earn.</p>

          <p eId="para_1037">I welcome the fact that we are having this debate but it comes just months after the Labour Party left government when so many of the things it is seeking now could have been implemented. One cannot but notice that. We watched with dismay over the past five years when things like JobPath, JobBridge and various other activation schemes were introduced. While there is a place for internships, there was evidence of job displacement. Indeed, the MOMENTUM scheme was scrapped mid-stream which left a lot of people between things. It was as if people were being used as guinea pigs. Many schemes were exploited and some replaced real jobs. The whole area of JobPath is a real problem. It has failed in the UK but the same people are employed to come in here notwithstanding the likelihood that it will fail here too. Zero-hour and never-never contracts have created a culture where it has become almost acceptable to treat people as chattel, use them when and if needed and discard them at will. Individuals and families are in the position of not knowing from one day to the next what their income is going to be, what they will require in relation to child care or if they will have a job at the end of the day. The social protection system is being used in many cases as a subsidy for some employers. It can be argued that it is very unfair to employers who do not seek that and pay better wages.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038"> The manifesto of the Social Democrats set out a requirement to introduce a living wage based on the real cost of living determined in consultation with the living wage campaign and employers. We called for a ban on zero-hours contracts as well as mechanisms to address the growing prevalence of if-and-when contracts. A society's success is based on the security of its citizens, but how can people feel secure if they do not know from one hour to the next if they have a job or not? The construction sector has seen the issue of bogus self-employment. For years, the construction sector worked under arrangements like C2 contracts and when the crash came, this group ended up being very exposed with little or no entitlements due to that arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039"> We have to take the long view on those kinds of areas. There must be protections. The living wage is vital but so too is addressing the cost of living as has already been said. We have proposed the introduction of a series of measures which would reduce the cost of living. A static wage is of little use if the costs of housing, energy, insurance, child care, etc., continue to go out of control. We welcome any and every initiative to protect and support workers, but talk is one thing. The Labour Party was in government and it would have meant an awful lot more when its members talked about these things had they actually done something about it when they were in that position. Clearly, talking about it in opposition is a very different thing given where they have come from.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1040">I am very happy on behalf of the Green Party to support the Labour Party motion. I will set out a couple of thoughts in the few short minutes I have. We live in a world where capital moves quickly. It can move from one part of the world to another in the blink of an eye and without any real controls. There is completely free movement of capital. In that same world, labour and migration are slow. It is not that easy to move. There is not the same speed. There is a negotiating power imbalance whereby the speed of capital gives it excessive power over labour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041"> From a Green Party perspective, I would bring in a third factor of production, which is natural capital, because that is static. The main message I want to get across is that natural capital and labour are natural allies in that world in terms of seeking to put a damper on the power of capital and to regulate such as to bring a greater return to labour and protect natural capital. As David Begg said at a recent climate gathering, there are no jobs on a dead planet. There are thousands of well-paid jobs in the green transition we need to make. We must ensure that it is a just transition and, in that spirit, we are happy to support the Labour Party motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042"> We must be cognisant of what is happening in the European Union and within our currency union. We look at what has happened to Germany as an example of that imbalance. German economic success is very real. Germany is able to trade in a global economy, but it has done so by increasing the retained earnings of companies and by not giving a fair share to labour. If one looks at the global situation, that has happened across the board. There has been an ever-increasing return to capital and a decreasing return to labour. That needs to stop. We must end zero-hour contracts and precarious working conditions. We can do so in a way that maintains our competitiveness. To do so is in tune with the way the world is going. The old way has to end.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanKelly" eId="spk_439">
          <from>Deputy Alan Kelly<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1043">I am proud to speak on behalf of the Labour Party in supporting our motion to enhance the rights of workers and to provide greater employment protections for those in precarious and low-paid work. I welcome the former Clerys workers, including Susie McGowan, and our trade union brothers and sisters who are present as well as those from Labour Youth, including Grace Williams, who led a campaign on this issue. They also led a petition to the Minister today albeit I had hoped she would give them more time. In future, she might facilitate that. I also welcome my SIPTU colleagues from the security and contract cleaning industries who helped to negotiate the new employment regulation orders which came into force last October and which have helped a great many people. I wish both Ministers well in their new roles and I say that sincerely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044"> The foundation of the Labour Party in Ireland was inextricably linked with the trade union movement and we have argued throughout our history that the best means of strengthening the hand of workers and their unions is through co-operation of both organised and political labour. This means that we have been unswerving in our support for workers both in government and in opposition. I call on every Deputy in the House to support the motion because it is the right thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045"> "The longer the picket, the shorter the strike" is a common adage among trade union members and it refers to the solidarity between workers from all sectors and their representatives, standing together against abusive employment practices. Today, myself and my Labour Party colleagues reaffirm our commitment to the cause of working people across Ireland. The Labour Party's last term in government was marked by the economic collapse inherited from our predecessors in which more than 250,000 workers lost their jobs. We also governed against a background where collective bargaining rights were being curtailed across Europe and where there existed a significant downward pressure on wages in already low-paid sectors, not least as a result of Fianna Fáil cutting the minimum wage before leaving office. It is remarkable then that during the Labour Party's term, we increased the minimum wage on two separate occasions, instituted collective bargaining rights, re-established joint labour committees and provided much-needed protections for workers by way of sectoral employment orders and registered employment agreements.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046"> We also established a commission to examine low pay. We call on the Government to act on that commission's recommendations quickly. In addition, we began to tackle so-called zero-hour and if-and-when contracts to end the cycle of precarious work among the low paid. It is also a credit to our party that despite the economic turmoil in which we toiled for the first few years of the previous Government, there was not a single mandatory redundancy in the public sector. Our efforts and record on workers' rights speak for themselves. Our dignity at work agenda was evident in every decision that we made over the five years, which is why it is so outrageous that the current programme for Government pays little more than lip-service to the rights of working people. Why is there no Minister for labour affairs? Was the role just forgotten? Is the reason for the environment Department being forgotten similar? Workplace issues form just two paragraphs in the entire document.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047"> It is undoubtedly true that with the Labour Party in government, the economy revived. Unemployment fell from 15% to below 9% and currently more than 1,000 jobs are being created each week. However, stronger economic growth should not mean a race to the bottom in workers' conditions. This is why the Labour Party supports the living wage initiative. We would increase the minimum wage in Ireland to €11.50 per hour and ensure that workers on low pay could live and not simply survive. A rising cost of living necessitates that wages move upwards and work pays in every instance. We call on the Government to commit to introducing a living wage, thereby leading the way on progressive work practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048"> The House will remember the Taoiseach's pledge that Ireland would be "the best small country in the world in which to do business". The Labour Party's ambition is much broader, encompassing the whole of civil society and in keeping with our traditions as a social democratic party. Our ambition is for an Ireland where work is rewarded and pays and where working people benefit first from any economic prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049"> The old model of trickle-down economics has failed and it is incumbent on us all as legislators to recognise this. It is difficult to believe that despite the Lock-out occurring more than a century ago, there exists a cohort of employers willing to exploit their staff and undermine their conditions. The Clerys workers, who are present, were abandoned by the new owners of their store without notice, an example of vulture capitalism where profit supersedes human dignity at every level. It was a disgrace. The workers had been mainstays of Clerys for decades and were shown damn all respect in the termination of their employment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1051">We call on the Government to legislate for the protection of workers in these "informal insolvency" and collective redundancy situations. Tesco is seeking to rewrite the contracts of some of its workers without adequate justification or the agreement of their representatives. I welcome that Tesco has recently chosen to negotiate with Mandate as the representative body of the workers where others have failed to do so but the industrial relations mechanisms of the State must be strengthened to ensure that employers are compelled to engage with unions on every level. In the aforementioned instances of Clerys and Tesco, as well as in disputes with Dunnes Stores, Greyhound waste disposal, La Senza and the Paris Bakery, Labour Party members, activists and trade unions have stood in support of workers fighting to vindicate their rights, not simply as units of labour, but as human beings deserving of decent conditions and protections.</p>

          <p eId="para_1053">Further, it is my fundamental belief as a former SIPTU shop steward that people have a right to feel safe and secure in their workplaces. The Government must legislate to provide statutory redress for the victims of workplace bullying.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054"> I wish to highlight the rights of workers beyond PAYE employees. We must support small businesses, local enterprises and the self-employed but this sector is being hampered by bogus self-employment, which is diverting much-needed Government support away from legitimate work and towards an exploitation of loopholes in our taxation system. We must tackle bogus self-employment to ensure that the resources of the State are put to work in the best interests of taxpaying, law-abiding citizens. This problem is not prevalent in the construction industry alone but also in the IT industry and it is beginning to occur in the education industry and elsewhere. Freelance workers, such as journalists, deserve the protections that union recognition brings. As such, we are calling on the Government to extend collective bargaining rights to freelance workers in recognition of the unique role that they play in society. We in the Labour Party are committed to combating the casualisation of work and will pressure the Government to enhance the rights of workers every step of the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055"> We often discuss new politics in the Chamber. I thank those who will support the Labour Party's motion. It is a shame, therefore, to read the amendment tabled by Sinn Féin in opposition to our motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_1092">Just yesterday, I met a number of former Clerys workers. To be honest, their resolve for justice should be an inspiration to each and every Deputy in the House. It is with these workers in mind that I hope we can all agree that such a situation should never be allowed to occur again. It is in the spirit of the supposed new politics that I call on all sides of the House to engage meaningfully with and consider the Labour Party's motion and to send the message out to unscrupulous employers that the people of Ireland will not stand for any attempt to undermine the pay and conditions of workers. In an effort to build a genuinely decent society, we must protect the vulnerable and low paid against greed and profiteering. We must stand up for a workers' republic.

          <p eId="para_1103">It is a fact that Sinn Féin has associated with political movements and parties across Europe that have inflicted damage on the conditions of workers, their levels of employment and their wages. Every time that any Member on the Government or Opposition benches draws attention to what the reality of Sinn Féin's policies would be if implemented elsewhere in Europe or, as it wants, in Ireland, what we get from Sinn Féin is a constant attempt to barrack that Member. We have just seen it meted out to Deputy Kelly and we have seen it meted out to other speakers. At a time when there appears to be a growing demand and thirst for new politics, surely it should be a basic requisite to listen with at least the appearance of respect to different opinions in Dáil Éireann.</p>

          <p eId="para_1105">I listened to Deputy Alan Kelly’s contribution. </p>
          <p eId="para_1106"> I want to speak about the public wage element and the consequences for civil and public service unions, their members and people working in services. I listened with great interest and care to what the Deputy had to say and was struck by his omission of any reference to the Lansdowne Road agreement. If it was at the start of his contribution, I missed it. I was struck, however, by his description of the achievements of the Labour Party in the last Government. They were achievements. One achievement that was absent in the Deputy's list and which is absent from the Labour Party motion is the Lansdowne Road agreement, in the delivery of which the former Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, played the lead role. That cuts to the core of why the Government has reservations about the motion and cannot support it in its entirety. There are many elements with which I agree entirely, but I cannot support the motion fully because of the consequences for the Lansdowne Road agreement. We have in place a three-year agreement with many unions, although I acknowledge not all of them. The TUI recently voted to be inside that framework. The reason I regretfully find myself unable to support the motion in its entirety is the consequences of the passage of the motion for the agreement, the people who voted for it and are party to it, and the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107"> Let me reiterate the objectives the Labour Party is describing in the motion. I am sure it was an accident, but Deputy Alan Kelly was selective in the quotations he ascribed to the Taoiseach. Of course, he made reference to the economy, but he also made reference to the fact that this was a country in which one could grow old gracefully. He stated it was the best country in which to bring up one’s family. An essential element of this is ensuring workers are treated with the respect they deserve. I acknowledge the contribution the trade union movement has made in this regard. It and its leaders, at a time of great difficulty for the country and a time of near collapse, played their role in leading the country and economy forward. We now need to ensure this leadership results in an opportunity for renewal for workers, their families and communities. I look forward to working with union leaders and Members of the House to deliver the objectives of the motion, if not the detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108"> I would like to end on a point of detail concerning figures for those who work in the civil and public services. They may be of interest to some who have pointed to issues concerning how we employ and pay people. I refer to the number of workers working in the civil and public services whom we judge to be earning less than the living wage. The information we have in this regard is that if a living wage is €11.50 per hour which equates to an annual salary of approximately €20,000 based on a 37-hour working week, some 94% of those who work in public services are on an annual salary in excess of that figure. Despite what many say and have claimed, successive Governments have a good track record in ensuring those who work in the civil and public services are well rewarded. As a result of the of the awful shock and trauma the country went through, that has changed, but we now have in place an agreement, the Lansdowne Road agreement, and an arrangement with the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court to deal with it and ensure it is implemented in its entirety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109"> I wish to talk about what public pay policy will be. It builds on much of what has been achieved. Many of the principles informing future policy are captured in the current Lansdowne Road agreement and have two separate elements. The first requires us to acknowledge that, where there is a demonstrated need, front-line staff numbers will be increased in a targeted and sustainable manner. One should consider the track record of the last Government, of which I was privileged to be a member, and the new Government which is seeking to build on the progress made. We see that, in many cases, the number of people working in the civil and public services is returning to the kind of number in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Where there is still a gap, as in An Garda Síochána, as we acknowledge, we have a plan in place to address it. The overall framework through the Lansdowne Road agreement puts in place a three-year agreement, cumulatively worth €844 million, that offers the Government our only opportunity to reconcile the understandable wage needs of those who work in public services and the need of citizens in general to receive public services on which they depend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110"> With regard to what will happen in the future, as the House is aware, there is a commitment in the programme for Government to establish a pay commission. I intend to consult stakeholders associated with the Lansdowne Road agreement in the coming weeks on the establishment of that body. This may provide a vehicle to address some of the matters being raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111"> I acknowledge and support much of the content of the motion. I agree with the objectives, but I must point to the basic incompatibility between some elements of the motion and the very agreement the Labour Party played a leading role in creating and in which I will play a role in its implementation.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (Deputy Pat Breen)<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1112">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the motion as Minister of State with responsibility for employment and small business. I remind the former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, that I have taken up the same position as his former colleague in this area, Senator Gerald Nash. These responsibilities were assigned to me this afternoon and I look forward to working in this area. I compliment the former Minister of State on the work he did in the Department and wish him well. He is in the Visitors Gallery, having taken up his new role in Seanad Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113"> Let me reiterate the Government's support for a social economy model to deliver a strong economy and a fair society. This is a fundamental goal of the Government and underpins the many positive proposals set out in the new programme for a partnership Government. The maintenance and improvement, where possible, of strong protections for workers have been and will continue to be a key element of Government policy as we seek to build on the progress made in recent years in our economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114"> As Minister of State with responsibility for employment and small business, I have a particular interest in and have been heartened by the recent CSO figures on employment. It is very encouraging to see job creation continue on a steady, upward curve and unemployment levels continuing to fall. Furthermore, the figures are showing that the improvement in employment levels is spreading across the economy and, importantly, the regions. According to the most recent CSO quarterly figures, employment has grown in 12 of the 14 economic sectors, while the unemployment rate fell in all eight regions in the year to quarter one of 2016. The regional Action Plan for Jobs initiative which was launched in February 2015 aims to build on these positive results. Action plans have been developed and published for each of the State's eight regions. Each action plan identifies a range of actions to be taken in the period 2015 to 2017 aimed at facilitating each region to achieve its economic potential and raise its employment levels. The focus is on implementation of the eight plans and implementation committees have been established in each region. The first progress reports will be completed and published in quarter three of 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_1115"> The latest CSO figures show that the number of casual and part-time workers is continuing to fall. In the year to April 2016, the number of such workers fell by 8.3%, or, in real figures, 5,798. This is particularly relevant in the context of this debate and the concerns expressed by some speakers about the increasing casualisation of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116"> Also noteworthy is the strong downward trend in the figures for part-time underemployment, which declined to 99,100 in the first quarter of 2016 from a high of more than 150,000 in 2012. This is a positive trend as it shows significantly fewer people are in a position where they would accept more work if was available. This good news is an indication that more people are in a better position in terms of their hours of work and earnings. This is not to argue that there are not challenges to be addressed in terms of, for example, the issues raised in the University of Limerick study on zero-hour and low-hour contracts. The Minister explained last night the position in respect of our response to the study. This issue comes within my remit and it is one in which I will take a special interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117"> I would like to comment on a specific issue addressed by the Minister last night and raised by almost all speakers during the debate, namely, the position of the former Clerys workers. Many of these workers were in the Visitors Gallery last night and I welcome them back to the House tonight. I am aware of the dignified campaign they have pursued since the closure of Clerys last year. This was brought home to me and the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor last night. I also understand the workers' motivation is to try to ensure that what happened to them must never happen to others workers. We should stand firmly behind them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1118"> I commend Senator Gerald Nash on the work he did when he was a Minister of State with responsibility for this area. The Government is committed to continuing the work initiated under the previous Administration in responding to the issues surrounding the closure of Clerys. The Duffy-Cahill report is a key element of this response. The report presents a comprehensive analysis of the relevant provisions of employment and company law. It makes a number of proposals for reform of the law, the focus of which is to ensure employees will have the opportunity to consult their employer for a period of not less than 30 days before any collective redundancy takes effect, including in circumstances where the employer is insolvent or solvent and where decisions are being made on an asset of significant value by a person related to the employer, which will lead to collective redundancies. The experts also propose increased sanctions for failure to respect the 30 day consultation period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119"> The report proposes a number of other reforms to employment law designed to ensure limited liability and corporate restructuring are not used to avoid a company's obligations to its employees. The experts stress that the various proposals they make need to be considered in conjunction with each other, as no single proposal will provide solutions to the issues in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120"> As the Minister informed the House last night, a public consultation on the report was launched earlier this week. I remind all interested parties that the consultation period will be short as the closing date is 17 June. It is important, therefore, that those who wish to make a submission on the report do so within the next two weeks. In this respect, my Department has drawn up a consultation document to assist interested parties in responding to the report. The document is available on the Department's website. I urge all concerned, including the small business sector, to respond to the consultation. I also urge interested parties to address the specific questions raised in the consultation document. This will help in our consideration of the report and in presenting proposals to Government with a view to agreeing the actions to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121"> I assure the House of the Government's commitment to build on the progress made in recent years in returning more people to work, reducing unemployment and improving the living standards of all. In pursuing these goals we remain committed to maintaining and improving the protections for all workers, the most vulnerable in particular.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_495">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1122">Recently, the economist, Dan O’Brien, noted that the economy has increased employment more in the past four years than in the 70 years from 1926 to 1996. It would be sad if we in Ireland failed to learn from the near death experience of eight years ago. For this reason, I urge the parties in this Chamber to engage in new politics and support the concrete set of proposals by the Labour Party to improve the lives of working people. The motion calls for increases to the national minimum wage until it is pegged at 60% of median earnings, a living wage of €11.50 per hour to be adopted throughout the public sector, further protections for vulnerable workers in precarious employment, and an end to exploitative employment contracts that foster increased casualisation of workers, including bogus self-employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123"> F. Scott Fitzgerald famously observed that the rich are different. We were cruelly reminded of this one year ago when the new owners of Clerys maintained a Zen-like silence while the company's workers were casually dispossessed of their livelihoods with minimum notice. This was predator capitalism working as social vandalism. If there was a blot on the recent 1916 commemorations in O’Connell Street, it was the spectre of the famous Clerys building shrouded and dead, a death created by a series of clever corporate moves both onshore and offshore, with hundreds of workers and concession holders thrown out on the street. </p>
          <p eId="para_1124"> In 2008, Ireland endured the worst economic crisis in the history of the State, the collapse of the banks and construction industry and the loss of 330,000 jobs. A major response was needed and the Labour Party in government made this response. We now see a dramatic recovery and growth in employment. Without a doubt, raising workers' wages and living standards is central to recovery and that is the purpose of motion before us. The Labour Party wants everybody who wants a job to have a job but we also want good pay and conditions. </p>
          <p eId="para_1125"> An early American President, Andrew Jackson, once stated we should measure the health of our society not at its apex but at its base. As no less a body than the International Monetary Fund stated, if the income share of the top 20% in a country increases, economic growth declines over the medium term. By stark contrast, the IMF found that an increase in the income share of the bottom 20% will fuel higher growth. This echoes similar findings by the OECD. If workers earning between €20,000 and €30,000 receive €2,000 or €3,000 extra per annum, they will spend most of it in the local economy. However, if someone on €120,000 per annum is given another €20,000, he or she may save it because he or she will not need to spend it. This underlines the reasons that tackling low pay and insecurity at work and protecting vulnerable workers is the most prudent and sensible form of economic management. </p>
          <p eId="para_1126"> In January last, Luca Visentini, the General Secretary of the European Trade Union Confederation, ETUC, addressed the Institute of International and European Affairs on the topic of boosting economic growth and relaunching the social model. Mr. Visentini referred to Ireland as a positive experience and stated: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1127">The ETUC recognise the Irish example has become a positive benchmark for all the countries in Europe since here trade unions and social partners have managed to restore the industrial relations, minimum wage systems and what was completely destroyed by the troika intervention in the past. We really appreciated what the Irish trade unions and social partners were able to do in the last couple of years and we discuss a lot about this positive experience because this could really be an example for other countries. </p>
          <p eId="para_1128">New politics tonight is about supporting this motion. I call on the parties and Independent Deputies to support progressive politics. It stands to reason that a wage-led recovery will increase confidence in Ireland and support the growth of small business because people will have more money in their pockets to spend in their local shops and businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1129"> In so far as the Government amendment is concerned, I welcome the commitment to at least review the application of the living wage within the public service and encourage its adoption across the economy. </p>
          <p eId="para_1130">We could go further faster and Labour will keep a careful eye on what the Government does to deliver on this commitment. It is long past the time when the Government can simply and blankly repeat that it will, at some stage, respond to the University of Limerick study on zero-hour and low-hour contracts. When and how will it respond? Does the Government accept the report or not?</p>
          <p eId="para_1131"> On the Clerys issue, the Government amendment reads as if the Duffy-Cahill report had not been published weeks ago or as if nobody on that side of the House has read it yet. The Clerys workers and other vulnerable employees are entitled by now to more than soothing non-committal generalities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132"> The most recent figures from the CSO show that unemployment is at its lowest level - 7.8% - since the crash. The rate of unemployment has been halved from when the Labour Party took office in 2011 until it left office a few weeks ago. The rate of youth unemployment has also been halved and employers are again recruiting young people from universities, colleges and other educational institutions throughout the country. We want to make Ireland a more attractive place in which to live and to create a more prosperous society. Therefore, supporting this motion is one of the key pieces in the jigsaw to building a better Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1133"> I worked closely with the trade unions during my period as Minister. With the help of Kieran Mulvey and Unite, I was delighted to be able to do justice by the Waterford Glass workers in finally getting their pension entitlements paid after the issue had spent many years before the European courts. That was an important injection of cash and confidence for the economy of a city which was very depressed and which is still recovering. I also want to thank SIPTU for its input into issues such as this. I stood with the workers at the Paris Bakery and sorted out their redundancy payments. I did not look for publicity for that. I did the same in the case of Vita Cortex workers. The Labour Party totally reformed the redundancy system from one where, after the crash, people were obliged to wait from two to four years for redundancy payments to one where those who are made redundant or, worse still, caught up in cases of insolvency, will get their money relatively quickly. I specifically thank SIPTU and its general officers in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1134"> When Clerys closed down and threw people out, there was not even a place in which to meet the workers to go through their social welfare entitlements, with some dignity, and get them their insolvency and redundancy payments. Members will recall that many of these workers, some of whom I know personally, had been employed by Clerys for 46 years. This was not just their workplace, but their family and their life. I will never forget that SIPTU and people such as Jack O'Connor, Gene Mealy and Joe O'Flynn made rooms available to the Department of Social Protection on one of the floors in the SIPTU offices to allow people to sort out their personal affairs regarding their insolvency entitlements with dignity and in privacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135"> I am aware that for many right-on political people, stuff like this does not always matter, but to me it does. It continues to matter that we always treat people at work with the dignity they are entitled to and it matters that they get the entitlements to which they are legally entitled.</p>

            <p eId="para_1429">That was terribly efficient; it was like a nightclub at 2 a.m. for a moment. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his forbearance on this Adjournment matter, which was tabled last week but directed to the incorrect Department. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for taking the issue and I congratulate him on his appointment. The purpose of this Adjournment debate on insurance premiums is primarily to highlight something which has been in the public domain for several months following annual increases in insurance premiums across the board. The CSO's consumer price index for April of this year shows that, across many different sectors, the cost of insurance premiums has increased in the past month and the past year. Nowhere is this increase more evident than in the motor car insurance sector, where in the 12 months up to April 2016, there was a 34.5% increase. In fact, there was an increase of 3.4% in insurance relating to motor cars in the month between March and April 2016 alone. Many questions must be asked of the insurance industry as to how it can justify such an increase in one year alone. It is difficult to believe it is plausible that such an increase benefits the consumer impacted, and for this reason I believe it is warranted that the Government establish an investigation, primarily through the Department of Finance, into the insurance industry in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430"> While the motor insurance sector has seen the most significant increases in the past year, it must be noted that, from what I could determine, all insurance categories, apart from health and travel insurance, increased. Health insurance decreased by 0.5%, which is negligible, and travel insurance decreased by almost 6%. Insurance connected with the dwelling rose by 10%, motor car insurance increased by 34.5% and motor cycle insurance increased by 6%. On the basis of the increase in insurance costs, it would be wholly justified for the Government to establish an investigation into the insurance sector. This could be done by the Department of Finance, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, and I will leave this matter for the Minister of State to determine. We must ensure that customers get the best value for money while receiving comprehensive protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431"> The question must be asked as to whether insurance companies are operating like a cartel. For example, in 2015, Aviva Ireland had its best performance in five years, according to its chief executive. As reported in its financial results, Aviva Ireland's operating profit, excluding non-insurance activity, stood at €91.2 million. This is an increase of 32% on the €69 million operating profit which existed in 2014. In fact, Aviva acknowledged that its general insurance business gross written premium grew by €48 million year on year while its customer numbers grew by 6%. This is not to draw attention to one company specifically, but merely to use it as an example. Another example is RSA, which RTE reported reduced its operating loss in its Irish operations from £97 million in 2014 to £26 million in 2015. This morning, I received a particular example from a constituent in Swords. A 37 year old male with eight years no claims bonus and three penalty points received a renewal quote from FBD for €445 in 2015, and his insurance renewal quote this year was 90% higher, at €845. Since that correspondence, the company has offered an intermediary level of €745, which is €100 less. This is a paltry gesture given the 90% increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432"> David Barniville, senior counsel and chairman of the Bar Council, wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Friday. Ironically, if the Adjournment debate had been taken last week it would have informed the article a little more. He highlighted the issue I have just outlined with regard to legal costs. I have done a great deal of research, which I will happily give to the Minister of State, which indicates legal costs have increased by only 1%, so the justification the insurance industry is giving is completely erroneous, with 35% in one example.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433"> The Government levy increases premiums and I accept there are other capitalisation issues, but the Book of Quantum of InjuriesBoard.ie, which was established to reduce costs for the insurance sector and the end user has not been updated in almost a decade. It is in the process of doing so, which is a welcome step. The problem is the insurance industry will not share information with the injuries board and it cannot make a determination which will ultimately lower costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1434">I thank Deputy Farrell for his comments and for raising this important issue this evening. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the issue of insurance costs. I am aware of the concerns of Deputy Farrell and concerns throughout the House about the increasing cost of insurance. It is an issue of concern for individuals, households and businesses throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435"> Consumers, be they individuals or businesses, need to have access at a reasonable cost to the insurance products they require. Healthy competition within the insurance industry should facilitate this, and with regard to competition, the National Competitiveness Council has emphasised that a resilient and well-functioning insurance sector contributes to economic activity and financial stability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436"> It is important that Ireland has an insurance sector that is not only financially stable but contributes to economic activity. The insurance sector makes a vital contribution to the Irish economy, through employment, attracting global capital and serving the needs of consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437"> In general, a number of factors drive the cost of insurance. Differing reasons have been put forward by various interested parties to explain Ireland's increasing insurance costs. Motor insurance, as the Deputy pointed out, appears to be particularly affected, with the cost of premiums increasing by more than 34% in the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438"> To examine these issues in more detail, the Minister for Finance has asked his officials to undertake a review of policy in the insurance sector. This is being undertaken in consultation with the Central Bank of Ireland, other Government Departments, agencies and interested bodies. The objective of the review is to recommend measures to improve the functioning and regulation of the insurance sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439"> The first phase of the review, which is nearing completion, is concentrating on an examination of the framework for motor insurance compensation in Ireland after the failure of Setanta. This work is being conducted by a joint working group comprising officials of the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. The outcome of this work will feed into the wider review of policy in the insurance sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440"> The availability of relevant and timely data to facilitate an in-depth analysis of the issues is also a matter to be addressed in the review, as the current lack of data presents difficulties from a policy analysis and development perspective, and the Deputy referred to this in his contribution. As the National Competitiveness Council report on insurance states, it is important to obtain data forensically because so many elements contribute to insurance costs. The Department of Finance is working closely with the Central Bank of Ireland and has met a number of stakeholders, including the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the injuries board. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has advised that the injuries board expects to have the revised Book of Quantum ready as soon as possible. While the review will examine the issues, it then will be necessary to approach the relevant areas to ascertain where improvements can be made that can feed into reducing the cost of insurance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441"> It is important to note it will continue to be the case that insurance premiums will be priced individually by insurers, which use a combination of rating factors in making their individual decisions on whether to offer cover and what terms might apply. While insurance premiums cannot be directly influenced, and the Government cannot interfere in how insurance companies price their insurance products, this does not preclude the Government from introducing measures that could, in the longer term, lead to a better claims environment that could facilitate a reduction in claims costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442"> Officials will continue to work on the review of policy over the coming months and the work is expected to<i>
							</i>be completed by the end of this year. I would very much appreciate the opportunity to examine with the Deputy his research and the figures he has shared with the House and submit them to the ongoing review, if it will help in its work, and in completing it as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1443">I am glad to have an opportunity to raise this issue. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Harris, on his appointment. It is a challenging brief and this is the first time I have had an opportunity to address him and I wish him well in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444"> The report on the future of services at Midlands Regional Hospital, Portlaoise was to be completed last September.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">We have waited long and hard for that publication. I believe it was finished months ago, but two weeks after the new Government was formed we were told that a draft report had been completed and sent to senior management at the HSE. General practitioners in and the people of County Laois, public representatives and I are very concerned about this issue, as are people living in surrounding counties, including south Kildare where the Ceann Comhairle lives and from where a lot of people using the hospital come. GPs have been made aware of the contents of the draft report and issued a lengthy response on it. I will not read everything they state, but they make a number of important points. They say it contains proposals to downgrade the hospital and that will exacerbate the negative patient experience in the region and result in needless and untimely deaths. They say there is no capacity to facilitate patients in any other centre. I am abbreviating what they say in the interests of time and because of my voice problem. They say they are receiving letters from hospitals fortnightly telling them not to refer patients to emergency departments because they do not have the capacity to deal with them. They say the plan is reckless in the extreme and shows no regard for patient safety. They outline the knock-on effects on other services at the hospital such as paediatric, maternity and mental health services. There has been a spike in the latter in County Laois. They say the plan will impact on the number presenting with self-harm. They also outline the difficulties regarding the effects on primary care services and say the MIDOC service is overburdened and that they have difficulty in filling shifts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446"> I have met the GPs many times, individually and collectively, and they are professional and responsible and not prone to exaggerating. I am not exaggerating. I attended the emergency department about six months ago and saw at first hand the pressure that it was under. The people living in County Laois and south Kildare and women from County Offaly who attend the maternity unit see the pressure it is under. I want the Minister to explain this to me and I say it with all sincerity: if the emergency department in Portlaoise is already one of the busiest outside Dublin and the departments in Tullamore and Naas cannot cope with their current workloads, where will the 38,000 or so patients who attend the emergency department in Portlaoise annually go? Is he aware that the ambulance service in the region is stretched to breaking point? How would patients in a critical condition be transferred to other hospitals? This is a point I raised at a meeting with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Leo Varadkar, with other public representatives last year. I asked him, as I ask the Minister, whether he had spoken to the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Defence about the cost and the logistics of mobilising police and military convoys to transfer high security prisoners from Portlaoise Prison to hospitals in other counties and Dublin? This is a big issue. As of now they cross the road and there is a secure holding area in the hospital. Protocols are in place and there is very little mobilisation as the hospital is located only a few hundred yards away from the prison. This will be a real problem for the Irish Prison Service, the Department of Defence and the policing service which is already stretched. I put the same issue to the Minister and know that he will have a scripted response written by officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447"> I am sorry about the temporary problem with my voice, but I raise this issue out of huge concern. If I was never a public representative or a member of a political party, I would be trying to do something about it. It is a serious issue. This is the second busiest emergency department in Ireland. The Minister is a fresh pair of hands and I really want him to consider this issue. He should not let officials in the HSE lead him by the nose. He should get a grip on the issue.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1448">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter and particularly for getting his point across, despite the difficulties with his voice. First, I reassure him that I am committed to securing and further developing the role of Portlaoise hospital as a constituent hospital of the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. The most important consideration in any proposed change to services at the hospital is that patient safety and the outcome for patients must come first. As the Deputy knows, there have been a number of reports on the hospital in recent years. These reports have pointed to the need for the reconfiguration of some services to ensure patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff who can safely meet their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449"> Since 2014 the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies and incorporating the hospital into the existing governance structures within the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. Governance and management arrangements in Portlaoise hospital services have been strengthened, clinical staffing numbers increased and staff training, hospital culture and hospital communications improved. Service improvements include a number of additional consultant posts within the hospital, including in anaesthetics, surgery, emergency medicine, paediatrics and obstetrics, as well as additional physician and midwifery posts. Furthermore, investment in patient quality and safety, complaints management and patient engagement has also occurred in the past two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450"> The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group has recently produced a draft plan for clinical service delivery at Portlaoise hospital. The draft plan has been discussed with my Department and is the subject of further work and consideration within the HSE. I stress that it is a draft plan with much further work to be done from the HSE's perspective. Any potential change to services at Portlaoise hospital, including plans for service reconfiguration, will be undertaken in a planned and orderly manner and take account of current use of services, as the Deputy asks; demands in other hospitals - another point he made - and the need to develop particular services in Portlaoise in the context of the overall service provided by the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group. The important point to note is that this work is being done to strengthen services in Portlaoise from a patient safety and quality perspective and ensure the services currently provided in the hospital are safe, adequately resourced and developed based on health needs. I will keep the Deputy and other Oireachtas Members in the Laois constituency informed on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_1451">The third Adjournment Debate matter is in the name of Deputy Anne Rabbitte and concerns staff safety and industrial relations at Oberstown Youth Detention Centre in County Dublin.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AnneRabbitte" eId="spk_511">
            <from>Deputy Anne Rabbitte<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T21:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1452">I thank the Minister for taking the time at this late hour to address my question and look forward to working with her and putting children at the centre of our briefs. I come to her with an issue that is live and very real for the people who work in and the patients who are inmates or service users of the Oberstown centre. Just before I came into the House, I heard of another crisis. A young child has escaped from Unit 9 and is on the roof of one of the buildings. </p>
            <p eId="para_1453"> Both the unions and Oberstown centre management have agreed to talks at the Workplace Relations Commission next Wednesday, which is to be welcomed. However, I find the approach the Minister has adopted in response to the work stoppage concerning. I read in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday that there was no basis for this industrial action to take place. If it were a dispute about pay, I would have no issues with it. The Minister will correct me if I am wrong, but I believe there is no basis for this action under the Lansdowne Road agreement. </p>
            <p eId="para_1454"> Because I am new to my role, I have looked at what has been going on regarding the Oberstown centre in the past 12 months. It appears that my colleague, Deputy Robert Troy, who has moved to a different post has been raising the issue since last year. Last July there were a number of incidents. A number of different children escaped and there was a report of a stabbing incident there. The issues raised by the workers are of real concern. This is their cry for help. This is how they are managing to gain attention - bringing matters to the fore by holding stoppages. They are very genuine. Health and safety at the Oberstown centre are the kernel of the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">Staff who, I can assure the Minister, are dedicated to their job complain they are massively overburdened and simply do not have time to build personal relationships of trust with the children in their care. There have been a number of violent incidents which I have referred to, and last summer there were security issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456"> It certainly seems the case that not enough was done to ensure the Oberstown facility was fully operational and staff were properly trained prior to the intake of 17 year olds from St. Patrick's and Wheatfield last year. Between March and July last year, nine female and 22 male staff suffered injuries, including concussion, nerve damage, throat injury, stabbings and bites. More assaults have taken place since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457"> The unions, IMPACT and SIPTU, state the four-hour stoppage was carried out on Tuesday and staff and residents at this centre are exposed to daily risks of violent assault. That is their cry for help. The care workers and other employees took part in industrial action from 8 a.m. to 12 p.m. over what they say is poor safety measures and an increasing number of assaults on the campus.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458"> The campus caters for 48 teenagers under the age of 18 and the union states that 100 violent incidents occurred at Oberstown last year, almost half of which were classified as critical. Due to management inaction on procedures, many staff at Oberstown feel that the centre is no longer based on a child care model and has become a containment facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459"> Last year Deputy Troy wrote to the then Minister, now Senator James Reilly, on the matter, referring to the severe staff shortages and the lack of standardisation of workplace practices within Oberstown. Yesterday, I noted that the manager of Oberstown said that a recruitment drive is under way to increase staffing levels and that there has been investment in protection equipment. That was highlighted last July, this is 1 June and we are still looking at recruiting the staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460"> The care workers who work there every day say that health and safety is the issue, and it clearly is. We are supposed to be encouraging the children and teens attending the service to return to the community as part of their rehabilitation. However, yesterday morning, we closed the doors and locked them away. While we have had fine days here in Dublin and the sun has been out, everybody in the centre had to endure the same lockdown again for health and safety reasons because the staff had to try to retrieve a young man off a roof.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461"> Those same children have been locked away twice, and this was not the choice of the care workers. The stoppage is their way of highlighting to the Minister and to me the issues in Oberstown. I plead with the Minister to listen sensitively to the workers and take all on board. Let us try to put the ethos of what we want, what is best for these young teens, at the centre of it. These teens have the right to rehabilitation and to intervention in order that they can get back into the community. They have been removed from Wheatfield and St. Patrick's to ensure that.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Katherine Zappone)<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T21:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1462">I thank Deputy Anne Rabbitte for raising this issue. It is our first exchange and I appreciate her contribution. We are at one in our concern about the ethos of which she spoke.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463"> As Minister with responsibility for children and young people, I am committed, first and foremost, to the provision of an appropriate, safe and secure environment for children in custody on the Oberstown campus. These children are cared for by staff who deserve to have a safe working environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464"> I can tell from Deputy Rabbitte's remarks that we would agree that detention is intended to be a last resort for children. It is justified when it works effectively for both the children who are detained in Oberstown and the personnel who are responsible for their care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465"> It has been Government policy in recent years to end the practice of detaining children in adult prison facilities. This policy has had cross-party support. Until now 17 year old boys serving a sentence have been sent to prison, but later this year we will finally end this practice. They will instead be sent to Oberstown. It is not a prison. It is a children detention centre. To achieve this, we are recruiting additional care staff, as Deputy Rabbitte refers. I hope all Members of this House and our predecessors who have advocated for an end to the detention of children in adult prisons will take comfort in that fact that we have moved to a more enlightened way of working with children in custody. In recent years a reform programme has been under way to make this a reality and I acknowledge the contribution of our staff in Oberstown and thank them for that. They have played a key role in delivering this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466"> In addition, there has been a substantial capital investment programme in new detention buildings, the gradual transfer of responsibility for older boys to the site, legislative reform under the Children (Amendment) Act 2015, and the first programme of staff recruitment on the campus in a number of years. Important governance reforms have also been undertaken, including the establishment of shared services across the campus, a single human resource team and training office under a single campus director.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467"> The issues that have been mentioned in the current industrial dispute, and Deputy Rabbitte referred to several of them, include effective practices for managing the behaviour of children in custody, staff safety, the management of the transition of children from the adult prison system to Oberstown and the design of new detention buildings. I welcome that management and staff are now engaging on these and other issues at the Workplace Relations Commission. I intend to monitor closely the progress of discussions, but Deputies will appreciate that this dispute has to be resolved through direct engagement between the parties. It is my sincere hope that there will be no further recourse to industrial action while the conciliation process at the Workplace Relations Commission is under way. In particular, as I am sure Deputy Rabbitte agrees, I hope that children in Oberstown who are facing into exams can concentrate on these without other distractions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468"> An adult prison and a children detention school are based on different foundations. In Oberstown, there is an emphasis on training in behaviour management programmes that de-escalate and, where possible, avoid crises involving the behaviour of children. I condemn any and all incidents resulting in assault and injury to staff. There is no acceptable level of violent behaviour in a children detention school. Children are assessed daily for all forms of risk, and policies and procedures are continually reviewed with the aim of ensuring safe and secure custody for children and the safety of staff. Unfortunately, the risk of injury cannot be excluded completely given the nature of a children detention school. A specific employee assistance programme is in place to assist members of staff on foot of any such incident where required. Staff are fully supported where incidents have to be investigated by the Garda authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469"> The original physical design of the new units was developed through a series of consultative meetings with both staff and management in the children detention school. The consensus design recommendations were taken on board. Work is ongoing to address lessons learned from the operation of the new facilities over the first 12 to 15 months of their use. I assure the House that health and safety issues are a top priority for the campus, and further works are planned with the assistance of the Office of Public Works to enhance physical and building security.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470"> I am describing the scale of the reform programme that is under way in Oberstown. There is a need for time, a supportive policy climate, an adequate level of resources and continued staff and management engagement to bed down the reforms and to ensure the new Oberstown campus operates successfully into the future. A positive work climate for staff on the Oberstown campus in the future is an absolute necessity. I am committed to this and to a future for children in custody that is modern and that serves children and society well.</p>

            <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2016-06-01T21:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1471">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this Adjournment debate in the House. As it is my first engagement with the Minister officially here in the House, I congratulate him on his appointment and wish him well in his work within the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472"> It is timely that this Adjournment debate has been taken today given the announcement earlier today by the Minister that there have been moves on SI 125 of 2016 relating to court cases. The Minister outlined that the statutory instrument will be amended to facilitate the sequential application of EU points in conjunction with the prosecution process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">It is a very welcome intervention by the Department and a confirmation that the system was not fit for purpose initially. It will go a long way towards satisfying many of the requirements of fishermen and fishing communities to ensure the points system works properly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474"> The points system was introduced in 2014 as a statutory instrument, which was struck down in the courts here in January or February. At that time, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine debated the statutory instrument and identified many of the problems recognised by the courts. The points system could have been made much more robust to meet the requirements. Although nobody likes points to be implemented, fishing communities recognise the need for a points system and that it will be in operation. The key is to ensure it operates fairly for everybody involved, it is clear and concise and everybody knows what is involved and how it will work in the future. It has potentially very serious implications for the livelihoods of fishermen and the viability of fishing businesses if points can be attached in a way that is not totally clear and understandable to everybody involved. The principle that, if a prosecution takes place and the courts decide no offence happened, the points are not assigned is a very welcome and positive contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475"> There remain some problems with the statutory instrument and how it has been established. Based on consultations I have had on the court case and the workings of the new statutory instrument, it could still be potentially problematic. A fishing licence might have points applied without being followed by a prosecution. In this case, the points might stand and the statutory instrument might lead to complications in that, if there is no court case, there is no chance of the points being rescinded in the event that there is no conviction. If this happens, there could be recourse to the courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476"> In the judgment in one of the cases in February, the judge pointed out that the statutory instrument and system, as it stood then, "do not require the Minister to ignore established systems for independent adjudication and recourse to the courts in such matters". There is concern that the 2016 statutory instrument does not include the full recourse to the courts. If it is the case that points will never be assigned where there is no prosecution, maybe it will not arise. Maybe the Minister of State could clarify this and we could put the situation to bed if there is no possibility it could happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477"> It is very important the Department is recognising this and I commend the Minister of State on recognising the problems in the system and finding a solution that can work in everybody's favour. There was a very strong feeling among fishing communities that they were being treated differently from everybody else. This has been a common theme through all the fishing legislation, such as the 2006 Act, which criminalised people, whereas across the rest of Europe, the offences were administrative. The feeling must be repaired and this could be a positive step along the road.</p>

            <p eId="para_1478">I thank the Deputy for his good wishes. He has always had a keen interest in fisheries matters. In previous debates on the matter, Deputies from Malin Head to Mizen Head and from Hook Head to Clogher Head were exercised by the matter. The Deputy's constituency colleague and my party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, also contacted me about the matter. As I said to the various principal officers I met today, I come to this portfolio with not a mile of coast in my constituency. Maybe in some regards this is an advantage in that I come with no baggage. I welcome good counsel on these matters and Deputy Pringle will not be shy in marking my card and giving me a whisper in the ear if I need assistance on these matters. </p>
            <p eId="para_1479"> I thank the Deputy for raising the issue, which gives me an opportunity to update the Dáil on certain matters pertaining to the European Union (Common Fisheries Policy) (Point System) Regulations 2016, SI 125 of 2016. Member States are required, under the 2009 EU Fisheries “Control” Regulation, to assign the appropriate number of points to the licence holder of the vessel concerned every time a serious infringement of the Common Fisheries Policy is committed. Ireland had previously implemented the required EU points system by means of SI 3 of 2014, which was the subject of two recent High Court challenges and was struck down in one of them. The two High Court judgments are subject to appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1480"> Given that Ireland is required to have in place a legal instrument implementing the EU points system, a new amended instrument, Sl 125 of 2016, was drafted and signed on 1 March 2016. It took on board, to the extent possible, issues of concern regarding procedures and process which had been highlighted in the High Court cases. Much of the scrutiny regarding SI 125 of 2016 since it came into force stems from the fact that points apply separate to any criminal prosecution or conviction or where a prosecution results in an acquittal. It has been suggested that the EU points system should, instead, be combined with a successful prosecution through the courts. In recent weeks, there have been a number of meetings between me, my predecessor and the fishing industry with regard to the concerns raised. I met with representatives of the fishing industry this morning to discuss a wide range of issues and, in particular, their concerns on the implementation of the EU points system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481"> On taking office, I requested that the Attorney General consider whether there is a way that the assignment of EU points for the licence holder can await the completion of the prosecution process while at the same time ensuring Ireland is fully in compliance with its obligations under EU law. Further to the programme for Government commitment pertaining to the assignment of points, I quickly sought that advice from the Attorney General as prescribed in the document. Having received this advice, I am satisfied to move on the introduction of a system for the sequential application for EU points in conjunction with the prosecution process, thus fulfilling the ambition outlined in the partnership programme and going to the heart of Deputy Pringle's concerns which he articulated here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482"> This move is subject to addressing some important legal and administrative issues in order to ensure compliance with EU law. I have listened to the concerns of industry and intend to report back to the Oireachtas as soon as I have finalised a way forward in the context of dealing with the legal and administrative matters that arise. However, I am confident that these matters can be dealt with in a collaborative and constructive manner with all stakeholders. Irish fishermen should be assured that the State is taking seriously their concerns that a fishing industry can be maintained for them and those coming after them. The conservation of fishing resources is in everyone's interest and is vital for the future of the Irish fishing industry. I am confident that the reformed points system that I have announced will play a vital role in acting as an effective sanction against the minority who break the rules, protecting the vast majority of our law abiding industry and preserving the fishing resources for all fishermen and for future generations.</p>
