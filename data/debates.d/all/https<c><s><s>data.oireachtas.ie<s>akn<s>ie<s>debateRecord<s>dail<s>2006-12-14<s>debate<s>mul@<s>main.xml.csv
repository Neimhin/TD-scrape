The elderly have contributed to the country by paying taxes and building the economy to a high level.  Why should this burden be placed on them in their later years?

For the Dáil to sit for a shorter period than yesterday and the day before sounds as if the Government wants to push through legislation as opposed to debating it in the House.  The sitting should reflect the amount of business.  It is too short a sitting if we are to deal with this business, it should be at least as long as yesterday and the day before.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19632	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	55	Fine Gael will not accept the proposal to accept these motions without debate.  The Ceann Comhairle knows that we have witnessed in recent days an alarming escalation in criminal activity on our streets, with murder, drug offences, firearms offences, assault and false imprisonment exploding on the Government's watch.  The Tánaiste and the Government will be judged not by good intentions or activity or by an open chequebook——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19632	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Attempts to curtail business by taking all these items without debate, including a motion related to drug trafficking, are not acceptable to this party.  I am perfectly entitled to outline my reasons for not accepting this.  When the Government members hear the reasons, perhaps they will change their view and we will have an opportunity for debate.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19632	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I welcome that.  I would like to outline why the Ceann Comhairle ought not only to accept that but also to allow us to reject many of the motions it is proposed to take without debate.  The reasons are straightforward.  The Tánaiste and his Government promised there would be zero tolerance on crime, yet murders are up 46%; homicide, 115%; assault, 131%; gun crime, 300%——

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19632	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	64	That was a brief comment.  The Government must be judged on results, which in the context of crime, is the capacity to detect criminals and bring them to book.  Under various crime headings, detection rates have fallen.

My colleague, Deputy O'Shea, has a matter of concern to raise, for example, on No. 23 but it has been lumped together with everything else.No. 22a provides for arrangements for a phoney sitting week.  The Dáil will reconvene on 24 January 2007 and the motion states: “(i) there shall be no Order of Business within the meaning of Standing Order 26; (ii) there shall be no Leaders’ Questions pursuant to Standing Order 26A; (iii) oral and written questions shall not be taken; (iv) Private Members’ business shall not be taken; (v) matters may not be raised under the provisions of Standing Orders 21(3) or 31; (vi) the taking of any divisions shall be postponed until immediately after the Order of Business on Wednesday, 31st January, 2007”.  That is a window dressing week to facilitate the Government.Meanwhile, we have a crisis on our streets.  Even the changed demeanour of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform betrays the gravity of the situation.  It is appropriate at this time of year that we pause to reflect on the number of families who will sit down to Christmas dinner without their loved ones and on completely innocent citizens going about their daily work being slain in the circumstances we recently witnessed.  It is not appropriate that the House should adjourn and arrange a phoney sitting week such as this without the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform saying clearly when there will be an opportunity to discuss the law and order situation that afflicts the country.I offer the Minister the support of the Labour Party for any reasonable measures to get a grip on this crime wave.  There is no point flailing around blaming others, including the Judiciary for the manner of the implementation of mandatory sentencing and so on.  This is driven by the crime racket that has infested communities with drugs in many areas.  The large, lucrative profits that can be made from the drugs trade is the direct cause of the murder and mayhem, which threatens the lives of innocent citizens.

When does the Tánaiste purport to allow the House to have a full debate on the law and order situation, which is out of hand?
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I expected that a Private Notice Question on the record levels of gun crime and murder that are unfolding daily might be accepted today and I submitted one on that basis.  Will the Ceann Comhairle confirm this when I have made my contribution?The Tánaiste read a list that included so many years and numbers I was reminded of a Johnny Cash song.  This is a farce because these motions and so on deal with issues as varied as the Official Languages Act, bovine diseases, drug trafficking, fisheries, biocarbons and the carbon fund.  Significant funding is being given the nod without the opportunity for debate and without Members being given the courtesy of being able to differentiate one issue from another.  When business is lumped together like this, it indicates more is being hidden than debated.  We must oppose this proposal because the House will be brought into disrepute if such a practice is permitted to continue without being challenged.  We should have the opportunity to divide on each item so that they can be given the decent attention they need.  I appreciate the time constraints but each item should be debated fully.

I agree with my colleagues it is inappropriate to create a lumpen mass of all of these and to ask us to make a decision on whether to proceed without debate.  Like many colleagues, I have concerns about a number of these items while I welcome others.  This is a poor approach to business and it needs to be addressed.I refer to the proposed approval of the Official Languages Act 2003 (Section 9) Regulations 2006, which are back from committee where there was a serious debate on the measures involved.  This only underscores the importance of addressing what is involved in No. 23 on the Order of Business and attending to the matter in this Chamber.  It is inappropriate that this motion and No. 26, the motion on proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Treatment of Persons in Custody in Garda Síochána Stations) (Amendment) Regulations 2006, are proceeding without debate.  They should have been accorded the opportunity of full debate.  While serious issues, of which we are all aware, have been mentioned in the House already this morning the reality is that this motion relates to the extension of time without address of the provisions for the protection of people in custody.  This also has implications for members of the Garda as it fails to reflect on the importance of introducing video interviewing.  Such protections are in the interests of every one of us as members of society and citizens.There are issues relating to the regional fisheries boards and the postponement of elections and, again, many voices have expressed concern in this regard.  This is most objectionable. I believe the Tánaiste recognises this. He should intervene with the Chief Whip.  It is not acceptable to cram all of these measures together on our last day in the House to steam roll them through.  As others have said, there were instances in the past session when there was insufficient business to be attended to.  This should not happen again. I am opposed to the approach taken to all of these measures this morning.

This legislation has to be dealt with today, which is the last sitting day before Christmas.  This country is at a major crossroads, at which it needs to decide whether it will use extraordinary amounts of taxpayers' money to buy carbon credits, or motivate and mobilise the people to take alternative action.  People in the business community, in particular, will gain a great deal if they embrace the opportunities offered by a low-carbon economy.  The message the Government is sending is that it is business as usual.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	19632	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I oppose this item.  In the past session we were promised 21 Bills and we have seen only five of them.  In respect of three of those, the Appropriations Bill, the Social Welfare Bill and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission (Amendment) Bill, the Government was statutorily obliged to produce them because of the timing issues.  Of the remaining, the Government produced only two Bills out of a total of 19.  That is not a record the Government can reflect on and say it has delivered to this House the sort of legislation on which we can have meaningful debate about issues of serious concern.It is not good intentions that determine the effectiveness of the Government; it is results.  On this measure the Government has not delivered results.  It has not delivered results on zero tolerance, zero waiting lists or children in classes of 20 yet it has asked ordinary families to come up with €7,500 more than they used to pay in tax.  That is the acid test.  This Government is not delivering on its own promises, nor is it delivering for the amount of money it is raising.  It has failed in its legislative programme.  It does not deserve the support of this House, nor does it deserve to go off on the Christmas break and hide behind a debate it proposes to have when we resume in which there will be no accountability on the part of the Taoiseach or Ministers and no opportunity for the Opposition parties to have a debate.  We oppose this motion.

What is being proposed by the Executive today is a negation of that principle whereby the Dáil will assemble without an opportunity for any form of accountability.  Even if there is a division on the matter that will be debated, that division will be deferred to a later date.  That is not acceptable.The Labour Party and Fine Gael published proposals on Dáil reform earlier in the year, one of which was that the Dáil would reassemble in the third week of January.  In accordance with that, we propose an amendment to the proposal before us——

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	119	It is a strange way of dealing with it, and I am as familiar with the system as you, a Cheann Comhairle.  However, I will accept your ruling on that.A total of 12 items have been passed by this Dáil today without debate and guillotines will be imposed on seven Bills.  If my recollection is correct, the Dáil collapsed on three separate occasions for lack of business yet in the week it reassembles we will engage in an exercise of sanitised democracy when no real business will be transacted and we will simply have a debate.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Green Party opposes this proposal and supports the motion to which Deputy Stagg referred.  I do not want to delay the Tánaiste any longer from going to speak on European matters at the forum but it is important for him to bear in mind at the forum that we do not compare well to other European countries when it comes to sitting days in this House and the way we conduct our business.  Against the backdrop of escalating crime levels, it does not send out the right signal.  I mentioned the signal sent out by the carbon fund Bill.  Our approach generally gives the impression of "cut and run" and it is an admission of defeat.The Dáil should resume earlier and sit for longer.  There is no excuse for not doing that.  Other workers are busy and many of them will be lucky to be off work for the period from Christmas Eve to New Year's Day.  There is an important accountability lesson to be learnt that the Government has not learnt.  This parliament should have the same number of sitting days as other European parliaments, and as Westminster in particular, with which we deal more often than with other parliaments.  That, for me, is a benchmark.

Accountability of Government is critically important and any number of issues will arise that will be relevant and appropriate to raise either by way of Leaders' Questions, Taoiseach's questions, questions to Ministers or in some other way.  To restrict the business of those two days to taking Second Stage of one Bill and not address any of the other important matters that this House must accommodate is simply not acceptable.  Accordingly, I oppose the proposition.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I move:That, pursuant to Standing Order 125, it be an instruction to the committee to which the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2006 may be recommitted in respect of certain amendments, that it has power to make provision in the Bill to amend the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995 to provide for an expanded definition of ‘party' for the purposes of the 1995 Act.Last year, the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 provided for the establishment of common contractual funds that are not undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities.  These are known as non-UCITS CCFs.  Prior to the enactment of the 2005 Act, common contractual funds, CCFs, could only be established as undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities, UCITS, introduced by the 2003 UCITS regulations, namely, SI 211 of 2003, as amended.The Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995, as amended, provides certain super-protections in insolvency for certain netting and related credit support arrangements that come within its ambit.  At it simplest, it allows for amounts owed to a party A under one or more financial contracts entered into by that party with another party B to be netted off, or offset, against any amounts due by party A to the other party B under separate financial contracts.The definition of who is a party for the purposes of the netting Act is central in determining to whom the 1995 Act applies.  In the netting Act, "netting agreement" is defined as an agreement between two parties only with regard to current or future financial contracts providing, inter alia, for their termination, the determination of termination values and the set-off of those termination values so as to arrive at a net sum.  The concern in this context is the implications of the reference to “between two parties only” for the availability of netting Act protections for agreements entered into by the manager, or its delegate, of a common contractual fund in its capacity as such.The netting Act defines the term "party" as "a person constituting one of the parties to an agreement".  It is the view of the financial services funds industry that the term "party" should not be restricted to a single legal or natural person.  However, whereas the reference to a netting agreement being "between two parties only" should not preclude either party to a netting agreement being composed of one or more legal or natural persons where they all share a single, identical interest in the contract and there is no differentiation of rights or obligations drawn as between those individual persons, this is not the position in the case of a CCF.A CCF, whether formed under the 2005 Act or the 2003 regulations, is an unincorporated body established by contract, under which the participants, by contractual arrangement, participate and share in the property of the collective investment undertaking as co-owners.  Pursuant to the deed of constitution of the CCF, the manager of the CCF, acting in its capacity as such, transacts on behalf of the CCF.  However, whereas neither the 2005 Act nor the UCITS regulations specifically address the identity of the principal to transactions effected by the manager or its delegate, the view is, on the basis of first principles, that the participants in the CCF, that is, the unit holders, comprise the principal to such transactions.In the case of a CCF, each participant shares in the assets and suffers liabilities, up to a maximum, in the case of liabilities, of the amount subscribed by it for units in the CCF, as tenants in common with all other participants and in the proportion that the nominal value of its holding of units bears to the aggregate nominal value of all units issued in the CCF.Therefore, the participants in a CCF do not share a single, identical interest in an agreement for netting that may be entered into by the manager in its capacity as such; and there is a differentiation of rights or obligations drawn as between those individual participants.  In short, what all of this means is that investment vehicles constituted as UCITS or non-UCITS CCFs cannot benefit from the Netting Act 1995.  Likewise, there is a legal doubt as to whether partnerships, whether constituted as an ordinary partnership or a limited partnership, including under the Investment Limited Partnership Act 1995, benefit from the Netting Act 1995.The proposed amendment to the Netting Act would deem the CCF to comprise a single party for this purpose and extend the super-protections of the Netting Act to CCFs.

In short, what all of this means is that investment vehicles constituted as UCITS or non-UCITS CCFs will be able to benefit from the Netting Act 1995.

In line with the co-operation of my party, I am sure that there will be no difficulty if I do not use any more time of the House to facilitate the important passage of this technical amendment.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	273	In the same spirit, I welcome any measure that tidies up our legislation and ensures Ireland is a first-class location in legislative terms for financial services.  There is an entire industry, with 16,000 people engaged in employment, in the International Financial Services Centre in the docklands.  There is probably more legal firepower contained in one of those companies than there is in the Attorney General's office because the stakes are so high.  We need constant review.  The legal minefield of this part of the world of commerce is like a complex garden that must be tended to every day.I accept this amendment.  I am not in any way opposing it.  Frankly, I do not understand the complexity of it, but I do understand the complexities of the issue in general and the constant need to be vigilant because this makes Finance Acts look like child's play.I invite the Minister of State, when we have some time, to come to the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business to go over the ground and explain the implications.  This is getting up the value chain in terms of employment and we will not stay there unless our laws are absolutely in the premier league.  In that spirit, I welcome the amendment.

In page 3, line 22, to delete "This Act" and substitute the following:"(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), this Act”.I will discuss amendment No. 5 first.  In a number of provisions in the Companies Acts, documents that require to be filed in the Companies Registration Office, CRO, must contain a statutory declaration.  Examples include section 60 of the 1963 Act in the context of a company providing loans to employees and others for the purchase of its shares.Usually, it will be a director of the company who must make the declaration.  Such declarations must be made before one of a number of persons who are authorised to receive and witness them.In most instances the statutory declarations are substantive requirements, not simply procedural, and in most instances form part of documentation that is required to be submitted to the CRO for registration in the context of the transactions in question.Under general law, statutory declarations made in the State are required to be made under the Statutory Declarations Act 1938.  They can be taken before a person authorised by law such as a solicitor, a commissioner for oaths, a peace commissioner or a notary public.Statutory declarations made outside of the jurisdiction are required to be made under the Diplomatic and Consular Officers (Provision of Services) Act 1993.  Essentially, this Act requires that the declaration be made before a diplomatic or consular official.For many years, the practice operated by the CRO permitted the registration of statutory declarations taken abroad when made before persons authorised to administer oaths in the jurisdiction in question, including in the case of Northern Ireland and the UK, before practising solicitors in those jurisdictions.  However, as a result of a detailed analysis of the situation, in the first instance by the Law Society of Ireland, and subsequently in the Office of the Attorney General, it emerged that the existing practice was incorrect.  Consequently, since April of this year, the CRO has changed its practice so that it now only accepts statutory declarations made abroad where they comply with the 1993 Act.The Law Society has strongly argued that the essence of the previous process and procedures should be restored.Amendment No. 5 will allow statutory declarations to be made abroad by Irish practising solicitors, for the purposes of the Irish Companies Acts, or a person such as a notary public authorised in that state to administer oaths.  In the case of the latter, it is proposed that the signature would be expressly required to be subject to existing arrangements regarding authentication under conventions to which Ireland is already a party.In that regard, where the state in which the declaration is made is a contracting party to the EC Convention, as defined in subsection (9), the terms of that convention, which provide for the complete freedom of movement of public documents without the requirements for authentication, shall apply.  Where the state in which the declaration is made is a party to the Hague Convention, which provides for the "apostille" system of authentication, and is not a party to the EC Convention, then the terms of the Hague Convention will apply as far as authentication is concerned.  Where the state in which the declaration has been made is not a party to either of these conventions, the authentication procedures applicable in that jurisdiction shall apply.  In all instances, where the CRO has a concern about the authenticity of documentation submitted, it can seek such proof as it considers appropriate or as permitted by the conventions, as applicable.Subsection (7) will retrospectively validate statutory declarations made abroad which have already been delivered to and registered in the CRO in accordance with practice and guidance that was previously issued by the CRO.The essence of amendments Nos. 2 and 3 to section 2 is to ensure that a number of provisions of the Bill will come into operation on the passing of the Act.  Apart from the provisions of Part 1 of the Bill, which contain the usual preliminary and general matters, provisions coming into operation will include the provision regarding statutory declarations, which I have just described, as well as some of the existing and other new provisions which we will be discussing later.  Perhaps most noteworthy among these are the provisions dealing with the increase in the audit exemption thresholds.  There has been a universal welcome for the increase in the audit exemption threshold provided for in section 6 of the Bill, and the amendments to section 2 will ensure these become applicable immediately on enactment of the Bill.I commend these amendments to the House.

In page 4, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:"7.—The following section is substituted for section 33 of the Companies Act 1963:33.—(1) For the purposes of this Act, ‘private company' means a company which has a share capital and which, by its articles(a) restricts the right to transfer its shares, and(b) limits the number of its members to 99 or fewer persons, not including persons who are in the employment of the company and persons who, having been formerly in the employment of the company, were, while in that employment, and have continued after the determination of that employment to be, members of the company, and(c) prohibits any invitation or offer to the public to subscribe for any shares, debentures or other securities of the company.(2) A provision of a company's articles that prohibits any invitation to the public to subscribe for any shares or debentures of the company shall be construed as a prohibition on any invitation or offer being made to the public to subscribe for any shares, debentures or other securities of the company.(3) Where two or more persons hold one or more shares in a company jointly, they shall, for the purposes of this section, be treated as a single member.(4) Subsections (5) and (6) shall apply for the purposes of—(a) subsection (1)(c), and(b) unless a contrary intention appears in the company’s articles, any provision of a company’s articles which—(i) corresponds in its terms to those of subsection (1)(c),(ii) incorporates by reference the terms of subsection (1) (c), or(iii) has the same legal effect as subsection (1)(c) even though its terms are not identical to those of subsection (1)(c) (and the cases to which this subparagraph applies include the case where subsection (2) applies to the interpretation of the provision).(5) Each of the following offers of debentures by a company (wheresoever made) shall not be regarded as falling within subsection (1)(c) or the provision of a company’s articles referred to in subsection (4)(b), namely—(a) an offer of debentures addressed solely to qualified investors,(b) an offer of debentures addressed to fewer than 100 persons, other than qualified investors,(c) an offer of debentures addressed to investors where the minimum consideration payable pursuant to the offer is at least €50,000 per investor, for each separate offer,(d) an offer of debentures whose denomination per unit amounts to at least €50,000,(e) an offer of debentures where the offer expressly limits the amount of the total consideration for the offer to less than €100,000,(f) an offer of those classes of instruments which are normally dealt in on the money market (such as treasury bills, certificates of deposit and commercial papers) having a maturity of less than 12 months.(6) The following offer of shares by a company (of any amount or wheresoever made) shall not be regarded as falling within subsection (1)(c) or the provision of a company’s articles referred to in subsection (4)(b), namely an offer of shares addressed to—(a) qualified investors, or(b) 99 or fewer persons, or(c) both qualified investors and 99 or fewer other persons.(7) A word or expression that is used in this section and is also used in the Prospectus (Directive 2003/71/EC) Regulations 2005 (S.I. No. 324 of 2005) shall have in this section the same meaning as it has in those Regulations.(8) For the purposes of subsection (7), the Regulations referred to in that subsection shall have effect as if Regulation 8 were omitted therefrom."Prior to the enactment of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 — in particular Part 5 thereof — and the Prospectus Regulations 2005, SI 324/2005, practitioners had been able to advise their clients that on the basis of existing law, and in particular a combination of sections 33, 51 and 61 of the Companies Act 1963 and section 21 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983, it was possible for a private company to make offers of their shares and debentures to potential investors, provided the offer was structured in a particular way.Thus, while offers of the kind which were permitted were not expressly spelled out in the law, as long as they were considered as being, in the terms of section 61(2) of the Companies Act 1963, "regarded, in all of the circumstances, as not being calculated to result, directly or indirectly, in the shares or debentures becoming available for subscription or purchase by persons other than those receiving the offer or invitation, or otherwise as being a domestic concern of the persons making and receiving it," they could be made by private companies.  However, along with a number of others, this section was repealed with effect from 1 July 2005 as part of the transposition of the EU Prospectus Directive.  This has resulted in a certain degree of uncertainty as to what types of offers of their shares or debentures can, or can not, be made by private companies.Separately, as we are all only too well aware, other developments have been occurring in the economy.  In this context, with the advent and growth of the financial services industry in general, and the securitisation industry in particular, the use of the private company as the investment vehicle of choice for particular types of offers has grown.  This is because, inter alia, it only requires two members to form a private company, as opposed to a public company requiring seven, pursuant to the Companies Acts.  A private company does not have to have a specified minimum capital, and time wise it is easier to actually form and commence business with a private company than with a PLC.  The changes effected by the law, both primary and secondary, transposing the EU Prospectus Directive have removed one of the interpretative building blocks used by the practitioners advising clients on the manner in which private companies can be used for their purposes.The issue of private companies making offers of their debentures or other debt instruments to raise capital has also been considered by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG.  In the context of the CLRG's recommendations for the major reform and  consolidation Bill, it is being recommended that the proposed model private company — the company limited by shares — will not be able to offer shares or debentures in the manner under consideration.  However, the proposed private company that has an objects clause — to be called a "designated activity company" — and where it specifically provides for the matter in its constitution will be able to make offers of the kind in question, as long as the manner of doing so does not give rise to the need to publish a prospectus under the national law transposing the EU Prospectus Directive.This proposed approach is broadly in line with the approach adopted in a number of areas of company law in recent times, such as in transposing the Prospectus Directive, or availing of the maximum audit exemption thresholds, as we propose in section 6 of the current Bill, where the limitations or thresholds set in European law are adopted in determining the appropriate boundaries for the application of national law.  Thus, in the application of the Prospectus Directive, the requirements in what was then the existing Irish company law to publish a prospectus in national law, even where one qualified for an exemption under the law transposing the earlier EU prospectus law, was repealed in the 2005 Act and replaced by a simpler requirement to make particular disclosures.The approach being adopted in the proposed amendments to section 33 of the Companies Act 1963 and section 21 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983 is to explicitly permit a private company to make offers of the type which benefit from an exemption under Regulation 9 of SI 324/2005, or which otherwise fall outside of the scope of the implementing regulations.  The opportunity is also being taken to increase the permitted number of members a private company may have to 99, in line with the recommendations of the CLRG, which would otherwise have to await the implementation of the main reform and consolidation Bill.Amendment No. 6 replaces section 33 in the Companies Act 1963.  While it repeats to a large extent the existing provision of that section, it spells out in new subsections (5) and (6) the precise types of offers that private companies will be free to make if they wish to do so.  Subsection (2) is designed to remove scope for argument as to whether an offer is different from an invitation.  That said, it will be noted that the wording of this subsection and subsection (4) will enable companies that wish to do so to make offers of the kind specified in subsections (5) or (6) without the necessity to have to change their memorandum of association, if their existing memorandum is worded so as to have the same legal effect as the wording of subsection (l)(c).Section 21 of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983 contains the criminal sanctions applicable where a private company offers or allots shares or debentures to the public.  Amendment No. 7 essentially substitutes a new section 21 in the 1983 Act which will mirror the adjustments being made to section 33 of the 1963 Act, such that offers made by a private company of the type now being permitted will not attract any sanction.  I commend the amendments to the House.

In page 6, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following:"7.—(1) The amendments effected by section 6 shall apply as respects—(a) a financial year of a company that commences not earlier than the commencement of that section, and(b) subject to subsection (2), a financial year of a company that ends not earlier than 2 months after the commencement of that section (not being a financial year to which paragraph (a) applies).(2) In cases falling within subsection (1)(b), section 6 shall have effect as if, instead of the subsection (2) inserted by that section in section 33 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999, there were inserted the following subsection in that section 33:"(2) In cases falling within section 7(1)(b) of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2006, a notice under subsection (1) may be served on the company not later than 1 month before the end of the financial year to which the notice relates.”Deputies will recall that during the exchanges on Committee Stage on the amendments which I tabled to section 6 of the Bill, I said that I intended to review the provisions to ensure that in deleting the former section 6(2), I had not inadvertently removed a necessary provision.  At the time I had emphasised that I wished the availability of the significantly increased thresholds which I was introducing for balance sheet total and turnover to enable companies to avail of the exemption from audit, to be available at the earliest opportunity, consistent with protecting the rights of members of companies who would be entitled to object to their company availing of the exemption to do so.  I believe that this was also the purpose of the amendment tabled by Deputy Quinn.Amendment No. 8 will insert a new section after section 6 to deal with application and transitional arrangements.  Effectively the new section provides that under subsection (l)(a), the new thresholds will apply to all financial years of companies that begin after section 6 and this new section come into effect.  Under subsections (l)(b) and (2), for the current financial year of companies, if there is more than two months to run before the year finishes, a company can avail of the increased thresholds in the current year. In the period before the end of the financial year, members holding 10% or more of the voting shares can object to the company availing of the exemption, and they would have to signify such an objection at least one month before the end of the company’s current financial year.It will be clear, therefore, that a company with less than two months between the commencement of these provisions and the end of its current financial year will not be able to avail of the increased exemption thresholds until its next financial year.  I remind Deputies that section 6 and this new section will come into operation on the passing of this Act and hopefully it will be ready for 1 January 2007.  I commend the amendment to the House.

In page 8, between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following:"10.—The following section is substituted for section 45 of the Act of 2005:45.—(1) The prohibition in subsection (2) only applies in relation to a prospectus if EU prospectus law requires the inclusion in the prospectus of a statement of the kind referred to in paragraph (b) of that subsection.(2) A prospectus including a statement that is attributed to an expert shall not be issued unless—(a) the expert has given and has not, before the publication of the prospectus, withdrawn, in writing, his or her consent to the inclusion in the prospectus of the statement in the form and context in which it is included, and(b) a statement that the expert has given and not withdrawn, in writing, that consent appears in the prospectus.(3) If any prospectus is issued in contravention of this section the issuer and every person who is knowingly a party to the issue thereof shall be guilty of an offence and liable to a fine.".".In recent weeks, a particular difficulty has been raised by a number of legal practitioners who advise clients on the raising of capital through the issue of debentures, which involves the issue of a prospectus.The problem relates to the way in which the EU prospectus directive, to which I have already referred in the context of previous amendments, was transposed into Irish law through a combination of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005, and the separate transposing Regulations, SI 324 of 2005, which were made under section 46 of that Act.  The specific problem arises from the requirement in section 45(1) of the Act that, where a prospectus includes a statement made by an expert, that expert has to give his or her consent to the issue of the prospectus, and that consent must not have been withdrawn before the issue of the prospectus.It has now emerged that this requirement, which was modelled on section 46 of the Companies Act 1963, which itself was repealed as part of the transposition process, goes beyond the requirements of the prospectus directive, which is a maximum harmonisation directive.  To address this problem, amendment No. 10 substitutes a new section 45, the essence of which only requires an expert to give his or her consent to the inclusion of the expert's statement in the prospectus.Due to the way Part 5 of the 2005 Act is structured, it is necessary to make a large number of consequential changes to sections 38, 41, 42, 44 and 48 of the 2005 Act, and these are being made in amendment No. 11.  Some of the changes add or substitute new text, some amend existing text, while others repeal text that is now superfluous.  They are all designed to reflect the new approach whereby the expert simply consents to the inclusion of his or her statement, as opposed to actually giving consent to the issueof the prospectus, which is the essence of the first amendment to section 45 that I have just described.I commend these amendments to the House.

This directive deals with and requires disclosure of specific information by companies whose securities are listed on a regulated market and is due for transposition by 20 January 2007.Due to the nature of some of the disclosure obligations arising, relating as they do to the financial situation of listed companies, it has been decided that the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, IAASA, be appointed competent authority in respect of these aspects of the directive.  The other competent authority for the transparency directive will be the Financial Regulator, which is also the competent authority in respect of the transposing law for a number of related EU directives dealing with the publication of prospectuses and market abuse.Amendment No. 13 will make a number of amendments to section 10 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003, which established IAASA.  That section sets out the general powers that were given to IAASA and the additional powers now being given are specifically designed to enable IAASA to discharge the functions arising from the EU transparency directive.  In particular, IAASA will have the power to apply to the High Court to secure compliance with any of its rules relating to, or arising from, its new functions under transparency regulated markets law.Amendment No. 14 is to substitute section 29(7) of the 2003 Act in a way that accommodates the expanded grounds arising from these new functions whereon IAASA can petition the High Court to ensure compliance with its rules etc.Amendment No. 25 will amend section 14(6) of the present Bill by including rules adopted by IAASA within the remit of the subsection and this is directly linked with the changes being made to sections 9 and 10 of the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003, to provide for IAASA's new functions under the transparency directive, one of which I have just referred to.  The essence of this revised section 14(6) is that the provisions of the regulations that will transpose the EU transparency directive and that will make provision for administrative sanctions will also be applicable to contraventions of rules adopted by IAASA that arise from its functions as competent authority under the law transposing the EU transparency directive.While section 10 of the present Bill was added by way of amendment at special committee, and while it deals with the conferring of additional functions on IAASA as competent authority under the law transposing the EU transparency directive, its more correct location would be in Part 2 of the Bill, which deals with amendments of Companies Acts, and amendments Nos. 12 and 15 are designed to achieve this.Deputies will also notice that this group of amendments contains a number of identical amendments to various sections in Part 3 of the Bill whereby we are substituting the defined term "transparency (regulated markets) law", using a lower case "t" in the word "transparency".  This responds to the amendments tabled by Deputy Hogan at special committee and the discussion thereon in which Deputy Quinn also participated.  Following review of the matter, Parliamentary Counsel agrees that it is unnecessary, in this instance, to have the initial word in the defined term with a capital "T", and the amendments will address this issue.For the sake of completeness, I notify Members that Parliamentary Counsel has confirmed that the retention of initial capital letters in the defined term, "Transparency (Regulated Markets) Directive" in section 11, and its use in this form elsewhere in the Bill, are appropriate.I commend the amendments to the House.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I envisage a massive surge in political support for this group of amendments, particularly the later one proposing lower case "t."  The people of Kilkenny will rise up in adulation.I will make a general point on the substance of the amendments.  Some of the interpretation and adjudication will be carried out by IAASA, others by the Financial Regulator.  The Minister of State will be aware that I am seriously concerned about the number of regulators in the country.  Genuine confusion is creeping in over the number of obligations on businesses and consumers alike and over which regulator is responsible for which sector.  The State, inadvertently or otherwise, is allowing empire-building by regulatory bodies in addition to their regulatory functions.  In the budget, the Minister for Finance announced a number of measures to reduce the regulatory burden on small business, which I welcome.  Some 8,000 businesses of 250,000 in the sector will benefit, which is a welcome start, as I said during the course of the debate on the Financial Resolutions.This Bill provides for two bodies to adjudicate on transparency and financial control over shares, debentures and investments, which is a perfect example of the objective criticism I have had of the regulatory regime in recent years.  The time has come for synergy among regulators and, indeed, the Competition Authority.  Various professional studies have been carried out by the Competition Authority recently.  One such study into the Commission for Energy Regulation proposed a review of the structure of electricity and gas prices, rather than the substance of whether an increase in energy prices was appropriate.  Within days, the Commission for Energy Regulation decided to have a second look at the file and, instead of a massive increase of 34%, imposed an increase of 23%, for which we were supposed to be grateful.  The same regulator stated it could only set prices on an annual basis, which would have meant no further review until September 2007.  Regulators ended up with egg on their face after that decision and the time is appropriate for the Minister to review the role of the regulators, particularly those which affect the competitiveness of the country and the disposable income of households.  They should be forced to work with greater synergy, rather than having separate legal, financial and accountancy departments to make their decisions.At a time when the Minister of State is discussing the consolidation of company law, there is significant scope for the consolidation of these matters.  On Committee Stage, I tabled a number of amendments to this effect, but they were ruled out of order on the basis that they would incur a charge on the Exchequer.  I tabled them on the basis that they would save the Exchequer money.  Fewer people need to be involved in the regulation of taxis, aviation, energy or telecommunications whereas the Financial Regulator and the IAASA have been mentioned in this context.I hope that the Minister of State understands the context in which I am speaking and that when we address these issues, we should bring a number of the regulators before the committee to determine what they are doing daily and how it impacts on business and the disposable income of ordinary householders.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I fully support Deputy Hogan's comments.  Our political and administrative systems are relatively new to the world of the regulator and we have understandably taken our steer from the island across the water, as we have done traditionally.  We have also taken a steer from the framework directives and regulations proposed at European level.Irrespective of who was responsible, I am not sure that we could have got the matter right the first time because it is uncharted territory, but I am satisfied that in an economy and population of this size and a fairly homogeneous political society, having separate offices for the regulation of energy, telecommunications and so on was not the right thing to do.  I am saying this with the wisdom of hindsight, which is always right.The Labour Party has prepared a policy paper that I hope will be included in our manifesto.  It proposes a commission for regulation in which there would be a shared analysis of the economy's performance.  The analysis would be an agreed diagnosis and, while one cannot gender balance the Latin language, a gender-balanced triumvirate would have the wisdom of three heads rather than one.  In the case of utilities rather than commercial undertakings, there are only one, two or three players.  If there is a personality clash between the regulator and the chief executive officers of the operations, there can be unforeseen and unnecessary side effects.While I welcome the Bill and thank the Minister of State and his officials and colleagues for taking on board some of the spirit of the suggestions made on Committee Stage, which is the manner in which such legislation should be handled, we need wisdom and humility when examining how the system works.  This is the area of our open and globalised economy that we control, namely, it is not subject to fluctuations in oil prices.  If we do not get it right, no one will get it right for us.Speaking as someone committed to the European project, Ministers and not just civil servants have been too eager to comply with standards set in Brussels without being satisfied that their eagerness is balanced by a critical analysis of what suits the State's terrain and the size of the economy and its players.  We have been more dutiful than many member states.The Bill is based on what we have learned and will continue to learn.  The closed cross-subsidisation that was the national marketplace of many EU countries is no longer the case and the matter of regulation is fraught with complexity.  Due to the high cost base of our economy, we do not need to overburden our performers when competing with many lower cost competitors.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	299	The question of competitiveness has raised its head.  In the past year or so, Vice President Günter Verheugen of the European Commission has published a paper calling for a 25% reduction in regulation.  I do not know to what degree that proposal has been developed, but it is concentrating the minds of Commissioners.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	301	At a meeting, Commissioner Verheugen wondered why strange regulations, such as those regarding straight bananas, were being made.  He went on to say that people are trying to justify their existence.Deputy Hogan raised an important issue.  We want to reduce the burden of compliance and section 6 goes a long way towards doing so.  The Financial Regulator and the IAASA will operate in this area, but they will do different jobs.  While there was much discussion on whether financial recording should be handled by the Financial Regulator, it will be dealt with by the IAASA, which includes people with experience in auditing and financial reporting.  The Financial Regulator will deal with the issue of share prospectuses, the trading of shares and the EU transparency directive.There will be no duplication of work, but the two authorities will share information.  The Deputy was right to raise the matter of duplication, but we examined the issue to ensure that another empire-building organisation was not being set up.  I agree wholeheartedly on the need to ensure an examination of the question of regulation, which the Minister, Deputy Martin, will do before he rides off into the sunset.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 3, lines 30 to 32, to delete all words from and including "com-" in line 30 down to and including "Centre" in line 32 and substitute the following:"commonly known as a Citizens Information Service (CIS) [being an independent non-statutory body Incorporated and Limited by the Guarantee of its Members] or a Citizens Information Centre (CIC) [being an Unincorporated body operating under the authority of a CIS]".The Minister for Social and Family Affairs was disinclined to accept the amendment on Committee Stage because he felt outlining the status of the citizens information service and citizens information centres was superfluous.  However, unfortunately, I refer to a second issue, which I did not raise previously, that obliges him to accept the amendment.  A serious drafting error has been made.  The Bill refers to "citizen information service" and "citizen information centres" but the plural should apply.  These are usually known as citizens information centres and citizens information service.  The only way to address this in the legislation is to accept my amendment.  This places the Minister for Education and Science in a difficult position because if it is not accepted, the legislation will be passed with incorrect titles for both the service and centres involved.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The issue raised by the Deputy has been checked and the plural of the word is the correct version and, for that reason, it is not proposed to accept the amendment.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	335	Therefore, the amendment is being accepted.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	337	Does the Minister not understand the Bill, as drafted, refers to the singular for both bodies?  That cannot be corrected unless an amendment is made.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I am assured by the officials that they have confirmed this is the correct form.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	339	They are wrong.  The centres are know as citizens information centres and the legislation is titled the Citizens Information Bill, which is intended to streamline and co-ordinate services, names and branding.  Citizens information centres are referred to in the singular in the legislation.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	340	The main purpose in including the citizens information services and citizens information centres in the definition of "voluntary bodies" is to provide statutory recognition for these frontline services, which form the primary channel through which information on social and civil rights and entitlements is provided to the public.  However, the Deputy is questioning the use of the word "citizen" as opposed to "citizens" in their titles, not their inclusion.

It is important that the emphasis on the citizens information board is also highlighted in Irish.

I have ensured that the line "advocacy, information and advice" will be present wherever the title is used.  The word advocacy will always appear as a strap line and that is very important.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	366	The board's intention is to promote the new personal advocacy service as a distinct service and to target people with disabilities and those who work with them.  On the passing of the legislation, the statutory body will be called the citizens information board, an bord um fhaisnéis do shaoránaigh.  However, the board's important function in the provision of advocacy services will be referenced in the strap line and it will read "information, advice and advocacy".My first instinct is always to support the Irish language title but there was a greater priority in this case to tidy up and create a brand we can sell, one that everybody, particularly visitors, can immediately grasp.  I felt that this service was spread all over the place between Comhairle, Oasis and citizens information boards and needed to be unified and tidied up.  Though I can see the other perspective, this view means that the service must do what it says on the tin, that is, information will be provided to people across all State services.  It is best to simply call the service what it is.  It would be ironic if a board with €24 million of State money, charged with giving information, could not give information about itself in simple, clear terms.On this occasion we will not be able to satisfy our great love of the Irish language and the requirement to put everything in the title, such as "advocacy, information and advice", though this phrase will be in the strap line.  I think this is the best way forward, though I understand the other view.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	367	Amendment No. 6 is a technical alternative to amendment No. 5.

I will, consequently, press my amendment.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 6, line 45, after "behalf" to insert ", either at all or in an effective manner,".We had an extensive discussion on this matter on Committee Stage and I do not wish to unduly prolong the issue as I heard the Minister's point of view at that stage.  Comhairle can only provide an advocacy service for children under 18 years of age when it is not reasonable to expect that a parent or guardian would be able to act on behalf of a child.  The Labour Party believes the Bill should be broad enough to cover a situation where a parent is able to act on behalf of a child, but is not sufficiently skilled to do so in an effective manner.  Advocacy could be needed in such a situation but I have heard the Minister's views in that regard and I do not think he will accept this amendment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I accept the good intent behind this amendment but I feel requiring the director to consider whether a parent could act effectively on behalf of a child, when considering entitlement to a personal advocate, would make qualifying conditions for the service more stringent.  This amendment could be counterproductive in practice because it introduces to the qualifying criteria the notion of whether a parent is in a position to act at any level on behalf of a child.The word "effective" introduces a judgmental angle to the legislation which could have the opposite of the good effect the Deputy seeks.  For that reason the legislation is best left as it is in this regard.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 7, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:"(5) Each application for a personal advocate shall be considered within a reasonable timeframe of the date of application.".We discussed this issue on Committee Stage.  The amendment tries to insert a timeframe in the Bill as no specific timeframe is indicated.  All the Bill stipulates with regard to dealing with applications is "within a reasonable timeframe".  The amendment tries to give some impetus so that each application will be considered within a reasonable timeframe from the date of application.  I am concerned that because of the lack of a timeframe people could be left waiting for some time, despite the fact that is not the intention of either the Minister or the Oireachtas.  Other legislation has a provision such as that provided by this amendment in order to give some impetus and to place an onus on the people providing the service.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The amendment is not necessary.  The strategic and business plans of the citizens information board, now Comhairle, should include — I will seek to ensure they do — some kind of time target.  To put it into legislation could have the kind of effect mentioned previously, as for example in the planning area where people kept returning for more information and the issue ended up going round in circles.  Not including it means that in many cases decisions can be made more quickly.  We can achieve the same objective by ensuring that some kind of time targets are included in the strategic plan of the new board.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	378	The Minister seems to be contradicting himself.  He says that he will not include any time target in the legislation, but he says he will include specified targets in the guidelines.  He criticises their inclusion in the Bill by saying if they are included, we will end up with a situation like that in the planning area.  If he is going to include them in the guidelines, he may be hoist with his own petard when he ends up with the same problem as that in the planning area.  The amendment is quite modest and only suggests that every application should be considered within a reasonable timeframe.  Therefore, if someone was left waiting a long time, the impetus would be in the Bill to deal with the situation.  If the Minister intends including a similar provision in the strategic plan, he can fall back on the primary legislation and say that it was the wish of the Oireachtas that a reasonable timeframe be set.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I do not have a problem with what the Deputy is trying to achieve.  At one level it is reasonable to use the word "reasonable" in legislation.  However, at another level an army of lawyers could spend time dealing with what is "reasonable" where somebody has a particular advocacy issue.  "Reasonable" for that person might be two days, but "reasonable" in other circumstances could be two months.  What the Deputy seeks appears reasonable, but in the circumstances it is better to try to include the timeframe in the strategic plan.We are feeling our way somewhat.  We need to know how many cases there will be and the kind of processing time required.  The situation is too new for us to lay down a firm deadline which could end up being counterproductive.  It is something for the future.  Perhaps it should happen once the system is flowing.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 11, line 44, after "advocate" to insert "is instructed to do so or".I made the point on Committee Stage that it is a strange advocate who is not liable to instructions from his or her client.  The wording of the Bill seems to leave it up to the advocate as to whether to launch an appeal, for example, against the refusal of a social welfare entitlement.  That is incorrect in principle and should not be accepted in any legal situation.  It is surely a matter for the applicant for payment, the client, to decide whether to appeal a refusal of payment.  The Minister made a counter argument in that regard which I will probably hear again.  Therefore, I will not press the amendment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	381	The point I made on Committee Stage was that the legislation requires the advocate to act in the best interests of the person.  The advocate is statutorily required to do so.  It may not always be simple to take direct instruction and therefore it is better to rely on the legislative requirement to act in the best interests of the person.  The giving, receiving and misunderstanding of instructions could cause a difficulty.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	382	I move amendment No. 11:
In page 13, line 45, to delete "3" and substitute "4".On Committee Stage, the Minister undertook to come back on this important issue, but I am not sure whether he has reconsidered his position.  The element of the Bill this amendment seeks to amend has to do with the reduction in size of the board to make it more manageable and the consequent reduction in quorums to allow meetings take place regularly.  This is something with which I agree, but the effect of one of the changes proposed by the Minister means the proportion of people representing those with disabilities will reduce from 25% to 20% on the new smaller board.  I want to remedy that.  There were five representatives on the old board, but the Minister wants three on the new board.  Four would be a fairer figure and would keep up the proportion of representatives of people with disability on the new board.  On those grounds I press my amendment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	383	We are reducing the size of the board from 20 to 15 for operational efficiency.  The percentages are tweaked as a result and there is a reduction from 25% to 20% in the representation of people with disabilities.  I undertook to take account of that when making appointments.  That is the better route to take at this stage.When one reduces a board dramatically, one gets this type of distortion in the percentage membership.  I remind the Deputy that the board still has statutory requirements and is required to take certain actions to support people with disabilities.  The composition of the board is critical.  However, no matter who is on the board, it has a statutory duty to act in a certain way.  I am confident we will have a board that will achieve that.  I stress that there was no agenda here.  The reduction in the percentage is purely consequential from when the board membership was reduced from 20 to 15.  I will try to take full account of the reduction when making appointments to the board.

In page 14, between lines 42 and 43, to insert the following:"(2) The Principal Act and this Act may be cited together as the Citizens' Information Acts 2000 and 2006.".This is an amendment the Minister can accept.  It is a collective citation to a Bill and brings some formality to it.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I propose to accept the amendment subject to one change.  There should be no apostrophe after "Citizens" in line with the word used in the Short Title of the Bill, Citizens Information Act 2006.  The marginal note will also be changed by the Bills Office to read "Short Title, collective citation and commencement".

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	388	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I express my appreciation that the House has facilitated my Department in taking this Bill at short notice.This short Bill, the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 2006, has a simple but important objective, namely, to increase the statutory limit on the cumulative capital outlay, commitments and liabilities that the Irish Film Board may incur.  As is the case with some statutory bodies that receive public funding, a limit was set by statute on such outlay when the Irish Film Board Act 1980 was enacted.  The Houses of the Oireachtas must update this limit every three to five years.The Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act 2000 increased the limit from £30 million to £80 million or approximately €101.5 million.  In the absence of amending legislation, spending by the Irish Film Board, inclusive of the recently announced additional allocation, will reach this statutory limit by year end.  It is now proposed, therefore, to increase this limit to €200 million to allow the board to continue to operate within an appropriate statutory limit, subject to the normal annual Estimates process.The Irish Film Board has a dual mandate to develop Irish film-making talent which can engage audiences at home and abroad while maintaining and building the resources, craft and skills of the industry through attracting international productions to Ireland.  Evidence of the necessity for this legislation is borne out by the activity of the board in recent times.  Following the publication of the 1998 strategic review of the Irish audiovisual industry, known as the Kilkenny report, key Government decisions were taken to assign a central place in Ireland's industrial policy to the audiovisual production industry.  This included a restructuring of the board which resulted in its staffing numbers increasing from four in 2000 to its current staffing complement of 16.  The board's staff have direct industry experience and are experts in the field.In the same period, the board's Exchequer current and capital funding has risen from a total of €10.16 million in 2000 to €19.4 million by the end of 2006, almost a doubling in its funding.  In the past six years, the environment in which the board operates has undergone massive and constant evolution and development, both domestically and internationally.  I am pleased the board has reflected and adapted to these changes.  As is only too well known, one cannot stand still in any endeavour if it is to succeed and the film sector is no exception.  One must adapt to changing circumstances, including in the type of projects being developed, the audiences to be reached and the markets to be targeted.The Irish Film Board, with Government support, has adopted a strategic approach to meeting these challenges.  Through its varied schemes and programmes, it aims to assist projects at the earliest stage of development, through the pre-production phase to production and post-production.  It has established clear polices, from bringing forward and nurturing talent using its short film schemes, up to its most recent initiative for company development, which is aimed at moving forward with a number of more established companies in streamlining their funding structures.In addition, through its funding of Screen Training Ireland, in conjunction with FÁS, the board addresses the needs of the industry at entry level.  Thus, training supports can be put in place to match the requirements of the marketplace and render its participants relevant to the sector they want to enter.  In this regard, it is noteworthy that between 2000 and 2005 an average of 630 participants have undertaken professional training annually.As is evident from the award of a short film Oscar for "Six Shooter" and the Palme d'Or for "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" at the Cannes Film Festival, these policies are working.  As I said at the time, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" would shake Fine Gael.

#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	390	A civil war story with a €6 million budget which received €500,000 in funding from the Irish Film Board, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" subsequently became the highest grossing independent Irish film ever at the Irish box office.  To date, the film has taken more than €20 million worldwide, proving that there is an international market for Irish stories.  It is safe to conclude, therefore, that there is real progress and cause for optimism for the Irish film industry.Film is not just about talent but is a key sector, which has become an international commodity, driven by economic incentives in an ever changing environment.  This, combined with the current dollar exchange rate imbalances, domestic US incentives and low cost regimes in some eastern member states of the European Union has resulted in fewer big budget projects from the United States being attracted here than previously.  In addition, one cannot deny the effect of the recently approved UK scheme on the Irish position and we will continue to monitor the situation.The Government is aware of the needs of the sector and the need to react to such changes.  We were pleased, therefore, to have been able to improve the scope of the section 481 scheme in the Finance Act 2006 and thereby maintain Ireland's position as an attractive location.  In an increasingly competitive international environment, I am pleased the board has been able to continue to effectively discharge its vital role of promoting our indigenous film industry and marketing Ireland as a location for international productions.This has brought direct results.  This year has been an exciting and productive one for the film industry.  Production activity returned to high levels.  As proof of this, some 38 projects were certified under the section 481 tax incentive scheme in 2006, with a total Irish spend of €115.6 million.  This is an increase from 28 projects in 2005 when the spend was €64 million.  Included in the 2006 figures is a small number of large budget projects, chief among them being the television series, "The Tudors" and "Rough Diamond", as well as the television movie, "Northanger Abbey".  Looking to 2007, the board has succeeded in attracting new projects, including the feature film, "Dorothy Mills", and television film, "My Boy Jack", as well as further series of "The Tudors" and "Murphy's Law".In 2006 alone, the film sector generated the equivalent expenditure of the Irish Film Board since its inception, a remarkable rate of return by any measure.  As can be seen from the board's annual review of 2006, which I had the pleasure of launching last night, the board's film location division succeeded in attracting 13 live action film and television dramas and provided logistical support to a further 13 local and film and television productions.  Altogether these 26 projects had combined budgets of approximately €113 million and contributed almost €70 million in Irish expenditure in the Irish film industry.While Ireland can hold its own due to our talent pool and incentives package, we cannot become complacent.  We must continue to search for and avail of any comparative advantage we can find and be active in the marketplace.  With this in mind, the Irish Film Board has risen to this challenge with the recent establishment of an Irish Film Board office in Los Angeles, a move I had proposed having visited the city.  I expect this office will achieve much in raising awareness of the Irish industry in the United States.  The board has also put in place a Dublin film partnership scheme, a one-stop shop for potential producers seeking to produce projects in the city.  This grouping, encompassing businesses and public sector interests in the city, facilitates overcoming the practical obstacles inherent in bringing a production to fruition.Although 2005 and 2006 have been challenging years for production, indigenous films, supported by the Irish Film Board, have continued to perform to critical acclaim both at home and at festivals around the world.  Titles such as "Adam and Paul", "The Mighty Celt", "Breakfast on Pluto", "Isolation", "Pavee Lackeen" and, as already mentioned, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" have been extremely well received by audiences and critics throughout the year.  Further affirmation in this respect are the nominations at world-renowned festivals in which Irish talent is well represented.I appreciate the Deputies' co-operation in expediting the enactment of this short but vital Bill and commend it to the House.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I was only too pleased to facilitate the Minister in introducing the legislation.  The Fine Gael Party always facilitates positive measures by the Minister.  While the Irish film industry has been successful over the years, nevertheless a number of important questions arise for the future.  I will avail of the opportunity afforded by this debate to pose some questions to the Minister.No feature film has been made in Ireland in the past five years.  The last one to be made was "King Arthur".  Other competing destinations have improved on our incentive scheme.  Some years ago I met members of a committee from the House of Commons who came to examine our scheme when "Braveheart" was filmed here.  The United Kingdom now has an incentive scheme which not alone matches ours but has improved upon it.  Seven states in the United States now give incentives to the film industry which are greater than ours.  Even though we raised the cap and improved the incentives last year, we are not attracting major films with budgets in the region of €100 million.  The cap must be raised, while a write-off of more than 80% must be allowed.  The Minister must make proposals to the Minister for Finance to include such measures in the Finance Bill to help the film industry.Statistics contained in the IBEC report referred substantially to 2005 but the Minister has quoted figures for 2006.  However, I believe an unpublished PricewaterhouseCoopers report states we are not in contention for major film productions and recommends concentration on smaller indigenous productions with budgets of up to €30 million, as well as more TV productions.  Can the Minister respond to the recommendations in this unpublished report?There is a major question mark against the future of Ardmore Studios.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers report states the studio is no longer attractive for major film productions, as it does not have the necessary scope or facilities.  The report recommends that it be closed and that the Government provide a film centre.  It should be a flexible, multi-purpose centre capable of being used at different locations.  The report recommends an investment in the region of €30 million in this project.  Can the Minister refer to this?  The Government has made huge investments in the Abbey Theatre, the National Concert Hall and the Wexford opera house, while major commitments have been made to the national cultural institutions.  If it is committed to the film industry, it should seriously consider the provision of a national film centre.I have experience of the Irish Film Board through my occasional involvement with film productions.  I found it extraordinary that a documentary on Con Houlihan, for whom the Minister has great respect, had been refused funding on four occasions by the board which could not see the merit of the documentary which RTE broadcast on two occasions.  It attracted an audience of 350,000, despite being shown late in the evening.  I hope the present membership of the Irish Film Board has a greater appreciation of the real culture and heritage of Ireland than the members who refused funding for that documentary and have a greater sense of what projects should be undertaken.  I hope individuals currently involved in documentary production will not have the same experience as I had.  There are wonderful opportunities to produce TV documentaries, as important stories remain to be told and researched.  There is potential for top class indigenous proposals.We must insist on quality production, better camera and sound work and a high technical standard.  Scripting is also very important.  We must produce top quality scriptwriters.  Most productions depend on a good scriptwriter.  Historical accuracy and continuity demand good scriptwriting.  Very good work is being done in the Institute of Art, Design and Technology in Dún Laoghaire but we must examine the education system to see how we can encourage the directors, producers, camera people, sound technicians and make-up artists of the future.The decision of Morgan O'Sullivan who has been one of the great drivers of the Irish film industry to leave the country makes a statement about the future of major film production here.  The Minister has a representative in Los Angeles but the person concerned will find it very difficult to attract major productions to Ireland.  The production of "The Tudors" has remained here because of the incentives provided by the Irish Film Board.  Nevertheless, the fact that Morgan O'Sullivan has left the country and that no major productions have been attracted in the past five years indicates that the international industry is extremely competitive and that it will be difficult to attract major productions to Ireland.I ask the Minister to refer to the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on the film industry.  Will it be published?  I understand it contains major recommendations.  Will the Minister take the opportunity provided by the Finance Bill to improve section 481 and provide better incentives for film-making?  Will he look at what is being done in the United Kingdom, eastern Europe and New Zealand and improve on their incentives?Filming in Dublin is given a major advantage over filming in the rest of the country by the SIPTU 40 mile rule.  Some years ago Hallmark filmed "Jurango", which is based on a book by John B. Keane, in Dublin rather than north Kerry because of this rule.  Workers who travel more than 40 miles from home must be given overnight accommodation and greater expenses.  Has the Government attempted to discuss this rule with SIPTU?  The rule ensures rural areas are disadvantaged.  Many production companies would prefer to film in rural areas which are more appropriate to the subject matter of their films, but they are prevented from doing so by the economic constraint of the 40 mile rule.  I ask the Minister to respond to the issues I have raised.

It increases to €200 million the maximum amount of money which can be spent to support Irish film and make the country competitive for film making through the Irish Film Board.  We have reached the £80 million ceiling which was put in place previously.  I presume the idea of resetting the upper limit every few years is to provide the House with an opportunity to review the way in which money is being spent.  We will have to revert in three or four years to produce a further amendment Bill to increase the threshold from €200 million to, one presumes, €300 million.  It is a welcome approach.  We often complain on this side of the House that the Government is not accountable or transparent enough in its approach to spending.  The measure before us is one of the few positive examples of oversight whereby we are forced every few years to reconsider the way in which money has been spent.I agree with Deputy Deenihan on promoting indigenous film production companies and the worry that we are not as competitive as we were a few years ago in attracting large-scale film productions to Ireland.  Attracting productions is not only about specific films, but about promoting the island of Ireland.  The Minister would receive support from Fine Gael if he were to constructively revise taxation policy in this area to make Ireland as competitive as it needs to be to attract film productions.The main issue I wish to address is subtitling of films.  There is a role for the Irish Film Board to ensure that everyone can access films in the cinema or on video or DVD if that is their choice.  We have attempted half-heartedly to address subtitling in broadcasting legislation, which has not worked.  We appealed to RTE, TV3 and others to put subtitling in place on a form of voluntary basis on a higher percentage of their programmes.  The Minister will be aware of these matters as there is a strong deaf community in County Kerry.  They have been campaigning for a long time to ensure that when members of the community attend the cinema, they can access films in the way the rest of us can.The Irish Film Board may be the vehicle through which to address the issue.  It is a matter on which I would like the Minister to respond.  We are required to take action under Television Without Frontiers, the upcoming EU legislation.  Governments will have to put in place plans to address the accessibility of programming and films through subtitling as well as other methods of increasing access by the deaf community.  Consideration of the matter would be welcomed strongly by the deaf and hard of hearing community.  It is not before time to act as other countries have already managed this very effectively.  While we have made some improvements in the past ten years in Ireland, our provisions fall far short of what is required.  As the necessary technology is available, there is no reason a deaf or hard of hearing person should be unable to access films at the cinema in the same way as those of us who can hear.  I would appreciate in response as precise an outline of the Minister's views as possible.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill 2006.  It is important legislation which gives us an opportunity to participate in a debate on the film industry.  I feel very strongly that the Irish film industry needs our support and welcome the further investment set out in the Bill.The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Irish Film Board (Amendment) Act 2000 to increase from £80 million to €200 million the maximum of the aggregate amount of any investments, loans, grants or moneys provided by the board towards the cost of making films and training in all aspects of film making.  It is necessary to deal with this issue head-on.The film industry is very important given the high level of creative talent in Ireland, which needs to be developed.  We need radical change and greater confidence among people who deal with the arts generally.  We must consider the positive contribution of the film industry and its potential to provide employment in the State.  There is significant potential to take on young people to develop their many skills and talents.  It is very relevant in the modern age, especially when one considers the growth of IT and the development of technology.  Employment is very important.  Coláiste Dhúlaigh, a college of further education in Coolock in my constituency, runs an excellent film-making course in which many young people are involved.  Last Wednesday, I had the Minister for Education and Science in my constituency to work with the young people at the college on the issue.  She saw their work at first hand.  I hope she will support the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism at Cabinet and when he lobbies the Minister for Finance for support for the film industry.The Irish Film Board must be radical, brave and creative.  These issues must be dealt with.  There are many Irish companies that want to develop their skills and resources.  Many small, Irish film companies make an excellent contribution to television and film and have great potential to grow further.  As legislators, it is up to us to support them.  I know many of the people involved in the industry who are making a significant contribution to the State.  It is important to maintain the high standards and quality of work of these companies.  We have the best of scriptwriters in the State, many of whom come from the north side of Dublin.  They have made a significant contribution to the development of the film industry.  When a country has talented writers, it is important to support them.We must face the reality of an economy in which everyone is very busy working.  In a recent poll, 82% of respondents said they did not have enough time due to the demands of work to enjoy films, the arts and live theatre.  The sad downside of a booming economy is our seeming inability to manage our time.  We must manage our time and resources positively and constructively.  We cannot allow 82% of the potential market to continue to be unable to enjoy and facilitate the arts, including film making, due to the demands of family circumstances and work.  Given that economic growth of 5.25% is expected over the next couple of years, I urge the Cabinet to put resources into the film industry.  I welcome the positive developments in the film industry.  We can no longer use the excuse that we do not have the money for investment.  That debate is over.  The debate now is about how we distribute the resources.We should always respect the film makers, artists and writers who have made a massive contribution to the country.  Many of them, with small budgets, have put Ireland on the map internationally in the context of the arts, music, drama and film making.  It is important to recognise this.  As legislators we have a duty to lead this debate and support these people.  There is nothing wrong with supporting and rewarding the talented and creative people we have on the island.  Now that we are in a new mode on this island with the development of the peace process, there is great potential for the many artists and film makers coming onto the pitch.It is important not to be in any way negative or hostile towards people, particularly young people, who come up with new ideas and who are radical and creative.  The youth of this country have a major contribution to make to the development of the film industry.  Dáil na nÓg made a submission to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights this morning.  The delegates were pushing the agenda of youth and that agenda included cultural issues, artists, film making and music.  Not enough support is given to the people involved in this area.  We need to focus on them.  We have some fantastic musicians and writers in the State and we have a responsibility to support them.  They are on different parts of the island but the north side of Dublin is particularly lucky to have many talented and creative people who have made a massive contribution.In the context of history, films such as "Michael Collins" and "The Wind That Shakes The Barley" make a very important contribution to Irish life by opening up the debate on Irish history and challenging those who have a revisionist view of history.  We should not be afraid to have this debate.  Let us thank the film makers for provoking the debate because in any democracy debate leads to a healthier democracy.  A group is currently trying to launch a film about James Connolly which I ask the Minister to support because the republican-labour tradition on the island has been neglected for many years.  James Connolly put social issues on the agenda at a time of great political turmoil on the island and our children and grandchildren would learn valuable lessons from a film about him.  I urge those with an interest in James Connolly and in the republican-labour tradition to support this project which challenges the revisionist view of history and provokes debate, which is healthy in a democracy, and also gives everybody an opportunity to make a contribution.The Irish Film Board (Amendment) Bill contains many progressive measures, which I support.  However, the Minister has a responsibility to lead in supporting the Irish Film Board and the film industry on this island.  There is great potential in the film industry and we have only tapped a small part of that, given the talent and creativity that is obvious when one meets particular groups.  I welcome this debate and this important legislation.  It is a start, but we need to do much more.  This is a non-political issue.  The arts, creativity, and the film industry are positive and good for the island and should be supported.  I would like to see an all-island approach to the issue, having met many creative people from Northern Ireland who are very anxious to get involved in making films and support the arts in Ireland.  We should not shy away from the potential that exists in that respect,  It is up to everyone in this House to support the Bill.

However, I will avail of part of this slot and Deputy Ó Snodaigh will avail of the remainder.I broadly welcome the Bill before us.  The Green Party supports the idea of increasing the capacity of the Irish Film Board to invest and use that investment to increase both the number of projects and their economic benefit in the country.  The Minister has highlighted the increase in the number of projects and the value of the projects with money invested in Ireland in 2006 to date over the figure for 2005.One concern is that the listing supplied by the Minister consists largely of television projects.  However, one of the remits of the Irish Film Board is to get an appropriate balance between mainstream cinema, television and new media, which is not mentioned in this Bill.  I also regret that this debate is so truncated that we do not have an opportunity of discussing the wider issues because visual media, especially the new media, IT the use of computers, and home computers in particular, is very much where this industry is heading both in terms of downloads of mainstream cinema and the popularity of websites such as YouTube.  The Irish Film Board therefore needs to have in place a strategy to adapt to the new reality that is new media and new film making.  This Bill could have provided an opportunity to address some of those issues to put the policy remit in its new context.  Unfortunately today is the last day of the session before Christmas and another piece of legislation is being rushed.There are other aspects of the work of the Irish Film Board that deserve comment, for instance, the support in regard to festivals such as the Cork Film Festival, which is the major international film festival here.  As a Cork Deputy I very much welcome that.  The inclusion of a competition element in festivals, concentrating on short films in particular, is something the Cork Film Festival has greatly encouraged  in recent years.  It is fairly apt, given that in literature terms Cork is also the Irish centre for the short story as much as anything else.  The idea of promoting short films both as a way of training film makers and those involved in film production, and of valuing the short film as an art form in itself, is something the Minister commented on in his opening speech, and the Green Party would be very supportive of such measures.Another aspect of Irish Film Board's work on which I would like to comment in the brief time that is available to me is the need for clearer policy statements as to where we stand on the idea of co-production.  Where is the added value that the country achieves subsequently?  The Minister has mentioned "The Wind That Shakes The Barley", a film made in Ireland with Irish actors, by a British director, largely funded from outside of this country, yet reflecting a period of this country's history.  If we want cultural statements and historical statements to go out about who we are as a people, the production element of any large-scale film is something over which we need to have more control.Another aspect of many of the films that have been made in Ireland in the past number of years, valuable as they have been, is that the film makers have used Ireland merely as a staging post.  The background was irrelevant.  They were here because of the tax incentives.  It did not really matter whether "King Arthur" was made in Ireland or in New Zealand.  We need a film industry which will reflect Ireland culturally, as the Spanish and Polish film industries have been doing for several decades.  The Minister needs to look to his policy remit by offering more guidance through legislation and in terms of how resources are provided by the Irish Film Board to bring us to that level.While this Bill is limited in scope to the capacity of the Irish Film Board to invest and the House is united in wanting to ensure it invests wisely, I hope the Minister will give us the opportunity of holding a serious debate on the future of the Irish film industry.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this Bill which I hope will ensure the Irish Film Board's work is not restricted by a lack of funding.  The Bill will enable the board to deal with the ongoing evolution in the domestic and international film industry.  It is important for the economy, as well as our prestige internationally, that we sustain the commendable work carried out by the Irish Film Board.  Last year, the number of films completed was substantially higher than in the previous year.  Some of the earlier downturn in film production could have been the result of the uncertainty surrounding the future section 481 but, thankfully, that issue has been addressed.The film industry has significant employment potential.  Even though employment in the industry is not usually permanent because of the cyclical nature of film production, we need to ensure workers are fully protected.  In that regard, the labour inspectorate should be asked to investigate the practices of certain companies.  I am aware, for example, of a large post-production company in Dublin which abuses young people by making them work long hours for approximately €3 per hour.  Deputy Morgan is confirming that scandal and will be raising it on an ongoing basis until it is addressed.  The same company appears to be placing people on night shifts regardless of whether they have already worked a day shift.  Such practices leave a bad feeling in my mouth and they should be stopped.The greater the number of films made in Ireland through the encouragement of the Irish Film Board, the stronger will be the creative side of Irish society.  Irish films offer a vehicle to show the world the beauty of our cities and countryside and an opportunity to tell a wider audience the stories of generations of Irish people.  The spectacular box office success of "The Wind that Shakes the Barley" demonstrates that money can be made from investing in films and this will hopefully encourage Irish investors.  I support Deputy Finian McGrath in calling on investors to consider projects currently in gestation, such as the film about James Connolly to which the Deputy referred.  The support of Deputies has been sought for this project and I hope we will be able to augment any contributions made by the Irish Film Board if that project gets under way so the world can understand the influence Mr. Connolly had not only in Ireland but also in England and the United States.By passing this Bill, we will enable the Irish Film Board to fully meet its responsibilities.  I hope we will be debating a further extension next year because, by spending the €200 million it has been allocated, the board will have made a sound investment in terms of supporting successful films.  The economy can only benefit from the returns and tourism generated.  Molaim an Bille.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I thank Deputies for their valuable contributions to the debate on this essential Bill.With regard to projects certified under section 481, this was a unique provision when it was first introduced in Ireland but, naturally, it was quickly copied elsewhere when it proved successful.  I have substantially enhanced that section but the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Gordon Brown, who has a personal interest in film, introduced a similar incentive scheme in Britain.  We must now consider how we can improve our scheme and decide whether we should begin negotiations with a view towards finding areas of compatibility rather than engaging in a Dutch auction.  The effect of section 481 in terms of the number of films certified in 2006 is encouraging.  Between 1994 and 2001, €581.8 million was certified under the section, while €62.2 million was certified in 2002, €84.8 million in 2003, €58.1 million in 2004 and €54.8 million in 2005.  The decrease in 2005 reflected a degree of uncertainty with regard to the future of the provision but this year has seen a significant increased to €110.5 million.Ireland attracts more television projects than elsewhere because we are unique in offering incentives for television production, whereas other jurisdictions only support films.The Irish Film Board is aware of the importance of production infrastructure to the film industry including, in particular, the viability of Ardmore Studios, and it keeps this area under constant review.  I expect the board to keep me informed of developments regarding requirements for film productions, including matters pertaining to Ardmore Studios.  It is important to point out that the Government's support for the Irish Film Board has grown by 93% over the last five years.  The Government has ensured the security of the film sector by enabling the board to continue to support training, production and development and the introduction of new initiatives, in keeping with the development and demands of the sector.  Some 740 applications, on average, were made each year to the Irish Film Board between 2003 and 2005.  Approximately 25% of those applications were successful.Value for money is a particularly important aspect of this matter.  The Irish Film Board's production-investment outlay has a leveraging factor of almost 1:10.  Production in this sector was stimulated between 1993 and 2005 by the distribution through the board of €50.02 million of production loans in respect of feature films, television drama and animation.  The productions in question had a combined budget of €482.65 million.  In other words, for every €1 of Irish Film Board investment, almost €10 was generated by the industry.One of the key strategies of the Irish Film Board is the development of talent, for example through screen training.  It engages with new talent by means of the short film schemes, for example.  Such talent is nurtured further by Screen Training Ireland.  Scripts and ideas for screenplays are subsequently developed.  Money may be invested in those screenplays.  Most projects which have received production loans from the Irish Film Board over the last five years were developed from the script stage.There is a tremendous amount of film-making activity in the regions.  Projects have been shot in counties Donegal, Kilkenny, Louth, Monaghan, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Sligo, Leitrim, Galway, Kildare, Meath, Wicklow and Dublin since 2000.  In 2004, the Irish Film Board established the regional film and television fund to encourage film-making throughout the country.  The fund aims to make the most of the wealth of locations in Ireland and to generate regional film and television activity.  It is appropriate that a film called "The Running Mate", which should be shown on TG4 soon, has been shot in County Kerry in recent times.  I understand the film is about a fellow running for the Dáil in the Kerry North constituency.  I do not know whether the film has any relevance to Deputy Deenihan.

As Deputy Coveney pointed out, it is considered prudent to keep the limit at a certain level to make it necessary to review the amounts every four or five years and to provide an opportunity for periodic debate.  I was asked whether the proposed sum is high enough.  Without pre-empting what might be allocated in the annual Estimates process, I consider than an increase of €100 million over four or five years is sufficient, especially as the capital allocation for 2007 is €17 million.The issue of captioning, which was mentioned during the debate, comes under the aegis of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The matter may be discussed with the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in the context of the television without frontiers directive.The Irish Film Board has demonstrated on many occasions that it has a strong commitment to the development of the Irish language.  It has put in place a specific initiative to develop new talent in Irish language-related broadcasting.  I refer to the development and production of short films, documentaries, drama, children's television and feature films in Irish.  In 2004, the board co-produced "Gearrscannáin", which is a compilation of Irish language short films for schools.  The production, which was embraced by the education sector, was distributed to every secondary school in Ireland.  In 2006, the board invested in two landmark Irish language projects — "Kings", which is a feature film adaptation of the play "The Kings of the Kilburn High Road", and "Aifric", which is a teen drama for TG4.In 2005, the Irish Film Board co-developed a pilot module of moving image studies for transition year students, to introduce them to the study of the contemporary moving image.  As the pilot was a success, a second phase of it will be rolled out to 60 schools throughout the country in 2007.  This project is in keeping with the board's strategic aim of developing new Irish audiences and new film-making talent.  In that context, I was pleased recently to make contributions of €100,000 to the Ark arts centre and of €50,000 to the National Association of Youth Drama.  These funds will help to stimulate an interest in the arts among young people.  Part of the additional allocation of €2.5 million that I recently made available to the Arts Council will be used to help the council to become involved in young people's initiatives.Ireland's recent success on the international film stage has been quite impressive.  It is significant that a number of Irish people have won Oscars in the last 25 years.  Josie MacAvin won the Oscar for art direction in 1985 for her work on "Out of Africa".  Daniel Day Lewis won the best actor Oscar in 1989 for his work on "My Left Foot".  Brenda Fricker won the best supporting actress Oscar in 1989 for her work on the same film.  Neil Jordan won the Oscar for best original screenplay in 1992 for his work on "The Crying Game".  Michelle Burke won the Oscar for best make-up in 1982 and 1992 for her work on "Quest for Fire" and "Bram Stoker's Dracula".  Peter O'Toole was awarded an honorary Oscar for acting in 2003.  Martin McDonagh won the best live action short film Oscar for "Six Shooter" earlier this year, which was wonderful.I was also asked about cross-Border initiatives.  The Irish Film Board works closely with the Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission on joint marketing activities, such as the annual Irish pavilion at the Cannes film festival.  Both bodies participate in joint promotional activities — they co-host inward trade missions and attend trade missions together overseas.  The board and the commission work together to invest in film, television and documentary projects.  The Northern Ireland Film and Television Commission took part in the Irish trade mission to India, which was led by the Taoiseach, in January of this year.  It subsequently co-hosted an inward trade mission involving key Indian film and television producers.  The commission is a member of the network of regional film offices.  Over the last three years, the agencies have co-invested in 12 film projects, representing one third of all Irish indigenous film production.  Many of those projects were shot in the Border region.Irish animation is highly regarded internationally for its ability to produce award-winning films which are independently financed and produced with a great amount of skill.  The Irish Film Board, which has been investing in Irish animation for over ten years, has developed and produced a considerable volume of Irish-generated film and television projects.  Such projects attract international financiers, broadcasters and audiences.  It is estimated that 300 full-time and freelance animators are working in the Irish animation sector.  The sector is bigger at present than it was in the 1990s when the Sullivan Bluth animation studios from the United States were based in Dublin.  Those studios established and upskilled the Irish animation sector.  Many third level sectors train those who wish to work in the sector, which is responsible for generating its own intellectual capital and is beginning to realise its significant export potential.  While I am talking about animation production, I should mention that "Give Up Your Aul Sins" was deservedly nominated for the Oscar for best animated short film.It is sometimes forgotten that the Irish Film Board has a relatively small number of staff.  Its full staffing complement is in the order of 16 extremely dedicated and committed people.  It is clear from the figures I have given to the House that the staff are worth their weight in gold.  They have done a great deal for the Irish film industry.  Everybody involved in the industry in Ireland and overseas thinks very highly of the board's workers and so do I.I hope the decision to locate Ireland's film ambassador in Hollywood will be of enormous benefit to the industry in the short and medium terms.  We will see how it works.  When I went to Los Angeles, I was advised by many people involved in the film industry that Ireland was at a disadvantage because it did not have a permanent presence there.  I expect the decision that has been taken, which should be welcomed, will give us an advantage.We should celebrate the success of Irish films this year.  I refer, for example, to the Oscar for best live action short film and the wonderful success of "The Wind that Shakes the Barley".  I am not sure whether it shook Fine Gael.

I said the British would not be claiming credit for it after they had seen it.  I was quite correct — they have not been claiming credit for it since then.  I doubt that Fine Gael will be claiming credit for it either.  In any event, we know it is just a film, even if it is evocative.  It was pointed out that it is important that films stimulate debate about our history.  It is important that, irrespective of the side of the equation one comes from, one enjoys the film.  There has been a great deal of enjoyment of Irish films this year and that is a wonderful tribute to the Irish Film Board and all involved in the industry.

That is a valid cost of production of the movie and funding should be available under the Irish Film Board in terms of production costs for partly or totally sponsoring the captioning costs of those films.

There was a project some time ago to set up local film boards but that does not appear to have been followed up.  It was before the setting up of the board proper.  Does the Minister know the number of people here who can become involved in film making and are we picking up on a significant number of those?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I understand that on average there are approximately 630 people involved in screen training.  There is a great deal of interest among young people in becoming involved in film and my hope is that the success we have experienced in 2006 should result in even more people becoming motivated.It is important to note that the Irish Film Board staff and the board work tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that Irish talent is available on the world stage.  That involves distributing short films to key industry personnel, locally and internationally; working with key film festivals to ensure that Irish films are considered for selection; membership of key promotional organisations such as European Film Promotion; and attendance at key events through the year to raise the profile of Irish film making talent.The Irish Film Board is a major funder of FÁS Screen Training Ireland, which is the organisation that provides continuing training for professionals in film, television, animation and digital media.  Between 2000 and 2005, an average of 630 participants have undertaken professional training with the organisation annually.  That is fairly encouraging.

Does the Minister have an update on that?  Obviously, FÁS will spearhead that media centre but it is important, from the point of view of film and audiovisual production, that this centre be provided in Tralee as soon as possible where some of our top technicians, camera people, producers and directors started their careers.  Will the Minister comment on that proposed media centre for Tralee or confirm that he supports it and that it will go ahead?  Also, what is the status of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report on the film industry?

The €200 million is State money but some of it will be used by the Irish Film Board.  Is there a local labour clause whereby film makers who are availing of opportunities in Ireland must employ Irish actors or expertise?  One of the films we praised earlier, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley", used a good deal of local labour including actors who had not been seen on screen previously but all the stunts were carried out by an English company, despite the fact that our stunt men do not have enough work to keep them busy throughout the year and must do other work.My other question concerns labour protections to ensure that the top standards we expect of all industries are implemented in this industry.

The Irish Film Board film commission acts as a focal point and information hub for the network of regional film offices to facilitate film making activity on the ground in the regions.  The members of the network are usually county and city councils.  Currently, there are 13 members, and included in those is Kerry.With regard to the Pricewaterhouse Coopers report, that report is still under consideration by the Irish Film Board.  I am waiting to hear from it in that regard.  I am sure the Deputy will raise the question again in the new year.  That is the current position.With regard to Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point on labour, first, there is a minimum wage here, as he is well aware, and, second, it would not be sustainable for us to insist that people working on films made here would be Irish because that would not be sustainable in European Union terms.

I commend the Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Bill to the House.  I am very pleased to have this opportunity to present the Bill for consideration by the House.The background to it is that the Good Friday Agreement provided for the establishment of six North-South bodies to take forward co-operation in specific areas, including aquaculture and fisheries in the Foyle and Carlingford areas.  The Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, which I will refer to as the commission, is one of the North-South bodies envisaged in the Agreement and was established under the British-Irish Agreement Act of March 1999.  The commission replaced the Foyle Fisheries Commission, which was established in 1952 to manage the fisheries resources of the Foyle area.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, the functions of the former Foyle Fisheries Commission in regard to the Foyle area were transferred to the commission.  These functions were also extended to the Carlingford area.The Loughs Agency is an agency of the commission and exercises the functions of the body in accordance with any directions given to it by the North-South Ministerial Council, to which it reports.  During suspension of the Assembly, decisions by the North-South Ministerial Council are taken by way of agreed interim procedures processes.  The Agreement also provided that the Loughs Agency would be given responsibility for aquaculture and fisheries related matters and should have powers for the promotion of development of Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough for commercial and recreational purposes.The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement in so far as the Loughs Agency is concerned.  Equivalent legislation is required in Northern Ireland, a draft of which has been published recently and is the subject of a consultation process prior to enactment.  In the absence of an Assembly in Northern Ireland, the legislation for that jurisdiction will be introduced by means of an order in council through the parliamentary process in Westminster.For the convenience of the House a detailed explanatory memorandum has been published and this provides a synopsis of the Bill's provisions.  The Bill, when enacted, will provide for a robust regime for the regulation of aquaculture in Lough Foyle for the first time, the introduction of an appeals system in respect of decisions on aquaculture matters, and generally for the modernisation of the fisheries provisions of the Foyle Fisheries Acts.I stress that the Bill is the result of a long and detailed negotiation process across a range of Departments and agencies North and South, and some of those negotiations are still continuing.  As such, it reflects a consensus that has been reached having regard to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement and the constitutional imperatives in the two jurisdictions.  For this reason, there will be provisions in this Bill that are not contained in the draft Northern Ireland order, and  vice versa, and this reflects the impact of local law in the two jurisdictions.  This is an important point because it means that any amendments, introduced in either jurisdiction, will need to be considered in consultation with the relevant Minister’s officials and legal advisers.  The need to agree changes, other than those necessitated by local law requirements, may restrict the scope for making changes as the statutory instruments progress through both the Oireachtas and Westminster.I will now deal with the contents of the Bill.  Section 2 provides for the commencement on specified days of different provisions of the Act.  It also provides that the commencement of any provision of the Act may be limited to a particular geographical area.  The purpose of this is to take account of the fact that it may not be possible for the Loughs Agency to consider all aquaculture licence applications at the same time.  Some sites may, therefore, be licensed before others.  Accordingly, it is proposed that the criminal sanctions for carrying out an unlicensed aquaculture operation should not be introduced until all licences have issued.Part 2 of the Bill inserts a new Part VI A, sections 53A to 53W, into the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952.  This part provides for the introduction of an aquaculture licensing system in Lough Foyle to be overseen by the Loughs Agency.  It also transfers the existing aquaculture licensing powers of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources within the Carlingford area to the agency.  One of the key provisions, section 53A, confers powers on the Loughs Agency to grant aquaculture licences, notwithstanding any public right to fish.  It also creates two offences — the first is the carrying out of aquaculture operations without a licence and the second is failure to comply with the terms and conditions of an aquaculture licence.  Penalties for these offences are: on summary conviction, a fine of not more than €5,000 and/or imprisonment for not more than six months; or on conviction on indictment, a fine of not more than €100,000 and/or imprisonment for not more than two years.  The section also provides that aquaculture licences granted in respect of part of the foreshore, the bed of the sea or of an estuary, which is owned or occupied by another person, or which is within the limits of a several or private fishery, can only be granted with the consent of the owner, or occupier, of the area or fishery in question.Section 53B empowers the Loughs Agency to prescribe matters of procedure in the licence application process and the type of information to be provided by applicants, including information relating to the potential impact of aquaculture on the environment.  Section 53C relates to the determination of licence applications.  It provides for the consideration of written representations on such applications, notification of the decision to the applicant and publication of the notice of decision.  Section 53D provides that an aquaculture licence shall define the position and limits of the licensed area and shall be subject to such conditions as may be determined by the Loughs Agency.  The section lists examples of the types of conditions that may be imposed.  Under section 53E licences may be granted for a period of between ten and 20 years and may be renewed for a further period not exceeding 20 years.  An aquaculture licence confers, on its holder, exclusive rights to conduct aquaculture but protects existing legal rights enjoyed, for example, by any person under a local or personal Act or under charter.  Section 53F also provides that ownership of the stock cultivated under a licence vests in the licensee.  It makes it an offence for another person to interfere with a licensee's operations.  Section 53G allows the agency to vary an aquaculture licence in the public interest and to pay compensation to the licensee for loss or damage arising from such a variation.  The Loughs Agency is enabled, under section 53I, to revoke a licence for reasons of non-operation or breach of conditions.  Licences may also be revoked in the public interest subject to the payment of compensation.Sections 53H, J, K and L make provisions for the variation of licences, the surrender of licences, the death of a licence holder, bankruptcy of the licensee, the transfer of aquaculture licences and the procedures to apply in each of these cases.  Section 53N enables the Loughs Agency to make regulations providing for the payment of fees in respect of applications for aquaculture licences.  It also provides for the variation, transfer, surrender and subsistence of aquaculture licences.  Regulations made under this part of the Bill must be approved by the North-South Ministerial Council.The Bill also provides for the establishment of the Foyle and Carlingford Aquaculture Licensing Appeals Board, and the appointment of members and a chairperson to the board by the North-South Ministerial Council.  Any aggrieved persons may appeal to this board against licensing decisions, including decisions on revocations, transfer, variations and compensation.  Both the agency and the appeals board are obliged to give reasons for their decisions under section 53Q.  The Bill contains a number of provisions on aquaculture in Carlingford and provides that existing licence applications shall continue to have effect as if made under section 53A.Part 3 of the Bill contains the proposed amendments to the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952.  Section 6 amends the functions of the agency as laid out in section 11 of the 1952 Act.  This is in order to take account of the additional functions conferred on the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission by the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999.  Section 7 amends the 1952 Act and confers additional regulation-making powers on the Loughs Agency.  These relate to the prohibition of the sale of fish caught by rod and line, concessionary fees, exemption from payment of fees, the nature of documentation to accompany applications, conditions attaching to fishing licences, the transfer of fishing licences and the tagging of fish.  It also makes provision in regard to the publication of such regulations.Section 8 amends section 14 of the 1952 Act and enables the agency to restrict the number of licences for commercial netting within a particular prescribed area of the Foyle or Carlingford areas.  This section also provides for how the allocation of licences by the agency is undertaken in instances where the number of applications exceeds the maximum number of licences prescribed.  These new provisions, when enacted, will play an important role in the introduction of any new management regime for wild salmon in Lough Foyle, which may be required in order to comply with the habitats directive.A new section, section 14A, in the 1952 Act, is inserted by section 9 of this Bill.  It allows the Loughs Agency to acquire, by agreement, fishing rights in any waters, for the purpose of developing and improving facilities for angling. It also provides for the development of these waters by the agency.Section 10 inserts a new section, section 14B, in the 1952 Act to enable the Loughs Agency to issue and charge for permits to fish in waters which it owns or manages.  Section 11 amends section 28 of the 1952 Act to provide that the agency may prescribe different times for the closure of the seasons for different species of fish.  Section 12 inserts a new section, section 35A, in the 1952 Act to prohibit unlicensed fishing.  It makes it an offence to fish without a licence or in contravention of the terms and conditions of a licence.  It will also be an offence to be in possession of an unauthorised fishing engine.  It also inserts a new section, section 35B, to provide for certain exceptions in relation to offences.  It details possible defences that may be available to a person charged with an offence under section 35A.Section 15 inserts a new section in the 1952 Act, which makes it an offence to cause or knowingly permit any deleterious matter to pollute a river.  Provision is also made for the Loughs Agency to carry out necessary works for the reinstatement of the waters to restore the fish population after such an incident.  This section also provides for the recovery of costs from the person convicted of discharging the pollution.  Section 16 extends the prohibition on the use of certain devices to facilitate the unlawful taking of fish, including electrical or acoustical apparatus.  It also prohibits the use of a gaff.Section 18 amends section 46 of the 1952 Act.  This amendment adds private river watchers to the list of persons with power to remove any unlawfully killed or diseased salmon from the water.  The amendment also requires those who exercise such powers to notify the Loughs Agency.  This was seen as an important addition by the agency.Section 19 details possible defences that may be used by a person charged with an offence under subsection (1)(a) of section 47 of the 1952 Act relating to the taking of spawn, smolts or fry of salmon or trout.  The amended section also provides that it shall be an offence to remove material from the bed of the freshwater portion of a river without the consent of the Loughs Agency and makes provision for the granting of such consents by the agency.Section 21 updates the procedures for the appointment of river watchers.  The two new sections added to section 56 of the 1952 Act oblige the agency to maintain a register of the names and addresses of those entitled to act as river watchers.  It also imposes a five-year limit on the period for which a river watcher may be appointed and allows for the re-appointment of river watchers.Section 22 amends section 59(1) to enable an authorised person to seize any equipment which has been or is being used to facilitate the unlawful taking of fish.  This section also amends section 65 of the 1952 Act and allows the courts to order the forfeiture of equipment seized.Section 23 also amends section 59 of the 1952 Act and allows authorised persons to cross any land on foot, and where there is a suitable roadway, lane or path, to use motor vehicles to assist in the pursuit and apprehension of offenders.  The provision also requires authorised persons not to cause obstructions and to re-secure any land against trespass when exercising such powers.Section 24 amends section 60 of the 1952 Act by updating the existing provisions relating to warrants.  This provision allows a District Court judge to issue warrants, valid for seven days, empowering an authorised officer to enter and search premises at any reasonable time or at a time specified by the judge in the warrant.  This also provides for the enforcement of the warrant if the house is empty and provides that an authorised person, other than a private river watcher, may accompany the person authorised by the warrant.Section 26 amends section 64 of the 1952 Act so that powers under this section do not permit authorised officers to enter an enclosed garden or dwelling house.  Section 27 provides for the revision of penalties in respect of offences committed under the Act.  The penalties are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill.  This section also provides for the recoupment by the Loughs Agency of the cost of prosecutions by the insertion of section 69A in the 1952 Act.Section 28 amends section 70 of the 1952 Act to provide that work, which might otherwise be prohibited under the 1952 Act, may be carried out by the agency or any person to whom a permit is issued, provided that such work is for artificial propagation, scientific purposes or the improvement of the fisheries.  The amendment also details procedures on permits issued for this purpose.Section 29 amends section 76 of the 1952 Act, by amending the existing statutory forfeiture provisions to allow the courts to adjudicate on forfeiture.  This section also repeals section 77 of the 1952 Act.  Section 30 inserts a new section 73A in the 1952 Act.  It provides that applications for judicial review of decisions of the Loughs Agency about aquaculture, or of the appeals board in appeals, may only be made in accordance with Order 84 of the Rules of the Superior Courts.  Provision is also made so that the High Court may not decline jurisdiction in a case by reason only that the decision was made in an area that is outside the State, or relates to a place that is outside the State.  This is one of the provisions that is included in this Bill but not in the draft Northern Ireland Order in Council, the Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries (Northern Ireland) Order 2007.  This section is included on the advice of the Attorney General.Section 32 confers powers on the agency to provide, subject to the payment of such fees as it may determine, services relating to fisheries and amends paragraph 2 of the Third Schedule to the 1952 Act.  Section 34 provides that the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 1997 shall not apply to the Louth area.  To date, aquaculture operations in this area have been licensed under the 1997 Act.  Section 35 amends the Foreshore Act 1933 so that the Minister may grant a foreshore licence to the Loughs Agency.  This will allow aquaculture licensees to conduct aquaculture operations on the foreshore.Schedule 1 to this Bill inserts new Schedules 3A and 3B in the 1952 Act.  These make provision for the incorporation, membership and staffing of the Aquaculture Licences Appeals Board and set out the procedures for appeals.There are eight articles in Schedule 3A which I will briefly outline.  Article 1 provides that the appeals board, which I will refer to as the board, shall have the legal capacity of a body corporate and that judicial notice shall be taken of the seal of the board.  Article 2 provides that remuneration of the board, tenure of office of the board, and resignations and removals from the board are to be determined by the NSMC, the Minister for Finance and personnel in Northern Ireland.  Article 3 provides for the employment of staff or engagement of services of persons by the board.  It makes provisions for the payment of such persons and for the payment of pensions subject to the same approvals as in Article 2.  Articles 4 and 5 contain a number of procedural rules for meetings of the board.  Article 6 requires the board to draw up a code of conduct, covering its obligations to the public and its accountability.  Articles 7 and 8 are standard provisions concerning the keeping and auditing of annual and other accounts and annual reports.The new Schedule 3B to the 1952 Act deals with procedures in relation to appeals. There are 18 articles to the Schedule.  Article 1 details the procedures for lodging appeals.  Article 2 authorises the board to give directions on notices of appeal and defer service of the notice of appeal on the Loughs Agency until it is satisfied that its directions have been complied with.  Article 3 provides that a board may dismiss appeals considered to have no valid ground, to be vexatious or frivolous, that are not in the form required or where the appellant fails to comply with a direction of the board.Articles 4 and 5 are concerned with procedures applicable to the amendment of notice of appeal and withdrawal of appeals.  Articles 6 to 11, inclusive, detail the procedures to be followed by the board and the Loughs Agency in response to a notice of appeal.  Articles 12 and 13 provide the board with the discretion to treat two or more appeals as one and where hearings are to be held.Article 14 authorises the board to give directions about the manner in which the proceedings are conducted; the presentation or disclosure of documentation; the seeking of expert opinion; and the calling of witnesses to give evidence.  The article also details procedures for third parties requesting the board to give such directions.  Article 15 authorises the board to issue a summons requiring a person to attend as a witness, answer questions or produce documents, and details the procedures to be followed for such a summons.  Article 16 authorises the board to debar a party from the proceedings for having failed to comply with a direction given under this Schedule.  Article 17 provides for oral hearings to be held in public except in the case where confidential information is being considered.  Article 18 provides for the delivery of decisions by the board and that each party to the appeal shall be sent a copy of the decision.Schedule 2 to the Bill contains the details of the new penalties as provided in section 27.  The penalties in the North and the South have been made as consistent as possible allowing for local law conditions so that offenders should be subject to similar penalties in either jurisdiction.  The Attorney General has advised that it is necessary to amend the Bill so that it applies to all fish in the agency's jurisdiction.  In addition, the Attorney General advises that the definition of the Foyle area must be inserted on the face of the Bill.  The Attorney General has advised that these amendments are necessary to give effect to the Good Friday Agreement.  I will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage to give effect to this advice.  Deputy Keaveney has been pursuing this matter with me for some time.The Bill is an important measure in the delivery of service by a North-South body established under the Good Friday Agreement.  It will equip the agency with the powers to regulate aquaculture and it modernises its powers over inland fisheries.  In turn, this will enhance the commission's scope for conserving and managing these fisheries.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	434	The Minister had some amount of script to get through.  I am delighted to speak on the Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Bill 2006.  Waters around the Foyle and Carlingford loughs offer superb fishing for both tourist and domestic anglers, with reports of sea bass catches of 16.5 pounds.  The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Good Friday Agreement.  The Agreement provides for the establishment of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission and confers powers on the commission for the promotion of development of the Foyle and Carlingford loughs for commercial and recreational purposes.The functions are restricted to marine fisheries and aquaculture matters and there is a concern that the Bill is excluding mussels and oysters.  The Bill excludes the wild oyster and mussel sector and proposes only to regulate the aquaculture sector.  How can we regulate one sector and not the other, when they are operating on the same ground?  The designation of oysters versus mussels is contentious, but to reach such a conclusion when half of the stakeholders are excluded from the process will be difficult.  The low level of consultation with fishermen on either side of the Border is also an issue of concern.Negotiations have taken place between the Department and its counterpart in Northern Ireland about ownership of the sea bed and the costs levied for the leasing of the ground.  That will be dealt with by the licences that are issued.  The big concern to date has been the way mussels are dealt with.  The mussels industry has collapsed as a result of a 40 year agreement which has discriminated between fishermen in the two jurisdictions on this island, in terms of exclusive fishery rights.  Irish authorities have registered vessels from other European countries.  A contentious issue exists as regards the oysters and mussels.  The Minister will know this is an emotive issue in the North, where people are very much aggrieved.  This Bill may introduce a very good precedent, however, and in time perhaps self-regulation.The Foyle system has a spring salmon run on the River Finn and salmon and sea trout angling is available from hundreds of miles of other rivers, including the Mourne, the Derg, the Strule, the Roe, the Culdaff and the Faughan.  Both the Foyle and Carlingford lakes are extremely important to the island of Ireland for many reasons, and I support this Bill today as it will provide for the development and licensing of aquaculture and for the exercise of a development function in inland fisheries by the Foyle Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.  The Bill is in line with the British-Irish Agreement Act 1999 and is also needed to update certain sections of the Foyle Fisheries Act 1952.There is enormous potential for aquaculture development in Ireland and it is an important part of this Bill.  Aquaculture development has taken place in Carlingford Lough, but only with licences issued separately by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Northern Ireland body, the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.  Aquaculture development has not taken place in Lough Foyle, however, because of jurisdictional uncertainties.  There is obviously potential for such development on the Foyle and the fact that it has not happened to date has economic and social implications.  This Bill provides the opportunity to regulate and license aquaculture in Lough Foyle for the first time.  It will provide significant protection to existing operators and make it an offence when licensed areas in Foyle and Carlingford are interfered with.This is a welcome piece of legislation.  The Bill updates the provisions of the Foyle Fishers Act 1952 and it is good to see cross-Border co-operation is working.  On the salmon issue, the Bill allows for angling licences with photographs.  This is a significant measure and will introduce control.  In recent times we have had the issue of salmon licences and drift netting.  I understand there are now drift licences on the Foyle.  I met the chairman of the new Loughs Agency, Mr. Derek Anderson, last week, and members of the board, which is very representative.  The members are very committed and have been very effective to date.  This could perhaps serve as a model for what could be done with inland fisheries in our jurisdiction.  The consultants, Farrell Grant Sparks, are reviewing the situation at the moment, and no doubt they have studied what has taken place at the behest of the Loughs Agency.  It has been very effective as regards the management of replacement stocks and in terms of development.  I believe angling licences with photographs are the way forward when it comes to control, in the light of the increased number of licences.  This has far-reaching implications in terms of the conservation of stocks.The question of punitive fines was also raised yesterday with the Minister of State, Deputy Browne.  When it comes to the courts, while the licence fees have gone up considerably, the fines are minimal for breaches of the regulations.  While people may be barred from fishing in the future, there should be punitive fines as well for those who are in breach.The licences with photographs will do away with the transfer of licences and will allow for better conservation effort.  Significant research is being undertaken all over Ireland, North and South, on fish and plant species.  The Marine Institute and its chief executive, Dr. Peter Heffernan, are doing very  good work in Galway.  I believe the Minister is transferring the research initiative from the Central Fisheries Board to the Marine Institute.  It is good to have the research effort based within a single institution.  Scientists working on fish stocks in the Foyle and Carlingford areas have found great genetic diversity of salmon stocks.  This research has indicated that individual populations of salmon can be differentiated in areas as small as 5 km of river.  The provisions in the Bill will enable the Loughs Agency to reinstate habitat, which will be of enormous benefit to fish stocks.  Provision is made to empower the Loughs Agency to prohibit the sale of rod-caught salmon for the first time, aligning the Foyle and Carlingford areas with the central and regional fisheries boards.The Bill also provides the opportunity to recover the costs of prosecution.  Such costs include investigation, detection and sampling analysis which will significantly assist the Loughs Agency in providing an efficient conservation and protection service and will be a further deterrent to those considering breaching fisheries regulations. The Bill includes the following provisions: to prohibit the carrying out of aquaculture without a licence or in contravention of the terms and conditions of a licence; to empower the FCILC to grant aquaculture licences under such conditions as it determines; to enable the FCILC to regulate aquaculture licence application procedures and fees payable in respect of licences; to vest ownership of aquaculture stocks in the licensee; and to allow the recapture of escaped stock from licensed sites.There is provision for the variation, revocation, transfer and surrender of licences — and for the establishment of a register of aquaculture licences.  There are penalties for offences relating to aquaculture as well as provision for existing fish culture, shellfish fishery and marine licences to continue to be valid.  An appeals board may be established to provide for appropriate procedures for aquaculture licences.Provision is also made to enable the FCILC  to acquire fishing rights in the Foyle and Carlingford areas and there are provisions relating to the form and conditions of fishing licences.  Further, provision is made for the reinstatement of polluted waters and the recovery of associated costs, as well as to improve the conservation and protection of fish stocks.  Other measures include the facility to strengthen enforcement powers and increase penalties for fisheries offices and powers to recover the cost of prosecutions.  There is also a means to increase controls over the appointment and activities of private river watchers.I was grateful to have been briefed by the Minister's officials on the impact of this Bill.  The Bill is long awaited, given the Loughs Agency's powers to regulate the shellfish sectors in the Foyle and Carlingford areas, through Westminster.  Given the whole level of consultation and the fact that it had to be put on the backburner pending implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, it is good that matters are now being progressed.  Perhaps it is regrettable that mussels, oysters etc. are excluded.  This continues to be a contentious issue.As for the regulation on the partnership approach to the effect there would be dialogue and consultation with fishermen, it is important to note that a degree of consultation makes a difference.  It is also important to consult fishermen on both sides of the Border who might work together on the Bill.  Obviously, people on both sides of the Border hold different opinions but they should co-operate in this regard.It is good that the cross-Border agencies are beginning to become relevant.  I met the board last week and noted its members' commitment to conservation, fish management, the development of aquaculture and added value for the State and the economy in terms of job creation.  Given the high regard in which the brand of Ireland is held worldwide, the public health aspects of fish consumption and the worldwide demand for fish, there is a huge opportunity for the entire island of Ireland to develop aquaculture and increase the number of jobs in the shellfish and finned fish sectors.  In particular, there is clear potential to develop both the wild and farmed salmon sectors.Will the Minister clarify whether the Exchequer will allocate additional funding to this body for restocking?  What other development moneys will be provided by the State in this regard?  It is important to establish the body with a suitable level of funding.  Heretofore, the funding devoted to inland and inshore fisheries within the State has been minimal.  I am aware that Dr. Cawley is examining this issue, at the Minister's request.  People are anxious to see the resultant report to discern the Minister's precise plans for inshore fisheries, inland fisheries and the development of cross-Border bodies.Two of the new inland fisheries will have cross-Border dimensions.  Having regard to the water basin district, two of the inland fisheries to be developed will straddle the Border.  As an inland fishery body will also incorporate this aspect, the new review of inland fisheries could include consideration of the potential for cross-Border development.In the context of developing the potential of Ireland's rivers and loughs, the opening up of the canal through Eniskillen has been a significant development.  It has brought people from Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim across the Border into County Fermanagh.  Similarly, there is huge potential along the Foyle and Carlingford coastline, as well as for 12 miles out to sea.  Deputy Keaveney will be aware of this potential and the significant impact it could have on the entire region.I am sure the Minister will examine the regulation, because this matter is important.  The issue of pollution and controls regarding oysters and mussels constitutes a major one.  Undoubtedly, while the Department is aware of it, it has been restricted in what it could do in this regard.Apart from the Minister's own contribution, having met the Department's senior civil servants on this issue, I compliment them on the amount of work done and the attention to detail shown on the Bill.  It is comprehensive legislation, which is also passing through the Parliament in Westminster.  As this empowering legislation is passing through both Legislatures together, it is important that it receive the same degree of recognition in Dáil Éireann.There are concerns.  The Bill refers to the negotiations between the Department and the UK authorities regarding the ownership of the seabed and the costs to be levied in this respect.  This issue must be discussed.  In particular, insufficient protection is offered to existing mussel farmers to reflect their investment to date in identifying good ground by trial and error.  Some operators will have tried many sites within Lough Foyle and many will have lost seed mussels before finding good sites.  Under these proposals, someone who sat back and watched others take losses while testing can apply for the good sites identified through the efforts and at the expense of others.  While I am not an expert on mussel growing, this issue must be examined carefully.Overall, the Bill pertains to co-operation, partnership and the level of funding from the State to the cross-Border body, as well as the commitment of the board.  Mr. Anderson and his board should work with the inland fisheries authorities in this State, as many lessons can be learned from what has been done in aquaculture and how the salmon issue has been dealt with on the Foyle.  It is important to learn the board's views on the draft licences which will be granted to remove surplus salmon.  The question of how the Minister proposes to issue draft licences to remove surplus salmon and how the system will operate is highly contentious.  Will he allow drift-netting within estuaries?  This is also an issue in Northern Ireland.How much of my time allocation remains?

I wish the Minister well and have been delighted to contribute to the debate on this important legislation.  It is great to see the Good Friday Agreement take effect as the Government has put much effort into it.  I met the body in Leinster House last week.  It operates on a cross-Border and cross-political basis and it was great to see its members.  It is good to see it under way.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I am delighted to have the opportunity to make a few brief comments on the Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Bill.  In general, I welcome it warmly.  There are a number of issues to which I wish to refer and which have been brought to my attention by people from the constituencies of Donegal North-East and Louth.I thank the civil servants involved for their extremely helpful briefing of spokespersons and forwarding additional material to Members, which was invaluable.  I also thank the Minister.  The two waterways concerned are among the most beautiful and interesting coastal waterways on this island.  Obviously, the partition of the country in 1922 created the circumstances whereby such special administrative arrangements must be established for them in the Bill and in previous Acts from 1952 onwards.  It is striking that Lough Foyle did not have an aquaculture licensing system because of some of the key jurisdictional issues involved.  I broadly welcome the Bill.Recently, while debating the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Single Electricity Market) Bill, I was supportive of the development of the all-island energy market as an example of practical patriotism.  This is another example of a concrete cross-Border measure that, in general terms, should bring economic and social benefits to citizens on both parts of the island, particularly in counties Donegal, Derry, Down and Louth.The Bill follows through from the Good Friday Agreement and the establishment of the commission in 1999, as the Minister and Deputy Perry noted.  I join other Members in wishing the chairperson, the commission and the Loughs Agency great success in the years ahead.One of the major issues that arose during the introduction of the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill was the complete dearth of consultation with local fishing coastal communities.  I was interested to read a consultation document prepared by the Northern Ireland authorities on the eight-week period of consultation in Northern Ireland.  However, it is a pity, as the Minister probably will agree, that the Assembly does not exist as a legislative body in Northern Ireland with an agreed government to have a full discussion, particularly involving local representatives from the Derry, Down and Armagh areas most affected.The core objective of the Bill is to provide for the inland fisheries development function and the development and licensing of aquaculture in the Foyle and Carlingford loughs in agreement with the Northern Ireland government and in the context of the British-Irish Agreement.Three concerns were raised with me as the most important, the first of which is the issue of the jurisdictional claims.  Looking at the map with the civil servants a few days ago, we saw that the Border effectively runs through Lough Foyle and the channel in Carlingford Lough.  Some of the local fishermen have asked me what is the impact of this in the context of the Crown Estate.  When the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and his successors presumably negotiate fees for the different functions to be carried out by the commission, does that mean ultimately that we are recognising the Crown Estate and the Crown's claims to the seabed in the two loughs or have we gone past that following the British-Irish Agreement?  What is the position?  Many local people in Donegal feel it is invidious that we be engaged in a recognition of the British claim.Second, there has been much local disquiet, in particular, about the oyster fishery.  People who have had long-standing historic rights to the oyster fishery, which has been an important source of work and income, see themselves as excluded from the terms of this Bill.  Likewise, people involved in the small mussel fishery — who have sowed seed and harvested for ten or 15 years and have identified the areas of the seabed where mussels grow best — feel that under this legislation anyone may apply to take advantage of their hard won experience over many decades, and of what one might call their research and development investment in their little fishery.  I have heard people state that they have spent up to Stg£60,000 and put in considerable effort.  They feel there is an exclusion here due to a narrow definition of aquaculture in the first part of the Bill.There is a general feeling that there has not been sufficient discussion with our stakeholders on one of the most important areas of the Irish coast — the local Deputy, Deputy Keaveney, is seated just behind the Minister — and that all the fishing communities along the wonderful area around Greencastle have not been sufficiently consulted about the matter.  There would be similar concerns on the Carlingford side.  I note there is a local Deputy from that area present in the House also.  Those would be the three areas to which I would like the Minister to respond if he gets an opportunity.The lack of licensing regime in Lough Foyle has been a serious and worrying anomaly.  It was my colleague, Deputy Gilmore, who, as Minister of State at the then Department of the Marine in the mid-1999s, introduced the fundamental licensing of aquaculture in this State and fish farmers throughout the rest of Ireland have had to live with that over the past decade.  Of course a transparent and effective licensing regime in aquaculture is absolutely essential to ensure high standards of cleanliness, disease control, fish welfare, environmental impact and husbandry, and it has been a concern that this was not available in Lough Foyle.  I hope that the reference in Part 6A of the Bill to the EU directive, particularly in the protection of the environment, is a matter that will be carried through.A little before the present Minister's time, when Deputy Dermot Ahern was Minister, the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources undertook an in-depth look at aquaculture.  At the time people spoke of the famous cover story in The Economist, “The Blue Revolution”.  With the worldwide development of aquaculture, allied to our grave concerns, highlighted in our discussion with the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, yesterday on the 2050 report, and our concerns about the wild fishery, aquaculture must be a way of the future.  In that context I was deeply disappointed with the Minister’s provision for aquaculture in the recent Estimates.  He provided an increase of 3%, a cut in funding in real terms.In general terms, the Bill is a welcome development, notwithstanding the caveats I outlined on aquaculture in Lough Foyle.  It is obviously critical that aquaculture and other fishery resources in Lough Foyle and Lough Carlingford are exploited in the most responsible and most sustainable manner for the benefit of all of the residents of this country.I note that Part 3 of the Bill refers primarily to the amendments to the 1952 Act and covers much territory we dealt with in discussions at the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and, indeed, in the sea fisheries legislation.  We must bear in mind that this area encompasses quite a large territory in terms of sea-fisheries.I note that in Part 3, section 15(42)(i), which deals with the penalties for pollution, the summary conviction does not exceed €5,000.  That is a matter I was going to raise with the Minister in the context of amendments.  Obviously, we can put forward amendments as soon as possible, but I realise they will involve the Minister in further discussions with his Northern Ireland counterpart.In general, like Deputy Perry, I welcome Part 3, the section 7 amendment to section 13 of the 1952 Act which provides for photographs along with the rod licences.  This is an important development on which the Department is to be congratulated.How will the commission will be invigilated?  Obviously, it is a cross-Border initiative under the British-Irish Agreement, but there was a reference already to the costs of the commission and the general policy directives it might be given.  The FCILC has significant powers in the Bill, for example, as outlined in Part VIA and Part 3 — amendments to the 1952 Act — to grant and revoke licences, provide education and training etc., and extensive powers to appoint officers and to invigilate offences under the Act.  It is important that all of those would be matters on which we would have the final say in the case of our citizens, in particular, and in general terms of all the people of this island.Earlier today we approved the levies for the single stock management and for the development of the new regime for salmon which the Minister has accepted.  He might refer in his final reply to how this will work with this Bill.The other point I note is that with the current Dáil ending shortly, the Minister has included a slight amendment to the foreshore Act.  Deputy Sargent must have raised that matter approximately 40 times since I have been a Member of the Dáil and, unfortunately, we still have not had that matter addressed.In general terms, I commend the Minister on getting to this stage today and bringing forward the legislation.  There has not been enough consultation.  There are some concerns, particularly in the Donegal area, and I want him to address those before we finally pass the Bill.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I propose to share my time with Deputies Eamon Ryan and Morgan.The Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission is one of the North-South Implementation Bodies established in 1999 arising from the British-Irish Agreement.  This agency, since its establishment, has developed a most impressive array of initiatives to improve the management of fish stocks in both loughs.  There are similar examples in Lough Erne as well, beside the Manor House in Enniskillen, where the fish stocks are attracting people to the fishing areas.  We, in Monaghan, have benefited from that also because there is a deal between the two hotels that they can come to fish the lakes and stay in the Hillgrove Hotel in Monaghan.  It is the type of cross-Border co-operation that we must move towards.  Unfortunately, the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly has left the various agencies in a form of limbo in recent years.  Let us hope that the Assembly and the North-South bodies will be up and running early in 2007 and can resume where they left off.I have been frustrated by the pace of the Northern talks where the use of words and their meanings has been such that we would almost need to rewrite the Oxford English Dictionary.  Those parties that benefited from the parties which took risks in the past now find that the cycle has come full circle and they must have the courage to take the same kind of risks as those taken by their predecessors.  Parties that showed courage in the past paid the political price.  There may be a fear in the two main parties in Northern Ireland that they will have to pay the political price for doing the right thing.  While the talk may be of the police and others issues, this is the real issue that must be grappled with and I ask the parties to take the necessary risks as there is a great benefit to be achieved.The Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission has been instrumental in developing innovative genetic monitoring techniques for the assessment of salmon stocks.  While Deputy Broughan mentioned difficulties in Donegal, these techniques have provided great benefits for the fishing industry in the loughs.  An advisory forum was also established for the Loughs Agency, including representatives of shell-fishing, draft and drift-net fishing, fishery owners and tourism interests.  The advisory forum also included environmentalists, local businesses and those working in agriculture and forestry around the loughs.  Everybody working in the various local enterprises had the opportunity to have an input into the agency's policy decisions.The Loughs Agency also constructed an interpretative centre at Prehen on the shores of Lough Foyle.  This allows for the dissemination of information on the loughs, and on the work of the Loughs Agency, to the public.  It is important that the public is tied into this and knows exactly what is happening.  It is indisputable that the development of the loughs will provide an economic boost to the areas that are contiguous to both loughs which will benefit from increased tourism.  This is about enlivening hinterland communities that have been denied financial success in the past.  We know of towns, like Clones for example, that suffered because of the Border division.  This Bill provides opportunities to overcome this problem.  It is particularly relevant to the Cavan, Monaghan and Fermanagh areas where there are many lakes and much marine activity.  It is important to get this agency moving.I note that the Bill provides for the licensing and regulation of aquaculture operations in the areas of both loughs, with an appeals board to deal with appeals and disputes over decisions.  Global farmed fish production now totals almost 42 million tonnes and the FAO estimates that aquaculture will supply more than half of all fish consumed worldwide by 2030.  That is a huge boost for people in Border areas and its hinterland.Irish aquaculture has significant development potential to capitalise on strong European and global demand and it provides a stable source of raw material for the fish processing sector.  The processing sector continues to expand and represents some 30% of the total value of Irish seafood output.  I welcome the Bill's provisions in relation to aquaculture and believe that it will facilitate the sustainable development of aquaculture into the future.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I wish the Ceann Comhairle, the Minister and his officials a happy, quiet and peaceful Christmas.This Bill is an example of North-South co-operation and mirrors the example currently being set by the Green Party with its new all-Ireland basis and innovative new North-South structures.  The case for integrated management of our rivers and estuaries is proven time and again.  I today received correspondence relating to the Ballinahinch River from the Save Our Sea Trout campaign.  The organisation has been engaged for many years in the debate regarding the risk to wild sea trout and salmon stocks from certain aquaculture policies.  Coincidentally, I am currently reading the biography of John Moriarty and it contains much information on the wonder of the Ballinahinch River near which he lived for many years.  The river was a famous sea trout fishery, but the catch on it had slumped to 200 to 300 trout per year.  Two years ago, the salmon farm in the bay, through which all the sea trout and salmon had to travel and where they risked picking up lice, was closed and reopened as a cod aquaculture facility.  Lo and behold, the sea trout catch on the river rose to 1,000 last year, albeit with smaller fish.  That figure rose to 1,200 this year and larger sea trout are returning to the river.  The salmon run last year increased to approximately 1,600.  This is a famous sea trout and salmon river and gives employment to hundreds of people in the area.  It is great to see it recovering.Management of aquaculture and other resources in our rivers and estuaries is crucial.  It is important that we conduct the management and licensing of the rivers and estuaries, in this case Lough Foyle and Carlingford Lough, on a sustainable basis.  In 1997, the Government published a report by Brady Shipman Martin on the issue of coastal zone management.  The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey, was the Minister for the Environment and Local Government at that time.  Responding to the report he said: "We must preserve the intrinsic value of the coastal zone while simultaneously availing of the advantages it bestows in the interests of local communities and the wider economy.  Our rate of success will be dictated by the extent to which the principles of sustainable development inform management policy formulation and its delivery at local level."  I am concerned that nothing has happened since those early days of the Government as regards proper and sustainable development in our estuaries and proper coastal zone management.  The Government's legislative programme in 2002 said that legislation to develop coastal zone management would be published in 2003.  As Deputy Broughan said, nothing much has happened since then.I am concerned and slightly disappointed that this opportunity has been missed.  While I know this is a more complicated and difficult Bill because it must be done in conjunction with either the Assembly or Westminster, I am disappointed that we seem to be continuing a tradition of narrowly defining how we manage our fisheries.  While the principles setting out the aquaculture projects, appeals boards and fines etc, are welcome, I regret that the opportunity to go further and adopt proper coastal zone management was not taken.The best example seems to be the conflict that will potentially still exist between the rights and interests of people collecting wild, natural oysters, which has been done for a significant period, and those introducing commercial applications, such as mussel farms.  I commend the Save the Swilly campaign group, which operates on a neighbouring lough to Lough Foyle, for the work it has done in raising estuary management issues.  I am concerned that this Bill does not explain how we intend managing wild oyster beds.A number of concerns were raised at our committee meeting yesterday where the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, presented some of the new wild salmon management procedures.  The cost of licences for drift netting and other salmon fishing methods will, in some instances, be higher than the fines that apply for poaching.  We face a serious problem in managing this area.  The Government's delay in establishing a new fisheries board structure shows that it has not given this area the priority it deserves.It is interesting that the fines in this Bill are significantly higher than in existing legislation.  The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, told the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources yesterday that a review of legislation was required but that the Government had not been able to carry it out within the tight timeframe of the legislative programme.  As many Members said this morning, given that we had to suspend the Dáil three times because of insufficient business, it is difficult to understand how we were not able to progress broader legislation in aquaculture and fisheries management, which we desperately need if we are to develop and protect this most valuable resource in a sustainable way.  Some 60% of Irish people live within the coastal zone management areas and we have a huge economic, environmental and social interest in getting it right.I commend this Bill and I am happy to support it on behalf of my party, but I cannot commend the Government for its management of this area in the four and a half years I have been in the House.  It is an area which seems to have been forgotten.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The Foyle Fisheries Act 1952 was both innovative and progressive.  Despite British occupation of part of our country, the commission helped small isolated communities to protect and develop the natural resource of wild salmon.  Much good work was done by the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, notwithstanding its poor record on discrimination.The Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, known as the Loughs Agency, was established under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement in 1999.  There are 12 board members comprising a wide spectrum of political opinion and expertise.  I was honoured to serve on the board for three years and I thank board colleagues and staff who have served the agency very well since its inception.  The board chairperson, Councillor Peter Savage, has been both inspirational and interesting at all times.  Those who know Peter will know what I mean by "interesting".  He is also an extremely competent councillor and one of the ablest in this State.  I also acknowledge the leadership of its chief executive officer, Mr. Derek Anderson, and his deputy, Mr. John Pollock, both of whom are very helpful and competent.The agency has the potential to bring very important development to the communities in the Foyle and Carlingford areas.  Development in a wide range of fields, including fisheries, tourism and angling, would offer much-needed jobs to people in those communities.  Tourism, for example, has huge potential, as do water-based sports activities, and there is massive potential for hillwalking in the Mourne and Cooley mountains.  The agency can bring the tourists into both areas and others can exploit the potential of a huge, untapped international market.  There are similar opportunities in Donegal.Angling means more than just fishermen on a bank but encompasses deep sea fishing for sharks and other species and could be developed further.  The Loughs Agency is the perfect vehicle to ensure this development occurs.  It is the perfect engine to drive the significant economic opportunity available to communities in the vicinity of both loughs.  Already much very important work has been done.  For example, the agency, in collaboration with Queen's University Belfast, has studied the DNA of salmon.  This gives an interesting insight into both health issues and the behaviour of fish.  The research also informs us about issues associated with escaped farm salmon and the implications of cross-breeding between wild and farmed fish.  Much more, however, can and should be done.The Bill is a long overdue beginning to give the agency the legislative footing necessary to carry out its role effectively.  There will also be substantial challenges for local fishing communities as new practices are necessary to maximise the potential of this natural resource.  Significant investment will also be necessary and the Loughs Agency has the capacity to guide and administer the communities in this area.  Very substantial financial reward is possible to enterprising people.Mussels, for example, have undergone a huge price rise in recent years.  Only four or five years ago wild mussel would have fetched maybe £100 per tonne, whereas now the price of good quality mussel is anything between €1,200 and €1,500 per tonne.  That gives some indication of the capacity for significant financial reward for those involved.  The Dutch provide the best example of good practice in this area, having improved their processes over generations.  They grow the product and harvest it using substantially enhanced techniques.  Added value is key to their industry and we can easily replicate that in Ireland, giving the sector a huge impetus.Licences will undoubtedly cause controversy and we have already heard that Members have received representations.  Perhaps we should keep our constituency offices open a bit longer because if this legislation comes into effect, we can all expect additional representations from people in that area.  We need to enact it first, however, and I hope in doing so we can combine loyalty to those who have been involved in the industry with new enterprises whose investment may be necessary to capitalise on the full value of this huge resource.I said this legislation was overdue, as it is, but I acknowledge the difficulties involved for the draftsmen as they try to make sure every comma and full stop in the Bill in this jurisdiction is replicated in the legislation on the northern side of the Border.  I hope the legislation will pass quickly but I acknowledge that it is imperfect.  I also acknowledge that, because of the cross-Border dimension, there will be huge difficulties amending it.  Nevertheless, I wish it a fair wind and look forward to communities around the two loughs having significant additional opportunities as a result of it and the work of the Loughs Agency.  Long may it continue.
#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Bill 2006 is finally before the House.  It has been like Lanigan's Ball. Instead of "He stepped out, I stepped in again" it has been "We will wait for the Executive — no, we will go on without it; we will wait for the Executive — no we will go on without it".  The Bill has been long awaited in my area.  I agree with Deputy Morgan's final point and feel this is only the start of the trouble.I begin by declaring my interest — I live on the banks of the Foyle, one of the most beautiful places in the world.  Seldom does any Bill going through the House have implications for only one Deputy, but I am she on this occasion.  That is why I was very despondent, having waited for this legislation throughout my political career, to be given a mere ten minutes to speak on it today.  I am glad that my time has now been increased.I am less despondent than I was earlier this month when I was made aware that aquaculture was not what I thought it was, namely, all mussels and oysters, and that there were to be separate regimes for spat, under the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, DARD, and the laid product under the Loughs Agency.  That represents a reinterpretation of the word "aquaculture", because I thought shellfish were fish — the clue is in the name.  I was very annoyed that everything seemed to change.  In a bottom culture shell fishery, definitions between aquaculture and wild fishery are difficult to understand and would be impractical and impossible to operate successfully under two different masters, in this case DARD and the Loughs Agency.I should apologise to the Minister for the tough time I gave him, the Taoiseach, the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on this omission from, or reinterpretation of, the Good Friday Agreement.  I will not annoy the Minister for the rest of this year.

#CeciliaKeaveney	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-party	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-dob	unknown-#CeciliaKeaveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I might not be telling the truth.  This reinterpretation was driven by DARD in the Six Counties but I cannot apologise for being protective of the area I love and the people I represent.  I cannot apologise for saying that we have an important and unique resource in the Foyle that we wish to grow, manage and see generations work and earn a living from.  I cannot apologise for fighting a corner to have the right legislation and not some touching of a cap to the symbolism of a North-South body.  We are a real community, dealing with the real implications of having no legislation.  Those implications would be even worse should a quick-fix piece of legislation be pushed through to satisfy deadlines or optics.  I appreciate that the Government has listened to my comments and I applaud the interest engendered and the work done by officials and Ministers, which I hope will continue.We are discussing a North-South body, but approximately 95% of the fishermen involved are from County Donegal.  The proposal before the House needs the consent of both jurisdictions and I ask that all sides embrace the Attorney General's opinion that the Good Friday Agreement envisaged the Loughs Agency as a body for all fisheries, not just farmed aquaculture.  The legislation should not be delayed further as those involved in delaying its passage will do fishing communities a disservice.My constituents and I are attention seekers in this regard.  We want the Government to be involved in our struggle to be heard and we want our opinion to be taken on board, not only at national level, but at every level, including in the Loughs Agency, which will gain the power to license fishing through the Bill.  We want consultation and input on a regular basis, not just when a Bill is published, and a say in our future.  We have fishing expertise because we are a coastal community.  We know what it is to suffer quota cuts and increases in regulation, whether on the lough under the Loughs Agency or on the sea in terms of the large whitefish fishing community at Greencastle.Any fisherman will accept that stock conservation is vital to the sustainability of the industry, which can only be the case if stocks are managed.  Once amended, the Bill will aim to license all fisheries in the Foyle.  No other area would have sustained a situation whereby the only licensing that took place since 1952 was in respect of salmon.  Our fishermen feel aggrieved that we had a strong management system for salmon fishing in the form of the Foyle Fisheries Commission, subsequently the Loughs Agency, but we have succumbed to the same penalty as all other rivers that might not have paid the price down the years, as it were.Feelings are understandably running high and it is difficult for people to get over their sense of deep mistrust.  A speedy resolution to the issues of compensation and the community moneys promised would help and would tie into this legislation neatly.  Being blunt, there is a feeling of "us and them" among the key stakeholders, whether they are salmon, oyster or mussel fishermen.While there has always been an advisory committee to the commission, those who served on it told me that they were often held back from being too forceful for fear that they would not be awarded their licences in future.  When I entered politics, I spent much time listening to complaints about the commission.  Opinions given at advisory committee meetings were treated like token opinions.  According to the people who matter, the fishermen, while the advisory committee was a good idea in principle, it was not as effective as it could or should have been.  A proper consultation process that takes cognisance of and acts upon recommendations and input from key stakeholders would help to heal much of the mistrust.Many years ago, the salmon drift net fishermen walked out of the committee and refused to return, but the only way forward in any issue is via communication.  Recently, a new burden was placed on them.  The Loughs Agency is examining the option of reducing the number of fishermen working on the river from 112 to 30.Under the Good Friday Agreement, a new, wider-based advisory forum was created, but, like many organisations, it was considered a talking shop.  The Loughs Agency seemed to railroad through its views.  A fisherman to whom I spoke provided an interesting quote that applies to a Deputy sitting across from me.  I will not name the fisherman who stated:The present Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission is politically appointed and knows very little about fishing.  Andrew Ward, Arthur Morgan and Lord Glentoran are the only ones who would recognise a fish without chips alongside it.Whether that is a fair reflection, I wanted to give the House a sense of the feeling on the ground.In the interest of balance, I found a degree of unanimity within the advisory group when I met it recently.  Its members are interested in and aware of the issue and are on the ball.  Sometimes, people are not au fait with all the facts, but I commend Councillor Peter Savage and his team.The fishermen I represent have received bad press.  They want regulation and to know who is the regulator.  Falling between two stools for a short period until issues are resolved is one matter, but 13 years is a long time to be without a stool.  In particular, oyster fishermen have seen their combined catch drop from more than 400 tonnes per annum to less than 100 tonnes.  Recently, the agency gave me statistics detailing that the oyster fishery's catch is between 50 tonnes and 100 tonnes, which is worth €200,000 to €400,000.The desired legislation to regulate, conserve, protect and improve oyster fisheries was promised, but never delivered.  The Bill must offer that opportunity.  Indeed, many fishermen blame the lack of legislation for allowing the bonamia ostrea disease to enter the fishery, despite our excellent record of being disease-free.  The lack of regulation is adversely affecting stocks.  A report by Friel on the Foyle oyster and mussel fisheries in 1997 stated that oysters should not be fished before November and that new legislation is the "ideal opportunity" to develop the industry.  In its absence, spating takes place in late August and fishing takes place in September.  Legislation is needed to protect fishermen who want to conserve stocks and wait until later in the year.  The fishery is all but fished out by November.  This legislation must not fail in its basic aim of protecting the stock.I commend the Government on its grant aid for boats and BIM for its work with fishermen, but there is no legislative back-up.  The Bill will open many development opportunities for BIM and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  Of the 75 boats in question, 60 are half-deckers and 15 are 40-metre dredgers.  They employ approximately 200 people.Between 10,000 tonnes and 15,000 tonnes of blue mussels are landed with an estimated value of €10 million.  Approximately ten years ago, the landing at Moville was worth €1 million, which was a considerable amount at the time, and it was in this manner that we acquired the money to replace the collapsed pier.  I welcome the fact that the catch has increased substantially due to investment in basic infrastructure, which was followed by investment in the Carrickarory pier.  I also welcome the Minister's announcement of funding to continue the development of the Greencastle harbour.A small, but important from the perspective of tradition, part of the industry is that of beach gatherers, who are not mentioned in any of the consultation documents.  There has been a tradition of gathering winkles, seaweed and barnacles for the purposes of money and private consumption.  Others ask about sand, namely, who owns it and regulates its removal.  This reverts to the point made on the Crown estate.The Foyle needs an overall development plan.  The more aspects it embraces the better.  I would go so far as to include the areas of marine leisure and recreation.  Too many rivers, including the Swilly, to which Deputy Eamon Ryan referred, have had their potential ruined by a lack of co-ordination and proper planning.  I do not want that to happen to the 188 sq. km. of the Foyle.  While it will not be easy, a single co-ordinating unit provides hope.  Like the Bill, if something is worth doing, it is worth doing well.Some site holders have spent time and money trying to establish which sites are suitable for mussel cultivation, but there is no provision in the Bill to recognise their pre-legislative investment in aquaculture.  However, they have been supported by BIM.  We must keep the door open for those interested in developing the fisheries and it would be unfair not to differentiate them vis-à-vis other licence applicants.  Additional consideration should be given to those already in occupancy of sites when they apply for licences.  However, I welcome the provision to vest ownership of aquaculture stocks in the licensees.The Bill provides for the jurisdictional issue relating to the Foyle and, as the Minister and the Attorney General have stated, the first point of departure must be the definition of the lough.  While aquacultural development has been undertaken in Carlingford Lough, with licences issued to promoters operating south of the navigational channel by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and those north of the channel by DARD, no such development has occurred in Lough Foyle due to the jurisdictional uncertainties.  I query the status of the river bed in this respect.  The Bill provides, for the first time, the opportunities to regulate and licence aquaculture in Lough Foyle and creates an offence for those interfering in licence areas in both Foyle and Carlingford.There have been bad years when the "Foyle Fisheries Commission" were swear words in my community.  Having walked the red beds with commission staff and seen many of the projects developed there, including the insertion of counters and stock conservation measures that others ignored, I commend the efforts being made by Derek Anderson and his team.Some I know are still critical of the public consultation process in the North which had redefined aquaculture, blaming the Loughs Agency for that.  Sometimes, however, it is wrongly blamed or is caught by legislation, such as the legislation on the drift net ban.  We want real interaction, however, as this Bill is put into practice.  When the new board is constituted in a year's time, the Minister should ensure that those from the fishing industry or from a fishing background will be appointed.  Meanwhile I wish the old board well in what will be a challenging year.Many people have said this will be a massive opportunity for the tourism industry.  I am concerned, however, that it may become a tourism only event.  Many in Donegal are worried that the highest bidders will get the licences.  There must be respect for local people who have fished the Foyle and its tributaries for many years so they are not outbid or their applications considered less valuable than someone from Scandinavia.  This is an opportunity to offer an added value product, linked to community support for drift net fishermen, to ensure conservation and development on the river.One of the major polluters of the Foyle is Donegal County Council, which still lets raw sewage flow into it.  Controversy exists about sewerage schemes but decisions must be made because the local authority is as liable to be fined as anyone else.  Pollution cannot continue no matter who is responsible and the Minister should work with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure tertiary treatment works are put in place for the Moville-Greencastle sewerage scheme.  The river must have the chance to recover and if that means putting the outfall pipe into the channel, which might cost more, it should be done.People tell us that a wind farm would be lovely because the smolts could swim around, becoming a tourist attraction.  We want our smolts to go where they need to go and not to be prey for other species.I welcome the Bill's aim of defining the area of jurisdiction over the Foyle.  I ask the Minister to examine how we are paying for the British Queen's corgis through the seabed issue.  The Loughs Agency was held up for years as an example of North-South co-operation, something that annoyed my constituents who dealt with the body.  This legislation was held up as a further example of North-South co-operation but had the limited definition of aquaculture remained, I could not have supported it.  I trust it will now provide recognition for those who have invested in mussels and oysters to date while giving opportunities for new people who are serious about fishing.Achieving consensus on a policing or licensing regime is always difficult and this will be no easier.  Hard decisions will be necessary but they must be informed decisions.  A single regulator for all aspects makes sense.  If possible an overall development plan for the Foyle should now be embraced to give a clear, co-ordinated river map.  We could then ensure a less hazardous future than has been the case in other regions.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I appreciate that Deputy Keaveney knows a lot more about the Foyle fishery than I do, living in one of the most inland areas in Ireland with no access to the sea at all.  I welcome the opportunity, however, to say a few words because this forms part of the Good Friday Agreement and, in that context, is extremely important.It is unfortunate that the Northern Ireland Assembly is not in place to discuss this issue and then debate it with Members of this House who come from the affected areas.  I hope that situation will soon be rectified and the season of Christian love and goodwill offer the chance to overcome the final barriers to the establishment of the Assembly.The suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly has caused difficulties for the six North-South bodies, not least Waterways Ireland.  It has held up progress on the Ulster Canal and other extensions to the Erne waterways, creating problems for tourism.  The purpose of the Bill is to extend the functions of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission, one of the six North-South implementation bodies.The definition of aquaculture only relates to farming.  There is some anxiety about wild native mussels that are found in the Foyle.  There are also question marks over the definition of jurisdiction over certain areas.  I hope it will not be a major issue but we must address it.  The mussel farmers have invested money but what protection exists for them?We have heard much about consultation in the past but the consultation document for this was available in Northern Ireland but not to Deputies and Senators of these Houses, a point that was made to me before I came in.My colleague, Deputy Perry, the Fine Gael spokesman on the marine, has raised these issues in detail.  I do not know enough to go into detail but I could not help but agree with Deputy Keaveney's request to remember local people who have had access for years.  We must ensure that whatever legal bodies are set up, these people are recognised and this does not become a haven for outsiders.The agreement provides that the Loughs Agency would be given responsibility for aquaculture and fisheries and should have the power to promote and develop Loughs Foyle and Carlingford for recreation purposes.  I concur with Deputies Keaveney and Morgan about widening the scope of this document to make sure it is fully utilised to encourage the development of both loughs.  They are located near the Border in areas that have suffered great deprivation over the years.  All funding that might become available should be used.  The Minister also referred to the need for legislation in Northern Ireland.  We can only hope the Assembly will resume next March or April and will deal with the legislation, rather than using the more complicated route through Westminster.The Bill, when enacted, will provide a robust regime for the regulation of aquaculture on Lough Foyle.  I hope that will be the case and that it will turn out to be as good as this sounds.  The key provision, which confers power on the Loughs Agency to grant aquaculture licences, also permits it to issue penalties.  I have not read the Bill in detail but I am concerned about penalties because I am reminded of what has happened in farming.  I have dealt with a number of cases in the past few days of farmers who are in desperation and panic because they do not have a penny left as a result of penalties imposed on them.  Where people do wrong, they should be liable for penalties but justice must be seen to be done so people are not subject to penalties they cannot afford.  The farmers who came to my clinic recently are extremely worried and what is happening to them is unacceptable.  A number of departmental officials dealing with them are not worried by this.The Taoiseach needs to clarify a number of issues in his recent statements on the St. Andrews Agreement.  He has made it clear funding will be provided by the Exchequer to underpin the agreement, which is vital.  The Carlingford and Foyle boards will welcome this.  It was stated the Ulster Canal and the road between Dublin and Derry, the fourth largest city on the island, will be upgraded.  The Minister for Agriculture and Food issued a statement that the road between Dublin and Donegal, which goes through Derry, would be improved but the NRA has made it clear in the past few days that it has no plans whatsoever to upgrade the road between Monaghan town and the Border.  We want the facts to be correct and to get everything right.  I do not want to hear public statements that cannot be totally supported.  If it is to ensure the Good Friday Agreement works and is meaningful, the Government and the party of which I am proud to be a member, will give 100% support but a realistic, factual statement about funding for the projects for the canal and road I mentioned is required.  That is the least that can be done during this season of goodwill.I wish everybody the best of good luck and a happy and holy festive season.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I join Members in offering the compliments of the season to everybody.  I hope they have a nice, quiet, relaxed Christmas and a very happy new year.  Halfway through the year we will be in a battle but we should make the most of the festive season.I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  They raised many issues, including the more general context in which the Bill fits, which is the St. Andrews Agreement, as Deputy Crawford mentioned.  I will address that later.  The only reason Deputy Keaveney promised she would not bother me between now and the end of the year is she probably thinks she will not see me but the Deputy never fails to take an opportunity to make contact.  There is always one more issue with her but I wish her a very peaceful Christmas and I hope she will not contact me over the festive season about this or any other matter.  On a more serious note, Deputy Keaveney and other Members have taken an interest in this matter and everybody is concerned, with the opportunity open to us, that we should make the legislation as good as possible.  Members were generous in their acceptance of the need to introduce similar provisions in both jurisdictions so that the legislation can work.I also thank Members for their acknowledgment of the work of the board in this case and the chairman, Peter Savage.  As Deputy Morgan said, I know Mr. Savage almost as long as him but probably not at such close quarters.  He is a good chairperson because he is a straight talker and he has little time for bureaucracy and red tape.  He tends to want to get things done, which is a good trait in a chairperson.Deputy Keaveney referred to a local authority polluting Lough Foyle and I will ask my officials to take that matter up with the local authority in question.  The area is fragile and it must be ensured official bodies do not cause pollution or other difficulties.Deputy Perry made a number of kind remarks about the work that went into the legislation by my officials and he referred to the exclusion of the shellfish regulatory powers.  They are excluded because we had an issue about them but, following consultation, as I indicated in my opening contribution, those powers will be covered by an amendment on Committee Stage.A number of Deputies referred to the need for consultation and this is something with which I agree.  Fishermen have been consulted on the aquaculture implementation plan and they will be consulted on any regulations to be brought forward by the agency regarding aquaculture and fisheries.  It is important that local people and fishermen understand and accept such regulations.  Fishermen generally, and anglers in particular, represent a body, comprising mostly men but also women, that sees conservation as part of its role.  We will try to ensure they feel part of the decision-making process.Deputy Perry raised the issue of the cost of leases and so on and foreshore fees are being discussed by Department officials and the Crown Estates Commission.  The Crown Estates Commission seeks economic rents but we feel fees for aquaculture in the Foyle area should correspond with those applicable in both jurisdictions, as far as possible.Regarding Deputy Perry's point on the designation of areas for oyster, mussels and aquaculture, it is envisaged that the agency will carry out a full environmental impact statement which will allow it to determine areas for wild shell fisheries, aquaculture and areas required to be designated under EU environmental legislation.  This is the first step towards making decisions on the various designations and it is an open and transparent public process.Deputy Perry and a number of other Deputies, including Deputies Eamon Ryan and Broughan, referred to the need for fines for offences in the inland fisheries sector, especially the salmon sector.  My Department, in consultation with the National Fisheries Management Executive, is reviewing all 17 statutes that apply to the inland fisheries sector with a view to modernising and consolidating the legislation into a single statute.  This exercise will examine penalties and make recommendations on appropriate penalties for specific offences.A number of Deputies inquired about the issue of regulations on mussels.  There is an all-island system overseeing the allocation of mussel seeds and the agency participates in decisions regarding allocation.  It is important this system operates on an all-island basis as it ensures all operators in need of access to mussel seeds are treated fairly, regardless of their locations on the island.  It is planned to make the agency an authorised officer, under the Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006, to enforce mussel seed allocation regulations in the Foyle area.A general question was raised on the scope for expansion of North-South co-operation.  A review group exists, under the auspices of the North-South Ministerial Council and it will report its recommendations to the council when the terms of reference are agreed, the Northern Ireland Assembly is restored and the review is completed.  At that stage we will know what kind of expansion in North-South co-operation is possible.Deputy Broughan raised the issue of funding for the Loughs Agency and I am delighted to tell him that it has been well funded since its foundation.  Funding is provided by the Exchequer and the UK Treasury and the agency has been unable to spend all of the money available to it in recent years while it awaits the allocation of additional functions provided for under this Bill.  We do not anticipate a shortfall in this regard.The Deputy also raised the question of fees, jurisdictional claims and the Crown Estates Commission.  As I mentioned, the fees relating to foreshore licences will be agreed without prejudice to jurisdictional claims.  Aquacultural licensees in the Foyle region will pay fees directly to the agency and not to either the Department or the Crown Estates Commission.  One of the benefits of this Bill is that such payments will go directly to the body responsible.Deputy Broughan raised a question relating to the protection of investments made by people currently engaged in aquaculture in the region.  The implementation plan for aquaculture licensing shows account will be taken of previous experience of aquaculture in Lough Foyle in addition to previous investment there.  In drawing up the regulations for aquaculture in the Foyle, the agency will incorporate provisions setting out the criteria for the award of licences.  The investment made by the people referred to by Deputy Broughan will be one of the criteria.I mentioned the issue of consultation earlier and I agree with the point, to which I referred, made by Deputies Broughan and Perry.  The Loughs Agency has an advisory forum which comprises approximately 50 local representatives, including fishermen and people with various relevant interests.  It is kept informed of developments affecting the Loughs Agency by the agency itself.  The Northern Ireland consultation process allows for the fact that the Northern Ireland Assembly is currently suspended.  The normal consultation process on Bills in this jurisdiction has been followed regarding this Bill.Deputy Broughan, with a number of other Deputies, raised the issue of accountability.  The agency is accountable to the North-South Ministerial Council and both sponsoring Departments.  It is accountable in the same way every other non-commercial, semi-State body is accountable to its parent Department.The penalties specified in the Bill are the maximum available to the courts for offences under the proposed legislation.  The courts will, as always, have discretion regarding the penalty to be imposed for a particular offence.Regarding North-South co-operation while the Northern Ireland Assembly is suspended, it is obvious that there are benefits in working together to develop practical co-operation for mutual gain.  The British and Irish Governments have been working together on projects, this Bill being one such example.  We have undertaken a lengthy negotiation process and, once this project is in place, the current temporary facilities for the regional office in Carlingford will be replaced by a new purpose built building which will provide suitable accommodation for Loughs Agency staff based in the town.  A site has been identified and we intend to proceed with it in 2007.  Meanwhile, the Loughs Agency has continued to carry out its functions under existing agency legislation.Once the Stormont Assembly has been restored, meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council will resume.  North-South bodies will be able to operate without the restraints that have been imposed on them during the suspension of institutions and the Government will seek closer co-operation with Ministers in the restored Northern Ireland Executive.I thank Opposition Deputies for their co-operation on this Bill because it is important that we introduce it in tandem with the consultation process taking place in the North.  I wish Deputies, staff of the Houses and the officials in my Department a happy and holy Christmas.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The Government is committed to meeting Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions reduction target for the purpose of the Kyoto Protocol and we will do so in a manner which is logical and structured but without interfering in the growth and development of the nation.  The fundamental elements of our strategy for meeting our target involve domestic emission reductions across the economy, participation by 109 Irish installations in the EU emissions trading scheme and the purchase of a limited number of carbon credits through the flexible mechanisms provided in the Kyoto Protocol.The purchase of carbon credits is a legitimate, practical and logical option under the Kyoto Protocol.  As well as being a key part of the Kyoto arrangements, carbon trading is endorsed in the Stern report and by the EU Commission and is central to virtually every member state's Kyoto programme, as well as being supported by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, and Al Gore.  However, the Irish debate on carbon credits regrettably has been polarised.The participating states in Kyoto could have adopted a variety of approaches, such as the system suggested by Deputy Eamon Ryan for allocating every person on the planet a carbon ration, but did not do so on the grounds that they would create a massive global bureaucratic burden.  Another such option was to place an absolute cap on carbon emissions, which would require every industry to cut emissions to a pre-determined figure.  While this idea has clear merit, it also has cost implications which, in the Irish case, would be ruinous for many businesses.The Kyoto parties could also have gone down the road of mandatory carbon taxes, as was proposed by the Green Party and more recently by Sinn Fein, but the economic and social disadvantages were seen as outweighing the practical benefits.  Furthermore, the effect of carbon taxes is regarded as questionable.  The increases in global oil prices over the past two years has not resulted in a significant decrease in transport emissions, while the increased fuel costs associated with a carbon tax would primarily affect vulnerable sections of the community.  Over the past few weeks, various other solutions have been put forward, no doubt sincerely, in the House and in the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government.  There is merit to many of these but a judgment must be made on whether their costs outweigh their virtues.In the debate at the joint committee on the emissions trading scheme, it was argued that the State should not buy credits because doing so would take the burden off polluting companies.  This line of debate misses the point that the emissions trading system applies to 109 companies and places the specific burden on their shoulders of cutting annual emissions by 3 million tonnes.What would be the consequence to Irish industry or foreign direct investment if this burden was to be significantly increased in the manner suggested by the Labour Party and the Green Party?  What would be the effect on the cement industry, even if it is not our favourite industry?  The damage, for example, to the cement plant in Deputy O'Dowd's constituency would be ruinous.  As that Deputy has argued, a balance must be found.Yesterday, I met representatives from the Irish pharmaceutical sector which, they said, directly employs 24,000 people and exports goods to the value of €40 billion, with a further 20,000 to 30,000 people employed related areas.  The sector incurs significant energy costs and is part of the trading system, but it would face a perilous future if we were to introduce more restrictive measures.  Who would explain to workers in Aughinish Alumina or small businesses that they are losing their jobs because our unnecessarily fundamentalist approach is driving up energy costs?A report issued this week by Sustainable Energy Ireland suggested that emissions from the energy sector grew by 3.2%, while output grew by 3%, due to an increase in electricity generated by turf.  In response, Deputy Gilmore has suggested that we should curtail peat extraction, stop using it as an energy source and conserve bogs.

This Government has done more than any previous one to designate bogs for protection.  However, Deputy Gilmore's proposal could be very expensive.  Who would explain to the workers in the two newly constructed peat power stations in the midlands why they are losing their jobs?  What would be the implications for our security of energy supply of putting all our eggs in one basket?  These power stations have been included in Ireland's emissions projections and they have the potential for being used for the co-generation of energy using bio-crops.  I acknowledge that peat bogs are important for biodiversity and as carbon sinks, but I am also conscious of their economic importance.  What about domestic turf burning?  Would anybody in this House really be happy to ban turf cutting, which is part of the way of life in many midland and western counties?

He made the valid point that public transport is important if we are to cut our emissions.  I remind him that the Government is investing a great deal of money in Transport 21 for that reason.  I disagree with his suggestion that the proposed motorway between Dublin and Galway should be put on hold until a Luas system has been developed in Galway.  Would the people of Galway, including the members of that city's council and its mayor, agree with that suggestion?  I do not think the people who live in the villages on the existing road between Dublin and Galway, which are currently choked with traffic, would agree.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	457	A great deal has been said about the transport sector, which is a very heavy producer of emissions.  A key point that is often overlooked in debates of this nature is that the UN's greenhouse gas accounting rules mean that fuel — petrol and diesel — that is purchased by motorists and hauliers in this State, but consumed elsewhere, must be recorded in Ireland's greenhouse gas inventory.  I do not know why that point has not come to the fore.  Such fuel purchases — this phenomenon is sometimes referred to as "fuel tourism" — were estimated to have accounted for 2.4 million tonnes of Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions in 2005.  That is the equivalent of two thirds of the Government's annual purchasing requirement of 3.6 million tonnes.The revenue that is raised from excise and VAT on the sale of such fuel amounts to approximately €370 million per year.  Members will be aware that the total amount allocated in the recent budget to meet the Government's allowance-purchasing costs was €270 million.  That cost is more than offset by the receipts from fuel tourism.  I make that point in response to those who have argued that the Government's actions in this regard are equivalent to picking up a tax cost.  We have to take a more balanced view.  I do not deny that arguments can be made on all sides of this debate.  I am simply saying that we need to strike the kind of balance that has been suggested by a number of Members.The European Commission supports the expansion of emissions trading to a global level, which was recommended in the Stern report.  This effective instrument is consistent with the principles which underpin the Kyoto Protocol.  I do not doubt that emissions trading will continue be a key feature of the international climate change regime.  Deputy Cuffe has acknowledged on a number of occasions that the flexible mechanisms which are provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, particularly the clean development mechanism, are important not only to developed nations but also to developing countries because they attract significant investment in modern clean technology.  This aspect of the debate was evident at the recent meeting in Nairobi of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol.  The flexible mechanisms are important for investing countries as well as the countries where the investment is made.Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions, as a proportion of all global emissions, account for less than the equivalent of 30 seconds.  If we closed down the entire Irish economy, we would cause a great deal of hardship on this island but the global impact would be negligible.  We must accept that economic and social problems would arise if we decided not to buy credits to supplement our domestic action aimed at meeting our Kyoto Protocol commitments.  Other countries with strong environmental commitments, such as Denmark and the Netherlands, have had well-developed purchasing programmes in place for a number of years.  The alternative for Ireland, which is to force industry or the domestic sector to carry the full burden, would have severe consequences.  It would become even more costly to locate business and jobs in Ireland, the cost base of all industries would rise, electricity prices would be inflated and domestic producers would face undercutting from imports.  Who would benefit from undermining companies and jobs in Ireland, which would be the precise consequence of the excessively rigid ideological approach that is being advocated by some people?We do not have to choose between meeting our Kyoto Protocol targets and maintaining economic competitiveness and growth — we can and should do both.  We have a moral responsibility to meet our Kyoto Protocol targets and we have a national responsibility to maintain economic competitiveness and growth.  That point was made by Sir Nicholas Stern in his often quoted, but, I suspect, seldom read, report.  The obvious benefits of a shift to a low-carbon economy would include significantly lower energy costs and major gains in efficiency.  We all agree with the suggestion in the report that substantial opportunities would accrue from a shift to a low-carbon economy.  That argument is based on a great deal of logic.  The report states that "markets for low-carbon technologies will be worth at least $500 billion, and perhaps much more, by 2050".Ireland has a proven track record of decoupling greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth.  In 2004, the last year for which figures are available, national emissions were 23% above their 1990 levels.  Our economy grew by 150% in the same time.  There are many more cars, houses and jobs in the country than there were in 1990.  There has been significant growth in industries which are emitters.  I will spell out clearly the Government's position in case it is not understood.  Ireland will comply with its Kyoto Protocol targets sensibly and honestly, without compromising economic growth or jobs.  It will adopt a sensible approach that is fully consistent with the Kyoto Protocol.The Government has capped the State's purchasing requirement at 3.6 million allowances per annum, or 18 million allowances in total over the five years between 2008 and 2012.  Incidentally, if one does some calculations, one will probably find that the allowances to be purchased by Ireland over that period, as a proportion of all global greenhouse gas emissions, account for less than the equivalent of one second.  The announcement in the budget that €270 million will be provided between now and 2013 sets out a definite financial basis for purchasing.  It will build on the money that was provided by the Minister for Finance in 2006.  In addition to providing financial resources, it is essential to put in place appropriate institutional arrangements for the purchase of carbon credits by the State.  The Bill before the House designates the National Treasury Management Agency as the purchasing agent for the State.I will outline briefly some of the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 provides for the definitions in the Bill, which are quite straightforward.  Section 2 addresses the main functions of the Bill.  It establishes the carbon fund, gives control and management of the fund to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and delegates the management of the fund to the National Treasury Management Agency.  The purchase of Kyoto units by the agency will be guided by certain principles.  The units will have to contribute to the ultimate objective of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.  There will be no investment in projects related to nuclear power.  The investment risk will be minimised, particularly in respect of the timely delivery of credits.  Good value for money will be obtained.  Section 2 also provides that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government may, following consultation with the Minister for Finance, direct the agency to purchase Kyoto units on foot of an agreement between the Government and other sovereign parties, or to dispose of Kyoto units if the amount held is surplus to requirements.  The reference to the Government and other sovereign parties is important because government-to-government trading is the most ethical and economical way of proceeding in this respect.Section 3 provides for the funding that will be required for the acquisition of Kyoto units.  This provision enables the National Treasury Management Agency to draw funds directly from the Central Fund on an ongoing basis as needs arise.  Sections 5, 6 and 7 provide for the provision of proper accounts by the agency in managing the carbon fund, the audit of the accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the accountability of the agency to the Committee of Public Accounts.  The agency will also be required to provide the Minister of the day with an annual report of its activities in managing the carbon fund.  The Minister will lay such a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  There will be full democratic accountability in the process.  Section 8 provides that the Minister may revoke some or all of the functions assigned under the Bill to the National Treasury Management Agency, following consultation with the Minister for Finance.The House will be aware that the European Commission recently made a decision on Ireland's national allocation plan for emissions trading between 2008 and 2012.  I realise that this has been a busy period for Members and, therefore, they might not have had an opportunity to consider fully the contents of the Commission's report.  There were some interesting points in the Commission's adjudication.  It took the view that Ireland has not shown sufficient progress on the purchase of Kyoto units to supplement domestic emission reductions.  That observation belies the suggestion that a negative view of carbon credits is taken in Europe or elsewhere — that is simply not the case.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	461	The notion that purchasing carbon credits is somehow dubious was further contradicted in a joint press release that was issued yesterday by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank.  Announcing the fund in which Ireland has invested, the president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development stated:The region [in which the fund is to be invested] has huge potential to address the issues of climate change and energy security, which are two themes that dominate the global agenda.  The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is helping the region to realise this potential by financing the efficient use of energy that will cut demand and imports, and also reduce pollution and adverse climate change.Management of this investment will be taken over by the National Treasury Management Agency on enactment of the Bill.  This is endorsement internationally of the ethical nature of the very investment we have been discussing somewhat heatedly.Early enactment of the Carbon Fund Bill is a further important step in demonstrating progress towards meeting our Kyoto target.  It is a sensible and perfectly valid option which will ensure that the Irish companies participating in the European emissions trading scheme do not bear an unfair share of the national or international burden in the period 2008-12.Ireland will play its part in terms of the Kyoto commitments but we must bear one fact in mind.  Our emissions are minuscule in terms of the global problem.  That does not take away from our moral responsibility to meet our targets but if we were to close down all of Irish business, we would save less than the equivalent of 20 seconds of the globe's emissions.  The impact globally would be negligible.  The impact nationally would be catastrophic.  A sense of balance is needed in the debate.The importance of this Bill for the viability and competitiveness of Irish industry cannot be overstated.  I thank the Whips for making time for today's debate.  I commend the Bill to the House and urge all sides to support it.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	462	This is an important debate but there is not sufficient time to fully tease out the arguments.  What this country needs is leadership in terms of climate change but we are not getting that from the Government.  We need leadership, a clear vision, a plan of action and, most importantly, a change in our own behaviour.  The reality is that unless all of us make fundamental changes in our homes, our lifestyle, where we work, how we go to work and where we live, we will not deal successfully with the issue of climate change.It is disingenuous of the Minister to suggest that regardless of how bad our emissions are in Ireland, they are only minuscule in terms of the world's emissions.  The reality is that all of us, no matter where we live, must make those changes.  This Bill is about Ireland not having made the changes.  It is about industry not being able to cut back on its fossil fuel use and its production of carbon dioxide emissions and not using other initiatives, which I will deal with later.  The option to buy carbon credits elsewhere is an indication of the distance to target on which we are missing out.As I understand it, our distance to target is approximately 7.14 million tonnes of CO2 which we must reduce to stay within the Kyoto limits.  Any money we spend abroad in buying carbon credits, regardless of how attractive that might appear, is an acknowledgement of a failure of the system to deal effectively with the issues at home.The Minister made reference to industries in my constituency.  He referred to the cement industry and to Premier Periclase, which is an important factory in my town.  I am very much aware of the effect of a carbon tax on those industries.  I am equally aware of the effect on the other 109 facilities throughout the country.  I acknowledge and support the principle that our industry must be competitive and that anything we do in terms of climate change must have at its core the maintenance of our economic development while cutting back on our emissions, using new technology and changing our ways to make that happen.Most of our problems in Ireland arise from energy production and transport.  While the Minister is not responsible for the transport portfolio, in terms of the national spatial strategy it has failed.  All the infrastructure we are building is on the east coast.  Everybody is trying to live on the east coast but we should make it attractive for people to move out of the city and live in Cork, Galway, Donegal or wherever.  That would reduce our transport emissions and deal effectively with the problems of modern Ireland, where we are all crowded into the Dublin region.It is disgraceful that for many of us who travel by train or car, the infrastructure does not exist to encourage people to get out of their cars.  There are no park and ride facilities, a point I raise constantly, on the north of the country for those travelling into the city.  That is not acceptable.  There is no joined up thinking in the Government to deal effectively with the policy on energy, transport and agriculture and ensure all of us make every effort to change our lifestyles.  We must make it easier for people to travel by public transport and encourage them not to pollute with carbon dioxide emissions.The Government must encourage investment in new technology.  We should encourage people to change the type of fuel they use.  We should examine the possibility of increasing forestry, improving efficiency and effectiveness in business and improving efficiency in our technology.  More money ought to be invested in research and development and we should incentivise that area as much as possible in terms of tax relief and new technology to allow people to change.  At the core of all of that is the need to reduce our CO2 emissions.  Notwithstanding the fact that I support in principle the need to buy carbon credits abroad, we are not doing enough at home.One of the key actions the Government has failed to take was to set a sufficiently high target for renewable energies in terms of our total supply of energy from all sectors.  Much of the money that is going abroad should be used to incentivise people to set up wind farms and examine research and development projects in renewable energy.  That is an opportunity the Government has missed.We must change the way we live.  We must look at countries like Sweden which decoupled from thermal power production to biomass.  We must encourage moves to all those areas.Fine Gael's policy on those issues is clear.  We will legislate to compel all fuel retailers to blend biofuel into fuel such as petrol, diesel and home heating oil.  We would remove all excise duty on biofuels produced from renewable energy crops.  In practice, that would mean that producers would not have to pay excise duty on the biofuels they produce, the knock-on effect being that consumers would enjoy cheaper fuel at the pumps.We believe in an open public competition for start-up grants for the establishment and operation of biofuel processing plants.  We would require all public transport vehicles and public service vehicles to convert, where practical and feasible, to forms of biofuel whether in a pure or blended form.  The Minister's refusal to take our proposals on board means that our environment and our economy will suffer for another year.Notwithstanding the green sell on the budget, there is no bite in what the Minister is doing because it will not happen.  He is consulting but he is not acting.  There are no substantial changes in VRT.  He talked about redressing the issues in terms of car tax and pollutants but there is no real change in that respect because the Government has failed and continues to fail in that regard.  It is all words and no action.  That is not acceptable to us and it is not acceptable to the country.The other issue I want to address is the way Fine Gael will address the issue of climate change.  What will we do that is different?  How will we ensure that there will be real change throughout our country?  The core of our policy will be that the energy committees that have been set up — I understand 16 committees were set up initially throughout the country — to advise and deal with issues surrounding energy conservation and climate change will be put on a proper footing.  They will be part of a local government effort, led by local government, to examine every aspect of life in our communities; it will be driven locally.  From talking to people about this issue, the main questions they raise is who is introducing change, what is different and what is happening.  The Government has policies on this area and the SEI is established, which does fantastic work, but nobody is driving the agenda for change locally.  That is what my party will change.  That is where the effort must be made and we will do that.It is a shame that some of the energy committees established throughout the country do not have the necessary funding to continue operating.  Some people working on them are employed part-time and there is no future for them in these jobs.  Local government should be at the core of change with a real and aggressive policy that focuses on reaching local targets to reduce our overall emissions.  There are leaders in the field.  The local authorities in Limerick and Clare worked together and produced a strategy for climate change and emissions reduction for those counties.  We hold up that strategy as the bible to be followed by every other local authority.  That is the direction in which we need to move.  We need to examine this issue at a micro and county level and not only at the national level.  We need to ensure local authorities will drive this change and we need to put in place a comprehensive strategy to provide that all policies locally will be examined from a green point of view.  Every planning application should be vetted for carbon proofing and energy conservation, but that is not happening.  We need such a strategy as a default system in local government whereby when an application is submitted, it is examined specifically not only in terms of planning and engineering issues but in terms of climate change and energy conservation.  We will ensure that every local authority will conduct a full inventory of CO2 emissions and then produce a plan of action to reduce them.Part of the problem is that the emissions trading scheme rightly deals with the major polluters but nobody deals with all the other people who use energy.  There is no focus on light industry, schools, hospitals, shops, other sections of the economy and areas of our life where these changes must be made.  Fine Gael will insist that local authorities will consult all those businesses which are outside the scope of the emissions trading scheme, inquire of them their plans to reduce energy usage and request that they report within a year on what changes they will make.My party will advise people on the best way forward and on best international practice to address climate change.  We will encourage the adoption of best practice to deal with climate change, even as a benchmark as to what people can and should do.Who is going to schools and pointing out to teachers that they have a unique opportunity to influence young people in this respect?  Dealing will climate change can be driven in the school curriculum.  The Minister could advise the Minister for Education and Science that he wants this issue included as a core subject under the SPHE or some other heading to ensure climate change is addressed.  Nobody is doing that.  People are talking about that but no action is being taken.  The Minister should ensure that bodies such as hospitals and Government Buildings are approached to establish what is being done to address climate change and how such necessary change is being driven.  The Minister should discuss this issue with officials in other Departments.  He should make a start with his ministerial colleagues and inquire of them the cars they drive, the level of emissions for which they are responsible and how will they lead in introducing the change that is required.  That is what must happen.  When carbon proofing and energy conservation policies are at the core of all activities throughout the country, then we can say we are dealing with climate change.  We can then say that if we do not meet our targets, we can explore the alternative the Minister has put forward in this Bill and we can consider purchasing our carbon credits abroad.The reality is that the Government has failed.  According to an article in The Irish Times, Ireland is not doing enough to reduce gas emissions.  Notwithstanding what the Minister said, under the protocol the Taoiseach has been told we are not doing enough to deal with our emissions.  From reading an article on the European website, I understand that mandatory limits will be imposed for 2012 onwards.  Therefore, it is time to get our act together.  It is not the case that by our actions we will save the world or destroy it, but at the core of the Minister’s thinking is a failure to acknowledge that individual responsibility must be taken by all of us to deal with it.  His comments were supercilious and do not make much sense.It is time to introduce the change that is required.  We on this side of the House will lead such a change strategy, if the Minister cannot.  He needs to put in place a policy that is at the core of people's lives and of local government and that is driven by local government, which must be given the necessary new powers to take control, carry out audits and ensure everybody is consulted and complies, if they can, with such policy.Santa Monica in California has an attractive policy in leading such change.  However, in Ireland nothing is happening in that respect.  Speeches are made, we have credits and the ETS, but nobody is moving in the direction of bringing about individual change.  The Minister is not driving that agenda and that is his biggest failure and a massive failure of the Government.  The country is crying out for it and people want leadership.  We will provide it on this side of the House.  The Minister's speech was poor on vision.  He needs to go back to the drawing board.  He needs to re-examine his approach and base it on best practice in this area worldwide.  He needs to change matters but he is not doing that.  That is the biggest regret of all.The Minister made it clear in his speech and I will make it clear in my contribution that we in Fine Gael support the concept and principle of the Kyoto Agreement.  There are three options in terms of meeting our commitments to the Kyoto Agreement.  We can introduce tax, reduce emissions and use the emissions trading scheme and carbon credits.  We accept that must happen.  I support the principle of the Bill that we must have that as an option.  It may be cheaper to do that rather than close an industry.  The Minister referred to the cement industry.  I am sure cement could be imported from other countries in the world and, if that happened, our factories in Limerick and Drogheda might close.  That could happen.  I do not want that to happen nor do I believe does anybody else.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	465	This is the last Dáil debate of 2006.  It is about an issue which coincides, almost to the day, with the life of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government but it is an issue which will affect our finances and our quality of life for decades to come.The Kyoto Agreement was the most important international treaty of our times.  It was made in 1997, just as Fianna Fáil and the PDs were settling in to what would become ten years of Government.  The Kyoto Agreement told those who did not already know that greenhouse gases were damaging our planet, that they would cause significant and unpredictable changes in climate, and that the countries and peoples of the world would have to act collectively to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to reconcile economic activity with the environmental imperative to protect this planet.Some simply did not believe it.  It was not until the levees of New Orleans were washed away that President Bush even acknowledged the possibility of climate change and global warming.  It was, as Al Gore put it, "an inconvenient truth", especially for those so closely tied to the oil industry.The freak storms, flash floods and other climatic events of the past decade have acted as trailers for what global warming may eventually do to our cities, coasts and neighbourhoods.  The recent Stern report in the United Kingdom documents the reality of global warming and climate change, and the necessity for urgent and effective action.Almost ten years ago, at the beginning of this Fianna Fáil-PD Government, the Kyoto Agreement set down for Ireland what needed to be done.  The European Union, to its great credit, took Kyoto seriously and agreed a basket of measures which were required by European Union member states.  Most countries were required to cut their emissions of greenhouse gases.  Ireland, however, was allowed an increase of 13% above the 1990 levels, given our need for economic growth and the need to catch up with the rest of the European Union.  We were given until 2012 to be 13% above our 1990 greenhouse case emissions.However, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party never took Kyoto seriously.  It took them three years to produce a national climate change strategy, which they then ignored.  In 2002, they handed out 95% of the carbon allowances for the emissions trading scheme for free, even though they were being urged by the European Commission to auction more of these allowances.  With just over five years to go until the 2012 deadline, Ireland is now 23%-26% above the 1990 level, depending on whose figures one takes.  According to the Minister himself, Ireland must reduce carbon emissions by 8 million tonnes by 2012, obtain a further reduction of 3 million tonnes under the ETS scheme and then buy 3.6 million tonnes of carbon credits on the carbon market.  For a country that has actually increased its carbon emissions in the ten years since Kyoto, that is a tall order.The greatest failure of public policy in Ireland for the past half century has been that of this Government on climate change.  The Government has let the party continue for the past ten years and has failed to act effectively on Kyoto.  As our country's economy and finances improved, this Government concluded that we could carry on polluting and pay the carbon bill at a later stage, from our increased wealth.  This reckless, irresponsible policy — pollute now, pay later — will cost the Irish taxpayer very dearly.  It may damage both our economy and our environment.  It is the Government's failure to deal effectively with the Kyoto Protocol that is exposing to greatest risk the very businesses and industries that the Minister purports to protect.The Carbon Fund Bill 2006 before the House today will set up a means by which taxpayers' money will be used to buy our way out of reducing carbon emissions.  The Government states that Ireland will have to buy 3.6 million tonnes of carbon per annum for each of the five years up to 2012, at a cost of €15 per tonne and at a total cost to the taxpayer €270 million.  This is a gross under-estimate of the total potential cost.  The figure of 3.6 million tonnes does not take any account of the additional 1.5 million tonnes which may now have to be bought following the European Commission's decision to reduce the emission trading scheme allowances by that amount.  I hope that the Minister will be successful in mitigating that cut in his talks with the Commission, but it is likely that when the new national allocations plan is finally approved, it will result in some additional requirement for the purchase of carbon.The Minister's figures also assume that the country will achieve a reduction of at least 8 million tonnes of carbon over the next five years, despite the fact that over the past 15 years we have increased our carbon output by about a quarter.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that the amount of carbon which we will be required to buy in each of the next five years will be at least 5 million tonnes, not the 3.6 million tonnes estimated by the Government.  It is also reasonable to assume that the price of carbon will increase. The Minister is assuming a price of €15 per tonne.  The European Commission believes that the price of carbon is too low and is making the ETS less than effective.  It wants the price of carbon to increase to about €30 per tonne, and there is now a considerable body of informed international opinion which indicates that the price of carbon will increase to that level.  In that scenario, the short-term cost to the Irish taxpayer will not be the €270 million predicted by the Government but €750 million, which is 5 million tonnes per annum for five years at €30 per tonne.  That will pay the bill only to 2012, after which the cost could increase by several multiples, as the second round of Kyoto will require major reductions in carbon emissions.In effect, the Government is now asking the taxpayer for €750 million to buy hot air.  This is five times the amount of money the Government wasted on PPARS, 15 times the amount wasted on electronic voting machines and 50 times the amount spent on the equestrian centre in Punchestown.  This money is being spent to pay for the Government's failure on Kyoto.  When people wonder why, despite all the country's wealth and the Government's tax revenues, we cannot get a bus on time, cannot get a bed in hospital for a sick relative, or cannot get enough guards to protect the innocent from crime, we should remember that this Government is wasting the taxpayers' money on failed pet projects, as well as on the purchase of hot air.This could have been avoided if the Government had acted on time and had given responsible leadership since the Kyoto Protocol was agreed almost ten years ago.  The carbon fund should have been established at least when the ETS began.  Instead of gifting carbon allowances to polluting industries, the Government could have sold or auctioned more of those allowances and put the proceeds into the fund.  That would at least have reduced the financial burden on the taxpayer.  More importantly, there are many steps which could and should have been taken and can still be taken to reduce carbon emissions in the first place, which would be better for the environment and easier on our collective pockets.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I have limited time.  The Minister can speak when he is concluding.  Over the past ten years, this Government has built 500,000 houses and missed an opportunity to maximise energy conservation.  Instead of implementing the EU directive on the energy rating of buildings, the Government has sought a derogation for three years.  Over the past ten years, EU policy on agriculture has changed, as has the practice of agriculture.  Instead of paying farmers to produce nothing, farm supports could be used to encourage and support farmers to produce the raw materials for bio-fuels.  It would be better for farmers, better for the environment and better for the taxpayer.  Instead of closing down the sugar factories and allowing them to be sold off to property developers, they could be converted to the production of more bio-fuels.Why do we not have a decent grants scheme for improving the energy efficiency of homes, schools, and all our older buildings? Given the dispersed nature of our settlement pattern, why do we not use the country's roof space to capture solar energy in greater quantity?  We are making some progress with wind energy, but given the size of our maritime area — we own almost ten times more sea than land — why are we not leading the world in developing wave energy?Given the Government's apparent belief that the market is the answer to everything, why has the market not been set to work more effectively to cut down carbon emissions?  Where are the tax incentives so favoured in every other area of economic endeavour?  Why is there no system of green tax credits to encourage energy conservation and incentivise carbon reductions, cleaner technologies and a cleaner environment?  Members can imagine what €750 million in green tax credits could achieve, but the Government intends simply to get the taxpayer to pay for its failure to get it right on Kyoto.The carbon fund will be used to buy carbon credits from people elsewhere in the world who are too poor to put carbon into the atmosphere themselves.  Taxpayers' money will be used to buy carbon credits from that quarter of the world's population who are too poor to have electricity, in order to facilitate us to continue to keep SUVs pumping out poison along the Stillorgan road.  We will buy the right to have air conditioners from people who are too poor to have an electric bulb or fridge or even the food to put into it.  This practice represents environmental imperialism.  It is the 21st century equivalent of the practice whereby corn was shipped from our shores while people starved during the Famine.  We are now the ones shipping the corn and buying up the carbon.  Hunger and poverty are no less painful in Africa now than they were in Ireland 160 years ago.The Labour Party does not oppose the Bill because we have a principled objection to the establishment of a carbon fund, but because it is almost ten years too late.  While we recognise the fund as a perfectly legitimate element of the Kyoto package, it is obvious the Government intends to take advantage of it to pay for its mistakes and failures on climate change.  We oppose the Bill because we want to alert the Irish people to the enormous price they will yet pay for bad and wasteful Government over the past ten years.  When historians look back at today to wonder at and regret the missed opportunities, they will ask why in the best of times Ireland was cursed by a wasteful, incompetent Government which had no vision and was unable or unwilling to harness the country's economic success for the social and environmental well-being of our people.  Nowhere have the Government's failures been more evident than in the crucial area of climate change.This is the time of year when we all turn our eyes to the polar cap.  While there still is a polar cap and before it melts away, and Santa has to be transported by paddling his canoe rather than by sleigh and reindeer, I take the opportunity of wishing a happy Christmas to the Minister, his officials, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and Members of the House.

It is symptomatic of an attitude problem and also a disingenuous approach by the Minister.

They know that relative to other countries Ireland performs atrociously when it comes to climate change.  The US, we know, is internationally the worst offender.  Next, in terms of per capita emissions come Australia, New Zealand and then Ireland.  When we describe ourselves as being part of the European project and so forth, we are at about twice the EU average as regards carbon emissions.  That is shameful for Ireland.  On the other hand, we try to present Ireland as a clean and green country.  Long may that brand work for us, but it is not helped by the reality of our climate change failure.  When the Minister says ours is a small amount of carbon dioxide in relation to global emissions, it is worth bearing in mind calculations which have found that perhaps 20 hours could be the equivalent of Ireland’s emissions per year.  That is close to a day.  We have one day a year, and perhaps it is today, given that this is the day on which the Dáil has ordered its business to deal with climate change and the carbon fund.

I am putting in perspective that there is, first and foremost, a moral responsibility rather than arguing about how much it is.  The bottom line is that we are failing in terms of our commitments.  We are obviously hanging a great deal on the aspect of the Kyoto package which states that carbon trading is legitimate.  However, it was seen as a supplement to the actions which were to be taken domestically, not a primary part.  That is why this Bill has to be rejected because certainly the budget presented the €270 million carbon trading package as the foremost central big idea coming from this Government.  That in itself is to abuse the understanding arrived at in Kyoto.I take the point made by Deputy Gilmore about the imperialistic aspect of other countries who are told they may continue so long as we pay for our business as usual.  Of the 500 projects mentioned in Nairobi, my colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who was there just before the Minister, found that two of them were in Africa.

It is very important we go beyond this legislation, which is sending out the wrong signals.  It is quite irresponsible economically, in that it is presuming that we will buy carbon credits for perhaps €10 or €15, or maybe €20.  It is a flexible and fluctuating situation.  The Stern report, however, suggests we could be looking at $85 per tonne of carbon dioxide.  The Minister can nod his head as much as he likes, but I do not see him deciding the price.  The Minister has given much credit to the Stern report and I agree it is an important breakthrough study.  If Stern is saying $85, then we need to take it seriously.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	479	Just to correct the Deputy——
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	480	That is what Stern says it will be.  I am not deciding this, and neither is the Minister.  I want him to bear in mind that he may be coming at this from a completely different viewpoint from the reality.  We need targets and that is something the Minister failed to accept from the Green Party when it put forward its climate change targets Bill 2005, the first legislation in this regard.  That would have meant that year by year we would commit ourselves to reductions, which would give a clear signal to business in particular as well as to every citizen to recognise that graduated reductions would be made each year.  Our reductions need to be well below what the Minister or even the European Union is considering, and that is coming from the Stern report as well.The message to business is very mixed, when the Minister talks about €270 million for a carbon fund and just €14 million for bioenergy growers.  A clear lack of priority is attached to measures in this country that would save us from having to pay for a carbon fund.  This is part of a much larger picture.  Reference was made to the Arctic and melting ice caps, but this is also an enormous opportunity.  The imagination, as well as the planning needed for this just seems to have passed the Minister by.  We are talking about rising sea levels, melting ice caps and enormous refugee problems which the United Nations High Commission on Refugees has not even begun to acknowledge — because this is an environmental issue and it only deals with political refugees. A major blindspot exists regarding the impact on Ireland, which I believe will relate primarily to refugees, first and foremost, before we feel the impact of rising seas.  That is something which I believe this Government has not even countenanced.The Stern report understood competitiveness.  Even though the Minister says he wants to keep business competitive, he is genuinely missing the point as to how to do this in a climate of a low carbon economy.  In many cases this is not the companies that are feeding the Fianna Fáil Party as well as the Celtic tiger, such as the large construction firms that manage to get away with low insulation norms and high energy use as a legacy from their work.  It is the companies that are striving to set up off-shore wind farms and to develop geothermal and solar power and other aspects of the 21 renewable technologies.  At the same time they are being faced with quite a number of cowboys in the sector because the Government has not introduced an adequate regulatory framework to require registration of trained people and provide the training required.  I have experienced this myself as I had solar panels installed that were put in incorrectly.  I must spend more money to rectify it because people are allowed to get insurance and simply carry on.  While they pretend to be experts, one finds out in the long run.  Of course such operators claim that one will recoup one's money in ten to 15 years, by which time they have fled.  This is a perfect recipe for a cowboy operator.  The Minister has a responsibility to clamp down in this regard, in order that the basic renewable technology sector does not find itself dragged down by people with low standards.  Regrettably, this is happening at present.  The Minister should deal with it.

It is no different to Neville Chamberlain returning from Germany before the Second World War waving a piece of paper saying people should not worry, it is not such a major problem, it is only a small country and peace in our time.  The phrase, "the Minister ain't seen nothing yet" is apposite and this situation must be dealt with greater seriousness than that with which he has started.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	485	I take this opportunity to wish the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and everyone in Leinster House a happy Christmas.  I also wish everyone well in the new year.  Some of the Minister's comments, in at least part of his speech, were designed specifically to try to enliven the debate.  There could be no other reason because some of it bordered on the nonsensical.During his budget speech last week, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was at pains to give the impression that the environment is a priority for the Government.  It is a pure stunt for the Minister to try to convince Members that the purchase of a further €270 million worth of carbon allowances constitutes an environmental measure.  This is a cost that taxpayers should not be obliged to bear.  Had we acted to cut emissions, we would not be forced to purchase such allowances.  Ireland should be aiming beyond the Kyoto targets, which merely represent a minimum level with which all states should comply.The Minister asserted that the squandering of €270 million was ethical.  Perhaps this is the case, particularly at this late stage.  However, the Government's complete lack of action for many years to prevent carbon emissions, thereby getting us to this position in the first place, is unethical.  The Government claims it is working to meet the environmental pressures and to improve the quality of our environment.  However, this has not been demonstrated and it must act now to implement immediate measures to combat the damage being done to the environment.  Members should consider the example of announcing a motor tax related to emissions in the budget.  However, this measure will not come into force until 2008 and Sinn Féin calls for it to be implemented immediately.  Were the Minister serious about this issue, he would do so without waiting for 12 months.Only a fortnight ago, the European Commission reduced the allowances under the EU emissions trading scheme by almost 7% below the emissions proposed in the national plans produced by ten member states for allocating carbon emission allowances to energy-intensive industrial plants for the period in question.  The Commission sought a 6.4% decrease in Ireland's proposed allocations, as it expects transport emissions to increase at a faster rate than expected.  Everyone, apart from the Government, accepts this.  The Commission also found the State had not made sufficient progress in its arrangements for Government purchases of allowances under the Kyoto Protocol.  Had the Government done this earlier, it would not be necessary to rush through this legislation, for which Members do not even have time for a proper debate.The €270 million being thrown by the Government at this carbon fund initiative is a complete waste of funds.  While it may be necessary, it constitutes a waste.  At least some of these moneys could have been used to incentivise industry in order that it did not produce as many harmful and toxic emissions.  Moreover, it also could have been invested in public transport.  Not only is such investment much needed, it would in turn remove more cars from the roads and reduce carbon emissions greatly.Real investment in pollution prevention, environmental health measures and sustainability are essential for Ireland's population.  The Government must introduce policies and legislation that seek to minimise or eliminate the release of any pollutant that causes environmental damage.  It must introduce legislation that will compel industry and commercial producers of waste to reduce waste production in a planned, targeted and accountable manner.The Government is trying to paint a picture suggesting that carbon funds are the answer to all our problems.  It is time for it to wake up.  Ireland should be aiming beyond the Kyoto targets, which merely represent a minimum level with which all states must comply.  The Government must build on the Kyoto Agreement, strengthen its positive points and commit itself to greater emissions cuts after 2012.I look forward with interest to the change in the Kyoto Protocol that will force governments to take action.  Clearly, this voluntary scheme has not worked.  This is particularly true in Ireland's case, as other states at least have made some efforts to take that path.  However, this State has turned a blind eye to dealing with the issue of trying to prevent emissions.  While the Minister may be nodding, what measures has he adopted?  Is there any evidence he has taken any action in this regard?

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 4 together.The decision taken by the Government to transfer certain functions from the Health Service Executive to my Department came on foot of recommendations made by the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service.  I am fully in favour of and support that decision.  The decision will involve the transfer of responsibility for the delivery of the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, scheme and of certain costs of disability and caring payments, as well as responsibility for the General Register Office, which currently comes under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children.An examination is also being conducted into the mechanics of transferring responsibility for the treatment benefit scheme, which is operated by my Department currently, to the HSE.Following the Government decision, a number of implementation working groups were established.  One such group oversees the implementation of the SWA element of the transfer of functions programme.  The group's work to date has centred mainly on providing the necessary foundation for the successful transfer of the scheme.  This includes identifying all of the functions currently carried out within the community welfare service for the purpose of identifying appropriate arrangements for the continued administration and management of these functions in the context of the transfer.Separately from the process which led to the decision to transfer responsibility for the scheme, my Department had undertaken a review under the expenditure review programme of all aspects of the SWA scheme, the report of which was recently published.  The report acknowledges that the SWA scheme has moved beyond its original role as a safety net and plays a more extensive role than was originally intended.  The report makes a number of recommendations for change in the context of ensuring a more streamlined delivery of income support through the social welfare system generally, including active case management to deliver immediate and flexible solutions to individuals' needs.  The report was presented to superintendent community welfare officers at a briefing seminar on 29 November 2006.  Arrangements are also being made to have a copy of the report circulated to all community welfare officers early in the new year.The transfer of functions will present fundamental reform and developmental opportunities for an integrated and enhanced income support system, including a restructuring and integration of support services within my Department, while facilitating the HSE in concentrating on its core health and personal social services functions.  The SWA review is timely in that it addresses all the major issues facing the scheme that can be addressed effectively in the context of the transfer process.The existing mechanisms of delivery by the community welfare service allow the service to be responsive, flexible and outcome focused.  These are attributes for which there will be a continuing need into the future and there will be no diminution in the existing role and responsibility afforded to community welfare officers.  The transfer of functions is an opportunity for an enhancement of the support role that community welfare officers currently provide to those disadvantaged in society.The implementation of a change programme of this magnitude involves organisational, human resource and service delivery issues.  Throughout the change programme both the HSE and my Department will give a very high priority to involving the community welfare service in the planning and implementation of the changes and providing clear and precise information on all elements of the change process.  Staff in my Department who will be impacted by the change will also be involved and kept informed throughout the process.A comprehensive information process is being put in place through newsletters to staff, briefing sessions and discussions with representative groups.  A series of information seminars will be held by the HSE and my Department on a regional basis for all staff of the service early in 2007.  These fora will provide further opportunities for those working within the service to comment on the implementation programme and the recommendations contained in the SWA review.  At the same time, staff and unions within my own Department will also be kept informed and consulted as the implementation programme progresses.The HSE unions have indicated a wish to meet with officials from my Department to discuss the transfer of functions and my Department would welcome an early opportunity for such a meeting.  While no date has been set for the completion of the transfer process, I propose to bring forward necessary enabling legislation to give effect as early as possible next year and I would intend that the transfer would take place as soon as possible thereafter.During the period of transition, my Department will continue to give a high priority to supporting the delivery of the very high standard of service currently provided by staff in the community welfare service.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	498	I thank the Minister for his response.  Am I correct in stating that the decision has been made?  If so, why did no direct consultation or discussion take place with the community welfare officers prior to the decision being made?  Is the Minister aware of the community welfare officers' concerns, for instance, that they maintain that their role is more a personal social service than welfare supports, and regarding the possible diminution in the transfer of their personal social service role?Is this move more about financial management and control, as the Minister mentioned early in his reply, than anything else?  If the transfer goes ahead, will the community welfare officers remain headquartered in the health services, as owned by the HSE, or will they be moved to some other location?  Does the Minister see the community welfare officers' existing discretionary payment process being changed in any way?The Minister indicated he would bring forward legislation.  Could he enlighten us as to whether this will be a stand-alone Bill or an addition to another Bill, such as the social welfare and pensions Bill, which is expected in February?  Will the decisions on the discretionary payments be based on legislation, standing operating procedures, as with other social welfare claims, or guidelines?  Will changes be made there?Is the Minister aware that the community welfare officers have had no opportunity to provide an input into this process to date and that the first time they had one was at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs on 22 June last where they had an opportunity to give a formal viewpoint on the process to transfer the community welfare service from the health sector to the remit of the Department of Social and Family Affairs?  Most importantly, is he also aware of the community welfare officers' important link with the health service and could he guarantee that this link will be maintained?  Is he also aware of the advocacy, pseudo-counselling role performed by the community welfare officers, that their role involves much more than giving out money to people and that people go to them for more than just that?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I greatly acknowledge and thank the 701 community welfare officers throughout the country and the 183 supporting clerical staff, including, for example, porters.  The service is delivered through 1,000 locations throughout the country.  There are nine appeals officers in the community welfare service who deal with SWA appeals and there are 59 superintendents.This has been discussed over many years.  It has arisen at conferences, it has been the subject of many discussions between officials and it is no surprise.  It has been in the system for a long time.  The Government has finally copperfastened its thinking on it and taken the decision to move ahead with it now.In thanking all of those community welfare officers, I want to give an absolute assurance that there will be no diminution in their discretion, that there will be full consultations with them as we go through this process and they will be listened to carefully, that, obviously, terms and conditions and employment issues will be worked out with the unions who will be kept fully involved in the process as it progresses, and that they have nothing to fear from this move.  It is an opportunity in many ways to enhance the service which they give.When this service started it was a fairly small safety net.  It has now grown into a €700 million scheme and it has moved far beyond its original intention.  It is helping welfare customers and the welfare Department is the line Department that should have the responsibility for helping welfare customers.  It is for those reasons that this makes sense.The main message I want to send in answering these parliamentary questions is that the community welfare officers have nothing to fear.  It offers the chance for enhancement.  Full terms and conditions of course will be guaranteed.I see no great need for changes of locations.  Those locations will always be needed, but the detail of that must be worked out with management.  I see there being no interference in the community welfare officers' flexibility and discretion because they are at the coalface and help so many people.  Their tangential work for the Department of Health and Children can continue.I have spent much of my time in office over the years fighting major battles trying to move civil servants out into agencies.  On at least three or four occasions I fought considerable battles, on the floor of this House and elsewhere.  I was told that I was diminishing their Civil Service status and pushing them into agencies and further away from the centre.  We are doing the opposite here.  We are taking them back from an agency into a Civil Service Department in which they have a bright future.  They will be fully consulted and all the issues with the unions will be fully thrashed out in good time to proceed with this.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	500	The impetus for this arose, not with the community welfare officers or their representatives, but at official level.  It is nothing more than a diktat.  Imagine imposing something, then calling for the referee to decide something and then calling in the players without having any consultation with them.  The first time that SIPTU and IMPACT were given an opportunity to respond was before a committee when I invited them in to make their presentation.The Labour Party is deeply alarmed at this proposal to subsume the community welfare service into the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  We strongly believe that this service, catering for the most vulnerable in society and operating at the cutting edge of the link between health and poverty, is best left where it is within the health service.  If it is not broke, why does the Minister and his officials set out to break it?Is this little more than a craftily disguised cutback, an attack on a vulnerable community?  Will this plan proceed under the 2007 Social Welfare Bill?  Will community welfare officers ultimately be reined in and prevented from providing information, advice and advocacy to vulnerable people in our communities as their link to statutory health and personal social services would be effectively severed?What is the Minister's game?  I realise that the interdepartmental review group's Core Functions of the Health Service report recommended the transfer.  There is no difficulty with the objective focusing of the HSE's resources on core health functions.  Does the Minister agree that the community welfare service performs a core health function?  I put it to the Minister that it is a profound misunderstanding to characterise the community welfare service as being limited to the administration of cash benefits from the social welfare allowance system.The late Frank Cluskey introduced this in 1977 and the administration of the CWS scheme is obviously an important and integral part of the work of CWOs.  Mr. Cluskey said that the CWO system was more than a mere cash response.  Is it the position that the service was deliberately placed within the community care structure and under the auspices of the Department of Health and Children with the intention of delivering a local response to individual needs, including providing clients with access to a range of health and personal social services?  The importance of the relationship between income maintenance and effective personal and health services, as well as the safety net separate from other social welfare payments, was clearly and specifically identified in the debates in this House that led to the establishment of the service.  These factors are as important and as real today as they were when the scheme was introduced.Even if this is not the Minister's intent, we are concerned that the proposed transfer will inevitably mean an end to the discretionary SWA payments and that this will have a direct and damaging effect on the ability of clients to access health services.  I accept the Minister's bona fides, but we must look at what the end result would mean.  Does the Minister agree that CWOs are in a position to deal with people out of hours and in all sorts of emergencies?  How will this function within the remit of the Minister's Department?  Will the discretion be eliminated, abolished or curtailed?  If someone requires an ambulance but finds there is none available, they can turn to a CWO to get funds to pay for alternative transport.  Who will administer such a scheme in the future?  Where are we going with this?  Why is it happening?  Is this a crusade by someone to curtail CWOs?The Labour Party supports the view of the unions representing CWOs that there must be a full study of the service and wide consultation about the likely effects of the changes with those who manage, deliver, use and interact with it before any change is proposed or implemented.  There has been no consultation with the people who use and benefit from the service and the great work being carried out by the 700 CWOs.  Why should something that is working so well be changed?  If it is not broken, the Minister should not set out to break it.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	501	This recommendation was made by a commission on financial management and control systems in the health service.  It follows on from the reorganisation and restructuring of the Health Service Executive.  Community welfare officers administer, for example, the rent scheme which runs to between €400 million and €500 million annually.  It is an enormous scheme and must be seen as a welfare scheme which must be connected and interrelated with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  It is means tested, connected to other schemes in the Department and comprises more than half of the community welfare officers' budget.  The salaries and expenses of all 700 community welfare officers come through the HSE but are paid by my Department.This is a restructuring to take account of what has happened in recent years.  The HSE has come on stream, the rent scheme has grown dramatically and the argument has moved on from Frank Cluskey's original idea to have a basic safety net with discretion.  It has moved on because the budget administered by the CWOs, who do a superb job, now stands at €700 million annually.  I hope to include this in the next social welfare Bill.  I will ensure their flexibility is assured and that there is maximum consultation, especially with the trade unions involved.There is no agenda other than ensuring that the Department of Social and Family Affairs, that spends more than €15 billion annually and is ultimately responsible for the other €700 million, continues to employ the CWOs.  They are excellent staff and look after the welfare of the community, and they must work directly for the welfare Department rather than for the Health Service Executive.  It will not affect the customer one whit.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I record my appreciation for the work undertaken by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others on behalf of the most vulnerable members of society, particularly families who for one reason or another are unable to survive financially, especially at times of difficulty or acute financial pressure.Government support for families facing financial difficulty is provided mainly through the social welfare system which provides substantial income supports.  In this regard, the Government is committed to improving significantly the standard of living of welfare dependent and low-income households and to making a decisive impact on poverty and social exclusion.  Over the period since 1997, the Government has greatly increased the levels of income support provided through the social welfare system, and this was again evident in the increases announced last week as part of the budget.  Expenditure on social welfare has increased by nearly 270% since 1997.  In 2007, almost €15.5 billion is being allocated to social welfare compared with €5.7 billion in 1997.The 2007 budget has provided more than €1.4 billion of an increase, the largest social welfare package ever in the history of the State.  This is more than five times the amount allocated to social welfare in the 1997 budget.  Almost one third of all current Government expenditure is being provided for social welfare in 2007 to support and benefit 1.5 million people directly.  In recent years we have lifted more than 250,000 people, including 100,000 children, out of poverty. We have travelled some distance towards eliminating poverty and the measures I have outlined will pay a major part in confronting remaining poverty.We are confronting the issue of fuel poverty, which I know is a concern of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  Last year, I increased the fuel allowance by €5 a week to €14 and this year I increased it to €18 a week.  This means that the level of the fuel allowance, which is paid to 274,000 recipients, will have doubled in the past two years.  As I already announced in September last, as and from next January the number of free units of electricity and gas paid under the household benefits scheme will increase from 1,800 units to more than 2,400 units per year as part of a €50 million package to protect welfare customers from price increases.I also announced a wide-ranging employment support package of €21 million in the budget, with measures built in to alleviate poverty and support activation by improving income disregards and tapers for the unemployed and qualified adults.  The full package of measures I announced for carers will cost more than €107 million.  It includes increases in the income disregards for entitlement to carer's allowance and a €300 increase in the respite care grant to €1,500 per year.  I am also introducing fundamental structural reforms for carers.  In future people in receipt of another social welfare payment, who also provide full-time care, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment equivalent to a half-rate carer's allowance.  Some 18,000 carers are likely to benefit by up to €109 per week.  The recent budget package is a strong statement of the Government's commitment to the elderly, children, carers and all those who, for one reason or another, are more vulnerable in our society.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I thank the Minister for his reply.  I accept and acknowledge that there has been a substantial increase in expenditure, especially in specific areas of the social welfare system such as for pensioners.  Nevertheless, how does the Minister and his officials explain that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul must do this work?  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul's ultimate aim is to render itself redundant because it is no longer required.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul does its excellent work because it must.  It takes up church gate collections and organises raffles throughout the country.  How does the Minister explain that in a time of unprecedented wealth and economic activity, voluntary organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul must spend €41 million annually and help 300,000 families in financial difficulties?  Those families must have been let down by the State social support system or they would not find themselves in such dire straits, necessitating recourse to those great volunteers who do tremendous work at all hours of the day and night, visiting people to ensure they are not hungry and have heat.Some €7.5 million of the emergency support was for families who had no food, no money and no resources, €4.6 million was for food and €3.1 million for fuel.  Approximately €1 million was spent reconnecting families to gas and electricity supplies but fuel prices escalated and, though the Commission for Energy Regulation reduced the increases, the prices projected for the next few weeks will still significantly impact on people with fixed incomes.  Despite the Minister increasing the fuel allowances it was certainly not enough.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul sought a further €6 to the additional €18 and an extension of the period in which they were provided.Does the Minister agree that fuel poverty is still one of the greatest threats to the comfort of elderly people and many on fixed or low incomes?  They find it exceedingly difficult to meet significant fuel price increases and to keep warm and be able to prepare hot food, which is vital for their health.  A lot has been done but much more needs to be done to prevent the activity of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul being curtailed and its spending cut.  The figure of €41 million relates to 2005 so the 2006 figures will be worse.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	504	The Society of St. Vincent de Paul is at the forefront of this issue and encounters much hardship and deprivation.  On behalf of all in the House, I thank the society for its work.  Its volunteers knock on hundreds of thousands of doors in any one year and they are worth listening to.  We did not meet all the requests in its pre-budget submission but we achieved much on issues such as school meals, CDAs, thresholds, automatic payments, basic rates, pensions, lone parents and family income supplements.  We have met most of its main requests.  Why it needs to spend €41 million on top of all the funds it receives is a good question.  I assume it is that, just because one is poor or under pressure, prices are no cheaper.  For what it could have bought for €5 million many years ago it now needs €41 million.  It behoves us to listen to what the Society of St. Vincent de Paul states.I recently offered a vacancy on the Combat Poverty Agency to the vice-president of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Professor John Monaghan.  He was concerned whether there would be a conflict of interest and I had to ask him a couple of times to convince him to take it because nobody knows the subject better than he does.  It will help that the Society of St. Vincent de Paul is represented on the Combat Poverty Agency and I am sure most people in the House will agree.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	506	My Department, through the Family Support Agency, has responsibility for a number of initiatives to support families and help prevent relationship breakdown.  The scheme of grants for voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling services is a non-statutory scheme of once-off grants to voluntary organisations providing a range of family counselling services aimed at enhancing stability in family life and assisting families and their members to deal with difficult periods which they may experience.In 2006 over €9 million was provided by the agency and a total of 541 organisations countrywide have received funding under the scheme.  During 2006, the agency also commissioned a review of the scheme and preliminary findings from the report indicate that up to 70,000 people benefit from the counselling provided.  Some €10 million has been allocated to the scheme for 2007.The Family Support Agency also administers the family and community services resource centre, FRC, programme.  The emphasis in the family resource centres is on the involvement of local communities in developing approaches to tackle the problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the areas concerned.   I am pleased to say that the Family Support Agency will deliver on the target set by the Government under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 of including 100 family resource centres in the programme nationwide by the end of 2006.Government commitment to this key sector has seen an increase in funding from €8.39 million in 2004, to €12.94 million in 2006.  The 2007 allocation of €18.75 million more than doubles the level of funding provided in 2004.The Family Support Agency also has responsibility for the family mediation service, FMS, a free, professional and confidential service for couples, married and non-married, who have decided to separate or divorce and who together want to negotiate the terms of their separation or divorce with the help of a trained mediator.A number of issues have been highlighted in recent research as contributing to relationship difficulties and family breakdown, including styles of conflict resolution, poor communication and partner criticism, domestic violence, alcohol abuse, child care and unfaithfulness.  The FMS suggests that the age profile of their clients may be decreasing with more young and unmarried people seeking mediation.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Family mediation assists separating couples to look at the resources and options open to them and to reach an agreement that meets the interests of both and those of their children.  The service has 26 professionally-trained mediators working from a total of 16 centres nationally.  Funding for the service has increased from €2.45 million in 2004 to €3.71 million in 2006.  Funding will increase to over €3.9 million in 2007.  The service assists almost 1,500 couples per annum.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I thank the Minister for his response.  Does he accept that one in every six marriages ends in divorce?  Is he concerned about the number of families, marital and non-marital, which break down?  What is his Department doing to promote positive family development and family values?  He has told us his views on the reasons behind the increase in family breakdown.  Does he agree that more research needs to be carried out into the issues behind family breakdown and barriers to new family formation, and has he any plans in that regard?  Has he carried out any research into the impact on children of family breakdown?Is the Minister aware of the criticism of Barnardos and its assertion that early intervention and prevention is essential to address family problems?  Many families accessing such services through the Family Support Agency and the Health Service Executive experience delays.  The approach seems to be one of intervention rather than prevention so will he take action in that area?  Is the Government concerned at the number of lone parent families with children under 20, which increased by 82% between 1995 and 2004, according to the Central Statistics Office report, Measuring Ireland's Progress 2004?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	508	The Family Support Agency is the main agency to address the issues the Deputy raises.  It funds 541 organisations countrywide and deals with family counselling in all areas, including separation, divorce and bereavement.  Those 541 organisations do a magnificent job.  As I said, the preliminary findings of the study we carried out indicate that up to 70,000 people benefit from the counselling service.  I have allocated €10 million to the scheme for 2007 and it is through those organisations we can give the most immediate support in cases of break-up.The Family Support Agency provides a mediation service, post-break-up, for marital and non-marital families and funds organisations dealing with prevention.  I have put the concept of offering the mediation service after the decision has been taken to separate to the Family Support Agency.  Otherwise, its great talents might be too confined.  I will ask the agency to determine whether it can become directly involved on the preventative side, but perhaps it feels it should do so through the organisations.  I must rely on its professional judgment.Deputy Stanton referred to the protection of children, which is the objective in this regard.  While the relationship issue is important, protection of children in that situation is more important.  For this reason, the Family Support Agency has substantial funds and resources to conduct acres of research, in which respect it is doing a good job.Question No. 4 answered with QuestionNo. 1.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	509	Supporting and recognising carers in our society is and has been a priority of the Government since 1997.  In that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been considerably increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes, such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant, have been introduced and extended.In budget 2005, I improved the grant in three ways by extending the grant to all full-time carers regardless of means or whether they are in receipt of social welfare payments other than carer's allowance or benefit, providing for the grant to be paid in respect of each care recipient and increasing the level of the grant from €835 to €1,000 in June 2005.  In 2006, I increased the grant to €1,200 and, through budget 2006, I have increased it by a further €300.  This represents an increase of 490% in the level of the grant since its introduction in 1999.A fundamental qualification condition for carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant is that the applicant must be providing full-time care and attention to a person who needs such care.  Until June of this year, people could engage in employment outside the home for up to ten hours per week and still qualify for payment.  Since then, I have increased the number of hours a person can engage in employment, self-employment, training or education outside the home and still satisfy the qualifying conditions for payment from ten hours to 15 hours per week.  This improvement applies to carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.Approximately 34,300 carers, including those in receipt of carer's allowance and benefit, have received a respite care grant this year and applications continue to be received.  Of this number, approximately 8,300 carers are not in receipt of a weekly social welfare carer's payment.  The respite care grant, which recipients can choose to spend as they see fit, is highly valued by carers.Towards 2016 commits the Government to continuing further development of the carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.  I am committed to working with carers to deliver additional benefits, supports and services for them and their families.  Deputies will be aware of the improvements for carers that I announced in budget 2006.

I recall that the Minister told me last May that he would review the condition that a person must be caring for another person on the first Thursday of June to receive the payment.  What are the barriers to abolishing the condition?  Does the Minister agree it is unfair to disqualify people who face the high costs associated with care throughout the year on the basis of this condition?Has the Minister examined the condition that a person must be caring for someone for a minimum of six months prior to the date in June?  Does the Minister plan to change that condition?  Has he examined the criterion of a limit of 15 hours per week or does he have plans to change it?

Will the Minister remove the insidious June stipulation?  For many, the respite care grant is the most money they receive because they do not qualify for carer's allowance, which has been extended, but why is there a strict time stipulation when most recipients do not receive the payments for a long period?  Often, we receive complaints to the effect that respite care grants are slow in reaching the recipients.Does the Minister agree that these grants constitute one of the most important elements of the care package he has introduced?  Given that the grants are not means tested, is making them available to those not in receipt of carer's allowance the foot in the door that will lead to the abolition of the means test?  The Acting Chairman likes sport, so I should say that we are only one kick away from rooting the means test out of the caring system, which would be a significant advance.

I am involved in developing a strategy with carers and we will examine some of these issues in that context because it is a good framework within which to deal with the remaining issues.As Deputy Stanton knows, we increased the 15 hours per week limit last year, but we have not moved the limit this year because we want to determine how well it works.  The figure is reasonable because one reaches a point of being unable to provide full-time care and attention beyond a certain number of hours.  We will keep an open mind.It is a fair distance to June.  The deadline was set for reasons of ease of administration because the Department has so many schemes and projects.  Another reason is that, as it is an annual allowance paid throughout the year, we do not want to provide it in situations where people will qualify for it in January, but will not qualify in February because they have gone back to work, are no longer caring for someone or only provide care for a short period.  It was explained to me that we must work out a number of administrative issues, but the June deadline is not sacrosanct and I am determined that no one will suffer because he or she misses a deadline.  Between now and June, we will examine the matter thoroughly.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 15 together.Child benefit and early child care supplement are regarded as family benefits under EU Regulation 1408/71.  Consequently, EU migrant workers have an entitlement to these payments in respect of their children even if the children are resident in the workers' home countries.  There are just more than 32,000 EU nationals in receipt of child benefit for 57,000 children who are resident with them in Ireland.  Of these, some 16,500 are UK nationals and a further 11,500 are nationals of the ten states that joined the EU in 2004.In the case of EU nationals who work in Ireland, but whose families remain in their home countries, it is necessary in determining any entitlement to child benefit or early child care supplement to contact the authorities in the country of residence of the children to confirm details and establish what, if any, family benefits are payable there.  This process can take a number of months to complete.In 2005, the number of claims in respect of non-resident children of EU nationals was 30 per week.  Since the start of 2006, the number of claims has averaged close to 300 per week.  At the start of 2006, child benefit was in payment under EU regulations for 650 families in respect of 1,320 children resident abroad.  There are 599 families receiving child benefit in respect of 1,444 children resident outside Ireland.  Some 90% of these children are resident in the UK.There is a total of some 14,000 child benefit claims awaiting finalisation under EU regulations.  As mentioned earlier, these claims generally take longer to process than domestic claims due to the need to communicate with the authorities in the claimant's home country.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The rules of entitlement for benefits in other EU countries can be different to those in Ireland.  For example, in the case of Poland, administration of social security schemes is regionalised.  This involves my Department determining which regional authority needs to be contacted to process the claim and, as the claimants may not be certain as to which regional centre is responsible for handling their claims, this can result in delays.In addition to establishing the facts, an additional level of control and accuracy is required.  The fact that foreign workers may spend a relatively short time in Ireland before returning to their home countries means it is necessary to establish in all cases that the claimants are still living and working in Ireland before making any payments.Given these factors and combined with the surge in claims during 2006, my Department is understandably having difficulty in processing these claims as quickly as we would like.  Measures that are being taken include the use of overtime to process these cases and the deployment of some additional staff on a temporary basis in the sections concerned.  I am having the overall level of resources in the area examined by my Department's management services unit.My Department has also engaged, on a trial basis, a small number of Polish-speaking clerical staff, as the majority of claims under EU regulations are in respect of Polish workers.  The trial has been successful to date and my Department is considering how a more permanent arrangement might be put in place.The total child benefit expenditure for EU migrants with non-resident children in respect of 2006 is estimated at €36 million or 1.8% of overall child benefit expenditure of €2.04 billion.  The total cost in 2007 is difficult to estimate, but by current trends, the potential accrued cost could be of the order of €85 million.  The corresponding figures for early child care supplement are €9 million in respect of 2006 and €17 million in respect of 2007.

I will call Deputy Costello when he is present.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	520	I propose to take all questions together.It is right that we have this opportunity to discuss a matter which is clearly of the gravest concern to Deputies on all sides of this House and the people of this country.  The message must go out from here today that we are unwavering in our support for the Garda Síochána in its efforts to eradicate this evil from our midst.  It is a cruel irony that some of what has been happening in recent days may stem in part from the successes which the force has had in disrupting organised criminal activity in drugs and guns.  It would be perverse, however, if that fact were to lead to any lessening by the Garda Síochána of its efforts in that regard.  That cannot and will not be allowed to happen.We have passed through a dreadful week of murders, there is no other way of describing it.  Every violent ending of a person's life represents a tragedy, but some of the killings we have recently witnessed are especially tragic.  I would like to offer my personal sympathy and that of all Members of this House to the families and friends of Alan Cunniffe, Anthony Campbell and Aidan Myers.  These victims were engaged in earning a living or going about their lawful business when their lives were so brutally cut short.  Any words we say here will offer small consolation to the forlorn relatives and friends of the victims but I believe, not least out of respect for those people, that it behoves us all in this House to show unity of purpose as the democratically elected representatives of the people in confronting the challenges posed by these armed and ruthless gangs.I have made it consistently clear that irrespective of the circumstances murder is murder.  No one is above the law and no one is beneath the protection of the law.  The fact that people may have put themselves in the way of violence by their criminal behaviour, including involvement in the killing of others, does not alter that fact.  The idea, however, that the gardaí can give round the clock protection to all those who may be at risk because of their involvement in drugs and crime is simply unsustainable.  There would be understandable outrage if that was the manner in which the gardaí were deployed.  People are entitled to be assured, however, that all steps that can be reasonably taken to deal with this matter are taken.All killings, regardless of the background of the victim or the method of killing, are the subject of a rigorous investigation by the Garda authorities.  The Garda Síochána does not make decisions on the scale or direction of a murder investigation based on the background or history of the victim.Our legislative provisions for the granting of bail are very stringent.  The 16th amendment of the Constitution provided for the refusal of bail to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious crime by that person.  The Bail Act 1997 gave effect to the amendment and tightened up the bail regime generally.The granting of bail in accordance with the Act, the amount of bail and sentencing are of course matters for the courts which are subject only to the Constitution and the law in the administration of justice.  However, I believe it is the view of all Deputies that these provisions should be applied to the greatest extent possible consonant with the provisions of our Constitution.  It is a matter of common sense that the ability of the Garda Síochána to deal with persons involved in serious crimes is seriously hampered when persons charged with firearms or drugs offences are freed on bail to commit further offences.  That is why I am exploring and taking advice as to further measures that might be taken to address the issues which arise in terms of dealing with bail applications in such cases.The House should also know that I have this evening signed the custody regulations approved by the Oireachtas earlier today, extending the maximum period of detention available to the gardaí provided for under the Criminal Justice Act 1984 from 12 hours to 24 hours.  That is now in operation.Other legislative measures we have in place are extremely strong.  There is 48 hour detention with extension under the Offences Against the State Act and there is seven day detention under the misuse of drugs legislation relating to drugs trafficking offences.  The House will be aware that the recently enacted Criminal Justice Act 2006 provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of offences.  In addition, the Act contains an essential updating of our criminal law to ensure that criminal offences can be investigated and prosecuted in a way which is efficient and fair and which meets the needs of modern society.The Act addresses a wide range of matters, including the designation of a place as a crime scene, increased detention powers for certain offences, the admissibility of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements, the creation of new offences related to organised crime and the misuse of drugs, the strengthening of existing provisions on sentencing for drug trafficking offences, provisions to update and strengthen the law on firearms and to deal with anti-social behaviour, and introduces mandatory minimum sentences for the possession of firearms in the circumstances described in the Act.I have been in regular contact with the Garda Commissioner and his senior management in recent days.  The activities of those involved in organised crime, particularly in the greater Dublin area, are of considerable concern to the Commissioner.  I have informed the House previously of a number of operations and initiatives which have already been put in place, among which Operation Anvil plays a central part.As we speak, the gardaí, in the light of recent developments, have begun an intensified campaign aimed at the disruption of the activities of the persons involved.  Deputies will appreciate that it would be counterproductive for me to give precise details of what is involved.  I can say this — the gardaí must, of course, act at all stages within the law but if the actions which they have been forced to take to disrupt the activities of these people are represented by the persons affected as harassment or persecution then so be it.The Commissioner has announced that to augment existing operations, he is taking a number of further actions.  From tomorrow, an additional 20 officers will be allocated to the organised crime unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, bringing the total to in excess of 70.  In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Garda Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the organised crime unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity, in particular by arrests, seizing firearms and targeting of individuals and groups.  It will focus on individuals known to the Garda Síochána to be involved in organised crime, particularly the trafficking of illegal drugs and firearms.I want to dispel the impression that might have been given that the drugs unit of the Garda Síochána comprises just 35 members.  There are, in fact, some 328 gardaí attached to drugs units nationally, with some 48 of these playing a central co-ordinating role at national level, with the balance attached to divisions across the country, including Dublin.  These officers are in the front line in the fight against the drugs menace and they work closely with other specialised units, including the organised crime unit, the special detective unit and other units within the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau.  Furthermore, additional resources will be deployed to provide a significant increase in armed Garda patrols and checkpoints to be undertaken by the special detective unit-emergency response unit in key targeted areas, including those where shooting incidents have occurred in the past.Operation Anvil will continue at its current high levels of operation within Dublin Garda divisions and in conjunction with national units.  Operation Oak, which targeted the late Martin Hyland and his associates since September 2005, will continue to form part of an intensified level of intelligence-led operations.  As a result of that operation, 24 persons are before the courts.  Following the 2007 Estimates process, the allocation to the Garda will increase by €135.3 million to €1.445 billion, an increase of 10% on 2006.Against that background, I have been assured repeatedly by the Commissioner and assistant commissioner, Martin Callinan, who is in charge of these investigations that he is not being hampered in dealing with the current situation by lack of resources.  Nevertheless, I am keeping under review the general issue of whether further resources may become necessary.  If it becomes necessary, I will seek Government approval to do so without delay.  I used a colloquialism earlier, which is true.  The Commissioner in this struggle has an open cheque book as far as the Government is concerned.My Government colleagues and I are totally committed to increasing the strength of the Garda.  I am informed that the personnel strength of the force increased to a record 13,000 on 16 November, following the attestation of 299 new members.  The induction of 280 new recruits to the Garda College on 6 November resulted in a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137.  Next year more than 275 fully trained gardaí will graduate from the college every 90 days, allowing the Commissioner to focus personnel where they are most needed.I thank Deputies for raising this matter today. In this House we can and do disagree about many issues. That is the democratic process, which I respect and relish.  However, I believe we can and must unite around a clear message that the people involved in these crimes will be pursued relentlessly and that whatever action is necessary for a democratic society to bring their activities to an end will be taken.  In that spirit, I have always been prepared in any debate in the House, and will continue to be prepared, to consider sensible and practical proposals put forward by any Member to counteract the menace of organised crime.  Moreover, this is not my last word on the deployment of resources or the development of new ideas in tackling crime.  I will explore further options over the coming days, which I will make public following consultation with my Government colleagues.

Six Members have tabled questions and I propose to call them in order before hearing a reply from the Minister because the House is obliged to adjourn at 7 p.m.  I request those who submitted questions to confine themselves to supplementary questions rather than statements because I would like to give the Minister a few minutes to reply.

He says everything is okay, resources are being deployed and the Government is in control of the situation, but the reality is there have never been so many gangland killings, with six killings in the past six days and 24 in less than 12 months.  Two occurred in my constituency and the detection rate in gangland killings is the lowest of all indictable offences.  Does the Minister accept we have a serious crisis on our hands?  Does he further accept he has repeatedly mentioned the initiatives he outlined, and leadership, commitment and effectiveness are missing?  Will he review existing operations such as Operation Anvil, which is a semi-permanent overtime mechanism in certain Dublin Garda stations rather than a fully drawn up strategy?  Does he agree the Taoiseach should also become involved in this issue, a Cabinet hearing should be held with the Garda Commissioner and other senior officers to draw up and resource a strategy with appropriate finance, modern equipment and personnel, and that this is the way forward?

It is perceived the Garda gives immunity to drug dealers and permits them to continue their operations with impunity.  What practices and protocols govern the Garda's engagements with informers?  The perception has been borne out by the facts and anybody living in an affected community will attest to drug dealers operating in this way.  Who oversees such engagements?  Does the Minister agree there should be no case where the importation of drugs and associated lethal weaponry into the State by drugs gangs is permitted on the basis that it might lead to the arrest of other criminals?Does the Minister further agree it is time to concentrate on actions and not on creating laws, given sufficient laws are in place to address this issue?  Will the Minister consider implementing the pilot programme recently run in Blanchardstown, the dial to stop drug dealing scheme, throughout Dublin and the State?  People do not have the confidence to contact the Garda directly but this scheme might provide a way for people with information who are afraid to do so.  Currently, they do not experience an appropriate Garda response and they are left on their own if they do their civic duty.  This might be a cost effective way to address this.

Will the Minister ensure CAB relentlessly pursues drug barons rather than tax evaders, which is the work of the Revenue?  I do not know which garda told the Minister the force was in no way hampered by a lack of resources.  What is happening if the Garda is not hampered in this way?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	528	Can the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, ensure that areas seen as soft targets for crime because of population growth in constituencies such as Deputy Glennon's and mine will receive a level of policing that will send a message to drug barons, crime lords and those engaged in murderous activity that they will be closely watched and apprehended should they commit a crime?  Does the Minister accept that there are areas of fast growing population, for example, the area of my constituency in the Louth-Meath division, that have no drug unit and no special investigation unit?  Generally such places are regarded as small towns and villages but they are, in fact, larger.  Rush is the size of Kilkenny city and Lusk is the size of Athlone.  Will the Minister rectify this situation and install a level of policing in these areas similar to large towns throughout the country?

Does he not accept that his policies on gangland crime have failed?  Does he not accept that he has not provided the necessary resources to the Garda Síochána, whatever statistical gymnastics he might engage in?He said, taking retirements into account, the total number of serving gardaí on 31 December 2006 will be 12,948.  He has gone less than half way to the promised target of 2,000 extra gardaí promised by his party and his Fianna Fáil colleagues before the previous general election.  Does he not accept that the information technology and communications equipment promised the Garda before the last election has not been provided?  Does he not accept that problems have arisen from a lack of dedicated firearms training facilities for the Garda Síochána?Regarding the legal framework, does the Minister not accept that the issues I highlighted, along with my party leader and the Fine Gael Party, over the years regarding problems relating to bail and sentencing should have been addressed?  Does he not accept the case made for electronic tagging?  He has neglected all these issues, including the witness protection programme I mentioned in the House last week.  Will the Minister accept the responsibility that falls on his desk for enormous increases in violent crime since his first year in office, especially murder and firearms offences?Yesterday the Taoiseach mentioned Mr. Martin Hyland in the Dáil.

Does the Minister think it is acceptable that such a person is involved with serious criminals?  What does he intend to do about it and will he consider revoking the licence under which that particular paramilitary member was released from Castlerea Prison?

My Priority Question related to the upsurge in gun murders and the Minister told the House that no such upsurge had occurred.Does the Minister accept that his current policy has not worked and that the first step to a successful policy lies in recognising his failure to date?  He stated yesterday and today that 24 members of Mr. Martin Hyland's gang are before the courts.  Does he accept that 23 are out on bail and walking the streets and what does he propose to do about this?  Does he find this situation acceptable?I refer to comments made in the House yesterday that were repeated by my Fine Gael colleague a moment ago.  A man identified in all the national newspapers as Dessie O'Hare allegedly associated with criminals during the summer.  Will the Minister inform the House if he has any knowledge of this and whether he agrees it is a breach of Mr. O'Hare's licence if it is the case?  Will Mr. O'Hare be taken into custody if it is the case?

Does the Minister accept that the main source of gun crime is drugs?  How can he explain the fact that the Garda National Drugs Unit has not seen an increase in manpower since 1995?  Despite what the Minister says, not including administrative staff, there are 35 operational gardaí in the unit which is under strength at the moment by two sergeants and ten gardaí.  Those running the unit have consistently sought to have these vacancies filled and have consistently been refused.  Does he not accept that local drug units throughout the country largely deal with low-level drug crime, while the only unit with the expertise and experience to tackle the problem, the Garda national drugs unit, is the most under-resourced and ignored unit in the entire Garda force?As I have asked the Minister on many occasions, is it not time the Criminal Assets Bureau had local and regional operatives in the areas of this city and country suffering from serious drug crime?  This would at last allow the bureau pursue drug dealers at all levels, as it was set up to do and has never done.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	545	A number of Deputies have asked if the current policy is failing and I wish to put some facts before the House in this regard.  Operation Anvil has seen 20,000 searches for drugs with €14 million worth of drugs recovered.  Some 562 firearms were also recovered, separate to the recent amnesty.  This operation is constantly chipping away at the edifices of drug barons and their gangs and has seen some very significant successes.  I pay tribute to the gardaí who put their lives on the line every day to bring about such success.

I have stated on a number of occasions that I regard this as very deeply unsatisfactory and have been criticised for doing so because it has been seen as disparaging of the Judiciary.  Article 40 of the Constitution obliges this State to protect and vindicate the rights of the people.  The protection and vindication of the rights of the people is not entirely to do with due process.  It is about preventing people from usurping the authority of the State by engaging in drug crime and gangland activities.  The Judiciary must uphold the laws of the land laid down in this House.

I strongly contend that the practice is wrong and must be addressed.A misleading account was given to the Irish public today about the provisions of section 15A of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977 on the minimum mandatory sentence.  It is not the case that a plea of guilty entitles one to a discount and it is emphatically stated in the Act that being a drug addict is not grounds for a discount.  It is not true that anything other than wholly exceptional and specific circumstances can justify a decision by a judge to deviate from the minimum mandatory sentence.  The judge can only do so where he comes to the view that it would be unjust to apply such a sentence.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Where is the appeals system?

It cannot be the case, if 80% of people charged under section 15A receive sentences of less than the minimum mandatory sentence, that deviations are being considered on the basis of wholly exceptional circumstances.  I am giving further consideration to the matter but this Legislature has passed strong legislation — indeed, I have been criticised for over-legislating in some areas.  The Executive had provided extensive resources to the force in terms of cash and additional gardaí.  The judicial arm of the State must also play its part in the suppression of gangland violence.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	585	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 40, 83, 89, 96 and 114 together.The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) provides assistance to people who are overindebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  There are 52 independent companies nation-wide operating the service.  The credit union movement has been a key partner in MABS since its inception and their involvement and support is central to the development and success of the service.  Other voluntary and statutory bodies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Community Welfare Service, Citizens' Information Centres, Centres for the Unemployed and local authorities work closely with the programme.In 2006, €16.4 million was provided to fund the service representing an increase of 20% on the previous year.  In 2007, I have further increased the annual allocation to €17.64 million.  Last year, almost 27,000 people availed of the service as compared with 18,000 in 2001.  The growth in demand for the service can be attributed to the increase in the availability of credit generally in the economy and to the quality of the service provided by the MABS advisers.  The issues that give rise to problems of over-indebtedness for people are highly complex.  The cost and availability of credit for people on low incomes and the barriers they face in accessing mainstream and cheap forms of credit add to the difficulties people on low incomes encounter in managing their finances.I have held discussions with a number of interests including the Irish League of Credit Unions and the Financial Regulator about these issues. One outcome of these consultations is that research has been initiated by the Financial Regulator with the help of the Combat Poverty Agency to find out more about the nature and the extent of financial exclusion in Ireland and the barriers faced by people on low incomes in accessing a wide range of financial services.  The report entitled ‘Financial Exclusion in Ireland — An Exploratory Study and Policy Review' was launched by the Financial Regulator on Monday 11th December.   The report is being considered by my Department at present.The findings of the research, together with the comprehensive statistical data now emerging from the new MABSIS information system will make a significant contribution to our knowledge about the problems of debt in Ireland and the situations that leave people on low incomes vulnerable to high cost credit services.  I plan to bring proposals to the Government shortly to establish the Money Advice and Budgeting Service board on a statutory basis while retaining the voluntary input so vital to MABS.  My proposals for legislation will build on the best features of the MABS model of service to the public.  The proposals will combine a continuation of local voluntary involvement with strong national leadership.  This will ensure a high quality and coordinated budgeting and advice service for the future, in particular for people on low incomes.The proposals for the new legislation will take account of the significant developments which have taken place in MABS since the previous Bill was published in 2002.  They will be informed by the outcome of consultations with a range of individuals and groups as well as the expert views of key MABS interests including money advisers, MABS voluntary boards of management and other stakeholders such as the credit union movement and the Financial Regulator.The proposals will take account of best practice in corporate governance for a customer focussed service that provides value for money for the taxpayers investment and meets the challenges posed by the rapidly changing face of debt in 21st century Ireland.I have asked my officials, in drawing up the legislation, to seek legal advice to determine if provisions can be included that address the issue of what appears to be the unacceptably high level of interest rates currently being charged by financial institutions and loan companies.The MABS is highly regarded and respected and it is my intention that this continue to be the case.   I believe the support structure put in place by my Department for the MABS in recent years has worked well for clients of the service, for local management and for the staff.   The legislation I will be bringing forward will further underpin the service.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	586	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 23, 44, 76, 78 and 82 together.The most recent results from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) Quarterly National Household Survey show that in the first quarter of 2005 51.5% of those at work had supplementary pension coverage. With a working population of just over 2 million, these figures suggest that about 1.03 million workers have a supplementary pension cover with 0.97 million without such cover. At the end of September 2006, a total of 83,790 PRSAs had been opened which represents just over 4% of those at work.The Quarterly National Household Survey does not provide information on the income of those with supplementary pension cover. However, an analysis of EU-SILC data undertaken in the context of the Pensions Board report on mandatory pensions suggests that coverage varies from 9.5% to 37.6% in the bottom four income deciles. Pensions coverage for the key National Pensions Policy Initiative target group, those aged 30 years and over, stood at 58.6% in the 1st quarter of 2005. This coverage rate has moved little in recent years.As the House will be aware, in early 2005 I asked the Pensions Board to undertake a review of overall pensions strategy because I considered that, on the basis of the progress being made at that time, there was little prospect of reaching our targets for pensions coverage within a reasonable timescale. The Pensions Board completed its work in November 2005 and I published the National Pensions Review report in January this year.The Board reaffirmed the various targets recommended in the original National Pensions Policy Initiative which included a retirement income, from all sources, of 50% of pre-retirement income, a social welfare pension equating to 34% of average industrial earnings and a supplementary pensions coverage rate of 70% for those aged over 30 years. The Pensions Board has recommended enhancements to the current voluntary system of supplementary pensions as it considers that it has the potential to deliver significant improvements in coverage.However, no truly voluntary pensions system has been able to deliver the sort of coverage rates for which we are aiming. In that context, I asked the Pensions Board to explore in more detail the ideas for a mandatory or quasi-mandatory system which had been set out in the National Pensions Review.In August, the Government published the Pensions Board report, Special Savings for Retirement, in which the Board suggested a model which could be considered if it were decided that a mandatory system of supplementary pensions was required. The model was aimed at low to middle earners and entails mandatory contributions of 15%, shared between employers, employees and the Exchequer, on earnings between €15,000 and €60,000. This would be backed up by an improved social welfare pension, which would increase from a current level of 33% of Gross Average Industrial Earnings to 40%. A timescale of 10 years was suggested for full implementation.As the House is aware the Government has committed itself to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the social partnership agreement Towards 2016. The Green Paper will outline the major policy choices, the challenges in this area and the views of the social partners. The two reports completed by the Pensions Board — the National Pensions Review and their report on mandatory pensions, Special Savings for Retirement will be major inputs to the Green Paper.It is expected that the Green Paper will be published by the end of March next year. Following a consultation process, the Government will publish a framework for future pensions policy later in the year.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 64 together.Since taking Office this Government has made the needs of older people a priority with the inclusion of several commitments in the Programme for Government aimed specifically at this group.  I am very pleased to say that we have delivered on our commitment to bring the basic State Pension (non-contributory) to €200 a week by increasing it by €18.  In addition, the State pension (contributory) has increased by €16 a week to €209.30.  The effect of these unprecedented increases is that since 1996, and including increases granted in the current year, pensions have increased by almost 119%, or about 57% in real terms, faster than both price and wages growth over the period.I am also making significant progress on the Government commitment to increase the Qualified Adult Allowance for spouses and partners of contributory pensioners to the level of the State pension (non-contributory).  The Budget 2007 increase of €23.70 per week in the qualified adult payment will benefit some 35,500 couples.In addition, this improvement will bring the Qualified Adult Allowance for those aged 66 years of age and over to 86.5% of the target rate contained in the Government commitment.In Budget 2006, for the first time in many years, I increased the basic income disregard for the purposes of the means test for non-contributory pensions to €20 per week. At the same time, I introduced incentives for pensioners on means tested payments, who may wish to earn extra income, to continue in employment, with €100 per week earnings disregarded.   I was happy to be able to build on these improvements by increasing the basic means disregard to €30 per week and enhancing the employment earnings disregard to €200 per week.   These measures will benefit approximately 26,000 pensioners a week who are currently in receipt of a reduced rate of pension.  As a consequence, for them, the additional increases in the personal rate will be up to €10 per week while the Qualified Adult rate will further increase by up to €6.60 per week.These pensioners will, of course, also benefit from the general €18 per week increase in the personal rate of payment and, where relevant, the €11.90 increase in the payment for qualified adults.  The overall effect of these changes means that some non-contributory pensioner couples will gain by over €46 per week from January.In addition to improvements to pensions and qualified adult allowances, I introduced a range of other measures which will benefit older people.In order to further develop the telephone allowance to respond to the expanding telecommunications market and to facilitate greater customer choice of telephone services, I expanded the telephone allowance to include mobile phones.  This is a particularly important step given the high level of mobile phone ownership in Ireland now and the fact that some households do not have land lines at all.  It will also assist in achieving the objectives of the scheme which are to ensure access to help in an emergency and to provide an element of security as well as to encourage social contact and to assist in the prevention of social isolation for those living alone.Under these new arrangements which will be implemented in April 2007, people will have a choice as to whether the allowance is applied to their mobile phone or to their landline.   In order to facilitate pay-as-you-go mobile phones, where the allowance is applied to a mobile phone it will be paid as a cash amount of €24.70 per month which includes the VAT.I also extended eligibility for the companion free travel pass to those aged 66 to 74 who are certified as medically unfit to travel unaccompanied.  This will take effect from March 2007.I have also announced the introduction, early next year, of an all Ireland Free Travel scheme which will allow Irish pensioners to travel throughout Northern Ireland free of charge on public transport, while Northern pensioners will be able to do likewise here.I have also provided for improvements for carers which will be of benefit to older people.  I have increased the income disregard for carers allowance by €30 to €320 per week for a single person and by €60 to €640 per week for a couple.  I have increased the rate of carer's allowance for people aged over 66 by €18 per week to €218 per week.I was very pleased to introduce fundamental structural reforms in this area whereby people in receipt of another social welfare payment, such as the State pension (contributory), who are also providing full time care and attention to a person, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent of a half rate carer's allowance.  The precise details regarding how this new arrangement will operate are being examined and will be set out in legislation early next year.  The measure will come into effect in September 2007.I am conscious of the high heating costs that many pensioners face.  That is why I recently made provision for increases in the electricity and gas element of the household benefits package of free schemes.    In Budget 2007, I have made further progress with regard to assistance with heating cost which will benefit a significant number of people, many of whom are pensioners.  I increased the rate of the national fuel allowance by €4 to €18 per week, from January 2007.  I also increased the income threshold for eligibility for fuel allowance  from €51 to €100 per week thereby enabling more people to qualify for the scheme.I was very pleased that EU SILC data for 2005 showed a significant drop in the risk of poverty for older people and this did not include the 2006 or 2007 increases.  Accordingly, I am confident that the reduction in poverty risk will be maintained and, indeed, improved on as a result of the improvements I have made in Budget 2007.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	588	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 17 together.Last week, I was pleased to announce an increase in the ceiling on reckonable earnings applied to maternity benefit from €332 to €350 per week for 2007. This will raise the maximum rate of payment — based on 80% of reckonable earnings — from €265.60 to €280 per week with effect from 1st January, 2007. The minimum rate of maternity benefit payment will be raised concurrently from €182.60 to €207.80 per week.As the rates of adoptive benefit are linked to the maternity benefit scheme (i.e. to ensure that the same level of support is afforded to both natural and adoptive parents), those in receipt of adoptive benefit will equally gain from the above changes in maternity payments.This Department pays both maternity and adoptive benefit to workers who have accrued the required number of PRSI contributions on their social insurance record and who could otherwise be without income during a period of entitlement to statutory leave in respect of a birth or an adoption. These payments are funded from social insurance contributions paid by workers and employers.The maternity benefit measures will cost a total of €10.96 million to implement (i.e. €8.42 million for the change to the ceiling and €2.54 million for the change in the minimum rate of payment — respectively) and the adoptive benefit rate increases will cost a total of €44,000.It is estimated that some 11,500 women will benefit each week from the increase in the earnings ceiling applied to maternity benefit. An additional 2,200 women will benefit each week from the increase in the minimum rate of maternity benefit payment. Furthermore, it is estimated that some 60 persons will benefit each week from the adoptive benefit rate increases.In addition to these improvements in rates of payment there have also been recently announced extensions to the periods for which benefits are payable. With effect from 1st March, 2007, the total period of statutory maternity leave attracting a payment will be twenty-six weeks and that of statutory adoptive leave attracting a payment will be twenty-four weeks — a four-week extension in each case.The changes announced in Budget 2007 build on increases already made to the payment duration of both maternity and adoptive benefit in last year's Budget.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 21, 34, 47, 81 and 87 together.The Government discussion paper, Proposals for Supporting Lone Parents, put forward proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare; improved information services for lone parents and the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families with young children.   The paper also proposed the abolition of the cohabitation rule as a condition for receipt of the proposed social assistance payment.One of the proposals in the report was that the upper income limit for the new social assistance payment should be set at €400 per week. Last year, in Budget 2006, I increased the upper income limits on the one parent family payment from €293 to €375 per week, moving a substantial way towards this limit.  In this year's Budget I completed this element of the proposal by increasing the upper income limit for the one parent family payment to €400 per week.The new social assistance payment, currently being developed by officials in my Department will have the long term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment, the avenue that offers the best route out of poverty.Any proposed new payment can only be introduced when the necessary co-ordinated supports and services are put in place by other Departments and Agencies.  This is why the Government has instructed the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion to draw up an implementation plan to progress the non-income recommendations in tandem with the development of the legislation required in my Department to introduce a new payment scheme.Work on the development of this implementation plan is currently under way. Issues including access to childcare support, education, training and activation measures are being discussed with the relevant Departments and Agencies.While the formal consultation process on the Government discussion paper has concluded, my officials continue to be in regular contact with lone parents' representative groups, whose views continue to feed in to the shaping and structuring of the proposals.Once I am satisfied that we have reached conclusions that are equitable, with a fully workable implementation strategy, it is my intention to bring forward proposals for consideration by the Government in the New Year.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	590	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 49, 57, 73, 105 and 113 together.The annual EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (EU–SILC), which commenced in Ireland in 2003, is conducted by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) and provides information on poverty, deprivation and social exclusion. The most recent results, for the year 2005, record continuing positive trends in relation to poverty and social exclusion, and show the impact being made by the greatly increased resources now devoted to social welfare and other social services. For example, the survey revealed that there has been a significant decrease in consistent poverty rates for lone parent households from 31.1 per cent to 27.2 per cent, a drop in consistent poverty levels for people with disabilities from 21.7 per cent to 17.4 per cent, and a substantial drop in the number of older people at risk of poverty from 27.1 per cent in 2004 to 20.1 per cent in 2005. Also reflected in the findings is the impact of employment in ensuring that people achieve a good standard of living, with only 1.7 per cent of people at work experiencing consistent poverty.These latest survey results show that the overall rate of consistent poverty in 2005, at 7 per cent, has remained relatively unchanged from the rate in 2004. However, because of methodological differences between the EU-SILC survey and the earlier Living in Ireland Survey (LIIS), used when setting the original NAPS target of 2 per cent consistent poverty, it will not be possible to conclude with certainty whether this target will have been reached by 2007.It is considered unlikely, however, that the actual situation regarding consistent poverty would have deteriorated during the years covered by the new EU-SILC survey, as there were no policy changes that would have brought about a reversal of the earlier downward trend in consistent poverty recorded under the LIIS survey. On the contrary, significant improvements in social welfare rates and in services have been made during this time and the EU-SILC results since 2003 would suggest that the downward trend that was apparent in the LIIS has continued. The low levels of unemployment, and the substantial resources devoted to social welfare and other social services which have been increasing in real terms since 1997 are bringing about this downward trend. In recent years 250,000 people, including 100,000 children, have been lifted out of deprivation and hardship since 1997 as a result of concentrated and targeted measures and supports.The meeting referred to was an informal technical briefing given by officials from the Central Statistics Office to public sector policy analysts from a number of relevant Departments at the time of the launch on 16 November of the latest results from EU-SILC. I am advised that, at the briefing, the CSO outlined the main results from the survey and provided responses to queries on particular aspects of the results. In relation to the consistent poverty measure, the CSO advised that the understanding of the deprivation questions by respondents to the survey, and their resultant pattern of response, must be taken into account in interpreting current and likely future movements in the measure as monitored by the EU SILC. In particular, the CSO officials drew attention to the finding that, even at relatively high levels of income, some survey respondents reported basic deprivation to questions used to assess the possible existence of consistent poverty amongst those on low incomes. Accordingly, the CSO formed the view that, in the survey environment, it may be unrealistic to expect that those on the lowest incomes would report ‘zero' or ‘close to zero' deprivation levels. In other words it was suggested there may be survey related reasons to conclude that the consistent poverty measure, as currently constructed and measured, may not fall below a certain ‘floor' level.The issue of selecting the most appropriate poverty reduction measures and targets is currently being considered in the context of formulation of the next National Action Plan for social inclusion (NAPinclusion), which I will launch early in the New Year. This consideration will of course be informed by the EU-SILC survey results and by the subsequent analysis of these results by the CSO, which I have referred to. My main aim is to come up with an agreed measure which will help to give a clear, realistic and objective picture of progress being made to tackle poverty and social exclusion and of the effectiveness of Government policies in this regard.I have previously expressed my concerns regarding the methodology employed by the UN when creating its Human Poverty Index, one of the measures contained in the UN Human Development Report. The latest report ranks Ireland 17th out of 18 high-income OECD countries on the Human Poverty Index, one of the key determinants of which is the ‘at risk of poverty' measure. The finding is simply not credible. While the latest EU-SILC results do show that our ‘at risk of poverty' rates are falling, I continue to believe that this measure gives a misleading impression of poverty as ‘at risk of poverty' levels are affected by increases in incomes generally. During periods of high economic growth increases in household income can outstrip even substantial increases in the incomes of households with relatively low earnings or on social welfare. This is precisely what happened in Ireland in recent years where increases in household incomes were substantially higher than increases both in individual earnings and social welfare incomes over this period, despite virtually unprecedented improvements in employment and social provision across the boardFurthermore, a recent analysis in the prominent journal "Development and Transition", published by the UN Development Programme and the London School of Economics and Political Science, insisted that relative poverty indicators cannot be used for international comparisons unless countries are similar in their level of economic development. Overall, it concluded that reliance on the ‘at risk of poverty' indicator causes a number of problems. It distorts the reality of Ireland's exceptional economic performance over several years and the significant progress that has been consequentially possible in confronting and tackling poverty.While different reports can cause confusion, we have undoubtedly made real progress in reducing poverty levels and in promoting social inclusion. However, there are still unacceptable levels of hardship and deprivation among the most vulnerable groups in the population.  The priority of Government for the next NAPinclusion will be on providing targeted supports and services so that ultimately we can eradicate poverty from society. The recent Budget 2007 package, containing the largest ever figure for social welfare expenditure of €15.3 billion, is clear evidence of our commitment in this regard.

For both schemes, an initial sum of €20,000 is disregarded and the balance is assessed as means. I understand that the Deputy is referring, in particular, to the difference in the assessment of means generally, including capital, for these schemes in the case of couples.In the case of state pension (non-contributory), the current arrangements provide that the means of the claimant shall be taken to be one half of the total means of the couple. Where means are in excess of €20.00 per week (€30 per week from January next), reduced rates of both the personal payment and the increase for a qualified adult are payable.In the case of farm assist, the means of a couple are halved where the spouse has earnings from insurable employment and/or where the spouse/partner's means from any source is greater than €76.18 per week. Increases for qualified adults continue to be payable at the full rate where the spouse/partner's income is less than €100 per week and at reduced rates where that income is between €100 per week and €250 per week (€280 per week from January). These provisions are similar to those which apply in the case of other working age schemes such as jobseeker's allowance and disability allowance.Any change in the method of assessment of capital for farm assist could only be considered in the context of the assessment of means generally for this scheme and associated schemes and there are no plans, at present, to change the current arrangements. However, the matter will be kept under review.

These include, the Costs of Disability Group and the National Co-ordinating Committee for Training and Work for People with Disabilities.  A Protocol agreed between the two Departments identifies the key shared objectives to be achieved by both in relation to people with disabilities. Progress is monitored by regular bi-lateral meetings.There is close and ongoing co-operation between my Department and the Department of Health in implementing the recommendation made in the Core Functions of the Health Service Report. This will involve inter alia the transfer of certain functions including the supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA), and other cost of disability and caring payments, from Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department.A number of working groups which include senior officials from my Department and the Department of Health & Children and the HSE have been set up to progress the transfer arrangements. The work is overseen by an interdepartmental steering group chaired by  my Department.The SWA scheme is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare Service of the HSE.  Officials of my Department works directly with the Health Service Executive in relation to the administration of the SWA scheme.My Department supports the Department of Health and Children in progressing the National Longitudinal Study of Children in Ireland and participates in the steering Group which is overseeing the study, the Project Team which is managing it, and in the Scientific and Policy Advisory Group.Furthermore, officials participate in a number of committees and working groups established by the Office of the Minister for Children to progress the National Children's Strategy.Both Departments worked together with the Department of Finance and the Department of an Taoiseach in relation to the issue on Long Term Care which is being considered by the Government at present.  Further co-operation is planned in relation to the National Carers Strategy  to be developed by my Department in line with the Government's commitments in Towards 2016.The Office for Social Inclusion (OSI) works closely with the Social Inclusion Unit in the Department of Health and Children on the development of the Government's National Action Plan for Social Inclusion.

The scheme allows up to 20 years (from 1994) spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.The scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance 10 years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the appropriate rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age must also be satisfied.The homemaker's scheme is not yet a significant factor in determining eligibility for social welfare pensions, with relatively few cases involving recourse to the scheme having been decided.The question of changing the system of disregards to one based on actual credited contributions has been suggested and this will be examined in the context of future developments in pensions policy.

It is expected that the Court will give its judgement within six months of receiving the Advocate General's opinion. I should point out that although the opinion is usually indicative of the courts decision, the court may choose to take a different view.In the meantime discussions are on-going with the Office of the Attorney General on the legal implications for my Department and on the steps to be taken should the judgement of the Court be in line with the Advocate-General's opinion.I will be putting appropriate proposals before Government once the court decision is known.  My Department will also engage with the Commission in relation to giving effect to the Court's judgment.Pending any new arrangements being put in place, and recognizing the essential payment delivery service which An Post currently provides for my Department, the Company will continue to provide these services.

The Plan will be launched early in 2007 and is being prepared in tandem with and will complement the forthcoming National Development Plan 2007-2013, which will contain a specific chapter on social inclusion. In keeping with the approach taken in the original 1997 National Anti-Poverty Strategy the new plan will adopt a strategic approach reflecting the complex nature of poverty and social exclusion, which is multi-faceted in its causes and effects and, as a consequence, requires a multi-pronged response across a range of policy areas.These strategies will build on the lifecycle approach in ‘Towards 2016', by assessing the risks which individuals face at each stage of the lifecycle and the supports they need to meet these risks. The groups focussed on using this lifecycle approach are Children, People of Working Age, Older People and People with Disabilities. This strategic framework is also being designed to create more coherent and integrated structures to achieve more effective implementation. It will also facilitate better and more effective reporting and monitoring across the spectrum of government activity in the area of poverty and social inclusion.The ten-year timescale chosen for the new plan both complements that of Towards 2016 and recognises that policy responses to poverty and social exclusion often require time to achieve their full results. The plan, however, will be reviewed at regular intervals, with the first review taking place in 2008.In the ten years since the first NAPS, much has been achieved in Ireland towards the EU aim of making a decisive impact on poverty. Much has also been learned, both from our own experience in Ireland and from that of other Member States, on how more effective, coordinated implementation of strategies can be achieved. Full account will be taken of this learning in developing the new Action Plan and the arrangements for its implementation.My aim and that of the Government is to continue to build not just a prosperous but a fair and equitable society in Ireland, which values and supports its people and particularly its most vulnerable. I am determined to ensure that this Plan and its implementation, in full consultation with all the stakeholders at national, regional and local levels, will make a major contribution to building the type of society we aspire to, by making a truly decisive impact on poverty.

All carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance, regardless of their age, receive a free travel pass.It is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension.  People resident in the State who are in receipt of a social security invalidity or disability payment from a country covered by EU Regulations, or from a country with which Ireland has a bilateral social security agreement, and who have been in receipt of this payment for at least 12 months, are also eligible for free travel.The scheme provides free travel on the main public and private transport services for those eligible under the scheme. These services are provided by companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as Luas and services provided by over 80 private transport operators.The free travel scheme applies to travel within the State and point to point cross- border journeys between here and Northern Ireland. In line with the Government objective to put in place an all Ireland free travel scheme for pensioners resident in all parts of this island, I am pleased that early 2007 will see the start of the introduction of all Ireland Free Travel which will allow Irish pensioners to travel throughout Northern Ireland free of charge while Northern pensioners will be able to do likewise here.There have been a number of requests and enquiries in relation to the extension of entitlement to free travel in Ireland to Irish born people living outside Ireland, or to those in receipt of pensions from my Department, particularly in the UK, when they return to Ireland for a visit.I have been advised that it would not be possible to extend entitlement to free travel only to Irish born people living abroad as to do so would be contrary to European legislation which prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality.  In addition, legal advice also indicates that to extend the free travel scheme to people in receipt of Irish pensions who live outside the State would also be discriminatory under EU law.However, I am determined to explore all options and I have raised the issue in meetings with the Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs, and officials from my Department met with European Commission officials on a number of  occasions in an effort to clarify the legal issues involved.  I am keeping this issue under close review and contacts with the European Commission are ongoing.All peak time access restrictions associated with the free travel scheme were removed with effect from 25th September 2006.   The lifting of all travel restrictions at peak times benefits many people, particularly older people and those with disabilities, who are now able to travel in the main cities, and surrounding areas, on public transport services at times that best suit their needs. The ending of these restrictions removed the need for people to apply for special passes to travel during what were restricted times.The free travel companion pass entitles the pass holder to have any one person, aged 16 years or over, to accompany him/her free of charge when travelling.  Such companion passes are available to persons who qualify for free travel and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone.  Those eligible for a companion pass include people who are receiving full time care and attention from someone who is in receipt of a carer's allowance.Under existing arrangements, since 1998 customers aged 75 years or over who advise the Department that they are medically unfit to travel alone receive a companion free travel pass.  At present those who are aged between 66 and 74 who are medically assessed as unfit to travel alone are not entitled to a companion pass unless they had been in receipt of a disability type payment prior to reaching age 66. In the recent Budget, I announced the removal of this requirement.  From March 2007 all those aged over 66 will be eligible for a companion pass if they are certified as being medically unfit to travel alone.The main objective of the free travel scheme is to encourage older people and people with disabilities to remain independent and active in the community, thereby reducing the need for institutional care.  The purpose of allowing pass holders to be accompanied while travelling is to further facilitate this mobility.  Extension of the companion pass in the manner proposed would not be in keeping with this objective.

Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.NESC has indicated that, as the proposed second tier income support represents a new approach to targeting, the issues involved are complex and there are technical and policy challenges to be overcome. The Council's analysis of these issues will, I believe, be of significant assistance in informing the future direction of child income support policy.In advance of NESC the examination of the new second tier support to be finalised, a range of other reforms, increased welfare supports and expanded child-centred services are all combining to make significant progress in tackling child poverty. The most recent figures show that at least 100,000 children have been lifted out of deprivation and hardship inside the last decade as a result of targeted measures and supports. These include, in addition to the substantial increases in each Budget in child benefit rates in recent years which directly benefit over one million children, increases in Budget 2007 of from €9 to €111 a week for families on Family Income Supplement which is being claimed by over 21,100 families, increasing the average payment, per child, to €50 per week; the €60 per child increase in the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance which benefits some 85,000 families and the €1,000 a year Early Childcare Supplement which benefits over 396,000 children, a third of whom are the children of lone parents.Also, the increase in all three child dependant allowance rates to €22 from January 2007 will benefit 342,000 children at a cost of €56.13 million in a full year.

Government commitment to this key sector has been underscored by the allocation of an increase of almost €5million to the FRC programme in 2007, to facilitate its consolidation and expansion, bringing total funding, including an increase announced in the budget, to some €18.75 million.The scheme of grants to the family counselling sector is another key family support administered by the Family Support Agency.  During 2006, financial support was provided to over 540 groups nationwide.  2007 funding will increase to €10 million, including a recent budget increase to allow for an increase in grant payments to those organisations that apply for funding and for an anticipated increase in the number of groups applying for support.Overall, the budget of the Family Support Agency will increase to over €35.3 million up from €28 million in 2006 and a massive €10.8 million increase since 2005  to continue with its mission to promote family and community well being through the provision of appropriate supports and services to families.My Department is also responsible for the Family Services Project (FSP) which was established to provide a high quality information service on the range of supports available to families and to provide programmes of support to groups of customers with complex needs for example lone parents, dependent spouses on social welfare payments with children, carers and Traveller families.Examples of activities funded under the FSP, now administered by the Employment Supports Service in my Department, include parenting projects for very young lone parents, support programmes for families of people with disabilities and family support for Travellers.  To date in 2006, over €1.40 million has been expended on some 82 programmes to assist disadvantaged families, 37 of which were parenting programmes.  The project is monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that the funding is targeted at those families most in need of assistance.

My Department is committed to working closely with the PRTB in ensuring that over time, all tenancies where rent supplement is paid comply with the statutory system of tenancy regulation and safeguards. To that end, my Department provides details of rent supplement payments to the PRTB to enable them identify tenancies that are not registered and to take any follow-up action necessary.It is not a requirement of the rent supplement scheme that landlords must be registered with the PRTB before a rent supplement is paid to the tenant. To make this a requirement would delay or in some cases entirely prevent payments of rent supplement to the tenants. In many cases, when a rent supplement claim is being decided the tenancy will not have been registered with the PRTB as the establishment of the tenancy will be dependent on rent supplement being awarded. I do not wish to penalise tenants for the failure of individual landlords to meet their statutory obligations.  In that regard, I am satisfied that the arrangements I have outlined above are currently appropriate.

One of these groups oversees the implementation of the SWA element of the transfer of functions programme.  The group's work to date has centred mainly on providing the necessary foundation for the successful transfer of the scheme.   This includes identifying all of the functions at present carried out within the Community Welfare Service for the purpose of identifying appropriate arrangements for the continued administration and management of functions in the context of the transfer.The transfer of functions will present fundamental reform and developmental opportunities for an integrated and enhanced income support system, including a restructuring and integration of support services within my Department, while facilitating the HSE in concentrating on its core health and personal social services functions.  The existing mechanisms of delivery by the Community Welfare Service allow the service to be responsive, flexible and outcome focused.  These are attributes for which there will be a continuing need into the future and there will be no diminution in the existing role and responsibilities afforded to SCWO/CWO's.   The transfer of functions is an opportunity for an enhancement of the support role that Community Welfare Officers currently provide to those disadvantaged in society.The implementation of a change programme of this magnitude involves organisational, human resource and service delivery issues.  Throughout the change programme both the HSE and my Department will give a very high priority to involving the Community Welfare Service in the planning and implementation of the changes and providing clear and precise information on all elements of the change process.  Staff in my own Department who will be impacted by the change will also be involved and kept informed throughout the process.While no date has been set for the completion of the transfer process, I propose to bring forward enabling legislation to give effect to the transfer in time for the 2007 Social Welfare Bill and I would intend that the transfer would take place as soon as possible thereafter.During the period of transition my Department will continue to give a high priority to supporting the delivery of the very high standard of service currently provided by staff in the Community Welfare Service.

Given the extensive and complex nature of the scheme, the review was undertaken in two phases. A report was published at the end of the first phase in December 2004. That report gave a broad appraisal of the scheme and identified issues for particular consideration in the second phase which commenced in February 2005.This second phase of the Review, recently published, on 29th November, considered the issues raised in Phase I of the report and examined the validity of the objectives and the efficiency and effectiveness of all elements of the scheme, including rent supplement. The review also provided a series of recommendations in relation to the future of the scheme.Overall the review concluded that the scheme has, over the years, met its objective of guaranteeing that every person in the State has a minimum level of income sufficient to meet their basic day to day needs. The main recommendations arising include –That ultimately, social assistance schemes should be integrated into a unified system of income support;That payment of basic SWA payments should be part of the Department's (DSFA) remit;That all matters relating to long-term housing needs should be dealt with by local authorities;That short-term income support for housing needs should be catered for by DSFA;that exceptional/urgent needs payments should be rationalised;that the remaining elements of SWA should become part of a system which would deliver irradiate, flexible circumstances. This service would be decided by the Community Welfare Service in co-operation with the other relevant agencies.In relation to mortgage supports study has been commissioned from Goodbody Economic Consultants to examine the potential of supplementing home ownership specifically among the client base that comes within the rent supplementation arrangements. The study is aimed at identifying possible viable alternative approaches to meet the housing needs of long-term rent supplement recipients. People in this category are primarily dependent on social welfare or health service executive payments and would not be in position generally to purchase private property at going market rates. The work is nearing completion and I understand that the draft report is currently being finalised.The Value for Money examination undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&AG) looked specifically at the rent supplement scheme during the period 2000 to 2005.  One of the main issues raised by the C&AG relates to the substantial increase in expenditure on rent supplement over the period of review. As the report notes, it increased from €151m in 2000 to almost €370m in 2005. In the same period, recipient numbers rose from 42,700 to just over 60,000. The report focuses in particular on the increase in the level of rent supplements paid during this period as a contributory factor giving rise to the increase in expenditure. Other contributing factors include increases in the number of recipients and changes in household composition.During the period under review my Department took measures to address increases in expenditure. For example in December 2002 limits were set by regulation on the amount of rent in respect of which rent supplements are paid.  Rent supplement are not paid where rents exceed the maximum levels set other than in exceptional circumstances. The limits were again reviewed in December 2003 and June 2005 and a further review is due to be completed by the end of this month.A conclusion arising from the C&AG report, is that rent supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has, over the years, developed beyond the original objective of providing short-term assistance with accommodation. A significant number of people have now come to rely on rent supplementation for extended periods, including people on local authority housing lists. For this reason, the scheme has to be viewed in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term claimants.In response to this situation, the Government has introduced new rental assistance arrangements including the rental accommodation scheme (RAS) giving local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis. When fully operational, local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a new public / private partnership type rental accommodation scheme.The Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated that at the end of November 2006 almost 2,600 tenants have been accommodated under the Rental Accommodation Scheme and a further 1,900 persons accommodated in Social Housing. It is projected that by the end of 2006, between 4,500 and 5,000 tenants will have transferred from rent supplement to accommodation provided by local authorities either through the RAS or some other type of social housing, rising to 10,000 by the end of 2007.These rental assistance arrangements were endorsed by the working group which carried out the review of the SWA scheme. Overall I am satisfied that the current approach in relation to those in receipt of rent supplement with a long-term housing need is the correct one and that my Department will be vigorously pursuing the implementation of the new arrangements.

Reviews of recipients' efforts to find work are carried out regularly by local offices. The onus is on the customer to show that he or she satisfies this condition by providing clear and convincing evidence that he or she has made an active search for work on an on-going basis. Statistics of people refused jobseekers benefit and jobseekers allowance are set out on a county and month basis in table 1 and table 2 attached. However, statistics are not maintained of the number of customers disallowed for not genuinely seeking work, who had supplied letters from prospective employers.It should be borne in mind that there are many other reasons why a deciding officer may disallow a claim under this heading, including failure to avail of training and developmental opportunities to improve ones chances of securing employment.The production of letters from employers is only one of a number of factors taken into account by a deciding officer when considering whether a person is genuinely seeking work. There are a number of reasons why employers' letters may not be accepted as evidence that a person is genuinely seeking work, and such letters are not in themselves conclusive evidence of work seeking. Other issues taken into consideration include the number of suitable employment vacancies known to exist in the area and previous experience of being unable to obtain evidence over a long period of time from the customer of having looked for work.All measures taken by a customer to secure employment will be taken into account provided they offer a reasonable chance of getting employment. The steps expected to be taken to find work will vary from person to person and from one period to another. In determining what are reasonable steps, the deciding officer considers the nature and conditions of the employment sought and the individual circumstances of the persons concerned, including their level of skills and/or qualifications for the employment in question having regard to the labour market opportunities and seasonal factors.A person who fails to satisfy the deciding officer that he or she is genuinely seeking work is not entitled to a jobseeker's payment.

The Pensions Board has the main statutory responsibility for monitoring compliance with the Pensions Act and is also required under the Act to provide guidance for trustees on their duties and responsibilities in relation to scheme administration and to issue codes of practice on specific aspects of trustees' duties.The provision made for these Pensions Board functions is a clear recognition of the central role which trustees have in ensuring that occupational pension schemes are properly administered, that scheme members' pension rights are fully safeguarded and that they and their dependants ultimately receive their pensions.The Pensions Board, as part of its regulatory role, monitors trustees who must account to members for how their scheme is run by providing them with a wide range of personal and scheme information as required by the Pensions Acts 1990 to 2004.The disclosure of information in a timely manner enables scheme members to monitor their benefits and the financial soundness of their pension schemes.The Board regards information disclosure as a very important governance requirement for pension schemes and takes steps to enforce this obligation where necessary. In this regard trustees have been prosecuted for failing to comply with disclosure requirements.There are also statutory provisions which place a legal requirement on a range of specified persons involved in the operation of occupational pension schemes to report suspected fraud or material misappropriation to the Board. There is also provision to make a voluntary report on any matter concerning the state and conduct of the scheme. Specified persons include auditors, actuaries, trustees, insurance intermediaries, investment advisers and any other person who has been involved in assisting the trustees of a scheme. The provisions also contain legal protection for the persons making such reports.Obviously, it is necessary to keep the regulatory strategy under review to ensure that schemes are administered in accordance with the requirements of the Pensions Act and to an acceptably high standard.  In this regard, the Pensions Board is at present carrying out a review of its operations to see how it might perform its role more effectively in the current pensions environment. Broadly, I understand that the Board plans to develop further its approach to the supervision of schemes and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts, in line with international best practise and EU requirements. I would support such an approach. The Board will shortly present its proposals in this regard to the Department and these will be considered in detail.

A second inspector was assigned to the Bureau in August, 2006.Operation Gull is a joint control exercise undertaken periodically at Airports and Ports in the Republic, Northern Ireland and Great Britain and the operations involve personnel from the GNIB, and the United Kingdom Immigration Service. My Department, through its assignment of Social Welfare Inspectors to the GNIB, participates in these exercises.I am satisfied that assigning Social Welfare Inspectors to the GNIB has proved beneficial for both organisations and that Operation Gull is an example of the benefits of inter agency and international co-operation. The operation is ongoing and my Department will continue to support such operations in every possible way.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	605	I welcome the launch, late last month, of the latest research report of the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, titled " Minimum Essential Budgets for Six Households".  My Department will examine the research report and its recommendations over the next period in the context of setting future policy direction.It is clear that Government has already acted, in 2006, to address some of the problems and challenges identified in this report, and in other similar studies. Such actions include:The introduction of the early childcare supplement (introduced after the research for this project was conducted);The introduction of new National Childcare Investment Programme;Changes in the upper earnings limit for one-parent family payment;Major proposals for lone parents, designed to remove them from poverty and to enable them to (re)join the workforce.This Government is committed to significantly improving the standard of living of welfare dependent and low-income households and to making a decisive impact on poverty and social exclusion. Over the period since 1997, the Government has greatly increased the levels of income support provided through the social welfare system and this was again evident in the increases announced last week as part of Budget 2007. Expenditure on social welfare has increased by nearly 270% since 1997. In 2007 almost €15.5 billion is being allocated to social welfare compared to €5.7 billion in 1997.Budget 2007 has provided over €1.4 billion, the largest social welfare package ever in the history of the State. This is more than five times the amount allocated to social welfare in the 1997 Budget. Almost one third of all current Government expenditure is being provided for social welfare in 2007 to directly support and benefit one and a half million people.Just to list some specifics. In Budget 2007:We have delivered on our commitment in the Programme for Government by bringing the basic State Pension to €200 a week.The contributory pension has increased by €16 a week to €209.30 and other social welfare rates by €20 a week to €185.80.About 35,500 contributory pensioner couples will be nearly €40 a week better off.We have realised the 2007 target for the lowest social welfare rates. The lowest rate of Social Welfare payments have increased by 12.1%, far in excess of the expected increase of 4.5% in private sector earnings and almost three times the forecast rate of inflation for 2007.Since 1997, the lowest rates of welfare payments have increased by almost 117%, well ahead of the 53% accumulated inflation over that period.We are also delivering on the pledge to tackle remaining levels of child poverty. A number of key measures are, in particular, shaped and targeted at confronting and tackling remaining child poverty, includingan increase of €10 in Child Benefit to over one million children that takes this universal support to at least €160 per month.combining the three rates of Child Dependant Allowance payments into a single rate of €22 per week that will benefit over 340,000 children of families on welfare.Increasing the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance by 50%.In recent years, we have lifted more than 100,000 children out of poverty. The measures I have outlined will pay a major part in completing this task.We are confronting the issue of fuel poverty. Last year, I increased the fuel allowance by €5 a week to €14 and this year I am again increasing it by a further €4 to €18 a week.  This means that the level of the fuel allowance, which is paid to 274,000 recipients, will have doubled in the last two years. As I already announced in September last, as and from next January, the number of free units of electricity and gas paid under the Household Benefits Scheme will increase by 600 units a year to 2,400 units.In Budget 2007, I also announced a wide-ranging employment support package of €21 million. This contained a range of measures which will alleviate poverty and support activation by improving income disregards and tapers for the unemployed and qualified adults. These arrangements maximise the benefits of work for low-income households.The full package of measures I announced for carers will cost in excess of €107 million in a full year and are further evidence, if such was needed, of this Government's commitment to improving the lot of family carers and the people they look after.Key reforms included increases in the income disregards for entitlement to Carer's Allowance and a 25% increase in the Respite Care Grant, to €1,500 per week.I was also delighted to announce that I am introducing fundamental structural reforms in relation to carers. In future people in receipt of another social welfare payment, who are also providing full time care and attention to a person, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, equivalent to a half rate Carer's Allowance. The precise details of this arrangement are currently being examined by my Department and will be set out in legislation next year.In conclusion, the 2007 Budget package is a strong statement of this Government's commitment to the elderly, children, carers and all those who, for one reason or another, are more vulnerable in our society.

Furthermore, people who are living in community-based residences are eligible to receive (DA) provided the relevant Health Board is not providing funding towards their maintenance.However, the position of people in residential care since prior to August 1999, or those who entered residential care subsequent to that date without an entitlement to (DA), has been that they are disqualified from receipt of this payment solely because of their residency.This situation was partially addressed in Budget 2005 when I introduced a new Disability Allowance (Personal Expenses Rate) to 2,700 people in residential care who qualified for this payment.This payment replaced the pocket money (spending allowances) which had previously been paid to some of these residents by the Health Services Executive but at the standardised and higher rate of €35 per week. The weekly levels of the pocket money allowance had varied between Health Service Executive areas.I have now moved beyond simply standardising the current personal allowances to make these people eligible for full (DA) at the rate of €185.80 per week as a matter of right, subject only to the same conditions as apply to others.  As part of Budget 2007, the disqualification has been removed so that all persons in residential care will have an income maintenance payment on the same basis (in effect abolishing the disqualification and the Disability Allowance (Personal Expenses Rate)). The removal of the disqualification will ensure that persons in receipt of DA in residential care are treated in the same way as other social welfare recipients.Arrangements are now being made to extend the payment of (DA), at the rate appropriate to their means, to approximately 2,700 people in residential care.  This measure will be effective from 3 January 2007 and payments will be made in accordance with the joint level service agreements in place between my Department and the service providers.  The payments to the people concerned will be treated in the same way as other Disability Allowance payments and in line with the protocols of the Health Services Executive for monies paid by my Department on behalf of persons in residential care.

Charges vary across local authorities and within local authorities where there is more than one provider.  In addition, some local authorities already operate waiver schemes.My officials have discussed this issue with their counterparts in the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  While there are no plans at present for the introduction of a waiver scheme through the social welfare system, I intend to keep the issue under close scrutiny.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	608	I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 69, 98 and 110.In the Budget of December 2005, I announced a wide range of important reforms for non-contributory pensioners in conjunction with the introduction of the State Pension (non- contributory).  These reforms include improvements to the means test for pensioners, the raising of the weekly means disregard from €7.60 to €20.  As part of the pension reforms, I also announced a specific additional disregard of €100 per week where the pensioner and/or spouse is in employment.  This new disregard, relating to earnings from employment, is intended as an incentive to facilitate non-contributory pensioners who wish to continue working, or to re-enter the workforce.The effect of this measure is that the first €100 of weekly earnings from employment is fully disregarded from the means test.  A similar earnings disregard of €100 per week also applies to the pensioner's spouse or partner.   The disregard also applies to people under age 66 who are in receipt of a widow/er's non-contributory pension, deserted wife's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.The new disregard was effective from the 29th September 2006.  In June  2006 all relevant non contributory  pension customers in receipt of a reduced pension,  some  48,000, were notified by my Department of the impending change to the employment disregard.  As a result, I am satisfied that all customers who are in a position to avail of the disregard are fully informed of these changes.The customers benefiting from the new €100 earnings disregard, currently numbering 380, are in addition to the approximately 500 pensioners who already avail of the 30 hours disregard from income earned as a home help with the HSE.Further to my commitment on encouraging our State pensioners back into the workplace I announced in the Budget earlier this month that I would be doubling this disregard from €100 to €200 effective from January 2007.  This specific rise in earnings disregard of €200 per week, equivalent to €10,400 a year will allow a State Pensioner the opportunity to earn additional income through employment while at the same time retaining their full pension entitlements.Labour force participation by older people has been declining over recent years and I would expect that the doubling of the disregard should act as a further incentive to pensioners to return or remain in the workforce, thereby reversing the trend.  It should also help address the concerns of pensioners about reductions in pensions and benefits, along with affording them the opportunity to increase their weekly income and standard of living.The change to State Pension (Non-Contributory) employment disregard should not only be seen as society's recognition of the contribution our older people have made to the building of modern Ireland, but also sends out the message that we value the potential contribution to society these  men and women can make.   While it is not yet clear how successful this initiative will be in attracting labour market participation nonetheless early signs are encouraging and I am optimistic for future active age employment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	609	My Department through its various social insurance and assistance schemes provides income supports to people to meet their basic living needs, including food, clothing, heat and light.Supplements are also payable in certain circumstances for specific needs, for example fuel allowances, rent supplements, living alone allowance for older people or the household benefits package for pensioners, eligible disabled people and carers.Where people on low incomes have particular medical conditions or dietary requirements, diet supplements are available through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive. It is expected that expenditure on diet supplements will amount to €6 million this year and benefit over 11,000 people.My Department also provides funding for school meals through two programmes, the urban school meals scheme and the local projects scheme. The urban school meals scheme operates in conjunction with certain local authorities and is co-funded by my Department. The local projects scheme provides funding to secondary, national, pre-schools and community groups in both urban and rural areas who provide school meals.For families with school-going children, school meals can make a real and important contribution to ensuring that children receive better nutrition. Such services can also contribute to improved school attendance and quality of learning. Expenditure on the schools meals programme for 2006 will be of the order of €13 million and will benefit some 125,000 pupils in approx 1,400 schools in 2006.  In Budget 2007, I have provided a further €3m for the school meals scheme.My Department commissioned the Irish Nutrition and Dietetic Institute to undertake a study into the cost of healthy eating and specialised diets for a single individual in Ireland.  This study, which was published in January 2006, brought an up-to-date focus on the varying costs of healthy foods and contained proposals for specialised diets based on the latest dietary and medical views.  This study found that, depending on whether a person shopped in a low cost supermarket or convenience store, a healthy eating diet could be purchased for between €40.38 and €59.38 at January 2006 prices.  This is equivalent to between 24% and 38% of the minimum weekly social welfare payment of €165.80.Healthy eating is affected by dietary and nutritional awareness, cultural attitudes and access to good quality grocery shopping, as well as to the adequacy of social welfare income supports.  In recent years, budgetary increases in social welfare payment rates have consistently exceeded increases in the cost of living. This key policy is the primary focus of Budget allocations to my Department each year, and it has helped ensure that those depending on social welfare experience real improvement in their ability to meet their basic needs, including provision of adequate food, heating, etc.In this regard, consumer price index information from the Central Statistics Office indicates that the cost of food and non-alcoholic beverages has increased by 1.7% over the past 12 months.  From December 2001 to date, food and non-alcoholic beverages increased by just 3.7% in aggregate while increases in social welfare payment rates increased by between 47% and 56% in the same period.   As overall total inflation amounted to less than 18% in that period, there has been a very significant real increase in purchasing power for people on social welfare.I am satisfied that the policy of providing substantial real increases in primary social insurance and assistance payment rates has been effective in ensuring that those who depend on social welfare income have sufficient income for healthy food.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	611	I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 50 together.Supporting and recognising carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.One of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement — Towards 2016 — is the development of a National Carer's Strategy.  This strategy, which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community, will be developed by the end of 2007.  It is expected that work on the strategy will begin early in the new year.While social welfare supports for carers will clearly be a key issue in the strategy, other issues such as access to respite and other services, education, training and employment will also feature strongly.  Co-operation between relevant Government departments and agencies is essential if the provision of services, supports and entitlements for carers is to be fully addressed.  For that reason all relevant departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.This type of co-operation is also reflected in the "Towards 2016" commitment that my Department lead the development of a structured consultation process to inform future policy in relation to carers.  This will involve an annual meeting of carer's representative groups and relevant department and agencies.I am pleased that the first such meeting has already been held and that the issues raised there informed the package of measure for carers which I announced in Budget 2007.  I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 43, 45, 70, 72, 86, 97 and 291 together.Supporting and recognising carers in our society is and has been a priority of the Government since 1997.  Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.According to Census 2002, there are some 148,750 people providing care to someone for at least 1 hour per week.  Of these, 48,500 people are providing personal care for more than 29 hours per week or just over 4 hours per day.  More than 14,300 of this group are employed for more than 15 hours per week.At present there are just over 27,100 people in receipt of carer's allowance.  A further 1,400 people are in receipt of carer's benefit.  As a result of the extension of the respite care grant to all full time carers regardless of their means some 34,000 grants are now being paid, including over 8,300 grants to people who are not in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit.In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer's allowance so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. This means test has been eased significantly over the years most notably with the introduction of spouse's earnings disregard.Following Budget 2006, since April, the earnings disregard for a couple has been set at €580 per week which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings.  As a result of further improvements which I announced in the Budget 2007 this disregard will increase to €640 per week for a couple from April 2007.When this increase is in place a couple with two children will be able to earn up to €36,240 and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.This measure surpasses the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure that those on average industrial earnings can continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.It is estimated that complete abolition of the means test for carer's allowance would cost over €140 million in a full year. The view of some support organisations is that if this level of resources were available, it would be more beneficial to carers if it were invested in further increases to carers allowance and in the type of community care services which would support them in their caring role, such as additional respite care facilities, more home helps, public health nurses and other such services.From June 2005, I extended the annual respite care grant to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care regardless of their income. Those persons in receipt of other social welfare payments, excluding jobseeker's assistance and benefit, are entitled to this payment subject to meeting the full time care condition.  In Budget 2007 I provided for the level of the grant to increase by €300 to €1,500 from June next year.The primary objective of the social welfare system is to provide income support and as a general rule only one weekly social welfare payment is payable to an individual.  Persons qualifying for two social welfare payments receive the higher payment to which they are entitled.  I am aware that this has been a cause of particular concern to people in receipt of a social welfare payment when they become carers.For that reason I was very pleased to introduce fundamental structural reforms in this area in Budget 2007.  In future people in receipt of another social welfare payment who are also providing full time care and attention to a person will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent of a half rate carer's allowance.It is estimated that approximately 18,000 carers will benefit from this measure at cost of €56.72 million in a full year.  The precise details regarding how this new arrangement will operate are being examined and will be set out in legislation early next year.  The measure will come into effect in September 2007.Each year I receive a significant number of pre-Budget submissions, many of which include proposals in relation to the carer's allowance.  I also receive a large number of representations both from public representatives, representative organisations and members of the public relating to income support for carers.  Among the most common issues raised are the means test for carer's allowance, the position of people in receipt of a payment other than carer's allowance or benefit who are also providing full time care and attention and the level of the payment.    I am pleased that Budget 2007 includes improvements relating to each of these issues.I have already outlined the new arrangements for people in receipt of another social welfare payment and the increases in the income disregard.  In addition, I have increased the rates of carer's allowance to €200 per week for those aged under 66 and to €218 per week for those aged over 66.Towards 2016 commits the Government to continuing to scope for further development of the carer's allowance, carer's benefit and the respite care grant.   I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.  The improvements for carers which I announced in Budget 2007 are further evidence of this commitment.

The level of take-up since the farm assist scheme was first introduced in April 1999 significantly reversed the ongoing downward trend in numbers under the smallholders assistance scheme which preceded it, reaching its highest level at approximately 8,500 prior to the introduction of the rural social scheme (RSS) by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in May 2004.  Numbers participating have decreased since then due to the transfer of farmers to the RSS.In addition, take up would have been affected by the increase in off-farm employment by farmers and their spouses in recent years.Farm assist has been widely promoted in various ways over the years, which included a major media campaign on local radio to promote the scheme, conducted in the Autumn of 2002 at a cost of almost €100,000.  The campaign consisted of prime time spots in 19 local radio stations and the placing of adverts in the provincial papers and farm publications. During the same period an information video about the scheme was transmitted at 24 livestock marts nationwide. The video was also shown on a large screen at the National Ploughing Championships in September 2002 and in each subsequent year, including this year.My Department's Information Service, in conjunction with the IFA, has presented information seminars on the scheme to groups of farmers at various locations throughout the country.  The farm assist video was shown at these presentations and was followed by a Q&A session.  In 2003 a follow up advert was placed in the Irish Farmers Handbook.Farm assist has brought about significant worthwhile improvements for low income farmers, particularly for those with children, making a valuable contribution to supporting those who are at the lower end of the farm income spectrum.  For this reason my Department will continue to promote and publicise the scheme in order to achieve and maintain maximum take up.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 91 together.In the context of the recent Budget, I announced significant improvements in the rate of payment for qualified adults on State pensions and important changes in the way these payments will be made in the future.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment "to introduce a personal pension entitlement for pensioner spouses currently in receipt of the qualified adult allowance, set at the level of a full non-contributory pension". The changes introduced in this budget mark a significant step in this regard, while setting in place a programme that will bring the Qualified Adults to the level of the State non-contributory pension within the next three years.Arising from the Budget the increase payable in respect of Qualified Adults will increase by Eur23.70 per week for State Pension (Contributory), State Pension (Transition) and Invalidity Pension where the Qualified Adult is aged 66 years of age or over.  This represents an increase of 15.9% in the rate of payment and brings the payment to 86.5% of the target rate.  Prior to the budget the maximum payment for a qualified adult represented 82% of the State non-contributory Pension rate.  Some 35,500 Qualified Adults will benefit from this increased level of payment.The making of personal payments direct to Qualified Adults was introduced for new claimants to State Pension Transition (SPT) and State pension contributory (SPC) with effect from 1 October 2002.  Under the procedures currently in place, personal and Qualified Adult payments are made as a combined amount to the applicant.  However, applicants may choose to avail of the facility to be paid separately.  Thus far, a total of 1,400 couples have opted to have the qualified adult allowance paid directly to the spouse.Following the changes announced in the Budget qualified adults will be entitled to automatically receive their portion of the pension as a separate payment.  Claim forms will be amended accordingly and there will be an opt-out option included for customers who wish to be paid their pension jointly.  The revised arrangements will apply to new applicants for SPT, SPC and SPn/c with effect from September 2007.The operational arrangements for implementing this initiative are currently being devised in my Department and will be finalised shortly.  It is envisaged that some 2,000 additional Qualified Adults will benefit from this direct payment of the IQA (Increase for Qualified Adult) during 2007.  In a full year approximately 6,000 Qualified Adults would benefit based on current trends.

These proposals have been discussed over the past 18 months under the UK, Austrian and Finnish Presidencies and officials from my Department have attended the meetings of the Social Questions Working Group dealing with these matters.The rules on the coordination of social security systems are currently contained in Regulation (EEC) 1408/71 and its implementing Regulation (EEC) 574/72. In 1998 the Commission presented a proposal to modernise and simplify the provisions of Regulation 1408/71. Following negotiation, Regulation (EC) No. 883/2004 was adopted on 29 April 2004. This was the first step in a process aimed at modernizing and simplifying the EU rules on the co-ordination of social security rights of migrant workers. This process must be completed with the adoption of an implementing regulation to replace Regulation (EEC) 574/72 and of a regulation that will form the content of Annex XI to Regulation (EC) 883/04. The new co-ordination rules contained in Regulation 883/04 cannot be applied until both these proposals have been adopted by both the EU Council of Ministers and the European Parliament.The first proposal sets out these implementing provisions, the aim of which is to define the procedures needed to implement the principles of Regulation 883/2004. The second proposal includes provisions regarding specific aspects of individual Member States' legislation that will form the content of Annex XI to Regulation (EC) 883/2004.With regard to the proposal for a Directive on the Portability of Supplementary Pension Rights, the Council at its recent meeting, noted the contents of a Progress Report from the Finnish presidency and held a policy debate on the proposals on improving the portability of supplementary pension rights. The draft directive attempts to address a number of issues which, in the context of pension provision, present obstacles to the free movement of workers. These issues relate to the acquisition, preservation and transfer of pension rights in respect of workers who change employment both within and across member States.Despite extensive discussions at the Social Questions Group, it had not been possible to reach agreement on the proposals in the draft directive, especially those in relation to the transfer of pension rights. It is expected that the Council will continue the examination of these proposals.

Under this new framework, Member States are required to draw up national reports, covering a three year period, on strategies for social protection and social inclusion which address the specific challenges in each of the following policy areas — social inclusion, pensions, healthcare and long-term care. The new framework envisages a positive interaction, at national level, between the National Reform Programmes for growth and jobs and the strategies for social protection and social inclusion.All Member States submitted integrated National Reports on Strategies for Social Protection and Social Inclusion covering the period 2006-2008. Ireland's national report was prepared by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. All other relevant government Departments were consulted including the Departments of An Taoiseach, Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.The preparation of Ireland's strategy took place in the context of the agreement of a new social partnership agreement, Towards 2016. This agreement outlines a new framework within which key social challenges have been developed around the "lifecycle" approach. The agreed 10 year strategic vision and key long-term goals for each stage of the lifecycle, together with agreed priority actions for the initial phase of the agreement, form the basis of measures outlined in this Report. The Agreement also included commitments to the development of a new comprehensive strategy for pensions policy, including the publication of a green paper and to the delivery of tangible improvements in the health outcomes of children, people of working age, older people and people with disabilities.The social inclusion component of the national strategy reports represent the National Action Plans for social inclusion (NAP/inclusion) and present the key priorities in Member States' efforts to promote greater social inclusion and make a decisive impact on poverty over the two year period of the plan. In this context, four key priorities were identified by EU Member States as being common to many of them and as areas where they can benefit most from exchanges of experience and best practice. These include child poverty; access to quality work and learning opportunities; integration of immigrants and access to quality services.The forthcoming new National Action Plan on social inclusion, to be produced in early 2007, will set out in greater detail the social inclusion elements covered in the national report and will elaborate on the commitments contained in Towards 2016.With regard to pensions, the national report includes an update on developments in both the State and private occupational pensions systems since 2005. It refers in particular, to the Government's commitments in the Towards 2016 agreement to enhancement of social welfare pensions over the period of the agreement subject to adequate resources and building on the commitment to a rate of €200 per week for social welfare pensions by 2007 and to the publication of a Green Paper on Pensions Policy outlining the major policy choices and challenges in this area.

My Department has on-going engagement with these bodies and projects.Pending development of a single pass, my Department has engaged with the Department of Regional Development and Translink, the main transport authority in Northern Ireland, to put in place an interim scheme to permit residents of both jurisdictions to avail of free travel within the other jurisdiction.  This interim scheme will extend the existing cross-border free travel arrangements by allowing pensioners resident here travel free of charge on all bus and rail services in Northern Ireland. Likewise, pensioners in Northern Ireland will travel free of charge on transport services in this State.Intensive work in relation to the introduction of the scheme has taken place including consultation with the transport operators in both jurisdictions.  Work has progressed on the design of the operation of the new scheme including a new registration process, design of a new travel card and application form.  The necessary ICT system changes have been identified, the technical elements of the new system have been delivered and a programme of testing and training has commenced.  Consultation with staff has commenced on the introduction of this system.The project is scheduled to be operational at the end of Quarter 1, 2007.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	618	A National Disability Survey, a follow-up to the latest Population Census is currently being conducted by the Central Statistics Office, the results of which will be available next year. This is the first national survey in Ireland specifically designed to capture the prevalence of different types of disability and the extent to which those affected participate in various activities.The three most recent sources of data on the demographics and economic status of people with disabilities are the Census 2002, the Quarterly National Household Survey (QHNS) special modules on disability undertaken in 2002 and 2004, and the Living in Ireland Survey, which was conducted on a uniform basis each year from 1995 to 2001. A recent report by the National Disability Authority on a Comprehensive Employment Strategy for People with Disabilities, drawing on the data sources for 2004, estimates that of a population of 298,300, 110,800 people with disabilities were in employment, 9,200 were unemployed and 178,300 were not economically active.Using this data, the estimated cost of the introduction of a universal payment of €40 per week for people with disabilities, regardless of labour force status is €620m per annum. If this payment were directed only towards those who are unemployed or not economically active, the estimated cost is €390m per annum.A working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF), with cross-departmental membership which includes my Department and chaired by the Department of Health and Children, has examined the feasibility of the introduction of a cost of disability payment.The National Disability Authority, on behalf of the working group and in line with its own remit, commissioned research into the feasibility of the introduction of such a payment. The purpose of this research was to advise regarding the additional costs incurred by people with disabilities, owing specifically to the direct or indirect costs of disability and the appropriate mechanisms or instruments by which to address identified additional costs. The resultant report, Disability and the Cost of Living, was subsequently published by the National Disability Authority.The group considers it vital that comprehensive data is available on which to base consideration of the introduction of a cost of disability payment, in addition to a structured process of the assessment of need. The working group recommended that steps be taken to improve the quality of data relating to disability in Ireland, for example, adjustment of existing data gathering exercises undertaken by the Central Statistics Office. This will be addressed in the aforementioned disability survey currently being undertaken by the CSO.The group has also examined the scope for addressing barriers that exist for people with disabilities who wish to undertake or increase their employment and thus move to a position of greater economic independence. In this regard, as part of the Social Welfare Budget package 2006, I introduced a change to the withdrawal rate of Disability Allowance and Blind Pension for income in excess of the current earnings disregard level which means that a single person can earn up to a maximum of €390 per week from rehabilitative employment before their Disability Allowance or Blind Pension is fully withdrawn. The outcome of this change will be monitored to assess its effect on increased employment participation and to identify any further policy changes required.In terms of ensuring adequate levels of income for people with disabilities, the current ten-year Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, includes the commitment to work for the continued enhancement and integration of supports in line with overall social welfare targets. These will include a rationalisation of existing allowances for people with disabilities in the context of the Government's policy of mainstreaming and the proposed transfer of functions from the Health Services Executive to my Department which includes a number of disability-related schemes, including the Domiciliary Care Allowance, Mobility Allowance and Blind Welfare Allowance. An inter-departmental working group has now been established to progress the implementation of this transfer.Other issues around the cost of disability will be considered following the development of a needs assessment system provided for under Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005.My Department's Disability Sectoral Plan similarly contains actions in relation to the rationalisation of existing allowances for people with disabilities. The Plan also includes agreed protocols with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on actions required to ensure that income supports and associated benefits do not create financial barriers to people with disabilities participating in the labour force or availing of training, educational or other developmental opportunities.I look forward to the implementation of the sectoral plan over the next three years and to continuing the commitment to expand and deliver services that best support, recognise and encourage people with disabilities as well as those in a caring role.

The provision of information in a clear and accessible manner is an essential element in the achievement of this objective.My Department takes a pro-active approach in advertising its schemes and services by using an appropriate mix of national and provincial media, information leaflets, factsheets, posters, direct mailshots, advertising on television screens in over 60 Credit Unions nationwide, and by distributing information booklets to health centres throughout the country.National advertising campaigns are undertaken periodically to promote greater awareness of a specific scheme or to highlight changes in schemes and services. The following campaigns have been undertaken in 2006:In March, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign to promote and encourage take up of the Family Income Supplement (FIS) scheme. An extensive week-long campaign included advertising on television, on national and local radio and in national and regional newspapers. Since this campaign was undertaken the number of new claims applications is 11,551 and renewals are 15,693 	compared with 6,327 and 11,966 for the same period in 2005.In August, the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance was advertised in national and regional newspapers.During the last week of September, an information campaign was conducted on television, on national and local radio and in national and regional newspapers to raise public awareness of the Carer's Allowance, Carer's Benefit and the Respite Care Grant, schemes designed to provide supports for carers. This campaign has proved successful. For example, the number of Respite Care Grants which will have issued in 2006 is expected to be of the order of 36,000 as compared with 34,300 approximately in 2005.My Department's PRSI information emailing service was recently advertised in the business supplements of the national newspapers. Employers and payroll companies were invited to register their details with the Department. Early notification, by email, of PRSI changes such as Budget Information will be provided to those who register their email addresses on my Department's website.As part of the Budget awareness campaign, this year, as in previous years, advertisements were placed in the national and regional newspapers listing phone numbers, including a Budget Freephone number, which customers could contact to receive information on changes in the various social welfare schemes and services.A LoCall helpline (1890 66 22 44) was provided for all campaigns. In addition to the LoCall number, the campaigns also highlight other sources of information available to the public, including my Department's network of Social Welfare Local Offices, Citizens Information Centres and my Department's website (www.welfare.ie). The responses to the campaigns have been encouraging and resulted in increases in the number of applications received for the schemes.In view of the range of services available from my Department it would not be possible to highlight all of them in a single advertising campaign. Therefore, nationwide advertising campaigns are designed to highlight specific schemes and services. Targeted advertising campaigns focusing on specific schemes and services will continue to be a key priority for me in the drive to ensure that citizens are aware of and claim their social welfare entitlements. I have secured an additional €0.75m in the budget for entitlement awareness campaigns in 2007.

This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were claiming other social welfare payments. There are currently 22,352 people in receipt of FIS.The reasons for the perceived lack of take-up of FIS have been the subject of significant Parliamentary and interest group enquiry. In response, my Department undertook a nationwide awareness campaign last March to promote and encourage increased take up of the Family Income Supplement scheme for working families on low incomes. This extensive week-long campaign included advertising on TV, on national and local radio and in the national and regional press.  A nation-wide poster campaign was also undertaken.  As a result, the take up of FIS was substantially improved.  In Budget 2007, I was pleased to increase income thresholds for FIS by €15 per week to €185 per week.The second element to address FIS take up issues is the proposed commissioning of a specific research project to examine factors behind the level of take up for the scheme.  Tenders to undertake this work have been invited and received by my Department and these are currently being evaluated. The project will commence early in 2007 with a view to its completion in the second quarter of 2007.

There is a statutory obligation on employers to register eligible employees in the scheme and to pay the necessary contributions.Compliance with the terms of the scheme is enforced through the Construction Industry Monitoring Agency, the Labour Court and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Pensions Board also has a role in relation to the scheme in so far as compliance with the various aspects of the Pensions Act is concerned and there are a number of provisions in the Act relating to the remittance of pension contributions to scheme trustees.It is important that employees are in a position to monitor the deduction and remittance of their contributions so that any problems in this area will be apparent as early as possible. Accordingly, employers are required to ensure that a statement is issued to employees at least once a month, and to the trustees or the person to whom the employer remits contributions direct, specifying the amount of contributions remitted on their behalf to trustees.In relation to defined benefit schemes this statement should specify the amount of employee contribution which has been remitted. In relation to defined contribution schemes the statement should specify the amount of both the employee and employer contribution remitted. This disclosure can be made via the payslip. The actual amount remitted during the period to which the statement relates may be specified on the payslip or, alternatively, where the amount of employee deduction and employer contribution which were specified on the previous payslip have since been remitted, a statement to that effect may be included on or with the payslip.Employers who deduct pension contributions from employees and who fail to remit these contributions to the scheme trustees are in breach of Section 58A of the Pensions Act. The Pensions Board will investigate all such cases brought to its attention or, alternatively, it is open to a person to make a complaint to the Pensions Ombudsman.In general I am satisfied that the necessary legislation is in place to deal with cases where contributions are not remitted to scheme trustees and that any such cases brought to attention will be fully investigated by the appropriate authorities.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	622	There is a number of social welfare supports available to assist families in coping with bereavement and the associated expenses. The Bereavement Grant is a one off payment paid to families of insured people to assist them with funeral expenses. I was glad to be able to increase the grant from €635 to €850, with effect from Budget day, 6 December 2006. It is paid to the spouse, partner, next of kin or personal representative of the deceased or to the person responsible for the payment of the funeral bill. The scheme covers virtually all insured persons, including the self-employed and people covered by the modified rate of social insurance. In instances where there are insufficient social insurance contributions to qualify for the grant, financial assistance may be sought under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.Where a person dies, the surviving spouse may be entitled to a Widow or Widower's (Contributory) Pension, subject to satisfying the insurance based conditions. Alternatively, where the insurance based conditions are not satisfied, the person may be entitled to a non-contributory pension, subject to a means test. Where the widowed person has dependent children a Widowed Parent Grant may also be payable. This payment is designed to assist with the income support needs of widows and widowers with dependent children in the immediate aftermath of a bereavement. It is payable to widows and widowers with dependent children who qualify for a Widow/er's Contributory Pension or a One Parent Family Payment or a Bereavement Grant payable on the death of their spouse. In the Budget, earlier this month, I increased the rate of the Widowed Parent Grant from €2,700, to €4,000 with effect from Budget day, 6 December 2006.Where a spouse or partner dies while receiving a social welfare payment, the payment is paid to the spouse or partner for 6 weeks after the date of death (provided the original payment included an increase in respect of their spouse or partner). This continued payment provides a financial buffer to the surviving spouse, in the period after the bereavement. This payment is generally paid as a lump sum. Guardian's (Formerly Orphans) Contributory or Non-Contributory Payments may also be payable in the case of bereavement where there is a dependent child, i.e., to age 18 or 22 years if in full-time education.In order to ensure that people avail of their entitlements, my Department produces a comprehensive range of information leaflets that are available countrywide in Local Offices, Citizen's Information Centres and Post Offices. Information Officers are available in Local Offices to explain the supports and services to customers on a one to one basis and to help and assist them in completing forms and assessing their entitlements. Information relating to social welfare entitlements is also available on my Department's web site at www.welfare.ie and from the Citizens Information Board (formerly Comhairle) at www.citizensinformation.ie. A LO-CALL number is also available nationwide to provide access to information at local call rates at 1890 777121. I am satisfied that a comprehensive range of measures, financial and otherwise, is in place to respond to the support needs of bereaved people.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	623	Since taking Office this Government has made the needs of older people a priority and the commitment to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for contributory pensions is at the core of this policy.  In this context, changes have been made to the qualifying conditions for pension which make it easier for people to qualify for pensions.  These include the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to 10 and the introduction of pro-rata pensions and a number of special half-rate pensions for those who had marginally failed to qualify for contributory pensions.I consider it important that those who wish to continue in employment after normal retirement age should, as far as is possible, be facilitated and supported.   Longer working can play an important role in ensuring that our pensions system is sustainable in the future and can be beneficial to the individual.  For this reason, and to improve income support for older people, the new enhanced State pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years which I introduced at the end of September, featured an employment earnings disregard incentive of €100 per week for those who wish to earn extra income to continue in employment.   I was happy to enhance this incentive to €200 per week in last week's Budget.In a wider context, The National Pensions Review, published in January, includes recommendations from the Pensions Board designed to encourage people to continue working after normal retirement age.  The measures suggested involve allowing people to defer receiving their social welfare pension at normal pension age and to grant them an actuarially enhanced payment when they claim. The Pensions Board also considered that if this was combined with allowing those with less than full entitlements to count contributions made after age 65 or 66 in order to improve their contribution record, this would complete the incentives for longer working within the social welfare pensions system. I am in broad agreement with the suggestions and will be seeking to have them introduced as soon as is practical.However, issues surrounding social welfare payments represent only one aspect of the problem. As I have said before, we require a change in attitudes in relation to longer working from both employers and employees. Employers must seek to retain older employees and create the conditions which will make longer working both attractive and feasible for older workers.With regard to pensions generally, the Government is committed to producing a Green Paper on pensions as part of the new social partnership agreement Towards 2016 with a view to developing a framework for future pensions policy.  This will include an examination of the issues surrounding retirement age and the barriers faced by older workers who wish to remain in employment.   The Green Paper will be published within months.  A consultation process will then take place and the Government will subsequently publish a framework for future pensions policy.

Applications for the allowance may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year. While the closing date for applications for BSCFA was 30th September 2006, processing and payment of late applications remained ongoing during November. Current indications are that about 84,800 families with approximately 172,000 children will benefit from the scheme this year at a cost of €25.4m. This is an increase on the 2005 figures when some 76,166 families with 157,254 children benefited at a cost of €16.7m.Based on information received to date the average number of successful applications in 2006 was 89.9% of all applications received. The estimated number of applications refused in 2006 is 19,323 (10.1%) out of applications made in respect of over 191,000 children. In previous years, the national average number of applications granted was 88.3% of all applications received.The BSCFA is a demand led scheme and statistics are not available on the take-up by families who might satisfy the qualifying conditions for the allowance but who have not applied. The Department has increased its publicity in this area to ensure that as many families as possible are aware of the scheme and further awareness initiatives will be undertaken in 2007.Final figures in relation to the numbers of applications received and awarded for 2006 are not yet available from the HSE. Current indications are that the number of applications received has increased nationwide. This can be mainly attributed to improvements in income disregards introduced this year, and the significant level of publicity given to this scheme in the media and through the other information services operated by my Department.Applications for the allowance may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year. This period was designated as it is the time that parents are preparing and budgeting for back to school expenditure. As the principal objective of the scheme is to assist eligible families with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn, the most practical time to implement the scheme is in the lead up to each new academic year. In dealing with the large volume of applications received, the Health Service Executive deploys additional staffing resources for the duration of the scheme during the June to September period. In the case of late applications exceptional needs payments under the SWA scheme may be paid where warranted.Extending the deadline for applications for back to school clothing and footwear allowance would have some scheme and administrative costs and there would be little or no gain to the public. I consider the existing period of application to be adequate and targeted in meeting the demand. In previous years, the national average number of applications made after the end of September was 1.5% of all applications received. Based on information received to date the number of applications received in 2006 after the end of September is approximately 2,600 or 1.4% of all applications received. These have been either processed under BSCFA or as claims for an Exceptional Needs Payment (ENP). From June 2006, an allowance of €120 was payable in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years, or €190 in respect of qualified children aged from 12 to 22 years.As announced in Budget 2007, the rate of payment of BSCFA is being increased by €60 per child for children aged 2 to 11 years old and €95 for children aged 12 to 22 — a 50% increase on the current allowance. The new rates (applicable for 2007) are €180 for children aged 2 to 11 years old and €285 for children aged 12 to 22. The annual expenditure on the scheme will increase to €38.1m as a result of this measure (€12.71m + €25.4m). The number of children that will benefit in 2007 is expected to be similar to 2006.These improvements in BSCFA are very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends. According to the Consumer Price Index for October 2006, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by 1.7% over the past twelve months. Since December 2001, clothing and footwear costs have decreased by 15.4%.I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain. I am satisfied that the improvements to the scheme for this year and next year provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.The school meals programme operated by my Department gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes. The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, currently operated by 36 local authorities. The second is the school meals community (local projects) programme through which funding is provided by my Department to participating schools and voluntary community groups in both urban and rural areas who are running specific school meals projects, including breakfast clubs.The Department of Education and Science has initiated a new action plan "Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools" (DEIS) which incorporates many of that Department's existing schemes which target educational disadvantage including schools with the highest concentration of early school leavers. A total of 875 schools were identified by the Department of Education and Science as disadvantaged under the (DEIS) action plan. Over 400 of these schools are already receiving school meal funding. The remaining schools have been contacted by my Department and invited to apply for funding. The additional €3m funding announced in the recent budget will allow for the current number of participating schools to be increased by over 200 additional disadvantaged DEIS schools which will benefit an estimated 20,000 extra children in 2007.The school meals programme makes an important contribution to ensuring that school children receive better nutrition and contributes to improved school attendance and quality of learning. All relevant research indicates that there is a strong link between nutritional intake and cognitive ability and that inadequate nutrition impacts negatively on a child's ability to learn and benefit from education. The scheme also supports initiatives that target dispersed disadvantage and children with special needs.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	626	Budget 2007 introduced a package of measures costing €300 million aimed at alleviating child poverty.  By channelling income support in a number of ways, this package of measures is designed to balance the need to provide support universally through child benefit, with targeting those most in need by increasing child dependant allowances, family income supplement, back to school clothing and footwear allowance and school meals.In addition to child benefit increases of €10 per month at a cost of €243.70 in a full year, all three child dependant allowances will also be increased and consolidated into a new single rate of €22.00 per week. This increase, the first in 12 years, will benefit approximately 342,000 children at a cost of €56.13 million in a full year and represents a more selective approach to child income support through its targeting of children in poorer households, while at the same time limiting the extent to which employment incentives are worsened.Family income supplement income thresholds have been increased in this Budget to add from €9 (for a one child family) to €111 (for a family with eight or more children) to weekly payments of almost all existing FIS recipients. This will increase the average payment, per child, to €50 a week.  Research has shown that poverty is more likely to be concentrated in larger families and in this context the new FIS thresholds, while substantially increasing all payments, concentrate additional resources on larger families. This improvement, costing an estimated €32m, continues the re-focusing of thresholds towards larger families which started in Budget 2006, thereby further targeting resources at low-income households.  As a result, average FIS payments in 2007 will approach €50 per week per child.Back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) is designed to assist recipients of social welfare, health service executive payments and similar schemes in meeting the costs of school uniforms and footwear. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but to provide assistance towards these costs, where people are on low incomes.Provisional figures for 2006 indicate that some 172,000 children benefited from this scheme in 2006 at a cost of €25.4 million.  This is an increase on 2005, when some 76,200 families with 157,300 children benefited at a cost of €16.7m. This increase can be mainly attributed to improvements in income disregards introduced this year and the significant level of publicity given to this scheme in the media and through the other information services operated by my Department.As announced in Budget 2007, the rate of payment of BSCFA is being increased by €60 per child for children aged 2 to 11 years old and €95 for children aged 12 to 22. This represents a 50% increase on the current allowance, bringing rates to €180 and €285 respectively, and will provide a considerable boost to families at a time of considerable expense in the year.  The annual expenditure on the scheme is expected to exceed €38.million as a result of this measure.The school meals programme operated by my Department provides funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes.  The first is the long-standing statutory urban school meals scheme, currently operated by 36 local authorities.  The Department jointly funds the food costs with these local authorities, who also manage and fund the administration of the scheme.  The second is the school meals community (local projects) programme through which funding is provided by my Department to participating schools and voluntary community groups in both urban and rural areas who are running specific school meals projects, including breakfast clubs.The purpose of funding is to assist disadvantaged children in gaining maximum benefit from educational services.  Many of the schools that are currently receiving funding are also in RAPID (Revitalising Areas by Planning, Investment and Development) areas.  The school meals programme has been expanding into additional schools each year.  Expenditure has increased from €4.6m in 2004 to €8.2m in 2005.  The expenditure outturn for the scheme for 2006 will be of the order of €13.6m.  This clearly demonstrates the ongoing expansion of the scheme. In 2006, the total number of schools availing of funding (under both schemes) has increased to almost 1,400 while the numbers of pupils benefiting has increased to over 125,000.  The additional funding of €3m in 2007 will allow for the current number of participating schools to be increased by over 200, benefiting an estimated 20,000 extra children.The school meals programme makes an important contribution to ensuring that school children receive better nutrition and contributes to improved school attendance and quality of learning.   The scheme also supports initiatives that target dispersed disadvantage and children with special needs.  All relevant research indicates that there is a strong link between nutritional intake and cognitive ability and that inadequate nutrition impacts negatively on a child's ability to learn and benefit from education.

Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have been greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have been significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs Report on the position of full time carers which was published in 2003 makes fifteen recommendations.  Some of these relate specifically to my Department and others relate specifically to the Department of Health and Children.  The report recommended that the means test of carer's allowance should be abolished.  In line with other social assistance schemes, a means test is applied to the carer's allowance so as to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need. This means test has been eased significantly over the years most notably with the disregard of spouse's earnings.Following Budget 2006, since April, the earnings disregard for a couple has been set at €580 per week which is equivalent to gross average industrial earnings.  As a result of further improvements which I announced in the Budget 2007 this disregard will increase to €640 per week for a couple from April 2007.  When this increase is in place a couple with two children will be able to earn up to €36,240 and still qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the commitment in Towards 2016 to ensure that those on average industrial earnings can continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.  Another of the major recommendations of the report was that where a person who is in receipt of a widow/er's pension and providing someone with full time care and attention, that person should be paid a half rate carer's allowance in addition to his or her pension.In Budget 2007 I was very pleased to introduce fundamental structural reforms in this area which go beyond the Joint Committee's recommendation. In future, people in receipt of another social welfare payment who are also providing full-time care and attention to a person will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be the equivalent of a half rate carer's allowance.   It is estimated that approximately 18,000 carers will benefit by up to €109 per week from this measure at a cost of €56.72 million in a full year.  The precise details regarding how this new arrangement will operate are being examined and will be set out in legislation early next year.In Budget 2006 I extended the duration of Carer's Benefit from 15 to 24 months.  This is in line with the report which recommended that the 15 month restriction be waived where the person continues to provide care.The recommended extension of the respite care grant to people in receipt of a social welfare payment other than carer's allowance or benefit and who are providing someone with full time care and attention was implemented in Budget 2005.  That improvement went beyond the report's recommendation in that the respite care grant was extended to all full time carers regardless of means.With regard to the provision of information to carers,  my Department provided the Carer's Association with a grant to assist them in producing an information pack for carers.  I was very pleased to launch that very comprehensive pack during the summer.  In addition, my Department has recently run an information campaign in relation to the income supports available for carers.  This involved a week-long media campaign which included advertisements on radio, television and in the print media.Another of the report's recommendations was that a national strategy for carers should be developed.  I am delighted that one of the key Government commitments in the national partnership agreement Towards 2016 is the development of a National Carer's Strategy.  This strategy, which will focus on supporting informal and family carers in the community, will be developed by the end of 2007.  All relevant departments and agencies will be involved in the strategy and there will be appropriate consultation with the social partners.I am committed to working for, and with, carers to deliver increased benefits, supports, and services for them and their families.  The improvements for carers which I announced in Budget 2007 are further evidence of this commitment.

It is neutral  vis-à-vis the employment status of the child’s parents and maximises choice for parents. Child benefit is paid monthly in advance to over 561,000 families is respect of over 1,080,000 children.  At present there are no plans to move child benefit to a weekly payment.  It should be noted that CB is paid in advance and if payments were made on a weekly basis the recipient would receive most payments at a later date than is now the case. A move to weekly payments would also have significant administrative implications, including additional costs.

This includes an increase of €20 per week in the basic rate of payment, plus increases in Child Benefit as well as improvements in the rates of qualified child allowance and the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  As I have said many times, the best route out of poverty is through employment and on foot of this year's Government discussion paper on lone parents, work is now progressing on a number of initiatives aimed at improving the employment opportunities of lone parents and parents on low income.A sub-group of the Senior Officials Group on Social Inclusion is currently working on a plan to implement proposals for the expanded availability and range of education and training opportunities for lone parents; the extension of the National Employment Action Plan to focus on lone parents; focused provision of childcare and improved information services for lone parents. In addition, my Department is currently preparing proposals for Government for the introduction of a new social assistance payment for low income families including lone parents with young children. This new payment will have the long term aim of assisting people to achieve financial independence through supporting them to enter employment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	630	Last September, I established a new pension scheme, the State Pension Non-Contributory, for persons aged 66 and over. As part of this reform, I increased the basic income disregard for the purposes of the means test for non-contributory pensions to €20 per week.   At the same time, I introduced incentives for those pensioners who may wish to continue in employment, or return to employment, by introducing a new disregard on earnings of €100 per week.In Budget 2007, I was happy to be able to: deliver a pension of €200 per week as promised in the Government commitment; build on the reforms I introduced last year by increasing the basic means disregard to €30 per week; and increase the earnings disregard to €200 per week.   These measures will benefit approximately 26,000 pensioners, including many farmers, from January 5 next. As a consequence, in addition to the €18 increase in non-contributory  personal rate a further increase of  up to €10 per week will apply while the Qualified Adult rate will be further increased by up to €6.60 per week. These increases are on top of the €18 per week provided for non-contributory pensioners generally.It should also be noted that special arrangements also apply for pensioner farmers who participate in the REPS and SACS schemes. The first €2,540 of all income from these schemes is not assessable for means test purposes and 50% of any balance is assessed. Any expenses necessarily incurred to participate in these schemes are also disregarded.I am satisfied that the measures introduced in Budget 2007 will ensure that the living standards of all non-contributory pensioners, including farmer pensioners, are greatly enhanced and I have no proposals to introduce further changes at this time.

In this context and to deal with this work programme as efficiently as possible, a number of key related ICT programmes have been identified for investment over the next few years. These programmes are: The Customer Object project; The Public Service Identity (PSI) services projects; and The Standard Authentication Framework Environment (SAFE) projects.The ultimate aim of these programmes is to improve the service my Department provides to its customers and to support similar initiatives by other Departments.My Department is engaged in a strategic programme which involves moving from individual scheme based systems to a more customer-centric approach. This includes examining our customers' future needs in the context of improving service delivery and involves supporting improved access to the Department's services, by either proactively contacting customer for example, when they are coming up to pension age. It also opens up opportunities to use other contact channels such as the phone or online channels.The Customer Object project will see the redevelopment of the Department's Central Records System and other systems and their migration from the current ICT platform to a new platform. It is planned to support business improvements in the areas of customer registration and claim processing with these technical enhancements. To illustrate the potential of this programme, early work in this area resulted in the automation of the child benefit application process, eliminating the need for multiple form-filling and visits to offices.The purpose of the PSI Services project is to make a subset of relevant customer related information available to appropriately authorised agencies. Among the advantages to the customer of this change is a reduced need to supply information repeatedly when seeking public services, while advantages to the agencies concerned include increased certainty regarding the identity of the person they are dealing with. The initial project, delivered through Reach, underpins the use of the PPS Number for the PAYE On-line initiative introduced earlier this year by the Revenue Commissioners. It is proposed to carry out further work to make similar facilities securely available to other agencies.My Department is also responsible for the issue of the Public Service Card. It is working with the Department of Finance to develop a framework for the deployment of public service cards. This programme of work is known as SAFE (Standard Authentication Framework Environment). It is planned to issue new cards to replace the existing Social Welfare Card, commencing in late 2007, primarily to beneficiaries of the free travel scheme. The new card will include a number of improvements and better security features.

These measures include combining three rates of Child Dependant Allowance payments into a new single high rate Qualified Child Allowance of €22 per week that will benefit over 340,000 children of families on welfare. I am also increasing the rate of Child Benefit by €10 per week. This increase will apply to all children benefiting over 560,000 families in respect of approximately 1,134,000 children, and will be effective from April 2007.The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance provides additional income support for the poorest families at a particularly difficult time of the year. With this in mind, I am increasing the allowance by €60 for children aged 2 to 11, and by €95 for children aged 12 to 22, bringing the rates of payment to €180 and €285 respectively.  I have also made provision for additional funding of €3 million to extend the School Meals Programme.Other budgetary measures, such as the €20 per week increase in the lowest social welfare rate to €185.80 and increases in the earnings thresholds for One Parent Family Payment and Family Income Supplement, will also indirectly benefit children living in poorer households.  The package of measures for children and families in Budget 2006 is in addition to recent initiatives such as the new €1,000 a year early childcare supplement for all children under 6 years and the creation of additional childcare places.In addition to these provisions, preparation of a new National Action Plan for Social Inclusion is currently being coordinated by the Office for Social Inclusion in my Department for launch early in the New Year. Building on the social inclusion provisions in the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, the Plan will adopt a lifecycle approach by assessing the risks which individuals face at each stage of the life cycle and the supports they need to effectively meet these risks. The groups focused on using this approach are Children, People of Working Age, Older People and People with Disabilities.  This strategic framework is also being designed to create more coherent and integrated structures that will greatly assist in achieving more effective implementation of the plan. It is also expected to facilitate better and more effective reporting and monitoring across the spectrum of government activity in the area of social inclusion.  Ending child poverty remains a key priority for this Government and for me personally as Minister for Social and Family Affairs.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	633	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes rent supplement, is administered on my behalf by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.  The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support, in the form of a weekly or monthly payment, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.The number of tenants benefiting from rent supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme has increased by over 10% since 2002.  At the end of 2005 there were just over 60,000 people in receipt of a supplement, at an annual expenditure of just under €370m.  Average weekly payment in 2002 was €94.88 increasing to €101.77 in 2005.  At the end of November 2006, the number of beneficiaries has reduced to 59,807 with the average weekly payment at €103.13.  Details of the number of recipients and expenditure for each of the respective years 2002 to 2006 are provided in the attached tabular statement.The scheme has developed beyond the original objective of providing short-term assistance with accommodation. A significant number of people have now come to rely on rent supplementation for extended periods, including people on local authority housing lists.   For this reason, the scheme has to be viewed in the context of overall housing policy, particularly in the case of long-term claimants.In response to this situation, the Government has introduced new rental assistance arrangements including the rental accommodation scheme (RAS) giving local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more, on a phased implementation basis.  When fully operational, local authorities will meet the housing needs of these individuals through a range of approaches including the traditional range of social housing options, the voluntary housing sector and, in particular, a new public/private partnership type rental accommodation scheme.The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has indicated that at the end of November 2006 almost 2,600 tenants have been accommodated under the Rental Accommodation Scheme and a further 1,900 families accommodated in Social Housing. It is projected that by the end of 2006, between 4,500 and 5,000 tenants will have transferred from rent supplement to accommodation provided by local authorities either through the RAS or some other type of social housing, rising to 10,000 by the end of 2007.YearRecipientsAnnual ExpenditureAverage Weekly Supplement% paid weeklyAverage Monthly Supplement% paid monthly€m200254,213252.3494.8878651.6522200359,976331.4797.0775715.9625200457,874353.76100.0072752.9128200560,176368.70101.7771768.47291/12/0659,807*323.66103.1371768.2529* End October 2006.

Fuel allowances are paid for 29 weeks from end-September to mid-April. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full. Improvements to the fuel allowance in recent years include an easing of the means test, extending the duration of payment from 26 to 29 weeks and a doubling of the rate of payment in the last two budgets. In Budget 2007, I have provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of €4 from €14 to €18 (€21.90 in designated smokeless areas) and I have also increased the income threshold for eligibility to fuel allowance by €49 from €51 to €100 above the state pension (contributory) rate.Some 274,000 people will benefit in 2006 at an estimated annual cost €125m. As a consequence of the increase in rate announced in the recent budget, annual expenditure on the scheme in 2007 will increase by €31.8m to €156.9m. Just over 89,500 of the 274,000 people in receipt of fuel allowance are recipients of a state pension contributory or non-contributory scheme. Statistics are not available on the number of fuel allowance applications refused on the basis of a non-qualifying family member residing with the claimant.The main conditions that apply to the fuel allowance scheme are that a person must be in receipt of a qualifying payment, satisfy a means test and must either be living alone or only with a qualifying dependant. The household composition and means test rules for fuel allowance scheme qualifying purposes is to ascertain the ability of applicant households to meet their normal heating requirements out of their own resources and to ensure that the maximum amount of support is targeted at those most in need of the fuel allowance support.People who already qualify for means-tested pensions or allowances such as state pension (non-contributory), long-term jobseeker's assistance or one-parent family payment do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for fuel allowance. The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment. In the case of contributory pensions such as state pension (contributory), state pension (transition) and invalidity pensions, which are not means tested, from January 2007 a person may have a combined household income of up to €100 per week, over and above the maximum state pension (contributory) rate (or savings/investments of up to €58,000) and still qualify for fuel allowance. The fuel allowance income limits increase each season in line with the increases in the state pension (contributory) rate.Some 340,000 pensioner and other households qualify for electricity or gas allowances through the household benefits package, payable towards their heating, light and cooking costs throughout the year, at an overall cost of €119 million in 2006.  From 1 January 2007 the Electricity Allowance is being increased from 1,800 units to 2,400 units including normal standing charges and VAT with a pro-rata increase applied on the gas effective from October 2006. In effect, the cash value of these allowances was set at €516 per annum from October 2006 for gas customers and from January 2007 for electricity customers. An additional annual increase of €33 will also be applied to those ESB customers who pay the higher rate rural standing charges, bringing the total cash value of the allowance in their case to €549 per annum.Following the latest downward price adjustment for electricity announced by CER on 4 December 2006, I have decided to maintain the value of the allowances at €516 per annum and €549 for rural electricity customers which will further increase the value of the allowance to customers through the provision of additional units for the same price outlay. These improvements represent an immediate response by the Government to concerns arising regarding increases in energy costs experienced during the year.The increase in the rate of fuel allowance to €18 per week as announced as part of Budget 2007 will provide over 274,000 people currently entitled to the allowance with additional help towards meeting their heating costs. The increase in the income threshold to €100 above the maximum state pension (contributory) will allow more people to qualify for fuel allowance. Up to 8,000 additional people are expected to qualify for fuel allowance as a result. Fuel allowances are incorporated in the recipient's weekly social welfare payment. The Government's objective is to ensure that the recipient's total weekly income, including the fuel allowance, is sufficient to meet all of their income needs, including heating costs.Budget resources are concentrated on providing significant real increases over and above inflation each year in all primary social welfare pension, benefit and assistance rates. The increases of €16 and €18 per week in the rates of payment for contributory and non-contributory pensions respectively announced in the recent budget is a continuation of this policy. (This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowances as the increase is paid for the full year and not just for the 29 weeks of the winter heating season). This approach delivers a good outcome for pensioners and others by substantially increasing their income in real terms over the whole year, to better assist them in meeting their normal basic living costs, including heating. Income maintenance measures for social welfare recipients are significant with rates of payments increased in the context of each budget strategy.At the proposed 2007 fuel allowance rate of €18, an increase of two weeks, four weeks and eight weeks in the duration of the fuel season would cost an extra €10.8m, €21.6 and €43.2m per annum respectively. I will continue to monitor the scheme to ensure it reaches those most in need.

Family  mediation assists separating couples to look at the resources and options open to them and to reach an agreement that meets the interests of both and the interests of their children.The Family Mediation Service has a total of sixteen centres nationally. There are full-time Family Mediation Service centres in Cork, Galway, Limerick and Earlsfort Terrace in Dublin and part-time Family Mediation Service centres in Athlone, Castlebar, Dundalk, Letterkenny, Portlaoise, Sligo, Tralee, Waterford, Wexford and Blanchardstown, Marino and Tallaght in Dublin.  There are 26 professionally trained mediators working for the service all accredited by the Mediators Institute Ireland, the professional accrediting body for mediators in Ireland.Demand for the Family Mediation Service has always been strong and the expansion of the Service from 2 offices in 1997 to its present number of 16 reflects this Government's commitment to provide a nationwide service. Up to the end of November 2006, the Family Mediation Service has helped 1,480 couples this year. The total number helped in 2005 was 1,430.This year, I opened two new centres, one in Letterkenny to enhance accessibility to the service in the North West and one in Portlaoise to similarly expand the service in the Midlands. In addition, the Service has recently opened a new pilot part-time office in Ballymun to deal with an increased demand in that particular area. The Service has also increased the opening hours in a number of the part-time centres around the country in order to continue to meet demand and reduce waiting times.I am pleased that funding for the Family Mediation Service in 2007 will be increased to €3.9 million from €3.7 million this year. This increase will help the Service to continue to meet its demand.

The report addressed whether and to what extent the Irish system of indirect taxation, namely VAT and excise duties, is regressive. The report outlines that over the period 2000 to 2005, the share of total Current Exchequer Revenues represented by VAT and excises duties combined has remained unchanged at 44.5%.The authors concluded that the indirect tax system appears to be regressive in the sense that households in the lowest decile pay a higher proportion of their income in indirect taxes relative to households in the higher deciles.  However, they also noted that the indirect tax system includes some elements of progressivity such as low tax rates on food and fuel and zero tax rates on children's clothes and footwear.  They also pointed out that changes to some tax elements could have negative effects elsewhere. For example, lowering taxes on drink and tobacco could have a negative health impact. In conclusion, the authors do not recommend adjustments to indirect taxes.Over the period since 1997, the Government has greatly increased the levels of income support provided through the social welfare system and this was again evident in the increases announced last week as part of Budget 2007.  In this Budget, the personal and qualified adult rates of payment were increased by unprecedented amounts. The lowest rates of social welfare payments were increased by €20 per week to €185.80, or by 12.1%. This increase is nearly 3 times the expected rate of inflation next year and, therefore, improves and enhances the living standards of all recipients.Since 1997, the lowest rates of welfare payments have increased by almost 117%, well ahead of the 53% accumulated inflation over that period. In addition, the Budget included a child support package of nearly €244 million which involved major improvements for low-income families and for single parent families.  We now have delivered, on time and as promised, on our commitments in the Programme for Government by bringing the basic State Pension to €200 a week and realising the 2007 target for the lowest social welfare rates.  The 2007 Budget package is a strong statement of this Government's commitment to the elderly, children and all those who, for one reason or another, are more vulnerable in our society.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	637	Family income supplement is designed to provide support for people on low earnings with child dependants and provide the incentive for them to remain in, or take up, employment.  Recent improvements to family income supplement include the change of assessment from a gross income basis to net income, the increase to €20 per week in the minimum payment and, in Budget 2007, the continued re-focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.The improved income thresholds which I announced in Budget 2007 will result in increased average weekly payments for most FIS recipients from €76 (for a one child family) to €392 (for a family with eight or more children), and will also make an estimated 5,600 additional families eligible for a full FIS payment. This will increase the average payment, per child, to €50 a week.  The cost of this measure is estimated at €32 million per annum, while the additional cost of paying family income supplement at the 70% differential in a full year is estimated at some €23 million.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	638	Since taking office this Government has made the needs of older people a priority with the inclusion of several commitments in the Programme for Government aimed specifically at the group.  I am very pleased to say that we have delivered on the commitment to increase the state pension to €200 per week by 2007.   In addition, the State pension (contributory) has been increased by €16 per week to €209.30 per week.  Pension increases have been well ahead of inflation thus ensuring that not only is the real value of pensions maintained but that they are significantly improved in real terms.  For instance, since 1996, and including the budget increases, pensions have increased by almost 119%, or about 57% in real terms, faster than both price and wages growth over the period.The State pension (non-contributory) is a social assistance scheme which, in common with all other such schemes, features a means test to ensure that resources committed to social assistance payments are used to provide support to and improve the position of those who are most in need.  The new enhanced State pension (non-contributory) for those over 66 years which I introduced at the end of September, features significant improvements in the means test and an incentive of  €100 per week of earnings disregarded for pensioners who may wish to earn extra income to continue in employment.  I was happy to be able to build on these improvements in last week's Budget by increasing the basic means disregard to €30 per week, and at the same time enhancing the employment incentives by increasing the earnings disregard to €200 per week.   Both of these disregards are doubled for pensioner couples.Other measures of benefit to older people include last years' increase in the over 80 allowance of €3.60 per week, bringing it to €10 per week and this years' increase in the fuel allowance of  €4 per week, bringing the allowance to €18 per week. This represents a doubling of the fuel allowance in the last two years.  The household benefits package, which comprises telephone allowance, electricity/natural gas allowance and free TV licence is available to people living in the State aged 66 to 69 years subject to certain conditions, and to over 70's.   The electricity/natural gas allowance is of immense benefit to older people who have in general greater heating requirements.  As already announced, the value of the natural gas allowance has been increased and the number of free units of electricity will increase by 600 units a year to 2,400 units.The additional supports, combined with the unprecedented increases in pension rates demonstrate that the needs of older people continue to be a priority for this Government. I will continue to look for opportunities to make further progress on improving the level of supports we provide for our older people.

Research and Policy Perspectives on Young Carers" by Barnardos and The Children's Research Centre, which was published in September 2004. I was particularly struck by the fact that, of the estimated 3,000 young carers who are providing some care, there are over 300 carers between the ages of 15 and 17 years of age who are providing full-time care. It is clear that this group needs appropriate supports.I recognise that special help, advice and support is essential for young carers who are often caring for a parent and, in particular, that services must be put in place to support the household and to ensure that young carers remain at school. The Barnardos report recommends that policy relating to young carers should be a matter for the Department of Health and Children with services being delivered by the Health Service Executive.  These include the services of home helps, public health nurses and home care packages generally.  The report considers that further research should be undertaken on numbers of young carers, the supports available to them, their needs and the impact of their caring role on their education and general development.I am pleased that the national partnership agreement "Towards 2016" commits the Government to undertaking a study (with the involvement of relevant Departments) of the extent to which children undertake inappropriate care roles in order to establish the extent and degree to which this issue arises and the levels of impact it has on the lives of children concerned.  Based on the outcome of this study and an analysis of the issues identified, a programme of in-home supports will be developed to alleviate specific problem areas identified for children.The report of the Long-Term Care working group is being considered by the Government. This Group was established by the Minister for Health and Children and myself in January 2005 to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care. It comprises senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and my own Department. My officials have brought the issue of young carers to the attention of the working group.Supports for carers from my own Department include the respite care grant and the carers's allowance. The respite care grant, which is an annual payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention, is payable from age 16. The payment is made regardless of the carer's means but it is subject to certain qualifying conditions.  The grant from will increase from €1,200 to €1,500 per year from June 2007. Carer's allowance, which provides income support to people who are providing certain older people or people with a disability with full time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit, is payable from age 18.I am always prepared to consider changes to existing arrangements where these are for the benefit of recipients and financially sustainable within the resources available to me.  I will continue to strive to bring forward proposals that recognise the valued and valuable contribution of all carers in a tangible way.

The first report an "Options Paper, presented by the Working Group on Domestic Partnership" to the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, focuses on different types of cohabiting relationships, both same and opposite sex and presents a range of options with regard to giving legal recognition to these relationships. Officials from my Department contributed to the work of this Group.  The second report — the "Report of the Law Reform Commission on the Rights and Duties of Cohabitants" makes substantial recommendations for reform of the law concerning cohabitants including both opposite sex or same sex couples who live together.These reports come at a time of wide public debate on the question of according legal status to cohabitants generally and same sex couples in particular and will contribute to the informed debate on these important topics.  In addition my own Department is currently carrying out a technical review of the entire social welfare code to examine its compatibility with the Equal Status Act 2000 (as amended).  The review will examine the schemes and services provided for both in social welfare legislation and the administrative schemes operated by the Department. It will identify any instances of direct or indirect discrimination, on any of the nine grounds under the Act, including: gender, sexual orientation, marital status and family status that are not justified by a legitimate social policy objective or where the means of achieving that objective are either unnecessary or inappropriate. This work, together with the reports I have referred to, will contribute to informed planning and policy making to ensure that the social welfare system reflects the needs and expectations of citizens and is equitable in meeting those needs.

There were 56,343 claiming Jobseekers Benefit, 82,713 claiming Jobseekers Allowance and other registrants amounting to 9,473.  This is the lowest November Live Register since November 2001, when it was 147,100. The Live Register stood at 150,073 at end-November 2005, so it can be seen that there has been a reduction of 1,544 in the year.My Department through its employment support and other services has assisted many people away from long-term unemployment and back into the workforce.  The primary role of my Department's locally based facilitators is to assist the unemployed and other welfare dependants back to work, training or further education by providing them on an individual basis with assistance to access the necessary programmes or supports which their circumstances demand.  Facilitators have access to some additional services, such as the special projects and family services funds which provide funding for specialised training and supports for those who are distant from the labour market and who need additional help in preparing them for further training and employment. The back to work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to assist the long term unemployed to return to the active labour force.My Department also administers the back to education allowance or BTEA which is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force.  In the recent budget I announced that I would extend immediate entitlement to BTEA to people who have been made redundant and who have an entitlement to statutory redundancy payments and to a social welfare payment. They will have an immediate access to BTEA to prevent long term dependency on unemployment payments.  In addition, under the Employment Action Plan (EAP), customers, aged 18 to 64 years, who are approaching 3 months on the Live Register, are systematically referred to FÁS for guidance, intervention or placement.The services provided by my Department to assist the unemployed, particularly their continued relevance and flexibility, are under constant review.  I am particularly interested in advancing measures that blend activation with supports and that make the transition from welfare to work as seamless as possible.

The FRC programme provides financial assistance to projects to assist with the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities.  The emphasis in the projects is on the involvement of local communities in developing approaches to tackle the problems they face and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the areas concerned. The services provided and activities supported by the resource centres are designed to meet the needs of the local community and include the provision of training, information, advice and support to target groups and families in the area; the provision of education courses, childcare facilities to those attending such courses and the running of after-school clubs.Family Resource Centres are an example of the kind of community initiative which the Government is keen to develop, focusing as they do on family support and social inclusion.  For this reason I am pleased to say that the target set by the Government under the 2000-2006 National Development Plan of including 100 Family Resource Centres in the FRC Programme nationwide by the end of 2006 has been delivered on. There are currently 96 centres in receipt of core funding by the Family Support Agency with a further 4 having received approval to join the Programme. Funding under the Programme has increased substantially from €317,500 in 1994 to over €12.9 million in 2006.

I am satisfied that the Amnesty, which resulted in the surrender of 1,002 weapons, has been a success and fully achieved its aims.The purpose of the amnesty was to afford people an opportunity to hand in illegally held weapons at their local Garda Station before the introduction of new more stringent sentences for firearms offences which I provided for in the Criminal Justice Act, 2006.  I was never of the view that large numbers of hardened criminals were going to hand over their weapons.  Such criminals can only be dealt with by applying the full rigour of the law; they are and will continue to be pursued relentlessly and brought to justice.  However, I did believe that there were people who had unlicensed guns and offensive weapons in their homes, who would have found it difficult to come forward or to admit that they had such weapons, and that an amnesty would afford them an opportunity to surrender their weapons safely before the introduction of the new minimum mandatory sentences provided for under the 2006 Act.  I was glad to see so many people avail of the opportunity before I introduced the minimum mandatory sentences provisions on 1st November, 2006.One cannot draw a valid comparison between the recent Amnesty here and the Swedish Amnesty in 1993.  Under the Swedish Amnesty persons were allowed to hand in illegally held guns anonymously and no questions were asked, neither were those surrendering weapons required to present any form of identification or asked for their names.  The basis of our Amnesty, and one which all parties agreed with in the course of the passage of the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 through the Oireachtas, was that persons would be required to give their name and address when surrendering weapons, that the weapons surrendered would be forensically tested and where a surrendered weapon was found to have been used in the commission of a crime both the weapon and forensic evidence could be used in evidence in any subsequent proceedings.  To provide otherwise would, in my view, allow for the possibility that criminals would avail of the Amnesty to "dump" weapons used in the commission of crime thus making it more difficult to secure prosecutions in some cases.

Arising from this investigation, three persons were prosecuted, and they were subsequently acquitted by the Courts.  I facilitated a briefing of a representative of the family and his legal adviser in this matter by the Garda Síochána in particular by a leading member of the investigation team who shares my view the matter was fully investigated by the Gardaí at the time and that no new evidence is likely to become available.I am aware of and sympathise with the continuing concerns of the family.  However, I remain unconvinced that any further practical step is open to me which would be likely to alter the outcome in this case.

Headline crime statistics have not yet been published in the manner requested by the Deputy.Following the submission to me in 2004 of a report and recommendations by an expert group on crime statistics, I decided that the compilation, production and publication of crime statistics should be taken over by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, from the Garda Síochána.  The Garda Síochána Act, 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO established a dedicated Unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, I am pleased to note that the CSO are now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and have published the figures for the third quarter of this year.I understand that the CSO is examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.

In 2006 to date there have been 24 murders with firearms, of which eight were detected and five have proceedings commenced.   Operation Anvil is central to the strategy of the Garda Síochána in combating serious crime and in particular murder.  The Operation, which commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in May, 2005 and was subsequently extended nationwide at my request, has proved to be very successful in disrupting the criminal activities of a number of key criminal gangs.  It has resulted in a number of high-profile arrests and the acquisition of intelligence on the movements of criminals.  Notable improvements have been achieved in the recorded number of incidents of crime being targeted by the Operation.The most recent figures available to me show that since the introduction of Operation Anvil in May 2005, 549 firearms have been seized in the Dublin Metropolitan Region. Up to 19 November, Operation Anvil has resulted in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in more than 3,350  arrests for the serious crimes of murder, robbery, burglary and serious assaults, including 56 arrests in connection with murder.  Outside the DMR and up to 1 November, 2,600 persons have been arrested and 238 firearms seized.In addition to the introduction of Operation Anvil, the Garda Commissioner in November 2005 augmented the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation with an additional 55 Garda members to address the problem of criminal gang activity.  Enforcement by the Unit has resulted in further firearms being seized and a number of persons arrested, thereby disrupting their criminal activities.  There has also been an increase in Garda monitoring and targeting of individuals and groups involved in armed crime in particular.Following the completion of the weapons amnesty on 31 October, the mandatory minimum sentences in relation to possession of firearms came into effect on 1 November.  The penalties available to the courts have now been greatly strengthened and stringent penalties now apply.I am very satisfied with the outcome of the 2007 Estimates process.  The allocation for the Garda Vote is increasing by €135.3 million to €1.445 billion — an increase of 10% on 2006.  This year's budget in turn represented an increase of 13% on 2005 and an increase of 85% in real terms since 1997.  The additional overtime allocation included in this will yield almost three million extra man hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.  As a result, innovative and targeted anti-crime strategies and operations such as Operation Anvil will be continued and intensified on a nationwide basis.  This budgetary  increase demonstrates that this Government continues to provide record resources for anti-crime strategies.The Government and I are also committed to increasing the strength of the Garda Síochána.  I am informed that the personnel strength of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 13,000 on 16 November, following the attestation of 299 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 on 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 21.5% (2,298) in the personnel strength of the Force in the period since then.  The induction of 280 new Garda recruits to the Garda College on 6 November resulted in a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,137.  Next year will see more than 275 fully trained Gardaí graduating from the Garda College every quarter, allowing the Commissioner to focus a highly visible policing presence throughout the country.I would like to stress that all killings, regardless of the background of the victim or the method of killing, are the subject of a rigorous investigation by the Garda authorities.

The decision of the Visa Officer to refuse the application was taken on 29th November, 2006.  The decision was appealed on 6th December, 2006. Following a re-examination of the case, the decision to refuse was upheld on 11th December, 2006. As each applicant is entitled to one appeal only, no further review in this matter can be granted; however it is open to the applicant to make a fresh application.

I can tell the Deputy that the case referred to by him is the subject of an application to the Central Authority which operates in my Department for the purposes of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. That Convention is designed to ensure the return of children who have been abducted from one contracting state to another. The application in this case was received by the Irish Central Authority on 18 September 2006, and after translation into French was forwarded to the Central Authority in France on 27 September 2006. The Irish Central Authority is in regular communication with its counterpart in France, which is responsible for ensuring that whatever steps are available to it in that jurisdiction, including if necessary the institution of proceedings before a French court, are taken as expeditiously as possible.  The Irish Central Authority, in this case as in all others it deals with, is keeping the applicant fully informed of developments as they occur.

His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, he was informed by letter dated 5 July, 2002, that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned.This person's case file, including all representations submitted, will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement).  I expect the file to be passed to me for decision in due course.

The reasons for my decision were disclosed to the individuals concerned in letters dated 16 February 2005.  It is open to both persons to submit further applications at any time provided they satisfy the relevant statutory conditions. In doing so, however, they should give due regard to my reasons for refusing the previous applications.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	674	I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Dáil Question number 56 of 30 November, 2006, in respect of the person concerned.  First of all I would like to advise the Deputy that the person concerned has still failed to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, (GNIB), as requested and continues to be illegally present in the State.  She should, without any further delay, present herself to the appropriate authorities, in this case either the GNIB or An Garda Síochána.I would also like to inform the Deputy that the person concerned is not being deported, but rather transferred to Belgium in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003.  Belgium is the appropriate State to process her application for asylum on the basis that she made an asylum application there on 18 February, 2005.I also wish to advise the Deputy that Belgium is a party to and thus bound by international human rights instruments which prohibit refoulement. The current development of a common EU asylum policy is predicated on the full and inclusive application of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 New York Protocol, thus maintaining its principle of non-refoulement. Council Regulation (EC) No. 432/2003 is based on this common policy. Belgium respects the principle of non-refoulement thus ensuring that a person is not sent back to face persecution.In relation to the appeals procedure and as I previously illustrated to the Deputy, in my reply to his previous Dáil Question in relation to this case, an appeal of the determination of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, (ORAC), can be appealed to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. However the appeal can be pursued from the receiving Regulation State, in this case Belgium. If the appeal is successful, my Department will make arrangements with the appropriate authorities in Belgium in order to arrange for the person concerned to be returned to Ireland and for her asylum application to be examined substantively by the ORAC.In conclusion, I would like to remind the Deputy that the person concerned continues to evade her transfer and is illegally present in the State.  She should present herself to the GNIB or An Garda Síochána without any further delay.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	675	As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the case of the person concerned falls under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation, Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003.  This Regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of ‘asylum shopping' across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which Regulation State is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one Regulation State or whereby an asylum seeker has been granted a visa to enter another Regulation State and has entered that other State before entering Ireland and making an asylum application here. At the same time, it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of ‘refugees in orbit', a situation which had previously pertained in Europe. Under the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) can, on the basis of relevant criteria, request another Regulation State to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other state.The person concerned lodged an asylum claim in this State on 19 May, 2006. Following investigation by the ORAC and pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, it was established that France was the appropriate State to process the application as the person concerned had previously lodged an asylum claim there on 14 January, 2005, and the appropriate authorities in France have accepted their responsibilities accordingly. The ORAC informed the person concerned of their determination on 08 August, 2006, whilst at the same time affording her an opportunity to appeal the determination  to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT). The person concerned appealed the ORAC determination to RAT which the RAT upheld and the person concerned was informed of this by way of letter on 28 September, 2006.As a direct consequence of the ORAC determination, a Transfer Order was signed in respect of the person concerned on 10 August, 2006. This Order was issued to her on 24 August, 2006, requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB), 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on 29 August, 2006, in order for arrangements to be made for her transfer to France. The person failed to attend the GNIB on this date and was recorded as having evaded her transfer pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation.The situation in the home country of the person concerned and her need, if any, for international protection are matters for France to consider as part of its examination of her asylum claim. The Deputy may also wish to know that France is a party to and thus bound by international human rights instruments which prohibit refoulement. The current development of a common EU asylum policy is predicated on the full and inclusive application of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 New York Protocol, thus maintaining its principle of non-refoulement. Council Regulation (EC) No. 432/2003 is based on this common policy and every Regulation State respects the principle of non-refoulement thus assuring that no person is sent back to face persecution.This said I do not propose to instigate any investigation into the asylum process in France as the Dublin II Regulation is binding on all EU Member States and the transfer of the person concerned will be effected at the earliest possible opportunity.

The refugee will be informed of the decision shortly.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	677	I would refer the Deputy to my earlier Replies to his previous Parliamentary Questions in this matter.  As previously stated, the person concerned arrived in the State on 11 April 2001 and applied for asylum.  His application was refused following the consideration of his case, at first instance by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  As the Deputy is aware, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner is a statutory body, independent in the performance of its functions, in accordance with the provisions of Section 6 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended).  Similarly the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is a statutory body, independent in the performance of its functions, in accordance with the provisions of sections 15 and 16 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended). Additionally, each of those bodies is required to examine all elements of each asylum application it receives and, this being the case, I am entirely satisfied that all elements of the asylum application and appeal submitted by the person concerned was examined in detail before any final position was arrived at by those bodies. Equally, I am satisfied that any documentation or correspondence included as part of the asylum application or appeal was given appropriate consideration by those bodies.I would refer the Deputy again to my Reply to Parliamentary Question No. 86 of Thursday 26 October 2006 where I explained how a Deportation Order came to be made against the person concerned. The Deputy will note from that Reply that a Deportation Order was signed by me only after all relevant factors and documentation had been taken into account. Consequently a Deportation Order was signed by me on 11 September 2003.I am satisfied that all elements of the asylum application, appeal and application for permission to remain in the State submitted by the person concerned have been fairly and comprehensively examined. As a result, I am satisfied that the decision to issue a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned was entirely justified.

It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions. These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs. Such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy. This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.The Garda Missing Person Bureau is attached to Garda Headquarters and is responsible for maintaining data relating to missing persons. The District Officer in the area where the person has been reported missing takes direct responsibility for all issues relating to the investigation of the circumstances of the missing person. When a person is reported missing, the local  Garda Superintendent will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary, for example, the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation or the Technical Bureau. The services of Interpol and Europol are also available to assist in these investigations. In addition, every Garda District has a specially trained search team that is familiar with the locality. The investigation of missing persons is a dedicated subject on the curriculum at the Garda College, Templemore, and is also a subject covered in in-service training.The Garda authorities are continuously monitoring international developments in relation to investigations of missing persons in order to ensure that best practice is followed and have assured me that they are satisfied that adequate resources are available for the investigation and monitoring of incidents where persons are reported missing.

Since then, my officials have been in discussions with An Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.   Both organisations are generally satisfied with the level of cooperation that exists between them.   However, it has been agreed that enhanced arrangements should be put in place for liaison between the Gardaí and Customs at local and regional levels particularly in the context of small airfields.I am also informed that the Revenue Commissioners are carrying out a review of their arrangements at small airports. This review is expected to be finalised in the coming weeks.  It is likely that the review will deal, inter alia, with risk assessments, intelligence driven operations and spot checks at these airports.

Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive (HSE) under the Health Act 2004.  While there is ongoing co-operation between An Garda Síochána and the HSE on the matters referred to, currently  there are no proposals to establish an inter-departmental group.As the Deputy may be aware, the HSE established the National Office for Suicide Prevention following the launch in September 2005 of "Reach Out", a National Strategy for Action on Suicide Prevention.  The Office was established to oversee the implementation of the Strategy and to coordinate suicide prevention activities across the State, consult widely in relation to the planning of future initiatives and ensure best practice in suicide prevention.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	684	The Interim Board of the Civil Service Childcare Agency (the Board), which is the body responsible for licensing the operators who run the Civil Service crèches, decided at its meeting on 20 September 2006 to increase the weekly fees at the Athlone Civil Service crèche from 127 Euro to 150 Euro for babies and from 100 Euro to 130 Euro for children over 1 year of age with effect from 1 January 2007.  These increased fees compare favourably with fees charged by private crèches in County Westmeath as per the National Children's Nurseries Association which quotes a maximum fee of 160 Euro per week for children and 176 Euro per week for babies in County Westmeath.Fees at the Athlone Civil Service crèche have not been increased since October 2005. The Board, in deciding to increase the fees took into account the increasing costs being incurred by all the Civil Service crèches, in particular wage costs which represent the biggest cost to operators. The fee increases will ensure that the salaries paid to staff are in line with levels generally applying in the field and that the crèches will continue to be in a position to attract high calibre staff. In addition the fee increases will ensure that standards of child care are maintained at the highest level and that the crèches will be operating on a sound financial basis into the future.In line with the regulations governing childcare services, the Board is committed to ensuring that all staff in Civil Service crèches are properly qualified, receive ongoing training and are paid accordingly.  The regulations have recently been reviewed and the revised regulations will come into effect on 1st January 2007.  These new regulations will place a greater emphasis on staff training with a view to enhancing the quality of childcare provision and the Civil Service crèches must be in a position to comply with these regulations.  The Board has also decided that the same fee levels will apply from January 2007 for the Sligo and Ennis Civil Service crèches in order to standardise the fee levels and implementation dates across the three crèches.  I can assure the deputy that the Board is totally committed to ensuring the highest standards and the best possible care for the children in Civil Service crèches.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	685	Capital gains tax (CGT) is a tax on a capital gain arising on the disposal of an asset.  A 20% rate of CGT generally applies on the gain arising on the disposal of assets.Where compensation is received for land that is compulsorily acquired, any gains arising from the amount paid for the acquisition of the land are chargeable to capital gains tax.  In other words, if there is a sum paid by a public authority for the compulsory acquisition of land, then irrespective of its components (for example disturbance, injurious affection etc.), that total sum will be the amount to be assessed for tax.  If additional sums were paid in respect of land acquired (however described), they would still be regarded as part of the consideration payable and would be liable to tax in the normal way.The CGT due on a disposal of land under a CPO is calculated in the same way as any other disposal of land.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	686	The position is that expenses in respect of tuition for children with dyslexia do not qualify for health expenses tax relief and have never qualified for the relief since it was first introduced in 1967.I understand from the Revenue Commissioners, who deal with such claims, that individuals may have been under the impression that tuition for children with dyslexia was allowable under the heading of health expenses relief. I also understand that the Revenue Commissioners have written to the Dyslexia Association to clarify the matter.In recent years, the Government has increased significantly the supports available through the direct expenditure system for children with disabilities, including those with dyslexia.As with many areas where State support may be required, the question arises as to whether such support may be more effectively provided through the direct expenditure route rather than through the tax system.  One advantage of the former mechanism is that the support may be better targeted at those in need, irrespective of family income, whereas support through the tax system can only benefit those whose incomes are high enough to benefit from tax relief.I have no plans to extend Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to cover expenses incurred by parents who have children with dyslexia.  However, this matter, like any other, can be raised by the Deputies at Finance Bill time.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	688	I understand that the Deputy's question relates specifically to the position of an established civil servant subject to the provisions of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956.There are a number of grounds on which a civil servant may be removed from office:[a]  Under the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, the Government may dismiss or discipline an established civil servant for misconduct or fraud. There is a disciplinary code which sets out the procedures under which this action can take place; the Code also provides for an appeal process to allow the officer the opportunity to state a defence. In the case of an unestablished civil servant, dismissal may be decided by the relevant Minister.[b] The Civil Regulation Act 1956 also allows for compulsory retirement on grounds of ill-health at the initiative of the employing Department or Office.[c] Under the 1909 and 1963 Superannuation and Pensions Acts, an officer may be retired early on grounds of organisational efficiency or effectiveness and receive a pension before the normal pension age.[d] Before the commencement on 4 July, 2006 of the Civil Service Regulation (Amendment) Act 2005, the termination of employment of an established civil servant was decided by the Government. With the commencement of the Act, the relevant Minister has powers of discipline for the grades of Principal upwards, and Secretaries-General and Heads of Office have responsibility for grades below Principal.[e] In relation to the definition of the term "employed by or under the State", this phrase has been interpreted by the courts in a number of cases.  The phrase covers both civil servants of the State and of the Government. The former refers to persons employed by the organs of the State established by the Constitution such as the Attorney General and the President. The latter refers to persons employed in the Civil Service of the Government, that is Departments controlled by individual Ministers.  The distinction is a technical one and both groups are civil servants.[f] It is not possible to comment on the role of an "outside body" in relation to the dismissal of an employee as this may depend on a number of factors including the employment relationship and who the employer is in any particular situation.

This recommendation has since been implemented. The provision of long service increments for T.D.s is in line with the views expressed in the above Review Body report. Any increases for Principals awarded by the Public Service Benchmarking Body will be paid to TDs.The salaries of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, Minister and Minister of State are made up of two elements the office holder's salary plus the T.D.'s basic salary.

It is difficult to predict sales of hybrid electrical vehicles and flexible fuel vehicles for 2007. The popularity of hybrid electrical vehicles should continue to grow while the supply of flexible fuel vehicles will be limited in the short term as the technology involved is still in its infancy.The following Table sets out data regarding the annual cost of the VRT remittance and the number of vehicles qualifying for the relief in respect of hybrid electric and flexible fuel vehicles on an annual basis since the introduction of the schemes.

Many other walls in the City area have also been found to be of adequate height and have not been altered.As the Deputy will be aware, parts of this wall were raised during the works in order to bring the wall to adequate defence height. As I have informed the Deputy before, the wall on the opposite side of the channel is higher in places for safety reasons as it is required to ensure a safe height from the footpath on the road side.The Office of Public Works has not received any reports of water levels reaching the top of this wall last weekend. However, my officials have asked the City Council to investigate the matter.

Whilst an individual letter did not issue to the taxpayer, or indeed any taxpayer, to advise of the changes to the period of permissible claims, the extensive media campaign undertaken by Revenue was deemed to be the most appropriate method by which to notify taxpayers of the important changes concerned.  As indicated to the Deputy in response to an earlier question on this issue, these changes were passed into legislation by the Government in the Finance Act 2003.The taxpayer was not requested to submit any outstanding tax returns as he did not register for income tax until 26 October 2005, and only then notified the Revenue Commissioners that his business had commenced on 1 July 1995. There is an obligation on the taxpayer to submit a self assessment return for each year in accordance with the provisions of Section 951 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.

OPW will undertake the work as agents for the County Council. Since it has been possible to identify a viable scheme it is not considered necessary to undertake a Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study for this area at present.OPW and Kildare County Council are continuing to consider options to relieve the flooding at Mill Lane with the intention that if a viable scheme is confirmed works would also be undertaken early next year.Subject to it being possible to resolve both these issues as anticipated, it is not intended to proceed with the Rye Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management Study at this stage. The Rye and the Sillechain watercourses will instead be included in a planned future study of the River Liffey Catchment.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	698	Stamp duty is liable on the conveyance of any property by the person receiving the property.  Where a farmer purchases land, he or she is liable to stamp duty at the rates applicable to non-residential property.  However, there are a number of reliefs and exemptions within the stamp duty code that assist with the transfer of farmland.There is an exemption from stamp duty for qualified young trained farmers receiving farmland.  Farmers aged under 35 years who possess specific agricultural qualification may be eligible for this relief.  In addition, transfers of land between certain blood relatives qualify for consanguinity relief which reduces the rate of stamp duty to one-half of the rate which would otherwise apply.Relief from stamp duty is also available for exchanges of farmland between two farmers for the purposes of consolidating each farmer's holding.  There are conditions relating to consolidation, farming and ownership attached to this provision.  I announced in the Budget that this relief will be extended to qualifying exchanges of land where only one farmer is consolidating his/her holding.  In such cases both farmers may qualify for relief, provided they both meet all other conditions of the relief.  These changes will be included in the 2007 Finance Bill.  However, commencement of these changes is dependent on EU approval.Under the stamp duty legislation, any stamp duty payable on conveyances must be paid within 30 days of the transfer of the property concerned.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	699	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there are no specific tax incentives available for the provision of staff showers at places of employment. However, there may be capital allowances available depending on the circumstances of the particular case.  Wear and tear allowances are given in respect of the cost of providing plant and machinery to be used for the purposes of a trade.  These allowances are given at the rate of 12½% per annum of the amount of the capital expenditure on the plant over an 8-year period.  The actual shower units, i.e. the sanitary ware and fittings involved, would generally be regarded by Revenue as plant.Industrial buildings allowances are given for buildings and structures that are provided for the recreation or welfare of staff that are employed in particular types of industrial buildings.  Some examples of such buildings are factories, hotels, airports, nursing homes and private hospitals.  Again, depending on the circumstances of the case, industrial buildings allowances may be available for a building or part of a building or a structure that is used to house staff showers.  The rate at which the allowances are given depends on the type of building involved.  For example, capital expenditure on factories can be written off at the rate of 4% per annum over a 25-year period while capital expenditure on a nursing home can be written off at the rate of 15% for the first six years and 10% in year 7.I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that no information is available in relation to any capital allowances that might have been claimed in respect of the provision of staff showers.  All of the claims for wear and tear allowances for plant and machinery are aggregated on the income tax return form and claims for the different types of plant are not separately identified.  Similarly, claims for industrial buildings allowances do not distinguish between the different parts of a building or where there are separate buildings involved so that it is not possible to identify any claims for buildings or structures that house staff showers.

At that time an Inter-Departmental Committee, the National Coordination Committee on Training, Work and Employment (NCC), was established to co-ordinate activities during the transition period and to plan for the further development of these services in the following years. The work of the NCC is on-going and it continues to provide a valuable forum for the consideration of new and effective enhancements for these key services.In the estimates for 2006, significant additional funding totalling €100 million has been included for the improvement of health funded support services for people with disabilities. As part of this provision, funding of €10 million has been made available to address core under-funding and core staffing issues in services provided by the voluntary sector.  The Health Service Executive has been asked to allocate this funding on an equitable basis, having regard to the needs of people with disabilities.I expect that the Executive's consideration of these needs will take into account any urgent case for funding of necessary services currently provided through FÁS employment schemes.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	708	There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to provide chiropody services to GMS patients; however, in practice, arrangements are made to provide these services.  Before the establishment of the HSE the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and so a degree of variation in practice developed over time.  Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over.  In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.I consider that it is inappropriate for private chiropodists who are providing services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE.   My Department requested the HSE to review the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service. I am hopeful that this process, which has been underway for some time, will be concluded soon and that this will ensure that no supplementary charges are levied.My Department is currently preparing legislation to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.  The Bill will define specific health and personal services more clearly; define who should be eligible for what services; set out clear criteria for eligibility; establish when and in what circumstances charges may be made and provide for an appeals framework.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider that part of the Deputy's question which relates to appointment times. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

These include the type and configuration of the services involved, the mixed public/private nature of our health system, the suitability of existing infrastructure and the capital requirements of the health services generally over the coming years.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for Primary Care services, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy.

In 2006, a sum of €26.2 million was provided for the development of our mental health services in line with "A Vision for Change". A further sum of €25 million has been allocated for 2007 to continue this development.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004 and funding for all health services has been provided as part of its overall vote.  Therefore, the Executive is the appropriate body to consider the particular matter raised by the Deputy. My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	713	Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed with the Health Service Executive a further adjustment to the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The Strategy provides a strategic framework for youth homelessness to be tackled on a national basis.  The goal of the Strategy is "to reduce and if possible eliminate youth homelessness through preventative strategies and where a child becomes homeless to ensure that he/she benefits from a comprehensive range of services aimed at reintegrating him/her into his/her community as quickly as possible."  There are 12 key objectives in the Strategy divided into three broad categories: preventative measures, responsive services and planning/administrative supports.Under the strategy, the Health Service Executive, has lead responsibility for implementation of the Strategy and they prepared detailed action plans in this regard to address youth homelessness in line with the objectives set out in the Strategy.  The Office of the Minister for Children supported the implementation process by establishing the Youth Homelessness Strategy Monitoring Committee (YHSMC).  The Committee is representative of the relevant stakeholders and is chaired by the Office of the Minister for Children.This Government is committed to the implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy, with funding of approximately €12m being allocated to the Health Service Executive for the development of youth homelessness services since 2001.The Office of the Minister for Children is reviewing the implementation of the Health Service Executive action plans to date and is considering the next steps to be taken in the implementation of the Youth Homelessness Strategy.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	742	I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 to 227, inclusive, together.Statutory responsibility for the administration of civil registration in Ireland, which includes the provision of facilities for searching indices to civil registration records, is vested in An tArd-Chláraitheoir (The Registrar General).  His office, Oifig an Ard-Chláraitheóra (The General Register Office — GRO) is the central repository for all records, and index books to such records, relating to the civil registration of births, deaths, marriages, domestic adoptions and stillbirths in the State.I have made enquiries of An tArd-Chláraitheoir regarding the matters raised by the Deputy and he advises me that he does not routinely collect and collate data relating to the numbers of searches, general or otherwise, undertaken at the Research Facility maintained by him at Joyce House, Dublin 1.The fees for registration services, including the fees for family/genealogical research, were set in 1987.  These fees were revised in December 2005.  The charge for a particular search increased from €1.90 to €2.00 while the charge for a general search increased from €15.24 to €20.00.  The latter represents an increase of 31%.  During the period 1987 to 2005 the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased by 68%.  The increase in fees is justified on the basis that the last increase was in 1987 and a substantial investment has been made in modernising the civil registration system in recent years.The number of persons presenting at the facility to undertake family history/genealogical research varies from year to year but would average 8000 persons per annum.  The income generated from search fees will vary as a consequence but in the current year will be of the order of €240,000.  There is no evidence to date to suggest that the fees increase in 2005 has impacted adversely on the numbers availing of the service.The position in relation to the cost of running the research facility in 2005 is that, as the entire GRO staff complement was located in Joyce House until the decentralisation of GRO to Roscommon in April, 2005 it is not possible to isolate the precise cost of providing the research facility from other costs generally associated with running the entire operation during the period in question.  However, based on current salary scales and a notional 40% addition for office facilities and overheads, the estimated cost of providing the research facility is of the order of €400,000 in a full year.Searching of GRO records for members of the public involves accessing index books to records of births, deaths and marriages and searching these indices in order to identify specific entries in the records and, if required, purchasing either photocopies or certified copies of the identified entries in the records.The Civil Registration Service has been engaged in a major programme of modernisation in recent years which included the introduction of a computerised civil registration system and a project to capture electronically in excess of 150 years of historical paper records, and their associated indices, relating to life events.  Thus far, birth records from 1864 to date, death records from 1924 to date and marriage records from 1920 to date are available on a live computer system.  The remainder of the data viz. death records from 1864 to 1923 and marriage records from 1845 to 1919, has been captured electronically but a substantial amount of data cleaning and conversion work is required before it can be released to the computer system.  An tArd-Chláraitheoir is unable to give a specific timeframe for the completion of this requirement but it will be considered in the context of planning for the continued development of the service in 2007.  It is important to note, however, that the years covered by the data currently available on the computerised Civil Registration System is sufficient to meet the vast majority of the daily business needs of the service.Part of the modernisation programme includes a project to create an electronically searchable database of the indices to the electronic records.  From a research perspective, where the focus of family history researchers and genealogists alike tends to lean towards the retrieval of older records, the creation of an electronic database of indices will facilitate easier and more efficient and effective record searches.  It will also facilitate the extension of the availability of the indices beyond the single physical repository, at the moment, of the Research Facility at GRO, Dublin to the wider HSE offices nationwide where civil registration is carried out.  A new Research Facility, a feature of which will be electronic research, is being developed at a city centre location, adjacent to public transport services and the refurbishment works and fitting-out required to facilitate its use as such is underway.  It is hoped that it will be commissioned towards the middle of 2007 and will be extended in due course to facilitate internet research.  I have not, as yet, given any consideration to charges in connection with electronic research.An tArd-Chláraitheoir is aware that the records he maintains are a valuable source for research purposes and the particular requirements of those engaged in such research are being taken into account in the context of the overall modernisation of the service.  The provision of a new research facility is evidence of this and he is satisfied that substantial benefits from its commissioning will accrue to members of the public who wish to avail of the service.He points out, however, that his primary function is to ensure the delivery of the system of civil registration of births, deaths, marriages, adoptions and stillbirths in the State and to provide for the extension of the system to decrees of divorce and decrees of civil nullity in line with the provisions of the statutes governing civil registration.  His office does not engage in family history/genealogical research, which has developed as a spin-off to civil registration.Plans to make information available on-line in relation to the 1901 and 1911 census, primary valuation and cancelled valuation books, tithe records and church records are a matter for the agencies having ownership or control of those records and do not come within the statutory functions of An tArd-Chláraitheoir.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	751	The Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006 provides a clear legal framework to repay recoverable health charges for publicly funded long term residential care.  All those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged and are alive will have their charges repaid in full.  The estates of all those fully eligible persons who were wrongly charged for publicly funded long term residential care and died since 9 December 1998 will have the charges repaid in full.  The scheme does not allow for repayments to the estates of those who died prior to that date.Recoverable health charges are charges which were imposed on persons with full eligibility under the Health (Charges for In-patient Services) Regulations 1976 as amended in 1987 or charges for in-patient services only, raised under the Institutional Assistance Regulations 1954 as amended in 1965.In relation to dates of repayments to applicants, the HSE has informed the Department that over 21,000 forms have been submitted to the scheme administrator applying for repayments and these applications are being processed at present. The timeframe for repayment is predicated primarily on whether the applicant is alive or whether the application is being made by the estate of a deceased person. Living people who were wrongly charged will be the first to receive payments under the scheme. It is estimated that there are now in the region of 15,000 people within this category. Queries in relation to individual applications should be referred to the scheme administrator.In addition, the Health Service Executive has put arrangements in place whereby it can make application on behalf of living persons in long stay institutions where there is no other connected person to make an application and where the applicants are unable to apply themselves due to ill health, or mental or physical disability.The HSE has advised that offers of repayment commenced in November and that the first payments have already issued with further payments continuing on an ongoing basis. It is expected that the bulk of payments to estates will commence in the Spring of 2007.  Provision has been made for applications to be received up to 1 January 2008.A dedicated website www.repay.ie and an information phone line 1890 886 886 have been established by the scheme administrator to assist the public in accessing claim forms and general information on the scheme.  The information line operates between the hours of 8.00 am and 9.00 p.m. from Monday to Saturday.

There are many areas of the country where for demographic or other reasons the private sector has been slow to respond to demand for broadband. In cases where the market is seen to have failed, my Department is addressing the investment shortfall in infrastructure using a combination of Government and ERDF funding through the Regional Broadband Programme.Despite Government investment in broadband in the regions through the regional broadband programme, there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband connectivity. Options to address the gaps in broadband coverage are currently being considered by a Steering Group comprising officials from my Department and representatives from ComReg. The Steering Group has met with representatives from the various technology platforms through which a service can be delivered. I expect to finalise proposals shortly.

The regulation provides for the revised quotas for the taking of salmon (including sea trout over 40 centimetres) by commercial fishing engines and the introduction of a quota for anglers. The quotas are to be allocated on a river-by-river basis. The draft regulation, sets out the Total Allowable Catch that may be taken by commercial fishing engines and rod and line on a river by river basis and by river catchments.The scientific advice of the Standing Scientific Committee of the National Salmon Commission indicates that the River Boyne is not reaching its conservation limit and in the circumstances there is no quota for salmon and sea trout that may be taken by commercial fishing engines and rod and line in 2007.

In order to proceed with the project the County Council sought funding of €200,000 from the Department towards Site Investigations and Planning Permission in 2004. The Department had no Exchequer funding available for this project in 2004 or 2005.Under the 2006 Small Harbours Programme I approved grant aid of €112,500 to Mayo County Council towards a Site Investigation and Feasibility Study at Porturlin at a total cost of €150,000. I understand the study is under way at present and a report will be available shortly.The question of providing funding for development at Porturlin in 2007 will be considered taking account of the results of the Study and Site Investigation and the amount of funding available for works at fishery harbours generally and overall national priorities.

Roaming charges were on the agenda. At the meeting I strongly supported the Commission proposals to protect mobile phone users from excessive roaming charges.The issue of high roaming charges is one that I take very seriously and one that I raised at my first Telecoms Council meeting when I took over this brief. I have repeatedly made my position on this issue known to the telecommunications sector in Ireland and I have called for action by them to reduce costs to the consumer in this area. Earlier this year I was very encouraged when operators in Ireland introduced tariff initiatives to address the issue of Northern Ireland roaming following a direct call from me to do so. I will continue to work to get movement at a European level on this issue.The Commission's draft regulation is currently being negotiated in the Council Working Group and debated in the European Parliament. I hope that agreement on the proposed Regulation will be reached in 2007.

The purpose of the pilot is to bring further momentum to the transition to digital terrestrial broadcasting and to test and trial various aspects of the service.The DTT pilot is now in the "soft trial" phase during which the network and user technologies will be tested. The initial transmission sites are at Clermont Carn in the northeast and Three Rock covering parts of the Dublin region. The trial is planned to continue over a two-year timeframe and will provide the opportunity for technical and user testing of both existing and new broadcast services, including both television and audio services.My Department is preparing legislation with regard to DTT with a view to facilitating a national roll-out.It is anticipated that the pilot will generate awareness and discussion among interested parties in a full national roll-out of digital terrestrial television. As the trial progresses and proposals are developed for a national rollout of digital terrestrial television, the question of possible analogue switch-off dates will be considered.Switch-off of analogue television services is being strongly advocated by the European Commission, with 2012 a target date suggested by the Commission. While the pilot is under way, I intend to hold discussions with all relevant stakeholders around the issue of digital switchover.When decisions have been taken about the nature and timing of analogue switch over, it will be necessary to ensure that Irish viewers are fully informed of all the issues arising.

Furthermore, I have no function or responsibility in respect of the charges imposed by such service providers.  Nor have I any function or responsibility in regard to the operation of Regtel which I understand is a private limited company.Similarly, I do not have any responsibility in relation to the enforcement of the EC (Electronic Communications Networks and Services) (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 2003.  These regulations were made by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.Where I do have Ministerial responsibility is in relation to consumer law but the Deputy's question does not contain enough detail to allow me to form a judgment as to whether or not any breach of existing consumer law might arise in relation to these matters.  I have, however, brought the substance of the Deputy's questions to the attention of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  If the Deputy believes that a breach of consumer law arises, I would urge him to communicate with the Director and to provide her with as much information as possible in order to allow a judgment to be made in that respect.

IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to the Mid-West, except for the Shannon Free Zone, which falls within the remit of Shannon Development.While IDA Ireland is actively marketing all areas within their remit, including the Mid-West, for new investment projects and jobs, decisions regarding where to locate, including what areas to visit as potential locations are ultimately taken by investors. IDA Ireland inform me that they hosted 23 site visits to County Limerick, 5 site visits to County Clare and 2 site visits to North Kerry this year. So far this year IDA Ireland hosted no site visits to North Tipperary.While agreements entered into between IDA Ireland and individual investors are confidential by nature and not always announced, the following announcements were made in 2006:In March 2006 Vistakon announced it is to invest over €100 million in its Limerick Manufacturing facility.  This development is part of Vistakon's aggressive growth strategy to capitalise on the global contact lens market's huge potential.In September 2006 Northern Trust announced its decision to locate its second fund administration centre in Limerick, which lead to the creation of over 300 jobs. In addition R&D expenditure of over €10m has been committed in four separate projects during 2006 in Limerick.The Forfás Annual Employment Survey records jobs gained and lost in companies supported by the industrial development agencies. Data are compiled on an annualised basis and data for 2006 will not be available until mid-2007.  The following table provide details of the number of IDA supported companies, total employment in these companies and jobs gained and lost in each of the Mid-West counties for 2005.IDA Ireland advise me that the Mid-West has excellent prospects in terms of attracting additional foreign direct investment in 2007 and beyond. In particular, IDA Ireland believe there is very significant scope for the region to grow as a centre of excellence in research and development activity. The IDA, through its partnership with University of Limerick (UL) and the various Institutes of Technology throughout the region, is strongly promoting this concept.  In addition, UL in collaboration with Science Foundation Ireland in appointing world-renowned researchers has greatly added to the reputation and attraction of the region as a centre for research and development.I am confident that the strategies being pursued by IDA Ireland will continue to bear fruit in terms of additional investment and jobs for the people of the Mid-West.CountyClareNorth KerryLimerickNorth TipperaryEmployment Data2005200520052005No. of Companies911386Permanent Jobs1,0241,0268,633717Job Gains (New Jobs)1298937438Job Losses-34-15-127-83Net Change in Employment9574247-45

The regime of control includes approval of new designs of weighing equipment, verification of instruments of an approved design upon installation and following repair or recalibration, and inspection over the life of the instruments.Limited inspections of meat plants are continuing to be undertaken; 10 meat plants have been visited since June 2006.  No breaches of the legislation requiring prosecution were found in the past two years.The tabular statement contains details of the dates of last visits to meat plants.As the Deputy was previously advised, a full programme of inspections for weighing equipment in meat processing plants will not be possible until an industrial relations issue relating to the hiring of private hauliers for the conveyance and lifting of test equipment is resolved.A Labour Relations Commission hearing on 27 March 2006 was unsuccessful in resolving the matter and further negotiations are ongoing between management and staff representatives.  An external facilitator was engaged and negotiations commenced in July 2006.  It is expected that these will conclude shortly.

The wages and conditions of employment of workers on board that vessel are, therefore, governed by the flag State's legislation (in this case, Jamaica) and neither I nor the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have any responsibilities in these matters.I understand that the vessel is subject to Port State Control (PSC) inspections in Ireland under the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)/EU Directive 95/21/EC.   PSC inspections, which are undertaken by Marine Surveyors of the Department of Transport, include, amongst other items, inspection of the vessels living and working conditions as regulated under the current International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions and in this case ILO 147/ ILO 180, which Ireland has ratified.As Deputies know, the Government has already communicated its intention to engage fully and effectively in the process of devising policies and measures which would protect employment standards and arrest a race to the bottom in terms of employment practices. I am confident that a successful response to these issues can be found for our economy, where the very particular legal and other characteristics of the marine sector do not apply. I believe they are best found within the context of a social partnership agreement, which continues the stability and progressive modernisation of our labour force and employment practices in order to sustain jobs and living standards. In this regard the Social Partnership Agreement "Towards 2016" sets out a number of commitments with regard to the improvement of employment standards and compliance.In addition to the measures contained in Towards 2016, a new Maritime Labour Convention was adopted in February 2006 at the 94th International Labour Organization in Geneva.

Kildare.  As regards Naas itself, in May of this year, I announced a major investment of €28m by Dawn Farm Foods Ltd with support from Enterprise Ireland.  A total of 100 new jobs will be created.  A major expansion by Green Isle Foods is under way and on target.  The Millennium Park in the town has three modern advance office buildings available for marketing to investors.  A financial services company has already established in the Park.According to the most recent Quarterly National Household Survey published by the Central Statistics Office on 30 November, the numbers in employment in the Mid-East region, of which Naas is a part, continue to grow.  The numbers increased from 225,600 people in the second quarter of 2006 to 231,800 in the third quarter.  This represents a continuing strong rise of over 20,000 in the number of people in employment in the region over the last two years.I am satisfied that the efforts of the Industrial Development agencies will continue to attract investment and job opportunities to the area.

The total social welfare spending in 2007 will exceed €15.3 billion and this funding will directly support and benefit one and a half million people.In its pre-Budget submission, the Disability Federation of Ireland made two recommendations; firstly that the rate of Disability Allowance be increased by €20 per week which, as outlined above, has been achieved and, secondly that a cost of disability payment at a rate of €40 per week be introduced, commencing with the recipients of the means-tested disability allowance payment.  There are currently over 83,000 recipients of disability allowance.A working group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF), with cross-departmental membership which includes my Department and chaired by the Department of Health and Children, has examined the feasibility of the introduction of a cost of disability payment.  The National Disability Authority, on behalf of the working group and in line with its own remit, commissioned research into the feasibility of the introduction of such a payment.  The purpose of this research was to advise regarding the additional costs incurred by people with disabilities, owing specifically to the direct or indirect costs of disability and the appropriate mechanisms or instruments by which to address identified additional costs.  The resultant report, Disability and the Cost of Living, was subsequently published by the National Disability Authority.The group considers it vital that comprehensive data be available on which to base consideration of the introduction of a cost of disability payment, in addition to a structured process of the assessment of need.  The working group recommended that steps be taken to improve the quality of data relating to disability in Ireland, for example, adjustment of existing data gathering exercises undertaken by the Central Statistics Office.  This will be addressed in the disability survey currently being undertaken by the CSO.The group has also examined the scope for addressing barriers that exist for people with disabilities who wish to undertake or increase their employment and thus move to a position of greater economic independence.  In this regard, as part of the Social Welfare Budget package 2006, I introduced a change to the withdrawal rate of Disability Allowance and Blind Pension for income in excess of the current earnings disregard level which means that a single person can earn up to a maximum of €390 per week from rehabilitative employment before their Disability Allowance or Blind Pension is fully withdrawn.  The outcome of this change will be monitored to assess its effect on increased employment participation and to identify any further policy changes required.In terms of ensuring adequate levels of income for people with disabilities, the current ten-year Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, includes the commitment to work for the continued enhancement and integration of supports in line with overall social welfare targets. These will include a rationalisation of existing allowances for people with disabilities in the context of the Government's policy of mainstreaming and the transfer of functions from the Health Services Executive to my Department which includes a number of disability-related schemes, including the Domiciliary Care Allowance, Mobility Allowance and Blind Welfare Allowance.  An inter-departmental working group has now been established to progress the implementation of this transfer. Other issues around the cost of disability will be considered following the development of a needs assessment system provided for under Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005.My Department's Disability Sectoral Plan similarly contains actions in relation to the rationalisation of existing allowances for people with disabilities. The Plan also includes agreed protocols with the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on actions required to ensure that income supports and associated benefits do not create financial barriers to people with disabilities participating in the labour force or availing of training, educational or other developmental opportunities.I look forward to the implementation of the sectoral plan over the next three years and to continuing the commitment to expand and deliver services that best support, recognise and encourage people with disabilities as well as those who provide a caring role.

The consideration of relevant issues raised in that context would be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Health and Children.With regard to the income support arrangements for people with disabilities, the improvements made to the Disability Allowance (DA) scheme since its transfer from the Health Boards to my Department in 1996 mean that many of those who had previously been disqualified for payment under the former DPMA scheme because they were in residential care are now entitled to payment under the DA scheme.  Furthermore, people who are living in community-based residences are eligible to receive DA provided the relevant Health Board is not providing funding towards their maintenance.However, the position of people in residential care since prior to August 1999, or those who entered residential care subsequent to that date without an entitlement to DA, has been that they are disqualified from receipt of this payment solely because of their residency.This situation was partially addressed in Budget 2005 when I introduced a new Disability Allowance (Personal Expenses Rate) to 2,700 people in residential care who qualified for this payment. This payment replaced the pocket money (spending allowances) which had previously been paid to some of these residents by the Health Services Executive but at the standardised and generally higher rate of €35 per week. The weekly levels of the pocket money allowance previously had varied between Health Service Executive areas.As part of Budget 2007, the disqualification has been removed so that all persons in residential care will have an income maintenance payment on the same basis (in effect abolishing the disqualification and the Disability Allowance (Personal Expenses Rate)). The removal of the disqualification will ensure that persons in receipt of DA in residential care are treated in the same way as other social welfare recipients.Arrangements are now being made to extend the payment of DA, at the rate appropriate to their means, to approximately 2,700 people in residential care.  This measure will be effective from 3 January 2007 and payments will be made in accordance with the joint level service agreements in place between my Department and the service providers.  The payments to the people concerned will be treated in the same way as other Disability Allowance payments and in line with the protocols of the Health Services Executive for monies paid by my Department on behalf of persons in residential care.

If a person dies as a result of an accident at work or an occupational disease their dependants may receive death benefit payments.  Their dependants may also get death benefit if the person at the time of their death, had been getting disablement pension assessed at 50% or more regardless of the cause of death.  There are no special PRSI contribution conditions attaching to death benefit: it is sufficient that a person was in employment insurable for occupational injuries benefit purposes.Death benefit includes widow's or widower's pension, orphan's pension and dependent parents' pension.Widow's or widower's pension, including increases for dependent children, is payable to a person whose spouse dies as a result of an occupational accident. There are currently 636 customers in receipt of this pension under the occupational benefit scheme. Orphan's pension is payable in respect of a child if the parent, step-parent or person who supported the child dies as a result of an occupational accident.  A child is regarded as being an orphan if both parents are dead or one parent is dead, and the other parent is unknown, has abandoned or refused or failed to provide for the child.  The child's guardian should apply for the pension.  There are currently 5 customers in receipt of orphan's pension in respect of 15 children.Dependent parents' pension is payable where the person who dies leaves a dependent parent or parents.   To qualify, the parent must have been wholly or mainly maintained by the deceased.  Because of the expansion of other services this payment has not been claimed for many years.   There are currently 7 customers in receipt of dependent parents' pension.

#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	791	I propose to take Questions Nos. 285 and 287 together.Pneumoconiosis is a prescribed disease for the purpose of the Occupational Injuries scheme administered by my Department.  The legislation governing the Occupational Injuries Scheme provides entitlement to benefit for persons suffering from certain prescribed diseases which are listed in the legislation and where that person has contracted that disease in the course of their employment.Where a person has contracted one of the diseases listed in the legislation, benefits are payable if they were employed in an occupation which is specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.  In addition, benefits may be payable if the claimant can show that the disease was contracted through an employment not specifically prescribed in relation to that disease.Employment under a contract of service as a miner is insurable for Occupational Injuries Benefit under the Social Welfare Acts.  Miners who are unable to work due to an accident arising from their employment may be entitled to occupational injury benefit for the first 26 weeks of their claim.  If their incapacity extends beyond that period they may receive Disability Benefit or Invalidity Pension, subject to meeting the qualifying conditions for these payments.Miners may be entitled to Disablement Benefit if they suffer a loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of an accident at work or a disease prescribed in legislation that they contracted at work.Medical assessments are undertaken in all such cases to determine the degree of disablement, which is calculated by comparison of the state of health of the applicant with a person of the same age and gender.Persons claiming Occupational Injuries Benefit in cases of Pneumoconiosis are referred to Consultant Respiratory Physicians in the first instance for an examination and report.  This examination consists of a clinical assessment and pulmonary function testing (PFT).  Disablement benefit is awarded on the basis of the consultant's report, including the pulmonary function test result.  The degree of disablement is expressed as a percentage of loss of faculty and the compensation payable varies accordingly.Loss of faculty may be determined within a range of less than 1% to 100%, depending on the severity of the condition.  With regard to the 21 persons currently in receipt of disablement benefit as a result of contracting pneumoconiosis arising from their occupation, the percentage of disablement assessed ranges from 8% to 90%.  A person must be assessed as having a minimum of 20% loss of faculty before they may be considered as being incapable of work due to their disablement.The arrangements which apply to pneumoconiosis under the occupational injuries scheme are in line with practice elsewhere and there are no plans at present to change those arrangements. My officials will be glad to meet with representatives of the group involved to discuss any concerns in relation to the present arrangements.

Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as 10 contributions and arrangements are also in place for the payment of pro-rata pensions to those with mixed rate insurance records or contributions from other EU member States or countries with which Ireland has a reciprocal agreement.I am anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for a contributory pension and, in this regard, the range of reduced payments has been expanded over the years so that more people can receive a payment. In relation to the current qualifying conditions I might add that up until 1997 an average of 20 contributions was required for a minimum pension.However, in considering eligibility for contributory payments it is necessary to uphold the contributory principle which underpins entitlement. This requires, amongst other things, that people meet a minimum contribution threshold in order to qualify. This is a normal feature of pension schemes in other countries.  On balance I think the threshold which we have set is a reasonable one and, in the circumstances, I do not consider that it would be appropriate to reduce it further.

The purpose of the scheme is to provide short-term income support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.In Budget 2007 I introduced a combination of measures which when taken together offer a significant reform of the manner in which rent and mortgage interest supplement entitlement is decided.From April 2007, the means test for Rent and Mortgage Interest Supplement is being reformed so that recipients retain at least half of any extra income they get from part-time employment, education or training allowances, subject to a limit of €200 in extra income.  This means that they may be better off by up to €100 per week as a result of availing of such opportunities.In addition, from April 2007, any person who is on a local authority waiting list for accommodation under the Rental Accommodation Scheme (those with a long-term housing need), may now return to full-time employment and be considered for a rent supplement payment under the standard means test as outlined above. This new system replaces the existing special retention arrangements.From January 2007, any additional amount of State pension which is in excess of the supplementary welfare allowance rate will be disregarded when calculating rent or mortgage interest supplement entitlements.These new measures do not in any way restrict the flexibility available to the Health Service Executive to deal with exceptional cases.  In this regard the Executive may provide assistance in the form of a supplement in any case, where, in its opinion, the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.Overall, I believe that Budget 2007 provides for significant improvements to the rent supplement scheme both in terms of simplifying the current assessment process and in offering clear incentives to those returning to work.The Community Welfare Service provides a responsive and flexible approach to meeting individuals' needs under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Within the service  customers are dealt with in a setting that facilitates privacy, sensitivity and confidentiality and supports the access to information.   I am confident that this ethos would be followed in all cases by Community Welfare Officers and Superintendent Community Officers in their dealings with applicants for rent supplement
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	794	Family income supplement is designed to provide support for people on low earnings with child dependants and provide the incentive for them to remain in, or take up, employment.  Recent improvements to family income supplement include the change of assessment from a gross income basis to net income, the increase to €20 per week in the minimum payment and, in Budget 2007, the continued re-focusing of income thresholds to include additional gains for larger families.The increased family income supplement weekly thresholds announced in Budget 2007 will benefit families by various amounts, from €9 (for a one child family) to €111 (for a family with eight or more children). This will increase the average payment, per child, to €50 a week.  These increases will make an estimated 5,600 additional families eligible for a full FIS payment. The cost of this measure is estimated at €32 million in 2007 and in a full year.Research has shown that poverty is more likely to be concentrated in larger families. The new FIS thresholds both significantly increase all payments and concentrate additional resources on larger families. This continues the re-focusing of thresholds which started in Budget 2006, to target resources at households in poverty.In the context of an overall review of targeted child income support payments, the National Economic and Social Council was asked to examine the feasibility of merging the family income supplement with child dependant allowance and possibly including other child supports such as the back to school clothing and footwear allowance, resulting in a single second tier child income support.  Such a payment would be aimed specifically at targeting child poverty by channelling resources to low-income families without creating significant disincentives to employment.  This commitment to examining such a change was subsequently embodied in the partnership agreement ‘Toward 2016' which committed to completing consideration of the issue within one year.I have long held the view that implementing such a second tier of payment for children in low income and welfare families is the most effective method of significantly reducing remaining child poverty. Overall, Child Benefit remains the main universal support for families with children.I now intend introducing in this Bill, a new single high rate Qualified Child Allowance (formerly Child Dependant Allowance) targeted specifically at families on welfare where, naturally, children are most at risk of poverty.  The current three Qualified Child Allowance rates will be combined into a single rate of  €22 per week to be paid for over 340,000 children of welfare families.  For those on the current lower rates of €16.80 and €19.30 per child per week, this represents a substantial improvement, particularly when taken with Child Benefit and other increases.I view this improved and targeted allowance as representing a substantial move in the  direction of a second tier payment and that is why in this Budget I have deliberately taken the decision to focus increased child supports in this area. I intend to build on the advances made on a second tier payment system in Budget 2007 when I receive the NESC report.

A person who is providing full time care and attention to a person as a carer is awarded credits on the same basis as if they were out of the workforce due to illness or unemployment. Under the current statutory provisions governing the award of credited contributions, recipients of the carer's allowance may be awarded credits if they switched to that payment from another credit-bearing payment such as jobseeker's allowance.  From April 1999, formal provision was made for the award of credits to claimants of carer's allowance who have left insurable employment to engage in caring duties.Recipients of carer's allowance, who are not entitled to credits, may be eligible for home-makers disregards which preserve the carer's entitlement for contributory pension purposes.  The home-maker scheme provides that contribution years spent working in the home while caring on a full-time basis for a child up to 12 years of age or an incapacitated person will be disregarded in calculating a person's yearly average number of contributions for old age contributory pension purposes.  The provisions apply from the contribution year commencing on 6 April 1994 and up to 20 contribution years may be disregarded.  The award of credits is subject to certain conditions.  For example, when a person has no paid or credited contributions for a period of two years, they cannot be awarded further credits until 26 contributions are paid.  In recognition of their caring role, this rule will be waived where claimants of carer's allowance were eligible for home-makers disregards immediately prior to claiming carer's allowance.  This, in effect, means that credits will be awarded where a person who has a gap of two years in their paid or credited contributions was eligible for home-makers disregards before claiming carer's allowance.  This will protect the position of people who did not give up work to become carers but may have qualified for home-makers disregards due to child-minding duties and who subsequently became carers after a two year period had expired.  All aspects of the carer's allowance scheme and supports for carers are kept under review and ways of increasing and expanding services for carers will continue to be examined.

These comprise an increase in the weekly rate of fuel allowance of €4 from €14 to €18 (€21.90 in designated smokeless areas) — a doubling in two years —  and an increase in the income threshold for eligibility to fuel allowance by €49 from €51 to €100 above the state pension (contributory) rate.  These changes add to a range of  improvements made to the scheme in recent years including an easing of the means test, extending the duration of payment from 26 to 29 weeks and an increase of €5 in the rate of payment in the 2006 Budget. Some 274,000 people will benefit in 2006 at an estimated annual cost €125.1m.  As a consequence of the increase in rate announced in the recent Budget, annual expenditure on the scheme in 2007 will increase by €31.8m to €156.9m.

Ireland also entered into a bilateral understanding with Quebec on 1 October 1994.  The main purpose of these agreements is to protect the social security pension rights of workers who have worked both in Ireland and the other country to which the agreements apply.  Ireland also processes claims under EU legislation from workers in the EU states.  The bilateral arrangements with Austria, Switzerland and the United Kingdom have limited application as EU Regulations apply in most cases.Social welfare entitlements that fall to be examined under EU or Bilateral agreements take a longer time to process than domestic claims due to the need to obtain and exchange information with the other countries involved.  Reviews of the implementation of EU and Bilateral arrangements are carried out from time to time by officials of the Department and institutions in the other countries are requested to expedite the transfer of information as quickly as possible. The logistics involved in transferring information between institutions in different countries inevitably leads to delays outside the control of my Department. There is currently a build-up in this Department of claims for processing under EU and Bilateral arrangements arising from the substantial increase in claims from EU nationals in recent years.  In the majority of cases the persons involved are already in receipt of a pension from another Member State or country with which the Department has a bilateral agreement. My Department is endeavouring to process these claims as quickly as possible through the use of overtime and the deployment of additional staff from other areas.  In addition, the use of temporary staff to assist in the processing of claims is being considered. Delays in processing claim applications do not result in any losses to pensioners and those who qualify for payment have their claims backdated fully in accordance with the normal provisions for backdating of claims.

The package is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments.  Widows and widowers aged 60 to 65 whose late spouses had been in receipt of the household benefits package retain that entitlement to ensure that households do not suffer a loss of entitlements following the death of a spouse.People aged over 70 years of age can qualify for the household benefits package regardless of their income or household composition.  Those aged under 70 must live alone or only with certain excepted people in order to qualify.  Excepted people for the purposes of the scheme include qualified adults, dependent children under age 18 or under age 22 if in full time education, people who are so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention for at least 12 months; people who would qualify for the allowance in their own right, people who are providing constant care and attention to any member of the household who is so incapacitated as to require constant care and attention for at least 12 months. A range of proposals, have been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package of free schemes. These proposals are kept under review in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	799	The back to education allowance is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and, therefore, their prospects of returning to the active work force. The qualifying period for access to the second level option of the scheme is six months. As the Deputy is aware, I reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option of the scheme to 12 months in the 2005 Budget.  I also increased the annual cost of education allowance, paid to people on BTEA, from €254 to €400.  These changes came into effect from 1 September 2005. Following an undertaking to the Dáil and the Social Affairs Committee, I further reduced the qualifying period for access to the third level option to 9 months. This condition applies to persons who are participating in the National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process and where a FÁS Employment Services Officer recommends pursuance of a third level course of study as essential to the enhancement of the individual's employment prospects.  This new condition also came into effect from 1 September 2005. In the 2006 Budget, I announced that time spent in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance from the Health Services Executive or the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform can count towards the qualifying period for back to education allowance in circumstances where the person establishes an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment prior to commencing an approved course of study.  This provision came into effect from September 2006. In Budget 2007 I extended the entitlement to participate in the back to education scheme to persons losing their employment with an entitlement to statutory redundancy, provided they have an underlying entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment. There will be no need to satisfy the qualifying period normally required.  This enhancement to the scheme recognises their need to retrain at the earliest possible time, in order to re-access the changing labour market. This will be effective from September 2007. I will continue to monitor the scheme but I believe that, overall, the current arrangements ensure that the scheme continues to provide valuable assistance to people who have been out of the workforce for some time and enhances the opportunities of obtaining employment.

A decision to award the Respite Care Grant for 2006 was made by a Deciding Officer on 27 October 2006.  The Respite Care Grant was not awarded in respect of 2005, on the grounds that the person concerned was not so incapacitated as to require full-time care and attention at that time.  The application submitted made it clear that care recipient's medical condition had deteriorated between 2005 and 2006. An error was made in communicating the decision. The person concerned was told that he had been awarded the Respite Care Grant for 2005 and accordingly a cheque for €1,000, the amount of the grant for 2005, was issued to him.  This mistake has now been rectified and the balance of the payment, €200, is being issued to him along with an appeal form in respect of the 2005 grant.  The miscommunication is regretted.

The need to tackle congestion is one of the key aims of Transport 21. Transport 21 provides funding for measures to relieve congestion in the Greater Dublin Area in a number of ways — through the provision of increased public transport services, through investment in improved traffic management systems and the improvement of the road network. Transport 21 will transform the public transport system in the Greater Dublin Area through the development of an integrated network of light rail, Metro, heavy rail and buses running on an expanded Quality Bus Network.  This will lead to almost a doubling of public transport passenger journeys by 2015. This, together with the upgrading of the M50 and new traffic management systems will make a major contribution to reducing congestion in the capital.  The establishment of a Dublin Transport Authority will provide a coordinated approach to the issue of traffic management and will, therefore, result in improvements to traffic flow.

Earlier this week the proposal was considered by EU Transport Ministers at a meeting of the Transport Council and agreement was reached on the general approach to the draft directive.  Essentially, the approach involves requiring HGVs registered since 1 January 2000 to be retrofitted with the enhanced mirrors within three years of the directive coming into force.  Also at the Council, in response to requests from a number of Member States, including Ireland, to include in the proposals measures to address the blind spot to the front of existing HGVs, the Transport Commissioner indicated that the Commission would undertake a study of this particular matter.The proposals cannot be adopted as a directive until such time as they have been considered by the European Parliament and agreed by the Transport Council.    I will await the outcome of the consideration of the proposals by the European institutions before legislating in relation to the retrofitting of mirrors to existing HGVs.

Payment entitlements are not attached to land but are the property of the farmer who was farming during the reference period and was in receipt of direct payments under one or more of the Livestock Premium and/or Arable Aid schemes.Entitlements may now be sold with or without land but can only be sold without land once 80% have been used in one calendar year.  On the other hand entitlements may only be leased to another farmer if accompanied by an equivalent number of hectares of eligible land.  Entitlements may also of course be transferred, with or without land, by gift or through inheritance.  The registration details of entitlements may also be changed (for example from one name to joint names).It is incumbent on my Department to maintain a database of entitlements which contains the name and herd number under which entitlements are registered with a view to ensuring that payment issues to the correct holder(s) of the entitlements in any particular year.  When entitlements are transferred from one farmer to another or when the registration details of the herd number are changed, the parties must complete an application to have the registration details of the entitlements changed.  The application forms to be completed by farmers engaged in transferring or changing the registration details of entitlements are available on my Department's website. In this context, where the registration details of an entire holding are being changed (for example from one name to joint names) within the 10 months period for compliance with the Single Payment Scheme requirements, the parties must complete a separate declaration of undertaking under which the persons being newly registered undertake to succeed to the responsibilities of the original applicant and thereby become entitled to payment.The closing date for receipt of applications to transfer entitlements for 2006 was 16 May 2006 while application to change the registration details within the 10 months period may be accepted at any time during that period.  Some 5614 applications have been received in my Department to transfer entitlements for the 2006 Single Payment Scheme.  Some 1460 of these applications were received after the closing date — many have only been received in recent months.  Since 2006 was the first year that these new arrangements were in place it is understandable that many farmers were unfamiliar with the requirements relating to registration of entitlements.  My Department is making every effort to have all of these applications processed as quickly as possible.  Applications for the sale of entitlements with land or the lease of entitlements must be accompanied by appropriate documentation (copy deed of transfer/lease agreement etc).  In over 50% of cases the required documentation was not furnished with the original applications necessitating further contact with the parties involved.

The aid is to be drawn down on the basis of an aid application, including a detailed restructuring plan, submitted by the sugar processor. In July 2006 the Government made decisions regarding the percentage of the aid to be reserved for beet growers and contractors and the indicative breakdown of the potential allocation of the aid to be followed by Greencore in preparing its restructuring plan.  These decisions are now the subject of judicial review proceedings instituted by Greencore in the High Court and, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment.Subject to the outcome of the Judicial Review, the application and restructuring plan which includes a social plan dealing inter alia with redundancy payments, has been submitted to the EU Commission in accordance with the requirements of the Regulation.I understand that the Commission has not taken a view on compensation for former Greencore workers other than to reiterate the requirements of the Regulation in regard to the restructuring plan.The position remains that there is a dispute between the workers and Greencore over the interpretation of the Labour Court recommendation and resolution of that dispute is a matter in which I have no function. My colleague Mr. Tony Killeen TD, Minister for Labour Affairs, outlined the position regarding the Labour Court recommendation in this House on 25 October 2006 and said that the Court remains available to the parties to advance a resolution to the dispute.

Investments can include purchase or long term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.The person named applied under Category B(i) in relation to investment in land, B(ii) in relation to the purchase of suckler quota  and B(iv) in relation to other investments.  The person named has been deemed successful under B(i) and B(iv) but not under B(ii) as he did not purchase suckler quota during the relevant period.Category D caters for farmers who inherited or purchased land and who commenced farming after 31 December, 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  The person named has been deemed unsuccessful under this category as he is a joint herd owner and the other party to the herd number had received direct payments during the reference years.A formal letter outlining my Department's decision on the National Reserve has issued to the person named and payment will issue shortly.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except, in exceptional cases, where for example, advice or instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired.Under the prescribed terms and conditions of my Department's student maintenance grant schemes, grant assistance may not generally be awarded in respect of a repeat period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not funding was previously awarded. However, the awarding body may waive this provision in exceptional circumstances such as cases of certified serious illness. It should be emphasised, however, that this discretion would generally only be exercised where a candidate is repeating a period of study on the same course.My Department understands from officials at Fingal County Council, the body responsible for the assessment of the candidate referred to by the Deputy, that she previously attended year one of a degree course in 2001/2002 at UCC. She is currently pursuing year one of her current degree course and therefore is ineligible for funding under the terms and conditions of my Department's 2006 HEG Scheme.The candidate will be eligible to be assessed again for maintenance grant when she progresses to the second year of the degree course.

At that time the school was a fully vertical co-educational facility meaning it catered for pupils from Junior Infants to 6th class.  It became a co-educational senior school in September 2005 following the establishment of a corresponding junior co-educational facility.  No cap was ever placed by the Department on the school's enrolments.As the Deputy will be aware, the area in which the school is located is rapidly developing.  The Department has determined that to meet the long term need for pupil places, 2 x twenty four classroom schools are required.  This provision will be made by way of a new greenfield school site for the junior school and an extension to the existing school.  How the extension project can be achieved is a professional matter for the Project Manager who has been appointed by the Department to master plan the sites in question.

I formally established the Board on 17th February 2006 and appointed Mr. Dick Langford, former CEO of City Cork VEC, as Chairperson along with 8 other Board members, four of whom are former residents.The functions of the Board are laid down in Section 25 of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Act 2005. The principal functions are:(a) to pay grants to former residents of institutions and their relatives to assist them in availing of educational services(b) to determine and publish the criteria by reference to which it will make decisions on applications for the payment of such grants, and(c) to make available to the persons aforesaid information in relation to the educational services in respect of which grants are payable.After deducting some €2.5 million expenditure incurred under the ad hoc scheme and allowing for interest of some €0.75 million, the Education Finance Board had a net fund of approximately €11 million at its disposal on establishment.This money is being managed by the National Treasury Management Agency on behalf of the Board.  The Board recently published their criteria for the awarding of grants.As the Board is independent in its functions, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on an individual application before the Board.

The scheme was extended in recentyears to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.Having reviewed a number of applications for home tuition, details regarding the qualifications of some of the proposed tuition providers gave rise to concern.  The Deputies will appreciate, that as home tuition takes place outside of the normal school framework, the need to ensure that tuition providers are appropriately qualified to give education to the children concerned.  The usual requirement is a fully qualified teacher. However, other qualifications are acceptable depending on the individual needs of the child.  A comprehensive review of qualifications has taken place in consultation with my Department's Inspectorate resulting in a definitive list of qualifications acceptable under the scheme as appropriate to the individual pupils.  In this context the clarity that now exists in relation to qualifications should assist the parents concerned in sourcing suitable tutors and there are no current plans to compile a data base of tuition providers.Nominated tuition providers with qualifications other than teaching qualifications had been accepted for the first school term this year to allow time to undertake the review.  Officials in my Department are currently communicating the status of the tuition providers to the parents concerned.  In cases where the tuition provider is not approved a direction is being given to recruit a tuition provider with suitable qualifications. However my Department is prepared to facilitate parents/guardians who experience difficulties in this regard by extending the sanction with the current tuition provider until the end of this school year to facilitate the recruitment process.It is important to stress that the allocation of tuition hours under the scheme was never at issue in the context of the review of qualifications in this regard.

Special Need Assistant (SNA) support is provided specifically to address the care needs of pupils with special educational needs.  The nature and level of support provided is based on the assessed needs of the individual child having regard to the criteria set out in my Department's circulars.The post of Special Need Assistant is often referred to as a classroom assistant post.  However, I should clarify that the posts which are funded on my Department's payroll to provide support for children with special needs are SNA posts and are defined as such both in terms of the payscale which applies and the governing circulars.My Department does not provide funding to schools in respect of a separate category of classroom assistant posts.

Typically this investment involves the provision of modern science facilities in new post-primary schools or the upgrading of science facilities in existing schools either as part of a school building project or as a dedicated investment to facilitate the teaching of science.Additionally I have provided for class materials, basic general equipment and chemicals for practical work for the Sciences.My Department also spent in excess of €13m in 2004 to facilitate the introduction of a revised Junior Science syllabus. Schools received a basic grant of €3,500 per science laboratory to enable them to provide the new curriculum.  Additional funding was made available to schools where other specified equipment was required. In addition, certain schools identified as needing new or refurbished science laboratories as a result of a 1998 national survey received funding. Funding was also available this year to schools that had not originally applied for the basic grant of €3,500 per science laboratory and for other specified equipment to enable them to provide the new curriculum.Schools have also received funding under the Summer Works Scheme in 2004 and 2005 to refurbish science laboratories. In the application for funding under the 2006 Summer Works Scheme post-primary schools were asked to specifically identify and provide details of any science and technology upgrade or refurbishment projects separate from any other projects being applied for so that consideration could be given to approving these projects for 2006.  I approved funding for 26 such projects under the 2006 Summer Works Scheme.The Deputy can be assured that my Department will continue to take a proactive approach in the provision of the necessary facilities for the teaching of science in schools.

The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.In January 2005, the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) issued guidelines to the management authorities of all primary and post primary schools on reporting student absences,suspensions and expulsions.  These guidelines advise that a school must report to the NEWB where a decision has been taken to expel a student.  Schools are also required to periodically report to the NEWB on student absences.  There are seven possible categories of absence which are reported on.As regards the specific data requested by the Deputy on the number of children in the Greater Dublin area, under the age of 16 years, not attending school, I have requested the NEWB to provide this information to me as a matter of urgency. I will reply directly to the Deputy when the data is to hand.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	869	The Higher Education Grants Scheme operates under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. An approved institution is defined to mean a university, college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course, or courses, of not less than two years duration at Undergraduate level and not less than one years duration at Postgraduate level, being a course or courses of which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.The Higher Education Grants Scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the Scheme. The approved institutions are mainly comprised of publicly funded third level institutions. In this regard, the Fitzwilliam Institute is a private college and is not on the list of approved institutions for the purpose of the scheme.Any general extension to the scope of the grants scheme to include private colleges such as The Fitzwilliam Institute can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands and priorities within the education sector. There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private colleges.

The property is vested in the Minister for Finance and is situated in a number of townlands which includes Ballinrush, Ballinvoher, Gortnahown, Killally West, Caherdrinny, Graigue, Skeheen Upper, Glenatlucky, Whitebog, Toor, Killakane, Pollardstown, Ballybeg and Turbeagh. All of the lands in question are used for military training and exercises, including the firing of live ammunition. For land management purposes, 136 acres approximately are let to local farmers on an 11-month basis, a further 76 acres are let to Teagasc at Moorepark, for agricultural research purposes, while the remaining area (excluding the Camp and ancillary infrastructure) in excess of 3,000 acres approximately is grazed by sheep on a per capita basis.There are ten civilian employees attached to the location in question along with one Land Steward and an Assistant Land Steward employed on a full time basis.  During peak training periods, a further four civilians are employed on a contract basis.It is not the practice for security reasons to give details regarding the numbers of military personnel serving at individual military locations.The proposal referred to by the Deputy is currently under examination in my Department.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	871	I am not aware of any such statement.  I assume that the Question relates to the schemes approved for funding and authorised to start in 2007 in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007, published in December 2005.  Local authorities are responsible for the procurement of individual projects and the funding allocated in the Programme is available to Galway County Council for the construction of these schemes.My Department is awaiting the submission of Preliminary Reports, Contract Documents or other necessary information by Galway County Council in relation to the majority of the schemes referred to.  In the remaining cases the Department has such submissions under examination.  Submissions from the Council which are with the Department are been dealt with as quickly as possible.In order to accelerate progress under the Water Services Investment Programme generally, I have introduced a number of measures to streamline the approval procedures.  I have reduced the number of stage approvals local authorities are required to obtain from my Department and also simplified Water Services Pricing Policy procedures and affordability criteria.  I have also introduced a new Project Control System to assist local authorities to adopt a consistent "best practice" approach to managing the planning, procurement and construction stages of all water services projects.I am anxious to see the Galway schemes completed as quickly as possible and my Department is giving every possible assistance to Galway County Council in that regard, including the provision of ongoing funding for two additional engineering posts in the Council's Water Services Section.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	872	I refer to the reply to Question No. 192 of 5 October 2006.Carbon credits will be used by the government for the sole purpose of achieving compliance with Ireland's commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to limit its greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels.The Government has stated its intention to purchase up to a maximum of 3.607 million allowances or credits per annum over the Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008-2012.  Budget 2007 announced a commitment to provide up to €270 million for the purchase of allowances or credits.Following the approval of the Dáil on 30 November, I signed a contract with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development for €20 million to source carbon allowances through the Bank's Multilateral Carbon Credit Fund.   Last Friday I published the Carbon Fund Bill 2006 and this is scheduled for second stage debate on Thursday 14 December.  I am also seeking Dáil approval this week to enter into agreements with the World Bank with a view to an investment of a further €20 million.

The Fund was one of a range of initiatives which I announced to support the ongoing implementation of the National Biodiversity Plan, and is administered by the Heritage Council.A total of €500,000 was allocated to the Fund in 2006 and a similar funding will be made available in 2007.  Details of individual grants paid are available from the Heritage Council and are also available on the Council's website.

The projects assisted include bring bank networks, civic amenity sites, materials recovery, composting and biological treatment facilities.Projects for which grants have been allocated can take a number of years to complete as they go through the various project stages, e.g. design, planning, construction, and consequently claims will be submitted and monies paid typically over a number of years. In 2006 to date, and in respect of projects for which monies have been allocated since 2002, a total drawdown of €7,923,310.83 has been achieved.The projected cost for the scheme in 2007 is €25m.YearPaidLowest PaymentHighest PaymentAverage Payment€€€€20023,657,715.403,630.00528,713.00261,265.3820035,615,698.48742.87686,199.4883,816.39200420,758,554.09381.155,891,400.00266,135.3020056,202,252.582,250.00379,629.59150,051.1920067,923,210.83428.341,208,571.82240,100.32ProjectGrant Allocation€mKernanstown Civic Amenity Facility0.306Bring Banks0.057Bring Banks0.058Bring Banks0.059Plastic Bottle Bring Banks0.039Inagh Civic Amenity0.878Inagh Composting Facility0.495Bring Banks0.144Civic Amenity Facility0.424Bring Banks0.165Raffeen Civic Amenity Facility0.604Bandon Civic Amenity Facility0.481Bring Banks0.197North Strand Civic Amenity0.250Bring Banks0.197Bring Banks0.062Bring Banks0.051Carrowbrowne Composting Facility1.784Bring Banks0.046Ballinasloe Composting Facility0.310Ballinasloe Civic Amenity Facility0.443Clifden Civic Amenity Facility0.257Tuam Civic Amenity Facility0.074Bring Banks0.439Athy Civic Amenity Facility0.950Dunmore Civic Amenity Facility0.315Bring Banks0.142Bring Banks0.028Mountmellick Composting Facility0.090Bring Banks0.038Gortnadroma Composting Facility0.395Bring Banks0.149Bring Banks0.092Bring Banks0.194Bring Banks0.240Rathroeen Civic Amenity Facility0.410Bring Banks0.111Kells Civic Amenity Facility0.407Trim Civic Amenity Facility0.382Scotch Corner Materials Recovery Facility0.086Bring Banks0.085Bring Banks0.092Bring Banks0.287Ballaghveny Civic Amenity Facility0.380Bring Banks0.160Tramore Civic Amenity Facility0.184Dungarvan Civic Amenity Facility0.154Lismore Civic Amenity Facility0.222Tramore Composting Facility0.127Dungarvan Composting Facility0.127Lismore Composting Facility0.105Bring Banks0.136Athlone Civic Amenity Facility0.862Killurin Civic Amenity Facility0.150Bring Banks0.079Total 2002:14.999Bailieboro Civic Amenity Facility0.362Corranure Civic Amenity Facility0.086Ringsend Civic Amenity Facility0.381Materials Recovery Facility0.981Bring Banks0.206Silliot Hill Composting Facility0.522Bring Banks Upgrade0.025Carrick-on-Shannon Civic Amenity Facility0.408Park Road Civic Amenity Facility0.027Kilmallock Civic Amenity Facility0.637Newcastle West Civic Amenity Facility0.820Bring Banks0.058Dundalk Civic Amenity Facility1.035Scotch Corner Materials Recovery Facility (2 projects)0.230Tullamore Civic Amenity Facility1.070Ballaghadereen Civic Amenity Facility0.386Blessington Civic Amenity Facility1.108Total 2003:8.342Ennis Civic Amenity Site0.3Macroom Civic Amenity Site1.8Letterkenny Civic Amenity Site0.754Donegal Town Civic Amenity Site0.345Stranorlar Civic Amenity Site0.510Bring Banks0.319Materials Recovery Facility6.546Manorhamilton Civic Amenity Site0.336Drogheda Civic Amenity Site1.395Cornacass Civic Amenity Site0.772Carrickmacross Civic Amenity Site0.741Tubbercurry Civic Amenity Site0.610Mullingar Civic Amenity Site0.903Bring Banks Upgrade0.064Birr Civic Amenity Site0.772Edenderry Civic Amenity Site0.463Kilcock Civic Amenity Site0.775Kells Civic Amenity Site0.077Ballisodare Green Waste Facility0.45Cashel Civic Amenity Site0.568Cashel Transfer Station0.987In-Vessel Composting0.469Composting Facility2.47Dungarvan Materials Recovery Facility4.68Rosbercon Civic Amenity Site (upgrade)0.150New Ross Civic Amenity Site0.559Total 2004:27.815Shannon Civic Amenity Site0.8Ballyconnell Civic Amenity Site0.45Kinsale Road Landfill (WEEE Acceptance)0.15Northside Civic Amenity Site0.8Raffeen Civic Amenity Site0.53Milford & Dungloe Civic Amenity Sites1.6Ballymount Materials Recovery Facility10Biological Treatment10Coolmine Civic Amenity Site0.54Carrowbrowne Facilities0.7Loughrea Civic Amenity Site0.8WEEE Acceptance Facilities0.045Listowel & Dingle Civic Amenity Sites1.8Athy Civic Amenity Site0.191Kyletalesha Civic Amenity Site0.622Portarlington Civic Amenity Site0.8Mohill Civic Amenity Site0.314Mungret Civic Amenity Site2.605Farnagh Composting Facility0.03Longford Civic Amenity Site0.8Drogheda Civic Amenity Site0.729Kells Civic Amenity Site0.346Roscommon Waste Park2.3Ballaghveny Landfill (WEEE acceptance)0.034Nenagh Civic Amenity Site (WEEE Acceptance)0.027Roscrea Civic Amenity Site0.8New Ross Civic Amenity Site0.6Kilcannon Civic Amenity Site0.8Arklow Civic Amenity Site0.748Wicklow Civic Amenity Site1.113Bray Civic Amenity1.148Total 2005:42.222Shannon Recycling Centre0.8Portable Compactors for Plastics0.142Portable Compactors for Green Waste0.057Estuary Recycling Centre0.635Silliot Hill Composting1.109Drogheda Civic Amenity Site0.671Total 2006:3.414

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.In April 2006, I announced a package of measures to assist local authorities in their work on preparing the 2007/8 Register. These measures included the provision of additional ring-fenced financial resources to support local authorities' own spending in respect of the register campaign and authorities were advised that a contribution of some €6 million can be made available in this regard. €3 million (€92,000 to Mayo County Council) was paid to local authorities in July and a further €2.1 million (€106,109 to Mayo County Council) in register funding is being paid to authorities this month.Local authorities have carried out an extensive and intensive campaign in respect of  the Draft Register for 2007/8, with the information available indicating both significant numbers of additions (379,394) to, and deletions (505,042) from, the Register. Final figures regarding the number of additions to and deletions from the Register will not be known until authorities and County Registrars have completed their work and the final register is published in February. However, on the basis of the work already undertaken, I am satisfied there will be significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	877	Since 1980, my Department has given considerable financial assistance towards remedial works undertaken by Cobh Town Council to strengthen areas susceptible to landslides.   The assistance takes the form of 100% grants, subject to prior approval of the remedial works by my Department.  Since 1980, grants of over €4 million have been paid to Cobh Town Council.As there has been an ongoing programme of works over almost a quarter of a century, periodic review is important.  It is now desirable to quantify the number of projects left to be completed, the estimated completion date and the potential final cost.Cork County Council will take the lead in this review.  A draft brief for the engagement of a specialist advisor in connection with the review has been endorsed by my Department, subject to some adjustments.  Cork County Council has also been advised that, if they are of the opinion that immediate remedial works are essential in the interest of public safety, my Department is prepared to consider a proposal from them.Cork County Council is also free to commit its own resources to meet such works as the council considers necessary.  In this regard, I have announced increased Local Government Fund allocations of almost €948 million in general purpose grants to all local authorities, including Cork County Council and Cobh Town Council.  Cork County Council will receive €54.8 million from the Fund next year (an increase of over 6%)  while Cobh Town Council will receive over €1.3 million (up nearly 8% on its 2006 allocation).
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	878	Waste management services have traditionally been provided at a local level, with individual arrangements being locally determined and tailored to local circumstances.  The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver scheme, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider. Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.  However, my Department has asked local authorities to engage with commercial waste collectors to agree on arrangements to assist lower income households by offering alternatives to periodic lump-sum payments.In August this year, I published a consultation paper on options for future regulation of the waste sector. Submissions were invited on whether there is a need for a regulator for the sector, if so on what model of regulator might be most appropriate and on what powers any such regulator should be given. Among the possible powers discussed in the paper is the power to impose a public service obligation so that services can be provided where they would not otherwise be economically feasible. Following consideration of the submissions received, which is currently underway, I intend to finalise further policy proposals.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The Ennis Town Water Supply Treatment Scheme, which will provide a new water treatment plant for Ennis, is approved for construction in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2005-2007.My Department issued approval to Clare County Council to invite tenders for the scheme in October 2005.  I understand that the closing date set for submission of tenders was 13 October 2006 and that the Council is currently assessing the bids received.The provision of clean drinking water is a fundamental customer service priority for local authorities. Accordingly my Department has emphasised to Clare County Council the need to accelerate the provision of the new treatment plant and to minimise the disruption and inconvenience caused to Ennis consumers by Boil Water Notices.In the meantime and to alleviate the problem, my Department provided the Council with funding for a temporary water treatment plant.  The Council's report to the Department in relation to the latest Boil Water Notice, caused by technical difficulties with the temporary plant, indicates that a tender recommendation for the new permanent plant will be submitted for Departmental approval in the new year with a view to construction starting before the end of the Spring.  I will be closely monitoring progress in that regard.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	887	The development in question is not within any site designated under the Habitats Regulations or the Wildlife Acts.  While Section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976, as amended, protects vegetation from being cut, grubbed, burned or otherwise destroyed during the period from 1 March to 31 August, the legislation also provides for a number of exemptions. For example, section 40 exempts from the provisions the clearance of vegetation in the course of road or other construction works or in the development or preparation of sites on which any building or other structure is intended to be provided.In these circumstances, it would not be practicable at this stage to commit my Department's resources to investigating the matter referred to in the Question.

As such, responsibility for the protection of the structure rests with the County Council to whom detailed queries should be addressed.However, I understand that the County Council has confirmed that while the lodge house alongside the structure named has been damaged (by the arson attempts which the Deputy refers to) the structure itself and two dovecotes are not affected. Kildare County Council has assured my Department that they are arranging 24 hour security which will remain in place for the foreseeable future. In tandem with this, the County Council is also actively developing a strategy for a viable use for the complex thus ensuring its conservation and preservation in the long term.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	893	The main income streams available to local authorities to finance loans raised for capital purposes are general-purpose grants from the Local Government Fund, commercial rates, and miscellaneous receipts from fees and local charges.  Earlier this week, I announced record levels of general-purpose grants for local authorities for 2007.  I allocated a total sum of €948m, representing an increase of €70m or 8% over the record amount provided in 2006 and an increase of some 2.6 times the initial allocation funded in 1997.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-12-14 00:00:00	Prelude	894	Adherence to the grazing restrictions prescribed in a commonage framework plan is a requirement of Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition and therefore a condition for receipt of Single Farm Payments.In the Owenduff/Nephinbeg Special Protection Area (SPA), it is a condition of the Notifiable Actions for the SPA that farmers be in an approved agri-environmental plan.  This is necessary because of the poor condition of the peatland habitat of the SPA generally and the lack of recovery in the commonage area, specifically, since the commonage plans were initially prepared.The REPS scheme, which is administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, is a per hectare payment for commonage lands, regardless of the restrictions, whereas the NPWS farm plan compensated the farmer for the actual loss suffered in farming in the required way.  In the case of destocking, payment in the NPWS scheme is for destocked sheep.In the destocking calculation, all livestock (including cattle) are converted to ewe equivalents.  In the case of commonages, sheep are required to be destocked first in all cases and farmers cannot voluntarily destock cattle instead of sheep.  However, in the rare cases where cattle destocking is an environmental requirement of the farm plan, compensation will also be paid for this destocking.
