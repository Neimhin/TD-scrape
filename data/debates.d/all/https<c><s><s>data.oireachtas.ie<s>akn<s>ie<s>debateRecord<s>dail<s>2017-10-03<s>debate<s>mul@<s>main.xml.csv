#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	On my own behalf and that of my party, I wish to express our deepest sympathies for the families of all those who were murdered or injured in Las Vegas. It was an appalling atrocity with so many innocent people mowed down. At times like this, we are reminded of the extraordinary role of first responders in situations like this and we salute them and their courage in assisting. One hopes that common sense will ultimately prevail and that gun laws in the US are changed. It is extraordinary how so many deadly weapons can end up in the hands of one individual. The hospice movement is one of the most cherished areas of care in our country. Uniquely among our health services, it enjoys almost universal approval. The ethos of care, empathy, dignity and space for families to be with their loved ones is quite remarkable to experience. Over the past number of decades, the advances in palliative care have been quite remarkable encompassing short-term respite, community-based care and end-of-life stage care. We all know that communities throughout the country have helped to sustain them and have fundraised for and supported them. Yet the Government is treating these organisations and others throughout the country in a hard-hearted and deeply cynical manner by, in the first instance, refusing to allocate sufficient funding to them but, worse, compounding that by refusing to allocate funding to cover pay restoration for staff working in these institutions as per the public service pay agreements.During the FEMPI negotiations and the cuts to public service pay, these institutions were told that they had to cut their workers' pay in line with HSE employees. However, they have been given no funding whatsoever to cover pay restoration. These include highly respected centres such as Marymount hospice in Cork, Milford Care Centre in Limerick, St. Joseph's Hospital in Raheny and Galway hospice, which I visited recently. It is not only hospices. There are hundreds of other organisations across the country in a similar situation which provide disability services, addiction counselling, services for carers, organisations such as Barnardos and Barretstown camp for young children with cancer, the Disability Federation of Ireland, the Diabetes Federation of Ireland and as many as 768 others. The Minister's reply to parliamentary questions on this subject is deeply cynical and dishonest. He says that they were not subject to the FEMPI legislation which imposed pay reductions, or the provisions of subsequent public service agreements which provided for pay restoration. Many of these organisations depend on the community. The Taoiseach added insult to injury some months ago by telling me that they would not get pay restoration but that he would not allow them to cut services either. It is not tenable. I ask the Taoiseach if the Government will provide necessary funding to enable hospices, disability organisations, elderly care organisations and many more to pay their employees the same rate of restoration that is allowed for in the public service pay agreement.

In the face of such horror and tragedy, the Irish Government and people stand in solidarity with our friends and families in the United States. I leith a leithéid d'uafáis agus de thragóid, seasann Rialtas na hÉireann agus muintir na hÉireann lenár gcairde sna Stáit Aontaithe. It was not just an attack on the people of the United States but also on citizens from all over the world. I sent a message to President Trump yesterday to express the condolences of the Irish people to the people of America. To answer Deputy Martin's question, everyone in Government, myself included, is aware of the wonderful work that the hospice movement does, not just in hospices themselves but also in hospice home care. We have been very supportive of the hospice movement and the budget for hospices and palliative care has increased every year for the last number of years. For my own part, I was very involved in ensuring that funding was secured for St. Francis Hospice in Blanchardstown so that it could open fully and serve my constituents and others from the north Dublin and Meath region. Deputy Martin knows that his former colleague, former Deputy Brian Lenihan, was essential in ensuring that we got State land on which to build that hospice. I was, in many ways, carrying on his work. He ensured that the land was secured, the community raised the money and, as Minister, I provided funding to open it fully. Castlebar hospice is now under construction. While it is not under construction yet, I know plans for the new hospice in Wicklow are now very advanced, and there are also plans for hospice units in Waterford and Drogheda. There is a definite need for one in the midlands too. That shows real commitment and progress towards providing the option of people ending their days in a hospice where they can die in a dignified way, which is what I think people would want for their friends and loved ones rather than for them to die in a busy hospital ward. Hospice home care is also important, because very few people die at home now and I think many people would wish to die at home if hospice home care was available. That needs to be increased in the years ahead. The issue the Deputy referred to relates to the law around section 38 and section 39 bodies. Section 38 bodies are considered to be part of the public service and therefore people who work in it are public servants, are affected by FEMPI legislation when it goes up or down, and have public sector pensions.Those who work under section 39 provisions, often hospices, charities and other bodies, are not public servants. They are not bound by the rules that apply to public servants and, therefore, they are not directly bound by FEMPI legislation. When salaries are being cut or when salaries are being increased, they are not bound by the rules around public sector pensions. The way those bodies are funded is through a block grant from Government and those bodies have a lot of autonomy to decide how that money is allocated.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	That, in essence, is the dishonesty of the Government's response. Correspondence to me states that as a section 39 body, they were instructed by the HSE to stay in line with the HSE pay scales and apply the cuts as per the Haddington Road agreement. All hospices were so instructed. All of them have communicated to the Minister in this vein, and the other organisations as well. It is not true to say that they were not governed by FEMPI legislation and that they did not have to implement pay cuts under FEMPI agreements. They did. In Marymount hospice, for example, there was a €300,000 deficit in 2017, and it will be higher in 2018. This is on top of a fairly low base, as it stands. In that hospice, for example, the stark statement is made that in its current model, Marymount is not a sustainable entity. I visited a Galway hospital recently and it is the same story there. Words are cheap, but I would have to put it to the Taoiseach that the existing current base is inadequate. The Government's actions, in cynically trotting out this mantra that such organisation are not subject to FEMPI legislation and their employees are not public servants, is dishonest. Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that nurses in a hospice should get less pay than nurses in other parts of the health services or care staff in a hospice should get less pay than those in any other service? The Government is cynically exploiting the volunteers who are keeping these organisations going, from hospice to disability rights, across the board. I have been told that hospice beds will be cut next year if this issue is not addressed. It is time to stop hiding behind that mantra, which is fundamentally dishonest. I ask that the Minister meet the organisations face to face and get this issue resolved because the current position is not sustainable for them and is doing a great disservice to their ethos and to the fact that they are so rooted and so generally applauded in the community.

However, the Deputy rightly stated there are differences in pay. There are differences in pay between the public sector and the private sector. This, if you like, is part of a third sector, a voluntary sector, section 39, which is not part of the public service, and that is where the issue arises.

I am aware of this issue. The Deputy can be assured that section 39 bodies operating in my constituency and elsewhere, such as hospices, have been in contact with us. We are aware of this issue. It is something that will be discussed, and hopefully resolved, as part of the Estimates process. The Deputy should bear in mind, because they are not public bodies, what will be increased is their annual grant. Exactly how that annual grant is distributed between pay, pensions, services and other matters is not controlled directly by Government.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	10	Before I begin, I want also to extend my condolences and those of Sinn Féin to the victims and the bereaved of the horrific mass shooting in Las Vegas on Sunday evening last. Our thoughts are with the victims and their families today. Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhrón a dhéanamh leo go léir. On Sunday, millions of Catalans voted in a referendum on independence. They did so in the face of violent repression on the part of the Spanish state. A Sinn Féin delegation of Senators, Deputies and MEPs were in Catalonia as international observers along with others. They witnessed the coercion at first hand. Old people were assaulted as they tried to enter polling stations. The Spanish police fired plastic bullets into crowds of innocent people simply because they wanted to exercise their right to vote.We should know only too well the horrific consequences of the use of plastic bullets by the British Army in recent years in our country. I want to commend the enormous courage of the Catalan people in their efforts to hold a peaceful referendum. That was a huge achievement in and of itself, organisationally and logistically. Families occupied polling stations and kept them open so that their fellow citizens could vote. Catalan fire fighters formed human shields to protect voters and farmers brought in their tractors to form barricades so that citizens could vote. These were not violent actions and they should not have been met with the violent response they received from the Spanish state. As the Taoiseach knows well, the Speaker of the Catalan Parliament has been prosecuted for holding a debate and a vote in the Parliament on the issue of an independence referendum. The former president and two former ministers have also been prosecuted for organising a non-binding referendum on independence in 2014. Fine Gael has a close connection with the government party in Spain and it is time for the Taoiseach to encourage dialogue. The international community, especially the European Union, has an obligation to ensure that Catalonia can pursue its course of self determination without fear of suppression. Our Government should be to the forefront in defending their right to decide their own future. What they decide is a secondary issue and is entirely a matter for themselves. The refusal to make this case is justified on the basis that these issues are an internal matter for the Spanish state but that is exactly the pretext that was used by the British state for decades to prevent the scrutiny of British rule in the North. It was only when these issues became internationalised that remedies emerged. Will the Taoiseach stand up for the principles of democracy and the right to self determination for the people of Catalonia and will he use his influence and connections with the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr. Mariano Rajoy, to get him to accept mediation as part of the necessary process of talks between his Government and the Catalan people?

Like Deputy Adams, everyone in this House and everyone in Ireland who watched the news on Sunday was horrified at the scenes we saw broadcast from Barcelona and Girona and to see that level of violence happening in what is a European country that has been a democracy since the 1970s. As I said on Monday, violence is never the solution to political disagreements. Violence by state actors, whether it is the police or the army, against unarmed civilians is disproportionate and should not have happened. It is also counterproductive. We know from our own history in this country and from history around the world that when policemen and soldiers use violence against unarmed civilians, it is counterproductive. It causes people to become more radicalised, causes greater nationalism and greater disunity. I hope the Spanish Government will reflect on the historical experiences of many countries in the world when it considers its next course of action into the future. I absolutely agree with the Deputy that dialogue is the right way forward and that is what I would like to see occur in Spain. If I have the opportunity to say that to the Spanish Prime Minister in the weeks ahead, I will certainly take that opportunity.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	14	There is a lot of agreement between us on this issue. The question now is what the Taoiseach is going to do about it. I welcome his commitment to raise this with Prime Minister Rajoy. The people of Spain are our allies. They are friends of Ireland but so too are the people of Catalonia. There are notable links between the Catalan and Irish independence movements. The Taoiseach may know that Terence McSwiney's hunger strike in 1920 inspired the independence movement there. When Terence McSwiney died, organisations from Catalonia wrote to the British Prime Minister condemning the treatment of the Cork mayor and there were mass demonstrations on the streets of Barcelona. We are agreed that we need dialogue and mediation. We are agreed that, as the Taoiseach has outlined, when the State uses violence it leads to more division, disunity and radicalisation.Will the Taoiseach pick up the telephone to Mr. Rajoy to tell him this? His party and that of Mr. Rajoy are sister members of the European People's Party group. Dialogue is what kick-started and sustains the peace process; therefore, I ask him to move on the very welcome statement he has made and raise these issues directly with the Spanish Prime Minister.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	15	I absolutely agree that dialogue is required and that neither violence nor unilateralism is required. Contacts will be made at official level and, when the opportunity is appropriate, I will certainly discuss the matter with the Prime Minister, Mr. Rajoy. I have not yet had the chance to meet him on a one-to-one basis, but we have attended summits together, although he was not at the summit in Tallinn, presumably in anticipation of events that were unfolding in Catalonia. There have been referendums on independence held in other countries and we are all familiar with the referendum in the United Kingdom on Scottish independence and the referendum in Canada on independence for Quebec. On both occasions the referendums happened in accordance with the law of the state. The referendum held in Scotland occurred under the laws of the United Kingdom, while the referendum held in Quebec occurred under the laws of Canada. The referendum in this instance was different in that it did not happen under Spanish law or within the constitutional legal framework of Spain. As a member state of the European Union, we respect the law, the constitution and the territorial integrity of Spain as another member state. If there is to be a referendum held in the future, as was the case in Scotland and Quebec, it should happen within the legal and constitutional framework of the country. Were that to happen, I imagine there would be a very high turnout and it would be considered to be democratically legitimate.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	16	On behalf of the Labour Party, I send my condolences and those of my party to and express solidarity with all those who lost loved ones or are fighting for their lives, injured or affected in any way by the appalling events in Las Vegas. Since taking office, concerns have been raised that the Government prioritises spin over substance. In recent weeks there has been some evidence to give weight to such fears. First, there was the creation of the new strategic communications unit, with an assistant secretary level head and a staff of five members. Incidentally, since the creation of the new unit no press releases have been posted on the Taoiseach's departmental website. We then began to hear about a principal officer-level vacancy being created to head up the communications functions in individual Departments, although it is unclear, so far, how many such individual posts have been created. Together, these changes represent a very significant taxpayer investment in Government communications. The Taoiseach formally told the House that the investment in communications would be cost neutral, but that is only true if the vacancies in question are filled at the expense of other areas of the Civil Service and the public service. It is time that the Taoiseach provided clarity on the number of positions he is creating and the total cost involved.  The creation of these new public sector jobs was a story and in recent weeks we have seen two more stories which cause some concern. The first was the publication of a tender by the Taoiseach's Department, valued at €130,000, plus VAT, each year, for commissioning tracking polls. All political parties invest in tracking polls or polls of some sort to test the public mood on issues, but with this tender it seems that Fine Gael wants to shift the burden away from the party onto the taxpayer. When we were in government, we commissioned research after individual referendum results, but we published the results. I have two questions. First, will the Taoiseach commit to publishing the results of any tracking poll paid for from the public purse? Second, will he set out, in full, the cost of the communications unit and the staff members he is putting in place?

What is the full cost of the communications unit and individuals the Taoiseach has put in place since he took office?

In terms of staffing levels, there will be six staff in the new unit who will be seconded from other areas of the public service. I do not yet know what the net cost will be, but as soon as I do, I will let the Deputy know. I do not know about the staff being employed at departmental level. The Deputy will have to ask the individual Departments about that matter. It is very much my view that communications are a virtue. There is a big deficit in communications between the Government and the general public. The public have a right to know what the Government does, how their taxes are being spent and about the programmes under way. We intend to improve that process. A huge amount of money is spent by the Government and agencies on communications. Approximately 750 staff work across Departments and different agencies in communications and public relations in some way, for which, believe it or not, the total budget is €170 million, much of which is valid. It involves Tourism Ireland marketing Ireland abroad and Bord Bia marketing the food industry. It involves advertisements advising people to attend for their BreastCheck examination or receive the influenza vaccine. It is all very good spending, but a certain proportion of it involves different Departments and agencies advertising their own logos and so on. That is exactly the kind of thing I want to change. It has been done in Britain and the Netherlands where the overall cost of government communications across Departments and agencies has been reduced, but in a much better way. There is huge confusion. Many people do not know whether an agency is part of central government or local government or whether that agency is even a Government body.

The new bypass is, or was, to begin on the western side of Farranfore, bypass Killarney and join the N22 to Cork and the N72 to Mallow at Lissivigeen. Another segment of the scheme is to link Muckross Road to Moll's Gap with the N22 and the N72 also at Lisivigeen. Specific plans are ready and the route has been determined and identified by the very capable staff of the National Roads Authority or Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, as it is now known, and in the national roads design office in Castleisland. The new bypass is critically important to the town of Killarney and the county of Kerry. From early May to late September every year traffic jams are a regular occurrence, especially in the morning and the evening, with people being left to sit in cars on Muckross Road, Hans Liebherr Road, Mission Road, the Tralee road to Cleeny Roundabout and the N22 from Roadstone Wood Limited's quarry at Minish all the way into town. If the bypass was in place, it would help to eliminate most of the accidents and the slaughter that occurs at the dangerous junctions around Killarney, namely, that at the top of Lewis Road, Madam's Hill junction, the Woodlawn Road-Clasheen junction and at Coolcaslagh, as well as the very dangerous junction in Farranfore village heading for Firies and Currow. Killarney is, without question, the tourism capital of the world. Built by many great local families and businesspeople, it operates the very best of hotels, restaurants, bars and souvenir shops. It has jarveys, bus operators, bicycle shops and the wonderful INEC events centre, ably assisted by the Tidy Towns committees and the chamber of commerce. The existing bypass linking Muckross Road with the Tralee road at Cleeny Roundabout is now recognised by engineers and management of Kerry County Council to be operating at maximum capacity, carrying more than 18,600 vehicles daily. Figures recorded also indicate that 12,000 vehicles pass through Farranfore daily. A total of 12,000 vehicles also use Muckross Road. The scheme which has been suspended for many years needs to be reactivated urgently.

The House will know that between 2011 and 2014 I had the pleasure to be Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. Therefore, I know the road very well having travelled up and down to Killarney many times. I have also been stuck in Macroom having had to pass through Ballyvourney and other towns.

There was a heritage case or a case involving property that held it up. The Government is keen to progress the N22 bypass project which would connect Killarney, Ballyvourney and Macroom, but I cannot make any commitment to the Deputy today. However, we are in the process of allocating additional capital resources to announced in the budget next week and the subsequent ten-year plan. I am keen to see the road project move to construction as soon as possible.

I am referring to the bypass which will link Tralee and Cork without the need to pass through Killarney. IBEC has told us clearly that Ireland has the fewest number of infrastructural projects in Europe, either under way or ready to go. Most of the country, with the exception of Dublin, is standing still. I call on the Taoiseach and the new Minister of State with responsibility for transport, Deputy Brendan Griffin, to reactivate the Killarney bypass scheme and give fair play to the people of Killarney and County Kerry. Give them a chance to breathe because the town is choking and we badly need the bypass for reasons of access and safety.Will the Taoiseach look at it as I can see now he did not understand what I asked about in the first place. This is a very important matter for the people of Kerry. It was meant to be finished in 2009 and we know what happened to the country. Will the Taoiseach reactivate this because it is a very important project for the people of Kerry?

I opened the three bypasses at Dingle, Castleisland and Tralee myself a few years ago. I would have to check with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport what is the exact status of the project. There will be further allocations for road spending as part of the ten-year capital plan. Under what we are planning already, there will be an additional €4.1 billion in capital spending over the next number of years. We will see capital spending - investment in infrastructure in Ireland - increasing by approximately 70% to 80% over the next number of years, bringing us from being one of the lowest spending countries in terms of infrastructure to one of the highest spending in the European Union by 2021. If I look back just over the past five years and what has been done, we have connected the Luas lines and joined them to the mainline rail network. That will open in December to passengers.

That is too late. The referendum took place on Sunday. There were quite unprecedented scenes of police repression, attempts to shut down a referendum which was taking place, the stealing of ballot boxes and so on. Up to 1,000 people were injured. This was ordered by the Rajoy government. A general strike is taking place today in protest against those measures. We should have a debate this week. It does not have to be today. It can be tomorrow morning or Thursday morning. The Government should have the opportunity to clearly condemn the violence that took place, which was ordered by the sister party of Fine Gael in Spain.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	70	The Taoiseach will be aware of the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that at least 9,500 Permanent Defence Forces personnel and a full strength reserve is in place. Fianna Fáil has highlighted the poor pay and conditions in the Defence Forces, and it is coming home to roost as significant numbers are leaving the Defence Forces on a regular basis. Those leaving are from across the range, from highly skilled IT personnel, traffic control and bomb disposal. There has been a severe impact on the bomb disposal unit. The force is at its lowest strength in 50 years. PDFORRA is meeting today in Cavan. It has said that 2,900 members took early retirement and approximately 1,000 of those had to pay the State a discharge purchase. I would ask how the Government proposes to fulfil its commitment in the programme for Government to ensure that there is up to 9,500 in the Permanent Defence Forces given the very poor retention rates of those who join.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	71	The Government is very much committed to achieving a target of 9,500 personnel in our Permanent Defence Forces. In doing so, we are going to recruit 800 personnel this year, but as the Deputy points out very accurately, a large number of people leave the Defence Forces every year. Roughly 580 leave every year, and that has been the case for the past decade. Other militaries, such as that of the United Kingdom, are experiencing similar issues. It is a normal feature of military organisations to have quite a high turnover of personnel. We will recruit 800 to the Defence Forces this year. We have a particular issue around those with particular skills which are very valuable in the private sector, and with the economy recovering we are losing personnel from groups such as pilots, air traffic controllers and other skilled people to the private sector.This afternoon, however, at the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, conference, the Minister of State with responsibility for Defence, Deputy Kehoe, will announce a series of measures relating to contracts, promotions and the working time directive aimed at further increasing the attractiveness of the Defence Forces as a career option. One example of the impact of pay restoration is that newly qualified three star privates and their naval equivalents can now expect to earn €27,000 a year, up from €21,000 a year when pay restoration began.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	72	I want to ask about the employment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill. Two weeks ago the Taoiseach restated his commitment to ending zero-hour contracts. While I welcome that, the Government has not published the Bill which is also supposed to deal with low hour contracts, banded hours and related matters. The real issue for many workers is low hour and "if and when" contracts which are creating serious insecurity for families. Deputy Cullinane of Sinn Féin has successfully steered the Banded Hours Contract Bill 2016 through the Dáil and through a rigorous pre-legislative scrutiny in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. The committee produced a report and backed the Bill with amendments. Will the Taoiseach agree to support the Sinn Féin Bill and, if not, will the Government publish the employment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill as soon as possible?

It is often an invisible social menace but it is a real and damaging one.

Will the Government advance the Bill because this is one of the most pressing social issues that needs a legislative response from this House?
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	75	I agree with the Deputy and thank him for his question. The general scheme of the Bill was published in 2013. We carried out further research, published last February, which showed the need to update the scheme and that work continues. The Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality recently and the committee has returned it without any comment following pre-legislative scrutiny. We are doing some minor work on that to deal with gambling control. I was hoping to publish it this term but unfortunately it has not been possible to publish the general Bill. I hope we will do that next term. Meanwhile, we are considering setting up a regulator in shadow format to kick start the work that needs to be done in this area.

I hope he will brief himself on the agricultural situation because the programme for Government makes explicit commitments to supporting agriculture. This is a hardy annual: every year the slurry spreading deadline, 15 October, comes up. With so much bad weather this year, as in many other years, farmers cannot possibly empty their slurry and make best use of it. Spreading it in wet weather causes pollution. This is ridiculous. It should never have been based on a calendar month. It should be based on climatic conditions. Will the Taoiseach direct the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and maybe the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the three who have passed this around, to see sense and allow it to be done in good weather and not in conditions that are appalling?

The runway is at capacity. Over 18 months ago, the EU issued a directive instructing that we make an independent body a competent authority to deal with noise regulations. The airport authority needs to know who this is, as do the local residents who are concerned about the construction of a second runway. We were advised 12 months ago that it would be the Irish Aviation Authority, but last week in this Chamber, a year on, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport was unable to say if it would still be the Irish Aviation Authority, if there would be a statutory instrument and if primary legislation would be needed to make this independent body a competent authority. Can the Taoiseach confirm who will be the competent authority to deal with this EU directive and will it be done by way of Statutory Instrument or primary legislation, so that it is put on the books of the Oireachtas?

It could be a statutory instrument and primary legislation.

After it was introduced, we were delighted that it was there, but it is not fit for purpose, especially for those who are retired, unemployed, or on disability payments. Some 80% of tenants in the country are debarred from the scheme. It is crazy, inoperable and it does not help the people who we would want to be able to purchase their homes.They have been in these houses for many years and want to purchase them, but they are debarred from doing so because of the rules and the restrictive nature of the scheme. I thank the Taoiseach for introducing it, but will he, please, alter it to make it more usable for tenants in local authority houses?

The scheme is showing up some anomalies, whereby people who have been living in those houses for many years and who, through various mechanisms, including family support provisions, are in a position to buy them are not allowed to do so. They deserve the opportunity to buy them for themselves and their families. The scheme should be looked at to accommodate those with a genuine reason to be in a position, with the provision of family support, to buy those houses.

One thing we always have to bear in mind when it comes to the matter of tenant purchase is that in the past we sold off much of the social housing stock and that we are in the process of building up the stock of public or social housing again. We need to have regard to this when it comes to the matter of tenant purchase in order that we do not end up in a situation where tenants purchase what used to be public houses and then sell them on to somebody else and the net effect will be a reduction in the social housing stock. This is something we must bear in mind from a public policy point of view.

Last month revelations by Médecins Sans Frontières, MSF, highlighted the abhorrent conditions, including torture, exploitation, rape and systematic abuse, being faced by migrants, refugees and asylum seekers in official Libyan detention centres. Earlier this month, on 7 September, MSF wrote to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, as well as to all Heads of Government in Europe. Has the Taoiseach yet met MSF to discuss this matter? Will he instruct the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to review Ireland's participation in the EU capacity building and migration management policies in Libya? Will he bring this urgent matter to the attention of his European counterparts at the European Council?

The way European Council meetings work is there is an agreed agenda with certain points; it is not a case of being able to raise anything one wants to raise.

We have since been unable to progress it because the Minister responsible has not brought forward the necessary money message and because the then Minister indicated that he wanted to consult the Attorney General to consider the text of the legislation. Will the Taoiseach explain to the House why the Government is deliberately delaying the progress of the Bill through the housing committee? Will he tell us when the necessary money message and the Attorney General's advice will be progressed in order that we can do the work we have been asked to do at the housing committee?

In light of the decision by the health authority to refuse access to Translarna for children suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, what prospect have those children of receiving the drug and increasing their ability to stay ambulant for up to ten or 15 years of their lives? It is a very serious issue. We have got some meetings with PTC Therapeutics and the families involved later today. As we speak, the avenues of communication seem to be closed off. I ask the Taoiseach to liaise with his colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to try to get this issue back on the agenda and resolved.

There are a number of key issues but I will focus on just two for now, the first being a commitment to reduce the pupil-teacher ratio and the other being related to an increase in the capitation grants, which is badly needed for every school considering the very many bills they have to pay. Will there be any progress on that? I bring the Taoiseach's attention to a situation in Kildare. At least when we are talking about capitation grants, we are talking about circumstances where there is a school but, for many children approaching secondary school age, there is no school to meet the demand. It is very important that we make provision in this regard. The recent census shows that all of the statistics prove the case that exists for a new secondary school in south Kildare.

No progress has yet been made on this despite its being subject to a key commitment in the confidence and supply agreement. It is very important, not just to this party but also to the country as a whole. It is also a commitment in the programme for Government. I would certainly like to hear something substantial from the Minister on it. It is the one thing in the Government's action plan on education for which there is no action plan. We would like to hear more detail on it and get something happening next week. We would like some kind of detailed progress plan that can give people some expectation as to how the Government will deal with this issue.

There is a commitment in it to address the primary school pupil-teacher ratio and capitation levels. In the previous two Septembers we increased the number of teachers in our schools by almost 5,000. We have made a very significant investment in additional teachers, including special educational needs, guidance counselling, support for the new junior cycle and middle management posts. All these areas are high priority. I can assure the Deputies that in the forthcoming capital plan and in allocations in future years for current spending I will seek to prioritise very obvious needs in the education system after what was close to a decade during which very little investment could be made. It is a question of fitting within the budget framework each year.

I expressed the view of the Government, which is that we do not just export our products; we export our standards, and we would expect that the standards should be the same in the Mercosur countries as they are in Europe when it comes to animal health, animal welfare, traceability, safety and other matters. I also expressed our view that the volumes should be limited and any such offer on that scale would not be supported by Ireland.

I understand Ministers had indicated that the fair deal scheme would be dealt with in the upcoming budget. It is my understanding that only last week the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, met the IFA regarding this issue. Reports in the media suggest that he has committed to a three-year cap on the charges against property. When will this be introduced? Has it been approved by the Attorney General? If so, what is the timeframe involved? Many people with small businesses and family farms are struggling to meet the costs of nursing home care in order to take care of their loved ones. It is high time that we did something about this issue.

We are nearing a resolution. It does not require the approval of the Attorney General. Rather, it requires the approval of the Government which may act on the advice of the Attorney General. Such a change would also require primary legislation and an amendment to the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act by the Oireachtas. Realistically, it will be months before the issue can be fully resolved.

On previous occasions, oral questions were always taken on Wednesday, the day after the budget.

The committee worked tirelessly and held a number of sittings and meetings to discuss the Bill. It met with over a dozen groups, including the Law Society, trade unions and business groups. The committee produced a report that made 21 recommendations to strengthen the Bill. As someone who attended two of the meetings and addressed the committee on both occasions to discuss the recommendations for the different groups, I support and accept all the amendments that have been made in the report. We are seeking to move this Bill forward. I understand that since we published our Bill, and notwithstanding the Government rubbishing our Bill and saying there was no need for such a Bill, it is now talking about a Bill of its own. We do not believe that is necessary. We believe the right thing to do is to support our Bill with the amendments that have been made and actually deal with the real issue. What the Government is talking about is banning zero-hour contracts, which is not the real issue. The real issue is "if and when" contracts and low-hour contracts. That is where the exploitation and problem reside and that is the issue that needs to be resolved. The Labour Court recently suspended a case between Dunnes Stores and the Mandate trade union for six months pending the passing of my Bill into law so there is a clear need for this legislation to be moved on. It is an issue that is important to many working people. Of course, we would support ending zero-hour contracts but the University of Limerick study, which was commissioned by the previous Government and which examined this issue in detail, was very clear that the biggest issue facing workers was "if and when" contracts.

As outlined to the House in July, the Government agreed a new streamlined Cabinet committee structure and approved the establishment of six new committees, one of which is Cabinet Committee C. This Cabinet committee will cover issues relating to the European Union and will assist the Government in its ongoing consideration of Brexit. Cabinet Committee C will also support the Taoiseach's participation as a member of the European Council. The Cabinet committee, which I chair, met on 11 September. The date of the next meeting of Cabinet Committee C has not yet been confirmed. However, we will have a special Cabinet meeting next week to discuss Brexit given the upcoming European Council meeting the following week.  Preparing for and dealing with Brexit in a way that delivers the best possible outcome for the country remains a top priority for the Government. Its potential consequences cut across very many areas of our national and economic life and it is being dealt with in a whole-of-Government way, including through Cabinet Committee C, as well as at Cabinet itself and last week at the all-island civic dialogue. Issues affecting the island of Ireland are being given priority and considerable attention by the EU task force led by Michel Barnier and by our EU partners. They share fully our concerns and approach and are working to ensure that progress is made on the Irish issues in the negotiations with the UK.

I was concerned, and I would like to know whether the Taoiseach was concerned, by weekend reports in some Sunday newspapers. For example, a survey of staff in the European Medicines Agency in London showed that Dublin ranked seventh in terms of being a preferred city for the agency to move to. Dublin ranked well below Amsterdam, Barcelona, Vienna, Milan and Copenhagen. I think the report appeared in The Sunday Times. Does this concern the Taoiseach? The report said that 45% of the staff were reluctant to move to Dublin. Most workers and professionals in large European cities expect to have public transport. In respect of the Taoiseach's leadership role on this committee, what has he asked the committee to do to protect Irish interests and jobs and our share of European agencies?

Article 1 of the UN Charter and all international law clearly defines self-determination. It is the right of people to "freely to determine, without external interference, their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development." That right has been violently suppressed by the Spanish state. While there has been some mealy-mouthed criticism of violence in general, there has been no straightforward condemnation, and there should be, by the Government and European leaders of the brutal suppression of a democratic exercise in the right to self-determination.That is at stake. We would not accept if the British state stated people in England or Wales had the right to determine whether Scottish people had independence, yet comments made by the Taoiseach and other European leaders appear to stand over the right of the centralised Spanish state to suppress the right of the people of Catalonia to self-determination. It is shocking in its hypocrisy for the European Union that goes on and on about its commitment to human rights to stand idly by while the Spanish state uses the most savage means to crush a democratic exercise in self-determination. Is the Taoiseach going to come out clearly and stand up for the right of people to democratically decide their own political future, while not taking sides on which way they should vote?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	159	Last week direct questions were put to the Taoiseach about Brexit, but he avoided answering them beyond vague generalities. I want to ask him a very simple but important question which I asked last week. Has he proposed to the British Government or European Union partners that Northern Ireland receive special economic status following Brexit? He has said he will not propose any border arrangement and seems to have delayed work by the Revenue Commissioners on the matter. What exactly does he propose? One media statement by the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, that the Border be moved to the Irish Sea was rejected by the North and does not appear to have been formally followed up. Once again, given that the Tory Government states it wants the United Kingdom to leave both the Single Market and the customs union, has the Taoiseach made specific proposals on the status of Northern Ireland? Given that there was a summit last week, it is surprising that the Taoiseach did not make himself available in this House for statements either before or after the summit. While he did not make himself available here to talk about the summit, he managed to bring a party person with him to take videos of him on the Government jet and at a meeting at the Irish Embassy in Tallinn. These videos were first published on the Fine Gael website; clearly, therefore, they have no official status. Does the Taoiseach think this type of party politicisation of a Government event is acceptable? While his personal obsession with media management is clear, why did he decide to break from the practice of his predecessors and use formal European Union business for purely party political purposes? There is an important distinction to be made in the Taoiseach attending summit meetings on behalf of the people as head of Government, not as the leader of a mere political party.

On the EU summit in Tallinn, I note that it was agreed that the European Union would be a global leader in the digital economy and that the leaders were committed to finalising the digital Single Market within a year. Will the Taoiseach provide a progress report on the matter? It is an important aspect of the European Union's agenda and we need to know how Ireland is shaping up in the completion of the digital Single Market. On the future of Europe, there have been three significant speeches recently, one by the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker; one by French President Emmanuel Macron and one by the German Chancellor Angela Merkel who supported the views of the French President. A vision for Europe is being set out. I would welcome the Taoiseach's views on how it is proceeding and how we will provide an input. Many are saying many things and the future of Europe is up for grabs. Ireland needs to be clear on where it stands in all of these debates. I know that momentum is building on the issue of corporate tax harmonisation, which is of concern to Ireland. Perhaps, in the Taoiseach's limited time here this afternoon, he might give us his views on the future of Europe, the vision outlined by the various leaders in the last few weeks and, in particular, where Ireland stands on these issues.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	161	I also think the Cabinet committee on Brexit needs to meet more often. We look forward to hearing the outcome of the Taoiseach's special Cabinet meeting on the issue. He will know that today the European Parliament passed a significant resolution on the current state of the Brexit negotiations. It specifically states there has not been sufficient progress in the negotiations on citizens' rights, Ireland and the settlement of the British Government's financial obligations. It calls on the European Council, unless there is a breakthrough, not to move into discussions on new trade arrangements with Britain. It is clear from the resolution which was supported by Sinn Féin's four MEPs that the European Parliament believes Britain has refused to detail how it plans to resolve its financial settlement or divorce bill and how it plans to deal with the Border or the rights of European citizens. I was concerned about the positivity of some of the Taoisearch's remarks after his recent meeting with Prime Minister May. It was not anything he said but the effort to put a positive spin on what she had said when it was clear that what she had set out what was not sufficient and that, in particular, she was in breach of her obligations under the Good Friday Agreement. Does the Taoiseach accept the assertion, which is reaffirmed in the European Parliament resolution, that Britain must provide a solution that will ensure full compliance with the Good Friday Agreement? Does he also accept - he has not yet said this - that the North has to remain within the internal market and the customs union? We have been arguing for designated status for the North within the European Union, which is essentially what the people voted for; they voted against Brexit. It seems that the Government's position is to support special arrangements for the North outside the European Union, something which just would not work. Will the Taoiseach use the opportunity presented by the European Council meeting later this month to lobby for special status for the North within the European Union?

They are of value, but the value is limited because we do not yet know what Brexit means. We do not know what the new trading relationship will be between the United Kingdom and the European Union. All the analyses can do is consider various potential scenarios and try to map out the impact they may have on job creation. They are of value, but it is, unfortunately, limited. The Government is seeking the relocation here of the European Medicines Agency, EMA, and the European Banking Authority. We have put Ireland forward as a candidate country for these institutions and a further presentation will be made in Brussels this week. We have fallen down on the matter of video conferencing where the EMA is concerned, but we believe we can resolve that issue before the meeting. We are doing well overall on job creation. Today the unemployment rate is approximately 6.1%. We already have an EU agency located in Loughlinstown, Eurofound, with which Deputy Joan Burton will be familiar. The events in Catalonia were discussed at the Cabinet meeting this morning. It is not intended to discuss the matter at the Cabinet sub-committee too. I answered questions about it in more detail earlier.

All of these contributions are welcome. In the 36 seconds I have left, I am not in a position to outline my own thoughts on the future of Europe debate. Suffice to say that I think we should be engaged in it. Ireland is a founder member of the euro and a founder member of the Single Market. We took a decision a long time ago that our place was at the heart of Europe and in my view, we should stay there. When we approach this debate about future integration, we should always answer the question, not with what we are against or what we are going to try and block, but rather what we are for. There are lots of things we are for. For example, we are very much for the banking union and a capital markets union.

I understand what Deputy Adams is saying but from the way he speaks, he does not quite understand the situation. This is a negotiation. The Government of Ireland is not in a position to insist or make demands on anyone, whether it is the European Union as a whole or the United Kingdom. Making demands is a form of politics. It is not a form of negotiation. One can demand all one likes. It does not result in an outcome.

While in Canada recently I announced a plan to double Ireland's global footprint by 2025. Work is now under way, involving relevant Departments and agencies, to develop a fully worked-through plan for consideration by the Government later this year. The plan, which will take a strategic approach, will identify locations or areas that should be an immediate focus, as well as those which should be part of our medium-term plans to 2025. It will also include consideration of the resource implications, including identifying where efficiencies can be achieved through innovative approaches and potential savings. Increasing our global footprint will involve new and augmented diplomatic missions, as well as an increased presence and investment in and by tourism, cultural and food agencies. There is a new self-confidence in Ireland, as an island at the centre of the world. That national self-confidence requires that we should be ambitious, visible and active in promoting our interests and values on the international stage. This initiative will support our efforts to diversify and grow trade, particularly as we seek to overcome the challenges of Brexit; it will enhance our ability to attract tourism and investment to Ireland; it will help us to strengthen links with our diaspora; and to advance our values, interests, reputation and impact internationally.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	189	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. It is clear from the reply that this commitment was one of the Taoiseach's soft August stories designed to give the appearance of activity without doing anything concrete. Since before the Brexit referendum, Fianna Fáil has been calling for a significant increase in overseas staff, both to overseas missions and to the enterprise agencies, including IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and Fáilte Ireland. I have been of the view that we simply do not have enough staff on the ground. It is extraordinary that an announcement of this kind was made, for example, when a number of years ago the Embassy in Tehran was closed, along with that in the Vatican and others. It seems from the Taoiseach's reply that his announcement was not based on any policy agreed by Cabinet. It was not based on any specific numbers or costs, or recruitment schedules or anything like that. It was essentially blurted out in Canada without any homework at all being done. What the Taoiseach seems to be indicating is the work has now begun well after the announcement. I called last year for a detailed staffing audit and future plan. Has that audit been undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and, indeed, by the Taoiseach's own Department because I asked separately for a complete review of the Department of the Taoiseach and its needs in relation to Brexit? The Taoiseach will be aware that Deputy Donnelly, who has done a lot of good work on this, discovered through a series of probing parliamentary questions that most of the agencies had not even filled the additional staff allocations they had received in respect of Brexit and the staff had not been hired. It is that disconnect between the reality of what is happening in the here and now and the grandiose announcements that we will be doubling our global footprint some time in the distant future. We need to get with delivery and executing what we have agreed in the immediate and short terms. That would give the people some confidence that propagandistic announcements that are made from time to time will be realised. People are becoming cynical and sceptical about statements that in five years' time this will happen and in six years' time that will happen. We had all of that in terms of universal health insurance and other issues. Has the Taoiseach finished the review of the Department of the Taoiseach and what has he decided as a result of that particular review?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	190	Gabhaim buíochas leis an Taoiseach as ucht a chuid freagra. The Ireland's Global Footprint 2025 plan is lacking in detail about its implementation. No one could argue with the intentions of the plan - attracting greater investment, boosting tourism and trade, building stronger links with the diaspora and increasing cultural exchanges. These are aims that Sinn Féin certainly supports. The notion of increased diplomatic and international agency services will increase the likelihood of delivery, but there is no timeframe that I am conscious of. Could the Taoiseach tell us what timeframe there may be? How will the increases in staff be divided between the diplomatic service and agencies, such as IDA Ireland and Fáilte Ireland? Has the Government reached any preliminary decision as to where new embassies might be opened? Against this backdrop we have the shifting dynamics within the European Union and we have Brexit. The Taoiseach will have noted the French President's call recently for the need for increased and accelerated EU integration, tax harmonisation and further EU military co-operation. President Macron spoke about a two-tier Europe, a sovereign Europe with its own separate parliament for members of the eurozone who will have their own finance minister, and he wants a single EU corporate tax band. This is the federalist dream, but it also is flying directly in the face of the so-called guarantees that were secured by the Irish Government in the aftermath of the rejection of the Lisbon treaty in 2009. If the French President's plan comes to fruition there will be little need for an Ireland's Global Footprint 2025 plan. I ask the Taoiseach to give us more details on his Canadian statement? Also, what is the Taoiseach's view of what the French President has said and did he raise these issues at the EU digital summit in Estonia last week?

I would like to know if expanding Ireland's footprint globally includes meeting our commitments on overseas development aid. This would require a very substantial uplift in the work that is being done by the Irish programme in a number of countries, particularly a number of very poor countries in Africa where the focus is to try and assist people, particularly women and children, many of whom are in extreme poverty. We gave an undertaking as a country a long time ago to a 0.7% of GDP commitment for overseas development aid. In this plan to expand our footprint, has the Taoiseach made any specific proposals that we would reach that commitment?We are now falling behind for the good reason that the economy is expanding again but I assume it will not take five, ten or 15 years to reach the commitment. I ask the Taoiseach to give the House an indication of where overseas development aid and support for the work of organisations like Trócaire, whose representatives were in this House last week, actually fits in.

When I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I had the opportunity to travel to all parts of the world promoting aviation and tourism in particular, as well as doing other work including general Government representation and IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland work, as part of that travel. I was always extraordinarily impressed by the quality of the staff we had on the ground, our diplomats and the people working for our agencies. It occurred to me that we needed a lot more of them and that it would be a good investment by our country to expand our diplomatic presence and the footprint of IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Tourism Ireland, Bord Bia and our cultural agencies. Now that I hold the office of Taoiseach, I intend to do something about it and make it a reality. I did not set this out as an August story. It was first proposed back in May or June in a document which I published entitled, "Taking Ireland Forward". I expanded on it in the speech I made in Toronto in Canada and set the task to my Ministers, the line Ministers, to draw up that plan so that it can be agreed by Government and published by the end of the year. The intention is, over the period 2018 to 2025, to double our global footprint. That does not necessarily mean a doubling of agencies, staff or budgets but, in the round, that is what it does mean - a doubling of our global presence. It will, of course, involve extra embassies but not necessarily a doubling of the exact number of embassies. In some countries we might expand the embassies, for example, while in other countries we may create-----

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	194	That is exactly what it will do. That is what the document will detail but for example, in the case of our embassies, there are many ways that we can double our diplomatic presence. We could just open the exact same number of embassies again or, in some places, we might decide to build up the embassy. We have a lot of embassies that only have one or two members of staff where we might go to four, for example. In a lot of countries the staff are only able to cover the capital and very rarely get to other parts of the country and that is something I would like to see changed. We have already allocated funding for extra staff for IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia. The Deputy is correct in saying that there have been delays in recruiting same but they are being recruited. Indeed, just as I arrived in Canada, an additional Enterprise Ireland staff member had just been recruited. The speech made by President Macron was, of course, discussed in Tallinn. The major topic of discussion on the Thursday night in Tallinn was the future of Europe and during that debate we discussed President Macron's vision for the future of Europe, Jean Claude Junker's state of the Union speech and the speech made by Prime Minister Theresa May in Florence. I am not in a position to go through in detail all of the suggestions that President Macron made but it is fair to say that I would agree with some and disagree with others. We will have time to go into that in more detail in the future.  This plan does not cover our international development aid commitments. It is not about that but we will need a separate plan in that area. I am familiar with Deputy Burton's excellent work as a former Minister of State with responsibility for that area in the 1990s. We are now very far behind in honouring the commitment to reach 0.7% of GNP or GNI*, as the case may be. I think we are at about 0.33% at the moment so we would need to double our budget, which would be an increase in overseas development aid spending of something like €600 million or €700 million per year, which is a lot of money. That is not the kind of thing we could do in a couple of years but I would certainly like us to set out a schedule as to how we might to do that in a realistic timeframe and then hold ourselves to account on an annual or biannual basis.

At the invitation of the Canadian Prime Minister, Justin Trudeau, I visited Canada between 19 and 23 August. The visit was an excellent opportunity to further deepen the very important economic and cultural links that exist between our two countries. My visit commenced in Montréal with an official welcoming ceremony and a bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister, during which we discussed the provisional implementation of CETA, which came into effect on 21 September. Both of us recognise and welcome the benefits that this agreement will have for the Canadian and Irish economies, in terms of job creation and revenue for our taxpayers. We discussed the latest developments on Brexit and Ireland’s priorities in the negotiations. Prime Minister Trudeau updated me on the latest state of play with regards to the NAFTA renegotiations with the United States and Mexico. In the context of a wider conversation on health care, I updated the Prime Minister on plans to hold a constitutional referendum on the Eighth Amendment. We also discussed climate change and reaffirmed both our countries’ commitment to the Paris Agreement. Following our meeting, Prime Minister Trudeau and I walked together in the Fierté parade, where I also had the opportunity to meet informally with the Mayor of Montréal and the Premier of Quebec. I also met leaders and representatives of the Irish community in Montréal and the wider Quebec region before travelling to Toronto. In Toronto I had a number of business engagements including a business breakfast event hosted by Enterprise Ireland, the Ireland Canada Chamber of Commerce and the Ireland Funds, which was attended by over 150 people. I also hosted a Tourism Ireland round table event with representatives of the travel industry and airlines and had a number of individual meetings with IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland client companies. During my visit, the IDA client company Toronto Dominion Bank announced an expansion of its European operations. The bank has chosen Dublin as its post-Brexit EU hub and I am glad to report that it will also establish a bond trading unit here. At an Irish community reception hosted by Ambassador Kelly I had the opportunity to meet with political and community leaders and members of the Irish diaspora, including representatives of the Irish Canadian Immigration Centre. Also in Toronto, I had the pleasure of attending a ceremony to mark the start of construction of the new Dr. George Robert Grasett Park, which will be a memorial to the medical staff who gave their lives to aid Irish Famine victims in the 1840s. I also travelled to the US-Canada border where I was briefed on customs arrangements there. While they employ a range of mechanisms to ensure smooth and efficient customs processing, it was patently clear to me that this was not a satisfactory model for border arrangements - if any - on this island after Brexit. Finally, I also had a number of international media engagements. Overall, my visit to Canada was extremely positive and an excellent opportunity to further develop the strong links between our two countries.

We have been talking about Brexit, on and off, over a very long period of time. All of us are concerned about the huge threat to jobs that it poses, particularly in the North. The imposition by the US of a 219% tariff on Bombardier in the context of its ongoing dispute with Boeing is probably the worst possible example of what the free trade regime might look like in the context of a total British exit from the EU, particularly with regard to Northern Ireland. I know the Taoiseach has expressed his friendship to the Canadian Prime Minister both here and in Canada. The Boeing, Bombardier issue was well flagged at the time of the Taoiseach's visit to Canada. Did he, during his meetings with the Prime Minister, have a specific opportunity to discuss it with Mr. Trudeau or did he phone him to discuss it subsequently? In terms of jobs in Belfast, this is probably the greatest imminent threat we have seen to high level, industrial jobs. While most of the jobs are male jobs, they are in the Belfast area. They are high level engineering and technical jobs in the factories involved.

The Taoiseach must be well aware of the concern among farmers, workers and small and medium-sized indigenous companies over the implications of the CETA deal, which has been provisionally in force since 21 September. Sinn Féin has repeatedly expressed concerns over the negative impact it could have and on the unconstitutionality of the investment court system included in it. The European Court of Justice has been absolutely clear in its pronouncements that this deal must be ratified by all EU parliaments before it can come into force. That has been sidestepped and that is worrying. It is a departure from the democratic norm and it is reprehensible for a deal of this magnitude to come into force without even a debate in the Dáil, let alone a vote. It is a case of implementing legislation first and debating it later. Will the Government agree to a date for CETA to be debated and voted on in this House?

It is outrageous. When asked about it during his visit to Canada, the Taoiseach confirmed that the invitation to Donald Trump to visit this country would stand. I am amazed at this. The Taoiseach said he and the Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, discussed their commitment to climate change but here we have an American President who wants to sabotage international efforts in this area. He does not give a damn what anybody thinks about it. In a terrifying development, he recently talked about the possibility of the United States totally destroying North Korea. This is the man in command of the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world. I need not mention his racist travel ban and all the other vile stuff he promised he would do and is now doing. Is the Taoiseach seriously going to invite this man to Ireland? If so, how advanced are the plans? Have there been active discussions with the White House or US officials about when this visit might take place? I appeal to the Taoiseach not to invite a man who is a dangerous threat to the world on a number of levels.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	199	When we discussed the visit of Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Trudeau, to Ireland the Taoiseach did not mention a return visit. Can we assume it was something that was organised relatively late for such meetings? Instead of a multiday visit, the focus this time was on existing trading companies and links rather than on opening new ones. Why was that the case? It is surprising, given the potential opportunities under the new trading agreement. I support the CETA trade agreement. There was a debate in this House, instigated by the Fianna Fáil Party in Private Members' time. It opens up opportunities for additional jobs and greater exports from small to medium-sized companies, as well as multinationals which employ thousands. It also offers opportunities for farming, although some challenges as well, but across the board we are an exporting country and it never ceases to amaze me that there is such ongoing hostility in this Parliament to the idea of open free trade agreements. There may be issues within those but the instinct of previous speakers, in Sinn Féin and others, is to knock every single free trade agreement that is touted. These agreements are aligned to the economic best interests of the country because if we were to stay isolationist and inward looking we could not create jobs or prosperity. We must export over 90% of what we make to sustain ourselves as a nation. This visit would have been a very good opportunity to help many such companies avail of the potential of the CETA in a post-Brexit environment. The Taoiseach visited the US-Canada border. Can he explain why he was looking at border options at all, having announced in Belfast that he had no intention of announcing new Border arrangements? Given the detailed work done by the all-party committee, might it not be a good idea to visit the Norway-European Union border to see an example of a border across which many people travel to work each day and where they have adopted quite advanced approaches to limiting the negative impacts of such a border?

We have, however, used our bilateral contacts with the United States in recent weeks to raise our concerns on behalf of Bombardier and the 4,000 staff in east Belfast, the men and women who work in the company. We will use whatever influence we have with the US authorities to ensure that those jobs are protected. Deputy Martin is right that CETA was discussed in the Dáil on foot of a Fianna Fáil motion. If there was a vote, I think it was favourable, so the House has already democratically expressed a favourable view towards the agreement. Formal legal ratification was not required for provisional implementation, which has already happened. Provisional implementation is the most important thing because it involves over 90% of the tariffs being removed, which has now happened. Formal ratification, when it happens, will require a further vote. That will occur but it is not necessary at this stage. No discussions have been held on the date or detail of a visit by President Trump to Ireland. I therefore cannot give a date or any further details.

The general approach I take towards other democratically elected leaders is to engage with them, which might be more successful than the alternative policy of the far left which is to shout them down and then ignore them. I just do not see how that approach could yield any positive results for the people who elect us. I went to the US-Canada border out of interest. I wanted to see it at a time when everybody was talking about borders and I was not too far away. I went for my own education as much as anything else. On "Morning Ireland" I had heard somebody - maybe a former Brexit Minister in the UK - defending the idea of a technological, invisible or telepathic border. He specifically referred to the US-Canada border as a seamless, frictionless border so I wanted to see it. It is not a soft border. It is a hard border. Even though they have a free trade agreement, there are flags, border posts, dogs, guards and barriers and it is definitely not the kind of border I would like to see between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, or in the Irish Sea for that matter.I do not think we should be building borders at all between Britain and Ireland.

Therefore, I raised the matter with the Taoiseach earlier. That is why it is not on the agenda in this context today. I certainly hope every effort will be made by the Minister to ensure the proposal will be blocked and that we will not see such a massive threat pursued to the beef industry. Priority Question No. 32 relates to areas of natural constraint and the commitment in the programme for Government to provide €25 million for them.

The areas of natural constraint, ANC, scheme is a very important source of financial support for farmers across the country, under which over €200 million is paid each year to over 95,000 farmers. A Programme for a Partnership Government provides for a commitment of a €25 million increase in funding for the scheme in 2018. This falls for consideration in the context of discussions on budget 2018. There are a number of options in relation to how any additional funding could be allocated under the ANC scheme. The options range from allocating the funds as a flat increase across the current payable rates to various forms of targeting higher payment rates for particular categories of farmer. Any change would require formal agreement with the European Commission via a formal amendment to the rural development programme, 2014 to 2020. The 2017 ANC scheme payments commenced on 19 September and, to date, more than €171 million has been paid to almost 80,000 farmers. Payments are continuing on a rolling basis as more farmers satisfy eligibility and stocking rate requirements. I am pleased to note that payments are ahead of where they were this time last year.

I would have thought that if there was a commitment in the programme for Government, it would have been sealed and done and dusted. It should not be up for discussion at this late stage as to whether the €25 million will be available. Will the Minister comment further on the matter because in his initial response he raised a question mark against whether the €25 million would be available? I want to make it absolutely clear that I believe it must be delivered as it is very important for the agricultural community. On the various land types and the way funding is distributed, as the Minister is aware, the difference between the payment rates for the three types of land - mountain land, more severely handicapped lowlands and less severely handicapped lowlands - is approximately €14 between the top rate and the lower rate, but there is a massive difference in the types of land involved. I put it to him that in distributing the €25 million which needs to be provided in the budget we should start the process of allocating higher payments to farmers with more severely handicapped land who should receive the largest portion of the funding.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	213	I thank the Deputy for his support. As he will be aware, total payments of approximately €250 million were made to eligible farmers under the ANC scheme in 2008. That sum was cut substantially by the Fianna Fáil Government at the time. We are attempting to make up some of the ground lost in budget 2018. Obviously, until the budget is announced, there will be no certainty in that regard, but it is my earnest wish that that will be the case. I appreciate the support of the Deputy in that regard. As to how the money would be spent if it were to be delivered in the budget, there is a range of options available, but my overwhelming objective at this stage is to secure the funding. Until the budget is announced, there can be no certainty in that regard. I am aware of the various views, particularly the different and competing views, on how the money should be allocated, but until such time as the €25 million is delivered, there is little point in exercising ourselves about the matter, but I am aware of all the options being canvassed.

For what does the commitment in the programme for Government stand? I remind the Minister that it is his party's programme for Government. If it commits to the provision of an additional €25 million in ANC funding for 2018, it is a poor reflection on the priority attached to agriculture that a week prior to the announcement of the budget, the matter is still under discussion and the Minister cannot made a clear commitment that the money will be forthcoming. The programme for Government stipulates that it will be provided. It is not exactly a big issue on which to have a fight; that fight would have been fought a year and half ago when the programme for Government was put in place. Will the funding, which clearly must be provided and is non-negotiable, be additional to what was included in the rural development programme and the overall Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, envelope in 2014, or will it simply be a rejigging of the spend, with farmers ending up no better off and the Government robbing Peter to pay Paul within the overall CAP envelope to provide the €25 million in funding? On the distribution of the additional funding provided, I am aware that there is a delay in the discussions at EU level in ensuring the constraint of land type is reflected in payments, but there is no reason the Minister could not begin that process and ensure farmers would be compensated in accordance with the level of difficulty they encounter in farming the land.

That is a debate I am sure we will have on another day should we succeed in securing the funding. I appreciate the Deputy's anxiety and support to make up some of the funding cut by Fianna Fáil in 2008.

#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	222	As the Minister is aware, we have had extremely bad weather since the middle of August and all through September. We have a huge problem in many parts of the country. In the north west, where we have very high levels of rainfall every year anyway, a particular crisis is developing at the moment and many farmers, certainly those in my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim as well as those in counties Donegal, Cavan and all that area, find that they cannot get their second cut of silage. As they cannot get the second cut of silage they cannot get their slurry out, which is another issue that I know has been brought to the Minister's attention and needs to be dealt with as well. This issue concerns fodder. There is the potential for a fodder crisis. As this is an ongoing problem every year, can a proper scheme be put in place to ensure it is dealt with?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	223	I accept that weather conditions in recent weeks have been challenging and this has created difficulties for farmers. My Department has been monitoring grass growth rates, weather conditions and feed supplies across the country. Grass growth rates are currently substantially ahead of recent years but there are difficulties in utilising grass in some regions due to above average rainfall levels. The European Commission has recently agreed to my request for an advance payment of the 2017 basic payment scheme. This has been prompted by the protracted inclement weather conditions and also market difficulties caused by currency fluctuations. This means an increase from 50% to 70% in the rate for the basic payment scheme to those applicants whose applications are confirmed fully clear with effect from 16 October, with balancing payments being made with effect from 1 December. There will also be an increase permitted to the advance for Pillar 2 rural development schemes. These payments and the payments under the areas of natural constraints scheme, which commenced recently, will inject up to €800 million into the Irish rural economy in the coming weeks and will provide a very welcome boost for Irish farm families, and also funding for fodder purchase where required. Taking account of this, there are no plans at this time to establish a fodder aid scheme. I understand fodder supplies remain available nationally and my Department will continue to monitor the situation.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	224	I am aware of the advances in the basic payment scheme. However, farmers would have been getting that anyway. They know that money is coming and they have already budgeted for it. The farming supplement of the Irish Independent today reports that prices are plummeting in the cattle trade because of the bad weather. Many farmers realise that they cannot keep their cattle as they will not have the fodder for them and they cannot put them out on the grass because the land is too wet. This is an annual crisis. Last year we had a similar situation. It did not develop into as bad a situation as farmers had feared. Some, however, were left in a dicey situation and found it hard to get enough fodder to get through the winter. Many parts of the country are currently waterlogged and farmers cannot get their cattle out. They have housed them. They have not got the fodder and they cannot do anything about it. It is time to look slightly differently at this issue. I appreciate that the Minister said last year he would deal with it on a case by case basis but it will need something a little more focused on this occasion to ensure it is sorted out. We need to see a fodder aid scheme put in place for farmers where there is clear evidence they have what could turn into an animal welfare crisis, which we do not want to see happen. It is quite appropriate for the State to step in to ensure an animal welfare crisis of this nature does not develop.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	225	I concur with the Deputy that the last thing any of us wants to see is any welfare issue arising on Irish farms, and we will take all steps necessary to avoid it. That has always been the position of the Department, and remains so. We have a dedicated animal welfare line in respect of farmers who may be facing individual problems. Individual holdings may have a problem and I appreciate the weather has been difficult. Ground conditions are not what we would like them to be at this time of the year. That gives rise to a whole range of issues, not least in terms of those who are trying to cut second-cut silage. However, we are in the first week of October and it is premature at this stage to speak of a fodder crisis. My Department continues to remain vigilant on the matter. Avenues are available to individual farmers and the Department will help where there are fodder and animal welfare issues combining to give rise to specific circumstances requiring the intervention of the Department. However, to speak at this stage about the need for a uniform, nationwide fodder crisis scheme is premature.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	226	With respect, I disagree. We spoke about this last year. Last year we said that we would deal with it on a case by case basis. When we speak about this issue, we are speaking about certain areas of the country. The Minister says "nationwide", but I am sure that in many parts of the country there is not the same level of crisis. Every year, we have a huge level of rainfall in the north west compared to, say, the south east or other regions of the country. The reality is that this is about the timing of that rainfall for many farmers. We have had an awful lot of rain in recent weeks and, in fact, in the past two months. It has led to a situation where farmers are not able to get their second-cut silage. I know the Minister is saying the weather may improve, but when we are talking about taking second-cut silage in the last weeks of October, it is of poor quality. That is the reality facing farmers. We need to ensure that a scheme is put in place so that farmers will know with confidence that they will not be let down. They cannot be required to go with a begging bowl, one by one, asking, "What can you do for me, please, Sir?" That is not appropriate. The farming community needs to have something proper put in place. The farming organisations are recognising it. I am sure some of them also will be lobbying the Minister on the issue. We saw the situation in County Donegal with the deluge of rain and the damage it did to the agriculture sector. We need to ensure that there is a full and proper scheme put in place to deal with this every year, if and when it occurs.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	227	The Deputy made the point that we were in this position this time last year. However, we did not have a fodder scheme subsequently. The responses that were available from my Department in terms of animal welfare issues were adequate to deal with any issues that arose. The Deputy is making this point in the first week of October. While I appreciate that we have had a difficult year and that ground conditions are difficult, there is no evidence of a fodder crisis at this stage. As I said, my Department remains vigilant in terms of the matter and we will continue to monitor the situation. Notwithstanding the fact that there are individual farmers who have had cattle in, some full-time, some in by night, because of ground conditions, there is no fodder crisis.

Has the Government formally submitted an application to the European Commission for EU state aid to help the agricultural sector and farmers following Brexit related currency changes or applied for CAP market disturbance funding following the UK referendum decision to leave the EU?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	231	It is important to clarify from the outset that state aid is aid funded by member states and not by the European Commission. Such aid is subject to common EU rules designed to avoid distortion of competition within the European Union. It is already possible to provide aid for farmers subject to a cumulative maximum limit of €15,000 per farmer over three years. Such aid is called de minimis aid and is designed to permit member states to provide assistance to primary producers at a level which does not distort competition across the union. Ireland already provides such aid to farmers under a number of headings in addition to the aid it provides under its rural development programme, which is subject to a separate legal basis to that of state aid. Some of the things which receive de minimis state aid from us include protein crops, tillage compensation scheme, dairy compensation package etc. In addition, the common market organisation regulation of the CAP provides for a number of market support mechanisms, for example, intervention when beef falls to threshold levels which are well below current market prices or for butter and skimmed milk powder between the months of March and September. More flexible measures against market disturbance can be made available when the conditions warrant it. These are not measures that will be deployed regularly and in practice their deployment is very exceptional and requires the support of member states. Regarding CAP market disturbance funding, emergency measures were introduced by the Commission in accordance with articles 219 and 220 of Regulation No. 1308/2013 in recent years in direct response to the market difficulties being experienced by farmers and producers during this time. Such measures included exceptional adjustment aid to milk producers and farmers in other livestock sectors, with €350 million in emergency funding allocated to member states. Ireland's allocation of €11.1 million from this fund, topped up by national funding, was used to leverage a greater fund of €150 million to provide low-cost loans to the livestock and tillage sectors. Currently in Ireland, dairy prices are strong, year to date average pigmeat and sheepmeat prices are close to the European Union average and whereas beef prices dropped back significantly since they peaked in June, they appear to have stabilised and are currently running at 97% of EU 15 average prices. Nonetheless Brexit poses a very significant risk and its impact is already being felt in some sectors through the prism of currency fluctuations. Sterling values dropped considerably in recent weeks, but have rallied somewhat since reaching a trough of 92p per euro.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
I am concerned about the potential impact of sterling volatility and Brexit more generally on the Irish agrifood sectors. It is clearly a significant risk and I have been in regular contact with the Commission and with counterparts in other member states to sensitise them to the threat posed by Brexit, including the more immediate risk associated with currency volatility, and to indicate that there may be a need for a community response at the appropriate time. I intend to raise these matters again at the Council of Ministers this month.

IBEC estimates this equates to up to 5,000 jobs. The Irish Farmers Association, IFA, has been very clear as well in outlining how the current weakness of sterling is leading to Irish farmers losing out to the tune of €2 million per week or 15 cent per kilo as a result of the fact that sterling is lower. I asked specifically if the Government has applied to the EU for aid relating to the impact of Brexit or market disturbance. Commissioner Hogan in the past few weeks has issued an invitation to states most affected by sterling disturbances to make applications for aid and assistance. Has the Government applied for that or will it do so? Will the Minister give a clear answer on that?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	233	As I tried to convey in my opening response, the two elements of the Deputy's question deal with CAP market disturbance funding and the state aid de minimis process. We have delivered to the agrifood sector under both headings. For example, the €150 million loan fund was partially under the de minimis process at sectors that were not covered under the CAP market disturbance funding. Sectors such as the mushroom and tillage sector were included in that de minimis aid process. Dairy and other livestock sectors were included in the CAP market disturbance funding. We have benefitted under both. I appreciate where the Deputy is coming from in respect of trying to get the best possible deal in the Brexit context. We are particularly anxious to avoid a position where Irish agrifood or even the Irish economy in general are dealt with in a cheque book fashion with regard to concerns over Brexit. In other words, lasting structural difficulties for us as a trading economy, North-South as well as east-west with the UK, could be seen as open to resolution through the writing of a cheque of compensation. We are anxious to secure a solution that is long term, viable and allows us to maintain our current trading relationship with the UK as it exits the European Union.

The way we are going now, at least one or two Members will lose out. I ask everybody to abide by the rules.

The Minister pointed them out in his first and second replies. I have specifically asked about Commissioner Hogan's comments and invitation to countries most affected by Brexit-related currency changes. Has the Minister made an application in this respect or will he do so? I still have not received an answer on that. An answer would be appropriate. Perhaps the answer is "No" and the Minister might just say it. The Minister knows as much as I and everybody else here of the danger posed by Brexit. It is not very far away and it will happen in early 2019. There is a structural element and getting a good deal is our utmost objective. We also must prepare for it and this may require EU state aid flexibility in advance of Brexit. Assistance from the EU may be required in the mean time to prepare, whether this relates to supply chain, new markets or price disturbance as a result of sterling changes. Will the Minister make an application or reply to Commissioner Hogan's invitation?

There are many schemes in the Department but what is going on there? We are sick and tired of excuses. I am not here to bash the staff in the Department but I am here to stand up for the farmers in Tipperary who are rightly entitled to get their payments but are not getting them.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	244	My Department administers a wide range of schemes that provide vital support to underpin the continued sustainability and growth of the agrifood sector. I am very aware of the importance of these supports for farmers and, accordingly, the issuing of payments under these schemes is a matter of priority for my Department. The main schemes are delivered under the framework of the EU Common Agricultural Policy, and each year approximately €1.5 billion issues under these schemes. My Department has a strong record in the efficient delivery of these payments, as evidenced by the fact that we perform very favourably compared to other EU member states in terms of both the dates on which payments are delivered and our ability to maximise the drawdown of available EU funding. With regard to individual schemes, the main direct payment scheme is the basic payment scheme, BPS. Advance payments are due to commence again this year on 16 October, which is the first date permissible under the EU regulations. In 2016, advance payments also commenced on 16 October, with €714 million issuing to 109,000 farmers on that date. To date under the 2016 BPS, over €1.18 billion has been issued to over 124,000 farmers. The areas of natural constraint scheme commenced payment on schedule again this year in the week beginning 18 September, and to date over €168 million has issued to over 78,000 farmers. This represents a significant increase over the payment figures at this stage last year. The current position regarding green low-carbon, agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments for 2015 is there are a small number of GLAS 1 farmers representing 0.5% of all GLAS 1 participants where payment is outstanding. With regard to 2016 advance payments to GLAS 1 and 2 participants, payments have issued in over 98% of cases. To date this year, we have paid over €147 million to GLAS participants. The online payment claim system for the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS II, opened in July 2016. Payments for approved investments continue to issue on an ongoing basis with 2,300 payment claims received and 1,680 cases paid. Payments totalling over €23.65 million have issued to date and continue to issue at an average rate of over €1 million per week.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
I urge all farmers who have completed TAMS-approved works to submit their payment claims to the online system as soon as possible so that payments can issue. With the organic farming scheme, OFS, our target in the Rural Development Programme was to attract some 16,000 ha of new land into production and to support 46,000 ha of converted land. We have more than achieved these targets and because of the structures we are putting in place, we hope to secure this land under organic contract for at least the next five years. For the first time, this allows us to plan ahead with confidence in terms of an organic food market. OFS payments in 2015 and 2016 amounted to €8 million each year. Projected expenditure for 2017 is €13 million and the average payment is approximately €6,500. We are well advanced towards preparations for the 2016 balancing payments, which I expect will commence in October. In addition to these existing schemes, the new sheep welfare scheme and the knowledge transfer programme are due to issue their first payments since they were introduced last year. In both cases, payments will commence issuing in the coming weeks. With all these EU-funded schemes, it is important to note that EU regulations stipulate payments can only issue when the required validation checks have been carried out and passed. I am very anxious to ensure my Department continues to issue these important payments to farmers in the most efficient and timely manner possible, and this remains a key priority for me.

These people are contacting my office, as well as many other Deputies, and we are going back and forth to the Minister. The Department is blaming computer glitches and wrong information being inputted. That is unacceptable as these farmers must pay contractors and suppliers. There are many contractors and suppliers operating as a bank and that is little good to them. It is unacceptable in this day and age that this can be blamed on computer glitches. The guidelines are too strict or rigid. I am not blaming the staff or workers in the Department as they are not deliberately holding up matters. In many cases, delays in payments result from an excessively rigid application process, which is unacceptable. Farmers are at the coal face, as are many suppliers. These are proud, honest farmers who have never owed a penny to anybody. When payments are delayed, they do not get any interest but if it were the other way around, there would be penalties and interest coming from the Revenue Commissioners, banks and everybody else.They are left in limbo and they will have to deal with this issue.

By international comparison we do quite well in terms of how efficiently we pay people. We had an issue with GLAS. We have substantially worked that through, and 98% of people have now been paid. There is a cohort of 2% which has outstanding issues that are delaying payment. All the IT issues have been addressed, and we are awaiting information from farmers in those cases. There is one issue I would like to flag, which is farmers who have not submitted their nutrient management plans. If the nutrient management plan is not submitted the farmers cannot get the balancing payment that is due. There are over 6,500 farmers who have not yet, under GLAS, submitted nutrient management plans. That is delaying the balancing payment and it will also delay the next round of GLAS payments for them. I would ask the Deputy to use his good offices to bring that particular issue to the attention of Teagasc, private advisers and indeed farmers. That might well be the issue that is delaying payments, because not alone is it holding up the balancing payment but it is also holding up the next round of payments.

I can move away from the script any day. The Minister is reading out figures and quoting international best practice and telling us how highly we rank. That is little good to the farmers of north Cork who the Minister represents, to those in Tipperary who I represent, or to Deputy McConalogue's constituents in Donegal. The Minister knows that better than I do. Around 1,000 farmers came up here last year and protested. They wanted to be at home tending to their crops and their animals and not up here protesting. They are coming again tomorrow, not for fun, and at their own expense. The Minister should not be so glib. He read out his script well. He should face up to the fact that farmers are not being paid but are being blamed. The Minister in his lecture asked Members to use their offices to tell the advisers and the farmers about this. It is too bureaucratic, and any little mistake is punished. Where is the yellow card promised in the programme for Government? The farmers are getting an immediate red card. The Department is holding on to the money and penalising the farmers, and the Minister has a smile on his face about scripts. Look after the farmers. They do not want scripts or fancy announcements. They want their pay so they can pay their suppliers.

It is the only outstanding reason for balancing payments. Not only will the balancing payment be held up but it will also hold up the next round of GLAS payments. We need to acknowledge, as I do, where there are Department failings, but there are other issues which hold up payments as well. My ambition is to pay everybody as quickly as we possibly can.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	261	The Minister answered a very similar question a few minutes ago concerning sterling fluctuations. He said that he wants long-term viability. Long-term viability cannot be assured if there is no short-term security. I want to know what initiatives can be taken to establish different markets and what interventions can be made in the short term.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	262	There is no doubt that Brexit poses enormous challenges for the agrifood sector which relies on the UK market.  The most immediate challenge has been the impact caused by the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro, and I fully understand and appreciate the impact this is having on the agrifood sector. The sector is of critical importance to our economy given its regional spread and the fact that it underpins the socio-economic development of rural areas in particular.  I am determined to safeguard its interests. Ever since the UK voted to exit the EU I have been very focused on assessing the impact such an exit would have on the sector.  I did this, inter alia, by consulting with all of the relevant stakeholders.  I held the first meeting of my Department’s Brexit stakeholders consultative group on 7 July 2016, some two weeks after the vote. The work of this group was, and still is, complemented by frequent contact with representative organisations and companies on an ongoing basis, and it operates in parallel with the separate consultation structures under the all-island civic dialogue. I have also held a series of bilateral meetings with my EU counterparts which are aimed at building alliances to ensure that agrifood and fisheries issues are at the top of the EU negotiation agenda.  Building common ground with other member states is critically important in the context of the negotiations. In all these engagements I am making clear our demand for continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariffs and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures, as well as keeping the UK market viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries.  In the last budget my Department led the introduction of a €150 million low-cost loan scheme, new agri-taxation measures were introduced, and increased funding was provided under the rural and seafood development programmes. I am considering what further measures might be required to assist the sector. In the meantime I sought and received sanction from the European Commission to pay a higher percentage advance in respect of the basic payment and rural development programmes - 70% and 85%, respectively - to assist farmers with cashflow issues. It is critical at this time to work towards reducing our dependence on UK markets for our agri-products, while at the same time retaining our market share in the UK. To give effect to this ambition I have supported Bord Bia’s marketing strategy by initially allocating €3.6 million in the last budget for market work in 2016 and 2017 and more recently by allocating a further €6.7 million to support a market prioritisation exercise and a range of strategic marketing and promotion activities. I have also had engagement with our main retail partners in the United Kingdom and led a number of trade delegations to seek new market opportunities, which I believe is bearing fruit. It is a complex range of initiatives. The ambition is to ensure that the agrifood sector is not disadvantaged by the UK decision on Brexit.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	263	Who takes the hit on the sterling differential? The might appears to be very much with the retailers which will be selling on the produce rather than the individual supplier. Obviously proximity in terms of fresh produce is a critical issue, and it is not easy in many cases to find alternative markets. It is quite interesting that Britain is not the only market being discussed. We heard today that Brazil and Argentina have a deal with the European Union on beef which may well pose some additional problems. Brexit is going to be uncertain all the way, and if a farmer is going to make a decision, for example, to grow a crop today, he or she needs to have some degree of certainty that the cost of growing it will be covered. That will not be done unless there is certainty that the farmer will get a little bit more than the cost of production. It is short-term thinking. I understand when the Minister talks about the chequebook, but the short-term consequences will be considered when those decisions are made. Are any short-term initiatives being looked at?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	264	The Deputy raised a point about the relative position of the primary producer on the supply chain. It is the case, and it is of concern both here and across the European Union, that when there is a squeeze it is the primary producer, or the consumer, who is always most adversely affected, and those in the middle, the distributor and the retailer, seem to be immune. The Commission is seeking to take a number of initiatives on that. In 2015 the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation commenced some new regulations in terms of addressing those disadvantages in retailing. It is important that we continue that. Mercosur is not a done deal. We are extremely concerned about what appears to be happening in terms of EU negotiations with Mercosur. We are primarily concerned because 50% of our beef - some 250,000 tonnes - goes into the United Kingdom every year. We are looking at how we can secure that market. It is our nearest and best paying market and we are concerned about what will happen when the UK is conducting its own trade agreements and how we can protect ourselves from that post-Brexit.We have also given substantial additional funding to An Bord Bia, almost €10 million since the Brexit referendum. That is primarily aimed at securing existing markets and looking for new market opportunities and it is bearing fruit. Our exports to countries outside the European Union increased by nearly 50% in the first six months of 2017.

In the past week or ten days we have been very active in building a coalition of 11 member states which share our concerns about a beef proposal in the Mercosur trade deal, particularly because of Brexit but also at a time when the EU market for beef consumption is static, and the Commission has researched the cumulative impact of existing trade deals, particularly identifying beef as a product sensitive to further trade development. We have been very active in the Commission and with other member states in building a coalition of member states which do not support the Mercosur trade deal. We are at a very early stage in those negotiations. The Taoiseach raised the matter on Thursday night last, or Friday, with Jean-Claude Juncker in the Commission. We have been extremely active in this area.

Nowhere is that more true than in the area of forestry. What practical plans have we got to significantly ramp up the afforestation programme from its current pitifully low level? We are planting only approximately 6,000 ha a year against an official target of 10,000 ha. There is a pitifully low level of forest cover in this State.

The Department is involved in a detailed mid-term review of that forestry programme and is engaging with stakeholders in its development. It should be noted that each year the Department has provided sufficient budget to fund the stated afforestation targets. However, as we are all aware, there is intense competition for planting land driven by a number of different factors, not least expansion in other agricultural sectors and this is affecting demand for the afforestation scheme.  I am convinced that forestry remains an extremely attractive option for landowners and can serve as a complementary income stream for farmers. This is because the Department funds 100% of the cost of establishing the new forest and guarantees an annual premium of up to €635 per hectare payable each year for 15 years, tax free. Forestry is also compatible with other agriculture schemes and farmers can continue to receive their basic payment on land which is also planted. I recognise the importance of ensuring that the benefits of the schemes are clearly communicated and well understood by landowners. I have established a group jointly consisting of the Department, industry and Teagasc to specifically examine the marketing and promotion of the schemes and this group has met twice already, as recently as yesterday. This group will come forward with a series of initiatives in the very near future on communicating the benefits of forestry to farmers to ensure that landowners are considering forestry as a viable land use option on some or part of their land. On the subject of deforestation, as the Deputy should be aware, under current legislation forest owners require a felling licence before felling can take place and where clearfelling is undertaken a condition of this felling licence is that the site must be replanted. In a small number of cases, deforestation is allowed but these are rare and exceptional circumstances, the reasons for which are set out in my Department's felling and reforestation policy document. Examples of situations where forests might not be replanted after clearfelling include overriding environmental reasons or for the erection of ESB lines. Therefore, given the exceptional nature of these activities, I do not believe that clearfelling is negating the overall level of new planting that is taking place across the country.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	271	We used to have a target of 17% of forest cover from the current position of 11%, which is one of the lowest in Europe. The average forest cover in Europe is 30% but we are at a pathetic 11%. Previously, the target was to reach 17% by 2030. Now that has been pushed out to 18% by 2045 because the Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, said that in order to reach those targets we need to be planting 10,000 ha a year, minimum, with a sustained yield. We are averaging approximately 6,000 ha. The Minister of State says it might go up as high as 7,000 ha this year. That is still well short of the 10,000 ha. That is against a pathetic failure to meet the targets we need to meet if we are to get anywhere close to those further targets. There is anecdotal evidence, which needs to be examined, that felling is happening too early. It is happening at 20 years rather than best forest practice of between 35 and 50 years. If that is happening, even the afforestation that is taking place is being undermined by felling too early which will also slow down our ability to meet the targets. Can the Minister of State confirm that the ESB imports 40,000 utility poles a year? We cannot even provide poles for the ESB, another indication of our failure in this area. That is how poor our forestry sector is. What will we do to ramp it up?

It is probably not 20 years but 25 years. Teagasc and the Department have jointly rolled out several initiatives. There are Talking Timber events to make people aware of them and the forestry felling tool on the Department's website which indicates the volume increase which equates to value increase if the farmer leaves the plantation alone or thins it at year 25 and leaves it to year 35. This optimises the climate change mitigation capacity and the investment by the State in the afforestation programme. There is an acute awareness of the need to do that. Farmers have tended not to be experts on forestry and that is why we are trying to make them aware. Teagasc is rolling out a series of clinics over the autumn. A total of 40,000 people connect with Teagasc on training programmes. That is part of its continuing awareness campaign.

We are still falling way short. We are completely underutilising public land that could be developed and that would not be useful for other purposes. The McCarthy report suggested that Coillte has 0.5 million acres that might not be suitable for narrowly commercial forestry but in terms of long-term forestry to meet climate change targets and so on, it is just sitting there and could be used. We should be examining those 0.5 million acres. Are motorways planted? We should consider other land that is not being used for other things. Are we planting it? Have we got a plan to get up to the 10,000 ha of planting? There are young people in my area who are so exercised about the issue of climate change that they have gone to the local council and said they want to get out and plant trees. We need programmes to encourage that kind of initiative and the use of public land as well as trying to encourage and incentivise farmers.

There was a good focus in last week's Irish Farmers' Journal showing some of the economic and environmental benefits. We must eliminate the fear factor for landowners so that they can look at options for their land and assess its value. Then they can consider whether, for example, if they plant one variety, it will yield them an income that they can use to enhance the rest of the land. We need a change in the mindset. The Deputy said that parts of Europe have an average of 30%. Someone who is a forestry owner or owns land for forestry is called a farmer over there. It is almost a signal of failure here, and that is something we must address, although I do not suggest that can be changed overnight. The target is 18% and it is to be used as part of our effort to combat climate change and is something on which the Government will focus, no matter who is in it.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	276	As the Deputy is aware, on 27 October 2016, the Supreme Court issued a judgment in a case taken by a number of mussel seed fishermen. In the judgment, the Supreme Court found that fishing by Northern Ireland boats within the zero to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State under the voisinage arrangements is not permitted by law.  The voisinage arrangements are long-standing reciprocal arrangements which have allowed fishing boats from Northern Ireland access to fish within the zero to 6 nautical mile zone of the territorial waters of the State and vice versa. It is important to note that the Supreme Court upheld the High Court finding that the voisinage arrangements are not invalid but that, as it stands, there is insufficient provision for them in domestic law.  The Supreme Court in fact noted that the arrangements were a sensible recognition at official level of practice and tradition, where fishing boats traditionally fished neighbouring waters. The Government approved the publication of the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill to address issues raised by the Supreme Court judgment, in so far as it relates to access for Northern Irish vessels.  If enacted and commenced, the Bill will give the voisinage arrangements a proper legal footing.  The Bill was published in February 2017 and is available on the Oireachtas website. The Bill has commenced debate in the Seanad. In July 2017, the UK Government formally announced that it is leaving the London Fisheries Convention. The action by the UK in announcing its withdrawal from the 1964 London Fisheries Convention was not unexpected. The convention deals primarily with access rights to countries' 6 to 12 nautical mile zones and many of these are also included in the Common Fisheries Policy.   Article 2 of the convention precludes countries from fishing in another country’s 0 to 6 nautical mile zone. However, Article 9 of the Convention gave countries the option to come to arrangements with their neighbours to allow access inside the 0 to 6 nautical mile zone if so desired.  This was the basis for the voisinage arrangements. The UK Government had been intimating its intention to withdraw from the convention for some time.  It is nonetheless unwelcome and unhelpful as it suggests a signal of the UK intent to take a hard line on fisheries in the context of Brexit. The UK has stated it wants to retain the voisinage arrangements element of the London Fisheries Convention. It remains to be seen if it can legally do this. On the all-island basis, however, there is still merit in reflecting on an all-island approach to these matters.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Ireland will have to reflect on all relevant issues in the context of Brexit negotiations.  I am actively engaged with my fellow European Ministers to keep Irish fisheries concerns on the EU agenda and to ensure that fisheries are not isolated in the overall negotiations on a new EU-UK relationship.

I asked him where the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill stands now and his plans to see it through the Seanad and back to the Dáil. Since the Minister first introduced the Bill, the situation has radically changed. As he said, the UK announced it would be withdrawing from the London Convention which had to be done two years prior to Brexit. We have an obligation, even though the Bill is before the House, to continue dialogue with the various sectors. Even since the debate in the Seanad, and subsequent debate in committee, there is a better understanding. It is in everyone's interest that this is resolved, and more dialogue is necessary. We will not have a proper opportunity to discuss the broader matter of Brexit in this question but it currently operates in a vacuum. There are many ponderables and there is a complete lack of certainty about many things. It is one of the greatest risks to Irish fishermen. When we talk about Brexit generally, we do not often hone in on fisheries, but it is a serious and major challenge. I know the Minister has had a number of meetings but is this dialogue with the industry continuing? Is he working closely with other maritime states in the best interests of Ireland and does he accept that it must be linked to trade?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	278	The fisheries sector is probably the most exposed to a hard Brexit. As the Deputy will be aware, over 60% of mackerel, which is our most valuable area of fisheries, is caught in what would be termed "UK territorial waters". Our second most valuable area of fisheries is prawns, and the percentage there is over 40%. In terms of value, over 50% of the entire industry is caught in UK territorial waters. We have had extensive engagement which continues. Last week, for example, when I met the National Inshore Fisheries Federation, which is the umbrella body for the regional inshore fisheries forum, it was particularly interested in the voisinage side of things. On the broader matter of fisheries in the context of Brexit, we have been very involved in working with like-minded member states which are equally disadvantaged by the UK decision to withdraw. These member states include Spain, France, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark and Germany, which all have an exposure to the UK territorial waters to a greater or lesser extent. We have very clearly said, and the Deputy made this point in his question, that we do not want the fisheries negotiations of Brexit conducted on a silo basis, where it is fisheries today and broader trade tomorrow. We want the fisheries to be part of the broader trade context - in other words, if the UK wants access to the EU in order that its financial services be passported there or if it wants to sell cars into the EU, part of the quid pro quo will have to be continued access to UK waters for our fishing industry.

Deputy Creed, as Minister, has to head this up. Most of our mackerel is caught off the west coast of Scotland where there is good quality early stage fish. Of course, we will catch them as they move down but they will be a much smaller mackerel, it will be much later in the season and will attract a much smaller price. Provenance is also a major issue. It is vitally important. We are working with like-minded countries. Some of those countries may be able to survive but if we do not get a fair and reasonable deal, I do not think that our industry will be able to survive. I spoke to Michel Barnier when he was in the House and to Guy Verhofstadt in Brussels last week, and when he was here. Both agree that the issue must be interlinked. It is the only way it can be done. We must use all our political muscle in Europe to secure a fair and equitable deal for Irish fishermen. Where is the Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill at the moment?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	280	The Sea-Fisheries (Amendment) Bill is in the Seanad. It has not concluded its Second Stage debate there. It must be said there is considerable political opposition to it. When the minority Government cannot get sufficient support for the legislation it raises the question of whether the Bill can pass. It should be borne in mind that it is one of the areas that was identified in the Good Friday Agreement as an area suitable for all-island co-operation. Furthermore, the boats in the Republic are under that voisinage arrangement and are still legally entitled to fish in Northern Ireland waters. If an Executive was in place in Northern Ireland, it would be particularly helpful because it might lead to a more rounded debate on the issues. On another matter in the context of the overall negotiations on Brexit, while I continue to engage with ministerial colleagues in the like-minded member states, I mentioned earlier that the officials in my Department also continue to work with their counterparts, continually refining and updating our position and feeding into the Barnier negotiating team. I am satisfied there is a clear understanding of the extent to which we will be disadvantaged in a hard Brexit.

What is going on regarding animal cruelty?I wish to know about the money the Minister's Department, and not the Department of Communications, Climate Action and the Environment or any other Department, has spent in the past four years regarding the seizure, impounding and hosting of animals, especially horses, that are neglected and abandoned, and in some cases totally mistreated and left seriously injured. A motion will come before the House this evening and it is very appropriate the question is being answered now.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	282	The Control of Horses Act 1996 provides powers to local authorities to deal with stray and abandoned horses. To date, my Department has provided funding of €4.3 million to local authorities for horse seizures for the period from 2014 to 2017. Local authorities are asked to make every effort to recover all costs associated with horse seizures and ensure they are achieving the best value through the public procurement process. The number of horses being seized nationally continues to decline, from 4,923 in 2014 to 2,128 in 2016 and 878 to date in 2017. My Department's contribution to local authorities is reducing year on year, from €2.3 million in 2014, €725,000 in 2016 and €426,000 to date in 2017. This reduced funding demand is reflective of a number of factors, including initiatives being progressed by my Department in the animal welfare area. This includes active enforcement of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and the EU equine identification regulations, which have resulted in the removal of a number of abandoned, welfare-compromised and unidentified horses throughout the country in the period from 2014 to 2017 at a cost of almost €320,000. Department officials have been directly involved in a number of horse seizures and have initiated prosecutions under the Animal Health and Welfare Act. The number of horses slaughtered for human consumption continues to increase due to greater compliance with equine identification legislation by the organised horse sector. Almost 33,000 horses have been slaughtered for human consumption in the past five years. Horse exports have increased substantially too in recent years, helping to bring about a much greater balance between supply and demand. In addition, animal welfare charities have been rehoming an increasing number of horses abroad. The increased emphasis on rehoming of horses is being assisted greatly through my Department's funding to animal welfare organisations. A total of €2.46 million has been paid to 137 organisations to assist their work in animal welfare in 2017. A number of these are actively involved in rescuing and rehoming neglected horses. My Department also provides funding to local authorities to support the development of urban and Traveller horse projects in their respective areas.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 To date, funding of €866,273 has been drawn down across several local authorities, including a contribution of €500,000 to South Dublin County Council for the Clondalkin Equine Club, the opening of which I officiated at earlier this year, and funding for Kildare, Kilkenny, Longford, and Leitrim projects. These projects focus on education and create awareness of compliance with animal welfare regulations, thereby reducing numbers of straying horses. My Department continues to stress that it is the responsibility of individuals to ensure the welfare of horses in their ownership and-or their care and to dispose of them appropriately. My officials continue to work closely with local authorities and animal welfare organisations in dealing with the issues which necessitate seizure of horses.

I spoke after the Minister told me in a reply to a parliamentary question that the Department had spent €4.5 million. Today, the Minister has said it is €4.3 million so €200,000 is missing. This is with regard to the seizure and control of horses in the three year period from 2014 to 2017. I do not know why the Minister cannot keep the figures the same as he told me the last day. Local authorities have been engaged from 2008 to 2016. It is farcical. We have a very proud equine record in Tipperary, as the Minister knows and I am sure he often has a flutter. We have very prominent racing horses. We have to deal with this issue. It is an underbelly and it is happening. I am aware of a very serious situation at present, and I asked the Minister a question about it back in August. It is with regard to a horse who was totally mistreated. This horse had travelled the world to England and America and back again. It fell into criminal hands. It was then abandoned in a boghole in Littleton and taken away by animal rescue people. It has been treated but is not yet back to full health. The Department told people where the horse was and is insisting it be handed back to the same people it came from. Where is the tagging? Where is the traceability? We have to have it in all aspects of farming. Why can we not have it for these horses and these people?
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	284	On the individual case, the Deputy is aware we have engaged in considerable correspondence with him on that individual matter. Whether in the area of equine matters, puppy farms or conventional farming of cattle, sheep or pigs, the Department has a commitment to the highest levels of animal welfare, and that reflects what society would want. For this reason, in 2013 we considerably updated the legal framework within which the Department is able to prosecute people who breach those standards. It is an appalling sight to see, particularly for people who come from an agricultural background who are the first to be offended by signs of animal cruelty. Concern about animal cruelty is not something that is the preserve of any particular sector in society. Farmers are the most committed to the highest standards of animal welfare. The horse has a particularly strong position in Irish society. The Deputy made reference to Tipperary, the home of the thoroughbred racing industry.

We have the legal framework now. We are prosecuting more people now. We are working with more voluntary bodies now and delivering funding in all of those areas to address this issue. I am satisfied that while there will always be an individual case which will make the headlines, we are doing everything possible and financial resources are not the constraining factor.

Farmers as we all know are excellent at animal husbandry and they are caring, and they are penalised severely with traceability and everything else. We have seen sulkies driven by horses that tumble upside down on the road and the horses are left there for dead and dying. It happened in Cashel this year, it happened at Horse and Jockey last year and it continues to happen. A blind eye is being turned here because in this case, this particular horse travelled the world and was exploited for money, and when it was no more good it was left in a boghole where it lost its foal and nearly died. Now, the Department is part of a prosecution and wants the person in the sanctuary, who is very sick and traumatised because the criminal gang who had the horse know where the horse is, to hand it back with no fines or penalties. A blind eye is being turned by many agencies to what is happening in this area. Not a week goes by when I do not get an email or contact about sulkies and the abuse of horses on the roads. Some people are exempt but farmers are not. They must be traceable and rightly so. We must be traceable and proper about all animal husbandry and they are, as the Minister said himself, but there is an element out there who can do what they like with their horses, including mistreating and abusing them, and then abuse the people who try to bring them back to health and mind them, who are animal loving people who get no support from local authorities. The animal welfare places get little bits of grants every Christmas.

With regard to the response, and the Minister mentioned the script earlier to Deputy Mattie McGrath, we are aware of what is in the scheme and we appreciate those who are covered. This question specifically focuses on those who are excluded and asks why they are excluded and whether the Minister will include them because it is unacceptable that they are not included.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	300	As the Deputy may know, I visited the Inishowen Peninsula with my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh, following the exceptional rainfall of 22 August to see at first-hand some of the very significant problems that a number of farmers faced as a result. I committed during my visit to supporting these farmers, and my Department, in conjunction with other State agencies, moved swiftly to offer practical solutions to those affected. In the aftermath of the flood I prioritised the availability of support by means of the animal welfare helpline, which gives guidance on protecting animal welfare and safety, in addition to responding to urgent requirements for emergency feed provision. Staff from my Department as well as Teagasc were in the area. Teagasc provided advice to affected farmers in dealing with the immediate challenges that arose. From my experience of visiting Inishowen, together with the findings of my officials and Teagasc, it was clear that the principal and most widespread impacts of the floods on farms in the Inishowen Peninsula centred on damage to land, fencing, fodder and livestock. To address these pressing issues in the most effective manner I introduced a targeted measure of assistance. Support under this measure will apply to losses of livestock, conserved fodder of hay or silage and as a contribution towards the clean-up cost of agricultural lands, including repair to fences damaged by debris washed up by the floods.The measure will be subject to the provisions of EU de minimis state aid rules in the agriculture sector and only losses not covered by insurance will be eligible for consideration. While it is not possible to address all of the problems that unprecedented rainfall caused on farms on the Inishowen Peninsula, this measure is a most comprehensive, timely and appropriate response to the main difficulties farmers had to deal with. It closed for the receipt of applications last Friday, 29 September. Applications will be processed as quickly as possible.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	301	The Minister had a go at Deputy Mattie McGrath earlier for using a script. Specifically, my question is whether the Minister will include those who are excluded. They include farmers who have lost potato crops, cereal crops and second-cut silage and those whose farm road networks have been extensively damaged. There is no rational explanation as to why the Minister is including some and excluding others. The flooding, severe as it was, did not discriminate in who it affected or the types of farmer on whom it had an impact, yet the Minister in his scheme is excluding certain farmers. For example, one farmer lost 40 acres of barley, which is entirely unusable and was wiped out. He is excluded from the scheme. Others lost potato crops, while others lost second-cut silage. Why is the Minister excluding them? Can he give us an explanation? There has been no rational explanation for the exclusion of farmers. No one should be left behind. The Minister is leaving behind farmers in dire need by not including them in the scheme.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	302	It is fair to say no compensation scheme ever compensates in the order of 100% of all those affected for damage inflicted on them. I visited the area and saw at first hand the damage caused. I walked the land and saw carcases of livestock, particularly sheep, that had been lost in the flood. I saw bales of fodder that had been transported long distances by the flood and fencing that had been damaged. We made what the Government believes, on the basis of the analysis it had made, to be the most appropriate response. When we consider the debate we were having in the House this time last year on the effects of adverse weather on grain producers, we must determine the most appropriate response. In the context of the next CAP, for example, it may be appropriate to explore instruments used in other countries, including an insurance model for farmers dealing with crop losses, etc., that arise in particular circumstances. There is no proposal, however, and the scheme, as approved by the Government, is now closed. There is no proposal to extend it to anybody else.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	303	There is simply no defence and the Minister has not given one. He has given no explanation as to why he is excluding farmers. He has not at any stage attempted to give a defence. The best argument he could mount was that we could never cover 100% of all losses or 100% of farmers. The reality is that, in a number of cases on the Inishowen Peninsula, the Government is covering 0% of farmers' losses; they are entirely excluded. They have experienced a massive loss as a result of the flood, the same as anyone else, but that is not being recognised by the Minister. With no justification, they are being entirely ignored by him and left to fend for themselves. The Minister was in the area. I ask him very specifically for his reasons, but he has no answer. He is leaving farmers behind. While 90% of them are included, why is the Minister ignoring the 10% who are being left to fend for themselves, some of whom have experienced the most severe losses? It is entirely indefensible, but it is not too late to change the scheme. I urge the Minister, on the back of the motion last week directing that what I propose should happen, to reopen the scheme and include the affected farmers in it.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	304	It is not possible to say definitively that, because of the level of rainfall on 22 October, second-cut, first-cut or third-cut silage was lost. Neither is it possible to say definitively that floods caused 100% of the losses, as the Deputy tried to convey. We are not compensating anybody in the order of 100%, but we are compensating for the loss of livestock, fodder and fencing, as well as damage caused to lands. These were substantially the issues that were reported and that I saw myself.

I have put forward this question to establish the work that has been done to open and develop new markets for Irish beef.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	312	My Department is always conscious of the need to gain access to new third country markets for the beef sector and improve and widen the existing levels of access that we enjoy. This was a central component of the Food Wise 2025 strategy and has been a key part of recent trade missions. Ireland gained access to the US market in 2015, making it the first EU member state to do so and we also enjoy access for beef intended for grinding. Ireland has been granted equivalence by the USDA in terms of its systems, which is a very significant achievement.  The promotion of Irish beef was a focal point for the trade mission to the United States and Mexico in June. While there, I announced the approval by the USDA of the process verified programme for labelling Irish beef as grass fed and reared outdoors. Irish beef is now on sale directly in retail for the first time in the USA. In Mexico I officially announced our intention to seek access for beef and there was significant engagement between experts at a technical level.  China is a very high priority for beef market access and significant progress has been made. In August my Department hosted an audit visit from the Chinese Certification and Accreditation Administration which undertook a series of plant inspection visits in order to assess the applications made by Irish beef processors to gain access to the Chinese market. Feedback form the audit team was broadly positive and we are awaiting the official report on its audit visit. My Department has also hosted visits from two delegations from South Korea in the past two years in connection with our market access application. The most recent was in June and I intend to raise the issue of our beef market access application during my forthcoming trade mission to the country in November. The beef sector received a boost at the beginning of 2017 with news of the reopening of the Egyptian market to Irish beef. In Saudi Arabia beef access has been expanded to include minced beef, cooked beef and processed beef as part of the trade mission earlier this year. We have also negotiated positive changes to the veterinary certification for beef to South Africa and Singapore, which has broadened access and opportunities for exports. We are actively pursuing opportunities to gain access in a number of other countries, including Vietnam and Ukraine. Live exports have also been a significant feature in 2017, providing for a much needed balance in the marketplace, and to date in 2017 amount to some 157,000 head.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	313	I welcome the progress made. Our beef exports to third countries represent only 5% of the total. Therefore, there is significant room for improvement. It is welcome that we have opened up markets in the United States and Mexico. I welcome the progress made in China and South Korea and also on live exports which I view as a very important market for us. I encourage the Minister to make further progress in that regard. Has he further plans in place to expand our markets? Has he trade missions in mind for the coming months and years? We need a sustained effort to market and promote our beef abroad. In Germany, for example, that has been done and one can see the improvements. I would like to hear from the Minister on this issue.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	314	Notwithstanding Brexit, the United Kingdom will always be an important market. It takes in excess of 250,000 tonnes. It is important to say we are not walking away from that market. My Department and Bord Bia have put a lot of effort into securing the foothold we have in that market. Businesspeople will always seek the market that pays them best. The Deputy is correct that 50% of our beef goes to the United Kingdom. Most of the balance goes to mainland EU member states, with in the region of 5% going to third country markets. That reflects where the best price opportunities are available. The function of the Department is to make sure we open as many markets as possible. Thereafter the industry leverages one against the other to secure the maximum price, thereby, in theory, delivering the best opportunities to the primary producer. In that context, we are working in the UK market. We hope to go on a trade mission to Japan and Korea later this year. Live exports are a critical export of the industry and are up, I understand, in the region of 45% in 2017.

While the issue referred to by the Deputy is an operational matter for Bord na gCon, it has informed me that, pursuant to the greyhound industry racing regulations 2007-2017, when a racing greyhound returns an analysis result for a prohibited substance the owner and trainer are notified as soon as is practicable. In addition to publishing adverse analytical findings, Bord na gCon also reports the findings to the independent control committee, pursuant to the greyhound industry regulations 2007-2017, with a request for the committee to investigate and determine the matter as provided for in legislation. Since 1 October 2015, greyhounds returning an adverse analytical finding for prohibited substances are prohibited from further racing until the greyhound is re-sampled and a subsequent analytical result is determined to be free from any prohibited substances. Bord na gCon has informed me that, as part of its commitment to greater transparency in the area of anti-doping and medication control, it introduced secondary legislation in 2015 to provide for the publication of all adverse analytical findings in greyhound samples and to ensure the publication of the outcome from all cases before the control committee. These publications are published in the regulatory section of the board’s website.  In addition, in 2016 the board introduced secondary legislation to provide for the mandatory maintenance of record keeping in respect of the use of all animal remedies and veterinary treatments for all greyhounds eligible for racing. In addition to this secondary legislation, Bord na gCon officials are now authorised to sample greyhounds out of competition at the premises of owners and trainers, whether or not greyhounds are in training. Bord na gCon has frequently exercised this new testing regime as part of its integrity management.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House.
 I intend to introduce a new greyhound industry Bill in the autumn which will address the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthen regulatory controls in the Industry, modernise sanctions and improve integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector. The draft general scheme of the Bill has already progressed through the pre-legislative scrutiny phase and a memorandum will go to Government in the coming weeks requesting approval to publish the updated general scheme and to submit it to the OPC for drafting.

It complained that there was not an immediate report. Some 80% of racing greyhounds in the UK are Irish dogs and because there a belief in Britain that there is widespread doping here the UK has begun mandatory testing on imported Irish greyhounds. There is a serious issue. The Minister of State will remember that in March this year our great broadcaster, Sharon Ní Bheoláin, and her "Prime Time" team aired its famous programme, "Gone to the Dogs", which put the spotlight on doping and poor regulation in the industry. At the time of the Clonbrien Hero announcement, the IGB confirmed that there had been eight other adverse findings in June and one in July. What about the other months? Why are there not quarterly reports? The IGB said it tests between 5,000 and 6,000 dogs a year. Can we have more clarity and transparency?

Approximately a year ago Bord Na gCon invested in a new state-of-the-art analytical system which allows for the detection of substances, including anabolic steroids, at very low levels in samples taken from greyhounds. Very low levels of drugs are now detectable. To be honest, some of the samples which are now showing positive for drugs would not have so tested until the machine was installed. It is all part of a greater effort to improve and enhance the reputation of the industry by putting in stronger controls and monitoring of all animals.

Has he given any more thought to the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill which I introduced and integrating it into the Bill he will bring forward to regulate the industry? It included a white list of countries to which we should not export our dogs under any circumstances.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	321	A very strong, clear message needs to go out from all of Government and the Minister to our European partners that there is a need for an increase in CAP funding post-2020. CAP has been very successful in ensuring a secure supply of safe food for the citizens of Europe. It is essential to support rural communities. As the Minister knows, it is essential to support primary producers and sustainable methods of food production. We have to start a very strong campaign now that under no circumstances can there be a reduction in CAP funding and that we need an increase in funding post-2020.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	322	I am in regular contact with the Commissioner, Mr. Phil Hogan, and my European counterparts in regard to maintaining a strong CAP budget post-2020 and my position on this issue is well known. I met the Commissioner most recently at the end of August and again re-iterated the need for a well-funded CAP. Regarding the Commissioner, Mr. Günther Oettinger, and the Commission’s final reflection paper on the future of EU finances, published on 28 June 2017, I am keenly aware of the potential implications some of the proposals within this paper would have on future CAP funding. The paper contends that economic strength, sustainability, solidarity and security must be focal points for the EU finances of the future and that future budgets needs to be simpler and more efficient and flexible. This is a principle to which Ireland can subscribe.  However, the paper outlines five possible funding scenarios, ranging from continuing with the current reform agenda to radical redesign, with the consequential effects on EU expenditure and revenue. Some four of these scenarios point to a potential reduction in the CAP budget. The paper also refers to a number of options for managing a cut in CAP funding, including reductions in direct payments to farmers, the provision of farm supports only to those under special constraints, and a requirement for member states to co-fund direct payments, which currently are 100% EU funded. Such proposals would have a significant adverse impact on the economic sustainability of farms or impose a significant additional burden on the Exchequer, especially given that many livestock farm incomes in Ireland would be negative without direct payments. The certainty and stability the direct payments provide to farmers cannot be underestimated, as has been evident during recent market crises. Cuts in CAP could also have a negative impact on efficiency and investment on farms, with knock-on impacts on food processing and associated sectors and the rural economy generally. It is worth noting that the amount of CAP funding per member state for Pillar 1, direct payments, and Pillar 2, rural development, is fixed until 2020 in regulations of the Council and European Parliament. Any change to these figures will require a co-decided amendment to these regulations.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The Commission was expected to come forward with proposals for the new multi-annual financial framework for the period 2021-27 by 1 January 2018. However, due to Brexit and other pressures, this is not likely to happen now until mid-2018. While formal discussions on the multi-annual financial framework have yet to commence, I support the retention of a strong and well-funded CAP and my position on this matter has been articulated at official and political level and is well understood by the Commissioner, Mr. Hogan, my counterparts in other member states and in the Commission. I will be working hard with my European counterparts to ensure that the CAP budget post 2020 provides a solid and effective foundation for the continued development of the agrifood sector.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	323	I do not think we can highlight enough the importance of direct payments which account for two thirds of farm income, as the Minister knows. It is extremely important not just for the farming community but the entire economy, in particular the economy of rural Ireland.Again, the importance of CAP cannot be over-estimated or highlighted enough from the point of view of sustainable food for the citizens of Europe and indeed markets much further afield. We all know we would like to see improvements in the governance of CAP and in some of the arrangements but what we need to focus on at the moment is the quantum of money that will be available for the budget post-2020. I know, and the Minister knows better than any of us in this Chamber, that there are competing demands and there are people at different Councils in Europe, be it at Heads of Government level or other ministerial Councils, and at parliamentary fora as well outlining the need for additional funding for defence and migration so we do not underestimate the challenge that lies ahead regarding increasing the funding for CAP. I would focus very strongly on the quantum of money that will be available for CAP in general as well as the other issues we would like to see regarding simplification, etc.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	324	I concur entirely with the Deputy. Since its inception, CAP has shown itself to be an extremely flexible and adaptable policy, not just in terms of its original objectives of delivering food security for Europe after the Second World War. It has evolved substantially since then to meet environmental concerns, the sustainability of our production systems and the public good in the area of biodiversity, water quality, etc. Notwithstanding the fact that Europe, as identified in a number of reflections in this area, faces many new challenges that were not dreamt of at the time its founding fathers met to pen the Treaty of Rome, new challenges require new money. The Government's position is not to raid a successful existing policy instrument of the EU to meet those new challenges. In due course, we may well have to meet and consider who funds it. Nobody is putting his or her hands up at the moment to take a penny less or put in a penny more but if we are serious about CAP, that is something we will have to address at another stage.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	325	I hope the Minister can give us an assurance that all of Government will back him fully in identifying the need to increase funding for CAP post-2020 and that whatever Council of Ministers is identified by members of the Government will be totally supportive of the need to increase funding for CAP in the next round.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	326	The Government is entirely committed to an adequately funded CAP post-2020. There are questions as to whether it will slot in immediately after 2020 because of complications arising out of EU budgetary contributions to CAP. Notwithstanding that, it is clearly our position that Europe faces other challenges but other challenges require new money. It is not our position to raid the existing CAP, which is delivering in spades not just in terms of food security, quality and traceability but also sustainability and a host of other public goods. The taxpayer gets exceptional value for CAP and it is our clear position that this needs to be adequately funded post-2020.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	327	I am glad the Minister is here to take this debate. The school in question is Rochestown Educate Together National School in Rochestown, County Cork. It is a fabulous school and under the leadership of Alan Sheehan and his team, the staff are doing a wonderful job in incredibly difficult circumstances. This school opened in 2013 and now had 208 pupils but is situated across a split campus. One part of the school is on the grounds of Douglas Hall soccer club in temporary accommodation and the other part is in Garryduff Sports Club, again in temporary accommodation. The split campus arrangement has presented real difficulties for parents, pupils and staff. Some families have to drop their children off at the two campuses. The classrooms are too small. The yard at Garryduff is extremely small. A room is being rented there for support teaching. There is no school hall for PE or assemblies and there is no staff toilet at the Douglas Hall campus. This is just a sample of the issues that arise on a day-to-day basis. It makes it an entirely unsatisfactory arrangement for staff and pupils alike. What is the up-to-date position regarding the acquisition of the site for the permanent school building on Old Carrigaline Road in Douglas? We were told in December 2016 that a site had been identified and were told in January 2017 that there was agreement in principle. Since then, we have been told that it is at conveyancing stage. There has been no further information. There is a real lack of information and engagement from the Department. Coming up to the start of every school year, the school has been left to its own devices to try to sort out temporary accommodation. People are asking when the site will be bought and what the temporary accommodation arrangements will be like in September 2018 if, as expected, the permanent school building is not in place at that date.

Its opening was very welcome, as is the announcement of a site being established. This is a school in a rapidly growing and very urban area just outside Cork city. It met the desire for an education with an Educate Together ethos so it was a school that was very badly needed. Consequently, demand for places has been very high since the first year. There were 20 students in 2013 and there were 215 students in September so it is growing rapidly. However, there has been a rush to get accommodation sorted year after year almost without exception. This was initially on the grounds of the Douglas Hall soccer club and from 2016 onwards, on a second campus on the Garryduff Sports Centre site so the school is divided between two sets of prefabs on two sporting club sites in an area with very heavy traffic. As Deputy Michael McGrath outlined, there are gaps in terms of a staff room, special educational spaces and toilets and all those issues along with parents trying to travel back and forth between those two sites with their children, who could be split between the two campuses in an area with very heavy traffic, cause huge issues. There was a debate on other schools that faced similar issues before the recess. Indeed, this school has been going through this since 2013. With either temporary or permanent accommodation, it always seems to go right up to the wire or beyond it leaving the board of management to resolve it. We have been told it is at conveyancing stage. When does the Minister expect that the sale will be agreed and when will it be in a position to go to planning for the school?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23578	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	329	I thank the Deputies for raising this issue. I know it is an issue of considerable concern because this school was opened in 2013 and now has enrolment of up to third class so, clearly, finding permanent accommodation for the school is a priority from the Department's point of view. There were attempts to find a site. We have been working through the memorandum of agreement with Cork County Council and one site was being pursued. The current site, which is deemed particularly suitable, is now the preferred the option. I think the Deputies know that efforts had been made to look for other sites before this one was settled upon. There was an agreement in principle in February 2017, as the Deputies acknowledged. The Department then requested draft contracts from the vendor, which was the first step. The site is not accessible and aspects of the design and delivery of the access road to the site needed to be discussed with the landowner. In the meantime, work has been ongoing on this.On foot of these discussions, the vendor provided draft contracts in August 2017 and this enabled the Chief State Solicitor to commence the conveyancing process. That process has commenced and I am not in a position to say when it will be completed. The legal people will have to be satisfied that there has been due diligence and such. I assure the Deputies that there is no attempt to slow this and the Department assures me that while the site acquisition process is going on, it is not hindering the delivery of the permanent accommodation for the school as preliminary design work on the project has commenced. The design team has already had some engagement about that with officials in Cork County Council and will shortly be holding formal preplanning discussions with the council with a view to further advancing the project. The Department is acutely aware of the difficulties outlined by Deputy McGrath with the two campuses that parents are trying to deal with. I assure the Deputies that we will make every effort to conclude this and proceed to the next design stage to provide permanent accommodation.

He acknowledges that we are looking at another school year in 2018 and 2019 where the school will be in temporary accommodation. That will be the sixth year in some children's primary school lives in this school in temporary accommodation. I do not know how long it takes to purchase a site after the price has been agreed but will the Minister assure us that this is not because his budget for land or site acquisition has been exhausted? I welcome that preplanning discussions are going to commence, hopefully in parallel with the conclusion of the acquisition phase. It is possible, however, that until contracts are signed, this site could be lost. Someone else could come in with a higher bid at any stage because no contracts are signed. Where would that leave us if this site was lost? I ask the Minister to take a personal interest in this. Our objective is to get it over the line; that is what it is all about. Will the Minister ensure that the plans for the next school year, from September 2018 onwards, are agreed well in advance? That would avoid a repeat of previous years when, as Deputy Ó Laoghaire said, school authorities were left to their own devices right up until the last minute. It is not fair on anyone. We need personal interest from the Minister and commitment to complete this both with regard to site acquisition and having proper planning and an agreement in place for temporary accommodation for the next school year which will unfortunately come around quickly.

I want to emphasise that this seems to be a policy issue and that these matters always seem to go down to the wire. This school is split across Garyduff Sports Centre and Douglas Hall. The educate together secondary school is in Nagle. There are other schools in Carrigaline as well. Both of those schools go right up to the wire when trying to source things. There is still great uncertainty, even as the year progresses, as to what the situation will be next year. There is an admission that we are looking at temporary accommodation for 2018 to 2019 which is disappointing and concerning. It is not clear to me that either of the existing sites are capable of supporting any more prefabs or temporary accommodation. The question is whether we are looking at a third site or relocating some of the existing school to another site. Much of that is unclear and I am disappointed to know that we are in that situation. I understand that indications have been that it is still at the conveyancing stage but that it could take until the end of the year. If that is the case, it is very likely that another school year will be spent in temporary accommodation. I urge the Minister to examine the issue of temporary accommodation and how that is handled in the Department as a general rule on a national level. I ask the Minister to ensure that no effort is spared to ensure that this site for a rapidly growing school is secured by the Department to provide a permanent home for what can be a very successful and valuable school for the locality.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23578	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	332	To reassure the Deputies, to be fair to everyone, a number of alternative sites had to be pursued. It was not an open and shut case of a site being available that could be pursued. This site became available. It is zoned for education purposes so I think that gives security. We are at an advanced stage in the process of conveyancing in that the work has been done and the vendor has submitted a contract which is with the Chief State Solicitor. No delay is being put in its way and no budgetary issue stands in the way of delivering this. I take the Deputies' points about temporary accommodation and how that will be provided for in 2018 to 2019. I do not think it is a question of finding a national strategy because every case is individual. We try to find sites and temporary accommodation while we find the permanent sites and build.

I take note of the points the two Deputies make and will bring that back to my Department and see if we can finalise plans early so that people have a sense of certainty. That can be easier said than done in individual sites. As the Deputy says, if the gap after the application for the site is tight, what do we do about temporary accommodation? I will bring that back to my officials and ask them to examine that in view of the fact that this is still at early design and planning stage.

I told her that in the build-up to this referendum, the unprecedented attacks on fundamental rights and civil and political rights are putting democracy in Catalonia at risk. Many of our worst fears were confirmed on Sunday. I agree with the Taoiseach's comments this afternoon that the scenes of brutality in Catalonia were horrific. Over 890 people were injured in this crackdown on democracy. Will the Minister of State join me in sending solidarity from this Chamber to those people and to wish them a speedy recovery? We know that the Spanish police used plastic bullets which the Catalan Government banned in 2014 after a campaign by victims who were maimed and blinded by these deadly weapons. We know the effect that they can have. One of the Minister of State's colleagues, the Minister of State, Deputy John Halligan, requested that the Spanish ambassador to Ireland be called into Government Buildings to convey our horror at voters in any democracy being dragged from polling stations. Will the Minister of State do this and does he believe that the police response was proportionate, as suggested by the Spanish deputy Prime Minister?
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	341	I was in Barcelona and Catalonia over the weekend as a guest of the Catalan Government and was accredited by its electoral commission, participating in a delegation of approximately 40 members of European countries' parliaments observing the election. I witnessed first-hand many disturbing scenes that we saw on the news over the weekend and spoke to many people who had been hit with plastic bullets and been beaten with batons, including an 83 year old man who, after being treated for his wounds, went back to the polling station and waited another six or seven hours to vote. I welcome, as Deputy Crowe has, the Taoiseach's remarks condemning the violence but it concerns me that the Government says that the substance of the difficulties in Catalonia are an internal matter for the Spanish state and that therefore the Government cannot interfere. That was not the Government's position on human rights and civil liberties in Poland or Hungary recently, or indeed in Myanmar. The Government has a long history of speaking up and advocating about foreign governments' actions when it feels that they are inappropriate. Will the Minister of State support the call of the Catalan Government to invite or to secure the European Union to intervene and to provide mediation between the Catalan Government and people and the Spanish Government to resolve the difficulties in that part of Europe?

They are condemning violence but not the decision to suppress a democratic vote. In fact, to some extent, there is a justification for talking about it being an internal Spanish matter to be dealt with under Spanish law. The UN charter and international law are crystal clear on the right to self-determination, but that right is being violently suppressed by the Spanish state, a European state. European leaders are not condemning it or saying the people of Catalonia have a right to vote and make their own decision on their political, social and cultural future.

I appreciate fully that their contributions reflect genuine concern and also, in the case of Deputy Eoin Ó Broin, informed by his presence in Catalonia over the weekend with other Irish elected representatives. The region is also a location I visit a couple of times each year. What has been said in the debate will be shared with Catalan and other Spanish contacts. In this way, a range of Irish opinions will be shared. This is something I welcome. As the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, said when she spoke on the topic recently, what happens in Spain is of great interest to their Irish friends in this House and the communities we represent across the country. Upholding the constitution and the rule of law in all its aspects is a key underpinning of all modern democracies. Ireland respects the constitutional and territorial unity of Spain. The Government's position remains that the constitutional and political arrangements in Spain, as in any country of the European Union, are matters to be determined by its own citizens through its own institutions in keeping with the rule of law. Political developments in democracies take place within a legal framework. This is what protects the rights of all citizens. Respecting the rule of law and the limits it imposes is not a choice but an obligation. Differences of opinion should be contested robustly by public representatives and others and all parties should do so with full respect for the law and the rights of citizens. That is the foundation that underpins and protects modern, democratic societies. I shared the dismay felt by many Irish people at the disturbing clashes and injuries sustained on Sunday in Catalonia. We know from our own experiences on this island, as well as from experiences elsewhere, of the particular responsibility borne by the authorities to balance law and order while respecting rights. Let me be clear: violence has no place in politics. This has always been the position of the Government. I echo the call from the European Commission to all relevant players to move very swiftly from confrontation to dialogue. It is important that steps be taken to reduce tensions and reclaim the space where differing political views can be contested through national and regional democratic institutions with full respect always for the law and the rights of citizens. The events of Sunday last are the subject of extensive debate in Catalonia and across Spain. Everyone has a responsibility to reduce tensions. What we are saying in this Chamber mirrors many of the reflections national and regional representatives there, as well as broader society, are putting forward. We trust our Spanish friends to decide for themselves how to shape their future. As I stated, what happens in Spain matters very much to us. We encourage all of the parties involved to find ways to de-escalate tensions and build trust.

The Spanish Government should respond to it through dialogue and negotiations, not by attacking voters and polling stations, a point on which there is agreement. The Catalan Government has requested mediation by the European Union on the issue. Does the Minister of State agree with that proposal and, more importantly, will the Government press the European Union to mediate on this important issue? I have heard the statement repeatedly that this is an internal matter for Spain. What happened in Catalonia on Sunday is a matter of concern for everyone. I agree that Ireland is a friend of Spain and a friend tells someone when he or she is wrong. Make no mistake about it - what happened on Sunday was wrong. Red lines were crossed and the Minister of State needs to let the Spanish Government know this. What happened was unacceptable and should not be allowed to happen again. The Catalan people need to be allowed to find a democratic pathway to decide their own future.

He used the phrase "all relevant players ... move ... from confrontation." There has been no confrontation by the Catalan Government or people. If one watches all of the media coverage, what one will see is people trying to assert their rights peacefully and in a dignified way. Confrontation is certainly not how I would describe it as. They were attacks by one group on another. There is a misunderstanding of how Catalan society has reached this point. For over a decade there have been attempts by successive Catalan Governments led by different political parties to find a different kind of constitutional arrangement within the Spanish state, either through greater devolution or now independence. The difficulty is that the Spanish Government is simply not open to dialogue. When one hears Mariano Rajoy's responses to the problems on the ground, the Spanish Government made its position very clear yesterday. What is needed is not a call for dialogue internally but international mediation and influence to be brought to bear, party to party, such as by the Minister of State's party, on the Popular Party in Spain to address the issue and crucially for the European Union to step in and mediate between the Catalan people and their representatives and the government in Spain. That is the role we want the Government in this jurisdiction to play.

The Minister of State said, "We trust our Spanish friends to decide for themselves how to shape their future." That is the problem. I do not trust Mariano Rajoy or the Spanish state that has a brutal history of suppressing the desire for self-determination of the people of Catalonia. We do not and should not trust them. What we saw on Saturday was a shocking, violent suppression of people who were acting peacefully and trying to do so in a democratic way. The Catalan Parliament made a democratic decision to hold a referendum and the people went out to try to cast their ballot papers and the Spanish state suppressed them violently. The European Union is always going on about its commitment to human rights. This is an elementary human right under international law for people to exercise the freedom to self-determination and the Spanish state is denying it. What is the Government going to state about this? What is the European Union going to state about it? If it states nothing, its claim to be concerned about democracy or human rights will be in tatters. Frankly, it has covered itself in shame in the last few days in failing to speak out more robustly about what the Spanish state is doing.

I reassure them that what is happening in Spain is also of great interest to the Government. Ireland enjoys an excellent relationship with Spain and has a great rapport with its people, including the thousands of Spanish schoolchildren who visit Ireland every year and in meeting Spanish tourists and business people and our contacts at political and governmental level. We will continue to work constructively with the Spanish Government to build bilateral and trade relations and pursue our common goals at EU and international level. In order to better understand our EU partner, we are monitoring developments in the country closely and will pay particular attention to any potential impact on Irish citizens. My Department is following developments closely and responding to the concerns of Irish citizens. Earlier this afternoon the Taoiseach spoke about the developments in Catalonia on Sunday. The Deputies are very much aware of what he said. We all were horrified by the violent incidents that we saw which involved state actors and unarmed and non-threatening civilians.We feel, not least from our own experiences, that such actions are counterproductive and that political progress needs to be made through dialogue. The Governments supports a resolution to the current situation which is based upon democracy and the rule of law. I want to reiterate the Government's position that this must be determined by Spain and its own people, based on the rule of law and through that country's own institutions. It is through such democratic processes that all voices can be heard and a way forward can be found. None of us here today wants to see further violence or injuries such as those seen last Sunday. I welcome the fact that demonstrations that have taken place since then have been allowed to take place in a peaceful manner.
#NoelRock	unknown-#NoelRock-party	unknown-#NoelRock-dob	unknown-#NoelRock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	348	I thank the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, for coming into the House to deal with this matter. I seek to raise the most urgent issue of the provision of a primary care centre in Finglas. This project was first approved in 2012. In July 2013, it was described by the then Minister of State at the Department of Health, former Deputy Alex White, as a "high priority" location. In February 2015, it was described by Deputy White's successor, Minister of State and former Deputy Kathleen Lynch, as "remaining a priority despite the planning setback", which I am sure the Minister of State will outline in his response today. Following that high profile planning setback from An Bord Pleanála, the lack of impetus and urgency on the part of the HSE to identify an alternative site has been staggering and appalling. Finglas, as the Minister of State will know well, is one of the most under served areas in the country in terms of general practitioners, GPs, and medical services generally. There is a dire need for the construction of a primary care centre in this part of the world. In response to a question that I submitted in 2015, Dublin City Council revealed that it had proposed five alternative sites to the HSE. That was two and a half years ago but there has been no tangible progress. In 2017 I corresponded with the HSE regarding this matter, arising from a parliamentary question I had submitted. The response indicated that a site had been identified but that a decision from the landowners was awaited. A number of days later, my office received a letter from the landowners stating that they had informed the Department of Health and the HSE that they did not wish for the land to be used for a primary care centre. The landowners had informed the HSE of same some weeks before I received a contradictory answer from the HSE via my parliamentary question.  It is now October 2017 and it appears that we are no closer to a solution. I am hoping that the Minister of State can uses his considerable influence and clout to bring people together and pursue a solution. It seems that there has been a real problem of co-ordination between the HSE, the Department and Dublin City Council from the outset. I imagine that is how the erroneous information came to me via a parliamentary question. It seems that various people within the agencies are not talking to each other. It would be greatly appreciated if we could bring some urgency and impetus to this most important matter. I do not need to remind the Minister of State that this primary care centre was promised five years ago. It was intended to cover more than 15,000 families from St. Margaret's Road to Finglas south. Finglas south currently has not a single GP. It is quite clear that not only do the people of Finglas need this, they deserve it. If we can show our commitment to assisting communities like these by making the plans of the previous Government from 2012 a reality as soon as possible, that will be a job well done. 
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	349	I thank Deputy Rock for raising the issue of the provision of a primary care centre in Finglas. Deputy Rock has a long track record in fighting for an improvement in the health services in the Finglas area in particular. Finglas has been identified as a high priority location for the development of a primary care centre. Plans for a HSE direct-build centre were approved in 2012 in the context of the HSE’s multi-annual capital plan. Following a review of a number of sites in the area, the HSE identified a Dublin City Council owned property on Mellowes Road in Finglas as the preferred site for the construction of the proposed new primary care centre. Subject to planning permission, the commercial terms for the sale were agreed with officials of Dublin City Council and approved by the HSE. The site on Mellows Road was selected because it was a good site. It was centrally located in the catchment area which it was intended to serve, had good accessibility and was well served by bus routes. It was a generous green field site that had future expansion capacity. There would be no impact on current services during the construction period and the location would complement the HSE day care centre on Kildonan Road. The site would facilitate the establishment of GP services in this area and local GPs had expressed significant interest, in discussion with the HSE, in being a part of the development at this specific location. As the Deputy will be aware, the granting of planning permission by Dublin City Council was appealed to An Bord Pleanála. An Bord Pleanála’s inspector also recommended that planning permission be granted, upholding the Dublin City Council decision. However, in February 2015, An Bord Pleanála took the unexpected decision not to grant planning permission for the Finglas primary care centre. We were extremely disappointed and shocked by this decision, as zoning was appropriate for the proposed development and use. The single reason given for the refusal by An Bord Pleanála was the loss of informal open space. Following the refusal by An Bord Pleanála, HSE estates in conjunction with local primary care services teams have reviewed a number of alternative sites for a new primary care centre in Finglas. A number of potential sites were identified by Dublin City Council but none were considered to be ideal. The HSE was made aware of another site in Finglas which would be very suitable for a primary care centre and which would potentially become available for the HSE to purchase. The HSE is still in discussions with the owners of the site and their agents to establish if their site development options would facilitate disposal of lands to the HSE or the incorporation of a primary care centre into a development at this location. These discussions are still ongoing and we understand that the owners are still considering their options. We await confirmation of their position. In the event that this site is not deliverable, all other options will then be considered by the HSE. Nevertheless Finglas south and west remains a priority for the Department and HSE as it is one of the communities most in need of access to primary care services. I will bring all of the issues raised by Deputy Noel Rock to the attention of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.
#NoelRock	unknown-#NoelRock-party	unknown-#NoelRock-dob	unknown-#NoelRock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	350	I thank the Minister of State for his considered response to the issues raised and questions posed. I suspect the site the Minister of State spoke about is the same one about which I received correspondence in the past. Maybe the owners of the site have changed their minds or maybe the HSE has moved on to look at a different site since my parliamentary question was submitted. I would rather not specify the site in this forum but I imagine that myself and the Minister of State are talking about the same site. The Minister of State said that all other options will be considered by the HSE in the event that this site is not deliverable and it would seem that now is the time to formulate a plan B. The planning permission application was turned down by An Bord Pleanála, as outlined in the Minister of State's speech, in February 2015. We are now two and a half years on from that point but are no closer to getting a solution, even though this project was announced five years ago. The funding has been ring fenced year after year and the needs of the people in Finglas south and west are no less than they were five years ago. In fact, those needs are even greater now. I appreciate that this was not the Minister of State's brief in 2012 nor from 2013 to 2016. However, his words here today are encouraging and his commitment is commendable. I would greatly appreciate it if the Minister of State could roll up his sleeves and use his considerable ability to join with me in trying to bring about a solution for these people.

In terms of the site issue, I agree that we need total clarity because this is not acceptable. In terms of urgency, I will push this matter with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, because progress to date has been slow. The people of Finglas deserve a primary care centre as a right, as far as I am concerned. I will do anything that I can to progress the project and find a solution. I assure Deputy Rock that I will use whatever clout I have. It is time for the talking to end. The people of Finglas south need and deserve a primary care centre. I have seen primary care centres in Coolock and other parts of my own constituency and they work very well. I know from Deputy Rock's experience and his very good work on the ground in the Finglas area that we urgently need to make this primary care centre a priority. I accept the Deputy's point that a plan B is urgently needed. I will bring the Deputy's concerns back to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and will do my best to ensure that Deputy Rock's constituents get the best health services, which is what they deserve.

Deputy Tony McLoughlin is also present, and I know this matter is very close to the heart of Deputy Martin Kenny. It concerns Sligo Garda station, a regional and divisional headquarters which houses an assistant commissioner, a chief superintendent, a superintendent, 140 gardaí and 20 civilians. For many years it has not been fit for purpose and it was condemned by the regional safety adviser of An Garda Síochána in October 2015. In July 2016 an independent health and safety specialist, Mr. Michael O'Reilly, who was hired by the GRA, also condemned the cells. Since October 2016 no drinking water has been available. We all salute the heroics of a number of gardaí who, on no less than four occasions throughout the summer months, saved people from the River Garavogue but did not have a shower to warm them up and clean themselves in afterwards. This is totally unacceptable and a walkout was arranged by staff in October 2016, although it was deferred on the basis of absolute assurances from management that temporary works would be carried out to make the existing Garda station usable and safe until a new Garda regional headquarters was built. To this day no works have happened and this is totally unacceptable and an insult to the people of the north-west region. This regional office is the headquarters for Sligo, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal and Louth. This is happening against the backdrop of the cynical reopening of Stepaside Garda station. An apparent leak to the media from a report to which the Committee of Public Accounts, of which I am a member, was refused access suggests the decision was based on population increases, which is another dubious retrofit to satisfy political gain. In Meath, the Garda stations in Kilmessan and Crosskeel have closed while Athboy and Oldcastle are push-button situations. However, there has been a 59% increase in property theft and an increase in burglaries of 44% in that county. The county has also had the same increase in population, according to census 2016, as Dublin at 5.9% but Stepaside was a very specific case, at the expense of the likes of Sligo and Meath. What is the reason for this? The people cannot take politicians seriously unless they do what they say they are going to do but the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, was in Sligo on 21 August and said we would have a site for the new Garda station within three or four weeks. This is week six but nothing has happened except an absence of drinking water, condemned cells and prisoners in a regional headquarters being transported 15 miles after public order arrests on a Saturday night. What is it that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has? Outside the Step Inn, in the run-up to Christmas 2015, the champion Independent could be seen wearing a Santa Claus hat. Straddling him was Councillor Kevin Daly holding a sign reading "Open Stepaside Garda station". What happened? It is reopened based on a spurious criterion while the people of Sligo are forced to suffer and the people of Meath, with the same population increase as Dublin, are dismissed and thrown under the bus. Does the sum of the Ministers, the Meath Deputies Regina Doherty, Damien English and Helen McEntee, not equal the influence the great almighty himself, the Minister, Deputy Ross, has on Government? The assistant Whip, Deputy Tony McLoughlin, Deputy Eamon Scanlon, Deputy Martin Kenny and I represent three different political entities and are all committed to the same thing. Do we have no say? When it comes to giving gardaí the basic working conditions they deserve, are we making the criteria up as we go along?

I also recognise the interest Deputies Scanlon, Martin Kenny and McLoughlin, who has previously raised the matter, have in the issue. As the Deputy will be aware, the Office of Public Works has primary responsibility for the provision and maintenance of Garda accommodation and works closely with the Garda authorities in this regard. The Programme for a Partnership Government recognises that An Garda Síochána must also have the modern technology and other resources, including fit-for-purpose buildings, necessary to do its job and notes that the capital plan 2016-2021 secured resources in this regard. The Deputy will be aware of the significant efforts being made by Government to enhance the working environment generally for members of An Garda Síochána, and of the major investment that has been committed under the capital plan 2016-2021 to upgrade Garda premises, the Garda fleet and Garda ICT infrastructure. This is evidenced by the Garda station building and refurbishment programme 2016-2021, which is an ambitious five-year programme that will benefit over 30 locations around the country and includes over €60 million of Exchequer funding as part of the capital plan as well as a major public private partnership project. Under the programme, a new Garda station is to be provided in Sligo, together with stations in Macroom and Clonmel, by means of public private partnership. The Deputy will be aware that, in order to secure a suitable site for the Sligo development, the Office of Public Works placed advertisements in local and national newspapers in January 2017 seeking expressions of interest from property owners or developers, with returns received in February 2017. I am informed that the Office of Public Works, together with Garda estate management, reviewed the submitted proposals in early April 2017 and a number of suitable sites have been identified as possible options for the development. In this context, the Office of Public Works is now actively progressing the acquisition of a site and I understand that the aim is to reach agreement on the purchase of a suitable site very soon. The Minister has been advised that, pending the development of the new station, local Garda management and the Office of Public Works have been working closely to develop proposals to improve the accommodation situation in the existing station. This includes exploring options for the relocation of certain functions outside the station and reconfiguring the premises to meet the needs of front-line operational personnel and to address space or health and safety concerns. Further, the Minister has been assured that, within every Garda division, there are adequate custody facilities to meet legal standards. I also understand that other short-term measures have been taken to address and improve the accommodation situation at the station. For example, works to fully refurbish the toilets above the public office were completed in late July 2016 and a new industrial-standard kitchen facility has been installed. On behalf of the Minister, I want to reassure the House that the Government is fully committed to proceeding with its major investment programme that aims to provide new stations and to modernise older stations at key locations around the country, ensuring a safe, modern working environment for gardaí as well as fit-for-purpose facilities for visitors, victims and suspects.

Just because Deputies McLoughlin, Scanlon, Martin Kenny and I did not stand bearing gifts, as Santa Claus Ross did outside the Step Inn at Christmas 2015, it seems the OPW is pressing ahead and is at an advanced stage of reopening the semi-derelict building in Stepaside, and this was confirmed by the acting Commissioner at the Committee of Public Accounts last week, just to placate the Minister, Deputy Ross, and to keep him on board in the Government. It seems the Ministers, Deputies Regina Doherty, English and McEntee, can go to hell despite the fact that their county has had the same population increases. The same applies to Deputies McLoughlin, Martin Kenny, Scanlon and me because nobody cares about the people of the north west. Here we are again, getting an IOU, which reminds me of "Dumb and Dumber" and the promise "That's as good as money, Sir." The Minister is telling us he has great plans, he will do this and do up the other but nothing has happened yet. Ask the GRA, ask the detective branch and ask the assistant commissioner. I do not blame any of them as they are living and working in conditions that are not fit for anybody. If this was a private sector premises it would have been closed down already but because it is in-house, people are told to keep quiet. They are told that they will be looked after in due course but the sum of McLoughlin, MacSharry, Scanlon and Martin Kenny, not to mention the three Meath Ministers, Regina Doherty, McEntee and English, does not equal that of Ross. What does the Minister have to say to the people of Sligo? I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is not the line Minister and I mean no disrespect to him but it is a further example of the contempt shown to the people of Sligo that the senior line Minister does not have the courtesy or the manners to come here to discuss the issue. Instead, we have the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran - who is a fine gentleman - coming to Sligo, promising a site within three weeks but nothing has happened. We saw the tweets from the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, announcing the opening of Stepaside Garda station at the beginning of June. The deputy commissioner confirmed to us at the Committee of Public Accounts last week that it was under way but Sligo can wait.

As I mentioned, the provision of a new Garda facility in Sligo is a key component of the Garda station building and refurbishment programme 2016-2021, which is an ambitious five-year programme that will benefit more than 30 locations around the country. In the context of the proposed new station in Sligo, the Office of Public Works is progressing the acquisition of a suitable site, having placed advertisements locally earlier this year. I want to repeat that because I do not think it was heard earlier. The Office of Public Works is progressing the acquisition of a suitable site. Furthermore, local Garda management and the Office of Public Works are working closely to improve the accommodation in the existing station.

I wish to focus on section 9 of this Bill, namely, the earnings disregard for people with disabilities. Fianna Fáil welcomes this provision and the fact that any decision which denies entitlement to a benefit or payment will ultimately be made by a deciding officer. Currently, those on payments such as disability allowance or a blind person's pension may have the first €120 of their payments disregarded for the purposes of the means test governing eligibility for those schemes even though such earnings are allowable, provided the employment concerned is certified as being of a rehabilitative nature. In addition to that, moneys earned from the rehabilitative employment between €120 and €350 per week is assessed at 50% under the means test.  I note that the report of the interdepartmental group established under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities provided that the requirement to prove that work is of this nature was unnecessary and such a requirement should be dispensed with. The Bill acknowledges this recommendation in respect of the earnings disregard for the aforementioned payments. The most recent SIF report provides that those on disability payments are at various stages of poverty and deprivation to the point that they are lagging far behind the general population. In that regard, I very much welcomed the recent introduction of the Ability programme for young people with disabilities and while this will hopefully assist those who need help to enter into the labour market, we cannot forget those who are already in the system. We need to move away from placing further restrictions and obstacles in their way. The Bill goes some way towards this. As the Fianna Fáil spokesperson for disabilities, I have seen first-hand the hardships experienced by persons with disabilities. Since taking up this position I have continuously called for the formal ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It is hard to believe that ten years after signing up to it, it remains unratified. The Taoiseach told me in this Chamber last week that the Government is taking a different approach from that of the other countries in Europe that have ratified it. I point out to the Minister of State that it certainly is a very hands off approach. If it takes this long to implement a measure that was signed in 2007, we will not make many inroads into achieving social inclusion for those with disabilities. We need to ensure that people with disabilities are given equality of opportunity in order that they can participate in society to the best of their abilities.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	361	I thank the Leas-Chann Comhairle for this opportunity to speak on the Bill. Its purpose is to provide for amendments to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, the Pensions Act 1990 and the Civil Registration Act 2004. One of the main provisions of this Bill is to amend the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 to allow for the publication, on a quarterly basis, of the names and address of persons convicted in a court of social welfare fraud. Fianna Fáil does not condone welfare fraud in any shape or form, but we do not condone the perception created by the Taoiseach when he was Minister for Social Protection that there was widespread social welfare fraud in his Welfare Cheats Cheat Us All campaign. That was unfair because while some people engage in fraud most people do not set out to do that. I have dealt with cases of people who claimed social welfare not knowing they were wrong in doing so. I know of cases of people having had overpayments of €60,000 and €70,000 who genuinely did not know they were wrong, and they are trying to pay money back. The vast majority of those in receipt of a social welfare payment are genuine claimants. We will be tabling an amendment to this Bill to ensure that only those who have been convicted of intentional social welfare fraud in excess of €5,000 will have their names published. With regard to the legislation on the public service cards, I am aware of the widespread opposition to the introduction of a compulsory identity, ID, card. There are advantages for its introduction. There are plausible arguments for and against that, but many will vigorously challenge the possible infringements on a person’s privacy. We will be seeking reassurances from the Minister that the questions raised by the Data Protection Commissioner will be addressed in full and that there is full transparency in terms of how the data is collected and, moreover, that people's personal data is properly and safely secured. The public needs to have full confidence in the public services card and the Department needs to communicate more effectively on this issue. That is critical. In this age in which we live it is a very useful card, but people need to know what personal information it holds and who has access to it. I accept the card has been in operation for those who require social protection services since 2011 and this is not the first time a national identity card was mooted. In 2009, a report by the then Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs recommended the introduction of a national identity card to coincide with the development of a public services card. The public services card contains very sensitive data, including biometric information, a person's date of birth and their personal public service number, PPSN. The databases behind the card will link to a variety of important public services. Therefore, the databases behind the card will have highly sensitive information such as a person's address, family and medical information, etc. We need to know who will have access to this information. Thousands of people could potentially have access, which increases the chances of abuse of the data and the chances of leaks. There is also no guarantee that the data will not be transferred to outside agencies, private companies and so forth that are supplying public services. The Bill contains a number of tidying-up measures in various areas, some of which I welcome. I welcome, in particular, the changes being made in section 9 for those in receipt of a disability allowance, the blind person’s pension and certain supplementary welfare payments to remove the rule allowing the disregard of earnings only where employment is of a rehabilitative nature. At present, those in receipt of disability allowance and the blind person's pension may have the first €120 per week of their earnings disregarded for the purposes of the means test governing eligibility for those schemes. However, such earnings are allowable provided that the employment concerned is certified as being of a rehabilitative nature. In addition, income from rehabilitative employment of between €120 and €350 per week is assessed at 50% under the means test. The report of the interdepartmental group, the Make Work Pay group for people with disabilities, established under the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities found that the requirement to prove that work is of a rehabilitative nature in order to avail of the earnings disregard was unnecessary and recommended dispensing with this requirement. The Bill also provides for a number of amendments to the Pensions Act 1990, which I welcome. We need to have a serious debate on pension provision in Ireland. There is no question but that the pension system is in need of reform. The Government must get its act together and act to address many of the issues that are causing great distress for pensioners and those coming up to pension age. There are anomalies that should to be addressed and they arise as a result of the methodology used in the determination of entitlements based on contributions, mainly for women but also for men, where there is a shortfall that means that they are not entitled to the full rate of pension. Issues such as the anomalies in the calculation of the contributory pension and forcing people who have worked all of their lives to sign on for jobseekers benefit for one year before they qualify for their pension should be addressed. Since my election, I have continued to highlight the pension gap between men and women. The past four decades have witnessed a seismic change in women’s participation in the workforce, but they are still financially less well off than men. Changes to the contributory pension thresholds that determine how much people receive by way of a State pension have made the position far worse for women. With effect from April 2012, the number of paid contributions required to qualify for a State pension increased from 260 to 520. The measure has worked against many women who spent time out of the workforce. A new homemaker’s credit was approved at the same time which seemed to offset any potential inequality, but it was not sanctioned by the Department of Finance because of the cost involved. It is crucial that we see the promised homemaker’s credit introduced and backdated to the 1970s. The current scheme was only backdated to 1994 and limited to the care of the children up to 12 years of age. We need to move towards a universal pensions system which would give both women and men equal access to a comprehensive pension guarantee. The payment rate must provide for a decent standard of living for all. We have a situation where many people, mainly women, are being denied a full State pension on retirement. We also have a situation where people are being forced to retire at 65 years but cannot access their entitlement to receive a State pension until they reach 66 years. We have a looming pension crisis where the rate of supplementary pension scheme coverage in Ireland is estimated to be only 35% of the working population when the private sector is considered in isolation. Fine Gael has been in government for seven years and it is time this issue was resolved. Financial hardship in retirement has become a real prospect for a lot of women. While much attention is paid to the gender pay gap, the problem is far more pronounced at pension age, with a pension gap between men and women of about 37%. I have been contacted by a number of women who are extremely worried about their pension entitlements. Many of them will not be entitled to receive the full pension payment because they do not have enough paid contributions and are anxious about how this will impact on their pensions. There is no doubt but that it will have a serious effect on them. These are individuals who started working and had to give up work to mind children and who then went back into the workforce. What is happening is very unfair. The pension pay gap between men and women amounts to about €700 a month. In fact, only 16% of women receive the full State pension. To be paid at the top rate, a person will need a yearly average of 48 paid or credited contributions from 1979. This means that a generation of women are either on reduced pensions, as they do not have enough contributions to qualify for the full rate, or receive one as a qualified adult which is related to their husband’s pension and is not a payment to them in their own right. We need to move towards a universal pensions system which would give both women and men equal access to a comprehensive pension guarantee. This pension should be at a payment rate which would provide a decent standard of living for all. I would again like to voice my concerns about eligibility for the tenant purchase scheme, specifically for those in receipt of a social welfare payment. The local authority tenant purchase scheme that came into effect in January last year deliberately makes it very difficult for anybody in receipt of a social welfare payment to purchase a house. No citizen should be excluded from the scheme that is open to social housing tenants on a minimum gross annual income of €15,000. Under the terms of the scheme, the council will place an incremental purchase charge on the house equal to the discount given, with the charge reducing to zero over time. Where a local authority house is valued at €150,000 and the applicant’s gross annual income is €18,000, a discount of 60% will be given against the purchase price and the applicant will pay €60,000. The scheme excludes tenants who are dependent on social welfare payments as their primary source of income and it has been set up in a way that deliberately makes it very difficult for anybody in receipt of social welfare payments to purchase a house, which is regrettable. Since it was established originally by Fianna Fáil, the tenant purchase scheme has been responsible for the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of the State and access should not be denied to any citizen. Home ownership is good for the families who live in the houses in question and good for the communities in which they live. Opening up a pathway to home ownership is at the very heart of Fianna Fáil policy. Ireland cannot afford to have a divided society where home ownership is confined to a few, while the rest struggle with unstable tenure and rent levels. The right to buy under the tenant purchase scheme has been an important tool in extending home ownership opportunities to low income households. The option to own a valuable long-term asset has empowered thousands of families across the country and should not be denied to any family or individual.

I am glad to have the opportunity to speak to the Bill. I note that it touches on a wide range of subjects and there are a number of aspects I wish to raise. First, I welcome the changes to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 which is being amended in the Bill with a view to deterring and reducing the level of social welfare fraud. Those found to be in receipt of excess of €5,000 in fraudulent payments will have their names published.  With regard to the Civil Registration Act 2004, I welcome the deletion of the Office Registrar, General and deputy registrar general. The country is top-heavy with unnecessary offices and management that only delay certain processes. The ending of these restrictive positions is welcome. This, however, results in the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection being responsible for the provision of birth, marriage and death certificates. For this reason, I am fearful that the Department may exploit the opportunity as a way to raise income. Having recently done away with death benefit, I plead with the Minister of State, Deputy David Stanton, to keep the cost of these important documents at the current price, if not to reduce it further, particularly the cost of a death certificate. We are all well aware of the strain the loss of a loved one can place on a family emotionally, as well as financially, as a result of funeral expenses.  Changes to the Pensions Act 1990 are also incorporated in the Bill. I bring to the Minister of State's attention a problem I raised on the floor of the House recently during Leaders' Questions. It is the issue of pensions for women in the home. Article 40.2.1° and Article 40.2.2° of the Constitution state:1° ... that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.2° The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.I am aware that the Government intends to hold a referendum to amend the article next year. My point is that we all know plenty of such women who left work after getting married to stay at home and rear their families or take care of parents and in-laws. They have saved the State millions of euros in child care and carers' fees. Many of them went back to work for a number of years after their families were reared and now realise they do not have enough stamps to receive a State pension. While a few of them benefited slightly from the introduction of the homemaker's scheme in 1994, many homemakers in my constituency of Cork South West have brought this issue to my attention at various clinics. They believe they have been discriminated against. In fact, they believe that, despite the wording of the article, the State did not go far enough to ensure they would be left in a financially stable position. They believe they have been left high and dry by the State. What an awful thing for them to feel having served the State for so long. I ask the Minister of State to raise this and the earlier issues I mentioned and to treat them in the legislation.
#DannyHealyRae	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-party	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-dob	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	364	I welcome the opportunity to speak on these matters related to pensions and the public services card. As I understand it, there are three pensions Bills to be brought before us in this Chamber in the current term. They come from Deputies Richard Boyd Barrett, Willie Penrose and Johnny Brady. I do not deny any of the three Deputies the right to bring whatever they wish before us in the Chamber as they are elected and have that right but I wonder if the three Bills could be streamlined into one Bill. There is no doubt but that the pension system needs to be improved in many areas. We have social welfare inequalities and unfairness in many areas. It is ridiculous that currently people must retire from many jobs at 65 years of age. After working for 40 or 45 years, it is ridiculous to think they cannot get the contributory pension until they reach 66 years of age so they go on jobseeker's benefit. We were all at the ploughing championships and it was great to be able to meet the farming community and people who service the business. It is a wonderful experience every year to meet people from every part of the country, especially those who go religiously from very rural areas. Fewer than 50% of these farmers have any preparations made for a pension. It is only when these men and women reach 65 or 66 years of age that they give any thought to the pension and at that stage, with many of them, their hips, backs and hands are gone and there are fingers missing. They will have given endless hours to work; more than many people, except maybe those in private business. They do not have working hours and they go from darkness in the morning until the dark of night. They work on Sundays and every day of the week. It is amazing to think that fewer than 50% have any provision for a pension. I was glad to hear the Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, suggesting a number of weeks ago some new idea he has for a pension. Farmers certainly need to be looked after as they dedicate their whole life to their farms and their operations. They must do it. As mentioned by Deputy Michael Collins, there are many women who, if they have reached pension age since 2012, would not qualify for a full pension. Maybe some of them are not getting any pension. I have an example of two sisters who went into the workforce back in the 1970s. One of the girls worked in the black economy and there were no stamps paid for her while the other girl had her stamps paid. Both of them reared their families and did not work for a long number of years up until the late 1980s. They went back to work again and the girl who had the stamps paid will not qualify for a full pension but the girl who was in the black economy and was paid cash will. That needs to rectified, particularly the way contributions are averaged. It is not fair and when something is not fair, it is not right. Many of these women are coming to elected representatives to see what we can do for them. Our group raised this matter in the Dáil a number of months ago but we were told the money was not there to rectify it as it would cost €300 million or €400 million. These people are being wronged and this must be looked at again. This will become an election matter. The affected people came up here from all over Kerry to highlight the problem. Will the Minister look at this as the averaging system is wrong and unfair? Many pension schemes have employers paying in for their employees but they will not benefit the employees. These pensions need to be clarified. Employees and employers do not know enough about these pension schemes and they are not benefitting the employees. Many people are worried about the public services card because they want to know who will have access to the card. If they do not want to give it to certain people, it is a right that should be upheld. The matter will not go away and it needs to be dealt with in a fairer manner.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	365	I welcome the opportunity to speak to this very important matter. I meet people weekly at clinics and I hear of the recovery but people on pensions and other various payments are, unfortunately, not feeling the benefit of any recovery. I certainly hope in the forthcoming budget, there will be what I would call a substantial and fair increase for people on different payments from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. That is very important. Today I had three phone calls from families who were not ringing for the fun of it. They were asking about the bereavement grant and if such a grant was available. I was very sorry to tell them that there is no bereavement grant but a case may be made individually and people may be able to get some funding. To be honest, the bereavement grant should never have been taken away and it should certainly be restored. I heard the Taoiseach today saying we have seen nothing until we see what his Government does over the next period of time. If he wants to show that his heart is in the right place, he should please restore the bereavement grant. There is one anomaly that comes up an awful lot, which is where people, through no fault of their own, are affected by some error made in filling out a form. There is some mistake and there is nothing devious or underhand about it but, all of a sudden, these people might owe the State €500, €5,000 or €15,000. They are left struggling. I know that if money is owed to the State, it must be repaid. There is a minimum amount that can be accepted. I ask that for people in bad, tough or dire circumstances, the rule be relaxed. In other words, no case should be the same. If people find they must repay money to the State, they should at least be given a proper and lengthy opportunity to repay an amount they can afford. I also want to have my say on women who have worked very hard in homemaking. I appreciate the homemaker scheme but it is too restrictive as it only takes into account a certain number of years. People who had families before or after that period are unable to avail of it, which is wrong. Those people worked hard and brought the next generation into this world. They should be entitled to a full pension, the same as anybody else as they worked at home, doing what is probably one of the most important jobs in raising their families. I use this opportunity to pay a very special compliment and tribute to a very important group of people who work as our community welfare officers in different communities, whether it is in Kenmare, Killarney, Gneevgullia, Killorglin or elsewhere.They are really in touch with their communities and doing great work. They deal with stressful situations every day and it is not often that they are recognised in Dáil Éireann. However, I extend my compliments to them as they are doing a great service for the State. The one thing I am terrified of is that the great work being done by community welfare officers would be centralised. They have a great and in-depth knowledge of their local areas and the people they are representing and I want them to be there into the future. I support what my brother, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, said, that the biggest insult of all to a person who soldiered very hard and worked to the age of 65 years is that they are told that there is no transition pension between the ages of 65 and 66 years. It is an insult. It is crazy that they are told that they should be retiring but that they must go on jobseeker's benefit. It is morally wrong and an insult to people who have worked hard. The transition pension between the ages of 65 and 66 years should be brought back and people treated with the respect they deserve.

The new Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, introduced the Bill on Second Stage before the recess in July. I wish her well in her new role. Section 4 has generated significant controversy. It provides that, "From the beginning of 2018, a quarterly compilation and publication of the list of persons who have been convicted of an offence under the Social Welfare Consolidation Bill Act 2005 or welfare fraud related offences under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001..." The apparent aim is simply to increase public awareness of the consequence of such activity. After three months the list will be removed from the Department's website, which will be refreshed. As many have observed, it is very striking that this particular list is being prioritised over, for example, a list of the bankers and financial wizards who have conned the country out of billions. Where is the list for them, the white collar criminals who will have our grandchildren paying for the blackguarding with which they got away? There was no regulation then, or, at most, light touch regulation. There is one law for the rich and another for the poor; shame and public disgrace for those who in engage in social welfare fraud but protection and anonymity for the high level financial operators. This is simply not good enough and we wonder why people are cynical about politics. It is unacceptable in the extreme.  Another section that has generated significant concern is the one dealing with the public services card and the circumstances in which it will be mandatory. Much has been made of the Minister's celebrated remark that the card is mandatory but not compulsory. What is the difference? Which comes first? I am not sure that this provided the reassurance for which many were looking. I do not believe it provided any.  In terms of the other aims of the Bill, I certainly agree that it is vitally important that we protect the interests of employees with respect to their defined benefit pension contributions and that we do all that we can to produce a more robust and effective mechanism to ensure that will occur. I understand the Minister will be introducing amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage in this area, but it might be too late for that. Why are they not in the general body of the Bill? Many will have found it quite shocking that there has never been a statutory obligation on employers under Irish law to engage with trustees and members to address deficits in their defined benefit pension schemes. This is found to be the case particularly with big business and corporations. Not enough conditions have been put on employers who wish to terminate their liability to contribute to their defined benefit pension schemes. We have seen how they have been abandoned and closed down overnight, which is not acceptable. I am glad that the Minister is intent on introducing clarity in that regard. We are waiting to see what measures she will introduce. From what she has previously indicated, the amendment she is intent on introducing will not permit an employer to walk away at short notice. I hope that measure will be well ring-fenced and supported by legislation because it applies to many big employers who move and change companies.  The amendments will also provide for a 12-month notification period to enable negotiations and discussions to take place between all sides. I welcome these amendments. Where a scheme is in deficit, they will require employers to enter into dialogue with trustees to develop a plan to sustain the scheme. It is only where these steps fail and no funding proposal is in place that the Pensions Authority will determine a funding obligation in the form of a schedule of contribution amounts and dates by which they will have to be paid.  As the Minister also noted in her remarks in July, the Bill includes a measure which will confirm the special position within the welfare code of guardians who take responsibility for caring for children who have been orphaned or whose parents are unable to take care of them. The Bill also includes a measure supporting people with a disability who take up employment. I will be very interested to hear the thoughts of someone like Senator John Dolan and the Disability Rights Federation. It is very important that we look closely at this measure and do not just pay lip service to it.  Like my colleagues, Deputies Michael and Danny Healy-Rae, I salute and praise community welfare officers. The previous Government closed down facilities and stopped community welfare officers from meeting people in places such as health centres and elsewhere and put them all in big offices in a couple of towns. They withdrew their support from the community and it could not have been done at a worse time when community welfare officers were never needed more. They are on the front line trying to deal with issues, but they are not available because they have to get taxis to get into towns to meet people who are out of the comfort of their own surroundings. We must respect community welfare officers and support them and allow them to do the job they have always done.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	367	There are a number of issues dealt with in the Bill that could easily merit a long contribution, not least the fact that the Bill falls very far short of the framework that was launched earlier in the year which promised significant pension reform. My colleague, Deputy Róisín Shortall, spoke to the Bill and raised many of the issues surrounding the management of pensions and the plight of workers such as those in Aer Lingus, the Dublin Airport Authority, Marks & Spencer’s, Independent News and Media and so on. I will not go over the same territory again.  Given what transpired during the summer break regarding the outrageous handling of the public services card, that is an area on which I particularly want to focus. Section 5 of the Bill makes provision for the Minister to issue a public services card where she sees fit. Departments and systems have to talk to each other, but safeguards are incredibly important and people are very conscious of the need to safeguard their personal data. The sledgehammer style introduction of the public services card has caused not only confusion, justified anger and fear but it has also severely impacted on some people's welfare payments because they expressed understandable and legitimate concerns about the new system. I spoke to one applicant who told me that all she was looking for was clarification as to whether it was compulsory to obtain one of these cards. I know that she has not been paid her pension, something into which she had paid and something she regarded as a benefit she would receive when she sought it. Instead of taking on board legitimate concerns of citizens about how their personal data would be used or transferred among Departments, or to handlers in other jurisdictions, they were ignored and people found themselves being held financially hostage as their payments were discontinued if they refused to blindly accept the imposition of the public service card. I do not know if a benefit for which somebody has paid can be legitimately withheld. If it happened to a politician or in the case of a ministerial pension, the High Court would be invoked as a possible sanction, but it seems that when it is a small individual who is trying to establish his or her rights, there is a difference in treatment.  The Minister has repeatedly denied that the public services card is, in fact, an ID card, yet the proposed subsection (1)(d) of section 5 clearly and succinctly states a person may use his or her public services card for the purposes of proving his or her identity to any other person or specified body. If we are to have an ID card, let us have a discussion about it.Let us have the discussion about the safeguards around identity cards but let us not do it by stealth. To watch the Minister ignoring concerns about an ID card, in an age when personal data is a commodity, was breathtaking. Serious concerns exist regarding the digital safety of such information. I dealt with a woman who had her old age pension payment stopped after she questioned whether it was mandatory to accept the public services card, PSC. I asked some parliamentary questions and received what can only be described as an aggressive defence of this woman's treatment and the treatment of others like her. The Minister said on radio that most people were accepting of this. Why would they not be accepting of it if by refusing to get one of these cards they would not receive their pension? Further, the reply doubles down on the fact that the PSC is indeed a national identity card and stresses the ‘consequences’ for those who refuse to get on board with the system. People need reassurance at the very least.  To add serious insult to injury, the reply also confirms that people who had the audacity not to blindly swallow the Government's line, and who dared to pose questions and express concerns, not only had their payments stopped but will not have those amounts backdated when their payment resumes. I find that astonishing because it is a benefit if a person has paid into it and meets the qualifying criteria. I do not understand how a person's pension can be discontinued without addressing that. Essentially, those persons find themselves penalised substantially for daring to raise legitimate concerns. Another area where there are significant legitimate concerns is JobPath. A significant section of this Bill concerns itself with the area of social welfare fraud and identifying those working while claiming payments. I am certainly not justifying anybody doing that but it appears very little consideration is given to finding ways to accommodate those people who are actively engaging with the system but want to activate themselves in the jobs market.  I am dealing with a case where a father of two was referred to JobPath in 2016. This referral happened despite the fact that he had declared himself a casual worker, in that he could pick up a few hours here and there and have his social protection payment reduced accordingly. Upon being sent to register for JobPath he was told, on the registration day, that he was not a suitable candidate yet they registered him anyway. Had he refused to be registered his social protection payment would more than likely have stopped although he did not have the casual work. The obligations placed on him by the Department required him to attend at times notified to him, even if those times clashed with working hours he had been offered. He consistently raised this issue with the team and told them he was at risk of losing the bit of work he had if they refused to help manage the times accordingly. He was rebuffed and ignored. Even more worrying, he was asked to sign documents asking him to verify attendance at sessions which he had not attended. When he expressed concern at signing something he knew not to be true he was told not to worry about it and that he had to sign in order to get paid. He had specifically requested a truck training programme and was refused and instead sent on a Private Security Authority, PSA, licence course which cost the same amount of money but had poorer work prospects for him. He was coerced into the training with the promise of a job at the end of it but no such job ever materialised. He was prohibited from accepting any other external offers of employment during the training time and threatened with sanctions if he accepted work outside the JobPath scheme. Eventually, he and his wife decided that it would be more prudent for him to take the risk of accepting a job and that is what he did. He then found himself pestered by Seetec, the JobPath organising company, to get his new employer to fraudulently fill out forms claiming JobPath had got him the job. The employer was contacted on several occasions. JobPath did not get him the job but he and his new employer were repeatedly harassed to the point that the employer eventually signed the forms to get it off his back. The man in question felt that he had to speak out and highlight what is going on in this scheme. This is not a client centred labour market activation programme. This is a programme for profit. The same company is having significant difficulties with the legal system in Scotland.  I ask the Minister of State to look into issues such as the public services card. Much more thought has to be given to some of the people who have fallen foul of this. It is not acceptable that people who have paid all their lives cannot get their pensions because they do not want to engage with the public services card but can provide alternative identification through a passport or a driving licence. They do not feel confident enough about the card and have not received enough answers on it.  The JobPath scheme merits a serious review from a citizen's perspective rather than looking to penalise and punish. There are other things within the Department that are costing money and which are not what they were intended to be. JobPath deserves that kind of scrutiny.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	368	The priority of this Bill should have been to reverse the savage cuts and austerity that the past two Governments visited on ordinary people. Instead, this legislation is taking the opportunity to demonise social welfare recipients. The dishonest claim of high levels of fraud was a cynical tactic used by the then Minister for Social Protection to promote himself and his recent campaign for Taoiseach. There is a very low level of fraud in this country. Research shows that the largest proportion of funding lost is lost through administrative error, some customer error but not fraud. The fraud levels here compare very favourably with the 2% to 5% levels in the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States of America and New Zealand. The proposals in this Bill for publication of names, addresses, fines and penalties make no distinction between someone who has been convicted for a relatively minor offence and someone who has habitually committed serious fraud. Recovery of overpayments is a question I come across regularly at clinics. Most of these are due to administrative error or errors by applicants. Thankfully the Government's proposal to recover 25% and recover repayments by way of that deduction has been dropped from the legislation. The situation is very difficult and needs to be reviewed. The Department is allowed to deduct 15% from the social welfare rate for overpayments. That is being used as the normal and only rate of deduction, in most cases without any consultation with the applicants. In many cases where there is consultation, and that is a small percentage, it was implemented before the applicant made his case and returned it to the Department. It has been automatically deducted. That is wrong and should be reviewed by the Minister and stopped. If there is an overpayment to a person on jobseeker's allowance of €193 a week, whether through administrative error or an error on the part of the recipient, 15% is routinely deducted. That person loses just under €29 a week and receives a payment of €164.05. It is not possible to live on that. That needs to be examined urgently.  A new unit was set up some time ago to trawl for overpayments. It goes back years.I have seen cases where it went back 21 years, and looked at situations that were closed off for that length of time. They are also trawling back that far for very small sums of money. That should be looked at. If something has been dormant for five, ten, 15 or 20 years, it should be written off. How can anyone make their case years down the line? It is very difficult to retain documentation. It is very difficult for someone to make his or her case when they are trying to account for something so far down in the past. I have concerns about the public service card. It is moving in the direction of a mandatory identity card. If it is to be introduced, it must be done on a voluntary basis. How secure is the data on these cards and who and what agencies have access to it? Now that we are outsourcing some social welfare schemes, will these private companies which are operating on behalf of the Department be entitled to receive the recipients' data that is held on these cards? That should be examined.  Turas Nua and the JobPath programme are completely inflexible. Once one is referred to one of these schemes, one cannot take up another scheme. I dealt with a case recently where a man was interviewed for a CE scheme on a Friday, told on Monday he had a place on the scheme and would start on the following Monday, but then on Tuesday he had a letter from Turas Nua to say that he had been referred to its scheme the previous week. It was the first he heard of that but he was not allowed to take up his place on the CE nevertheless, despite interventions across the board. I know from talking to Deputies in the House that this is happening across the country. Others have raised the situation faced by women regarding the State pension. This is something that I come across regularly at my clinics as, I am sure, do other Deputies. The regulations were changed by the former leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Joan Burton, of all people. Now we have a situation where women who had breaks in their employment to work at home to rear their children find themselves with either no pensions or their pensions significantly reduced. That is not good enough. If nothing else, the Government should take the opportunity of this Bill to deal with this question and ensure that women who were in employment and then looked after their children and reared them at home and then returned to work are entitled to their full pension, as was the case. I agree with other Deputies that the qualifying age should be re-examined. It was another austerity measure introduced by the Labour Party in the last Government. We now have a situation where State pensions are not paid to people until they are 66 years and there is a hiatus between 65 when many people have to leave employment and 66 years. In the future, the age will increase to 68 years and recent reports that there is talk that it will be 70 years. The pension age should be returned to 65 years and people should have the option to work on if they wish. This should be looked at in this Bill. One category of social welfare recipients who were badly hit in the years of austerity through cuts introduced by Deputy Joan Burton were one-parent families. We know that poverty is rampant among one-parent families. There are children who go to bed and to school hungry. This is supposed to be a republic of opportunity. The Minister and the Government should now take the opportunity in this Bill to reverse the cuts that were made because they are causing havoc in one-parent families, especially for the children. The situation in which one-parent families, and particularly the children, find themselves is a disgrace to the State. I wanted to refer to a number of other areas quickly, although my time is running out. The Department is effectively promoting the payment of social welfare payments through banks. That should be stopped and it should promote their payment through An Post services throughout the country. It is a vital service in rural Ireland. If the social welfare payments are removed or significantly reduced we will see hundreds of post offices close in rural Ireland.  The right of social welfare recipients to purchase local authority houses should also be looked at.

It makes amendments to the social welfare legislation, the Pensions Act and the Civil Registration Act. I will speak briefly on the Civil Registration Act and will concentrate on the amendments relating to the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005. My question for the Minister is one that he might answer on Committee Stage. What is a waiting time for the issuance of birth, marriage and death certificates by the civil registration authority? There are considerable delays and it has got worse in recent times. I am aware of people being affected by this in my constituency. These are mothers who are badly in need of the qualified child allowance and child benefit when a new child is born, and they have to wait weeks on end to have their birth certificate issued from the local office. Those delays are new, I never encountered them before but I am seeing it this year. I ask that the Minister of State investigate this matter.  Another matter that has arisen on the civil registration offices is the delays for people to get an appointment of the civil registration of their intention to marry. I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter earlier and I am sure I will receive a response shortly. I have asked for a timetable on an office-by-office basis around the country. I hear that people are choosing the office in which they register because they hear that there is a big waiting list in their own county but the next county is not so busy. We are seeing all sorts of funny things. Again, I have only encountered this issue this year. It is something I would like to have investigated.  When I get a letter from the civil registration office, it is on HSE headed paper. I know that this legislation is under the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection but it seems to be run through the HSE offices. I know the Department is responsible, but I do not know how one tallies with the other and there does not seem to be a clear line between the two. Historically, it may have been through the HSE but the Department has legal authority in this issue and it should check with the HSE that it is administering these issues on its behalf in the regional offices and investigate the delay.That is all I have to say about the Civil Registration Act side of the legislation. I will now come back to the substance of the legislation, which is designed to deter and reduce fraud in the social welfare system by providing for the publication on a quarterly basis of the names and addresses of persons convicted in a court of social welfare fraud. Nobody in the House stands over social welfare fraud. Everybody in the House must accept that people are defrauding the State, taxpayers and their neighbours of money, and this must be followed and pursued and they must pay it back. However, there is a remarkable imbalance in the legislation, and this legislation can be considered fair and reasonable only if it is balanced. It is fair enough in some respects, in so far as it goes, but I contrast this with what we have had at the Committee of Public Accounts in recent months. Allegedly, €400 million or €500 million is due to the Department because of overpayments. There are various categories of overpayments. The Government is introducing legislation to chase these down and that is fine, but there should be similar legislation in terms of following and chasing down funds due to the redundancy and insolvency fund under the remit of the Department. An exact equivalent amount of €400 million or €500 million is allegedly due to the State, based on the amounts the Department records in its accounts, which come to the Committee of Public Accounts every year. I understand the majority will not be collected because many of the companies where the State paid statutory redundancy have gone bust, been liquidated and gone out of business, and some will take time. However, some of them are back on their feet and some of the companies have had restructuring. Some of these companies are now very strong and some are very profitable, and this is money that is due to the State. The Department has no mechanism whatever to follow this money. It makes a paltry effort. We have had it at the Committee of Public Accounts. The Department does not even know the details. This matter has moved from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Employment because it was about redundancy and it was not really interested in it. That Department was more interested in giving out grants and not chasing up this issue. It has now landed at the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection and there is no interest in the Department. We asked questions at the Committee of Public Accounts and no significant information is coming through. I reiterate that the majority of what is allegedly owed needs to be forensically examined, and what is owed should be chased and what is not possible to collect we must face up to and it is only a figure on a sheet of paper. I understand 10% to 15% of the fund comes through every year by way of people making payments back to the fund. I asked at the committee meeting about the fact this fund, this debt to the Government, does not show up. In other words, the debt people have due to alleged overpayment is shown on the State balance sheet as money owed to the State, but the money owed by employers to the redundancy and insolvency fund is miraculously excluded from the balance sheet of the State because somebody takes the view that if we get something we get something and if we do not we do not, so no real effort is made to follow it. It is referred to as a contingent asset and it is not recorded on the Government balance sheet and there is no real effort. I would like to see a balance in terms of examining this and seeing how much is owed and then dealing with this. If it is not owed we should be truthful about it, but some of it is owed and no adequate information is being obtained to follow it through. I asked a simple question, that surely the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection can contact Revenue about a company and whether it is still trading and making VAT returns. It is very simple. There could not be anything more simple. Revenue is outstanding in chasing money on deposit interest retention tax and showing people with deposits in bank accounts in Ireland, England and other countries, and telling the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that people in the system claiming money actually have deposits of €30,000 or €50,000 which they have not declared. Revenue is able to give great information to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, but the Department does not seem to be able to say here is a list of companies that may owe it money and ask whether or not they are trading. If they are not trading that is fine, but the Department does not even know how to ask the question. I am just saying this legislation is not fair. It goes after the little guy who owes a small amount of money and ignores the big guy, but that is the Fine Gael way and I must be straight. That is why we have this legislation. It is the Fine Gael way to go after the little guy. The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is smiling. He can prove me wrong by including an equivalent measure in the legislation to chase employers who owe money to this fund and have not paid it. If he does this I will accept the balance and I will be happy to withdraw the comment at that stage. The legislation is a bit of a charade. It is part of Leo's trick that he will be hard on social welfare. He said when he was at the Department that he would pass legislation, and we have it coming through now. The essence of this is to issue the names on a quarterly basis of people who have been convicted in court. Every court conviction is public record anyway. They are in the local and national newspapers. The Government will publish a list of something that is in the public record. It is sham and a charade and it is shallow, but it achieves the political aim to try to frighten and in some way cast aspersions on people in receipt of social welfare payments and try to categorise them all in this way. It will not put a name in the public arena that is not already in the public arena as a result of a court hearing and court conviction, because if people are not convicted they will not be published. I believe I have made my point on what I think on this. Turning to other aspects of the Bill, section 7 is very important as it provides that decisions which deny entitlement to a benefit or payment must in all cases be made by a deciding officer. I want the Minister of State to think about this carefully. I do not believe we are on a sound legal footing here. Somebody applies for carers allowance, and the medical report states the person requires X amount of care, and the medical officer or qualified doctor states the person is entitled to it, and a deciding officer of I do not know what grade in the Department, perhaps administrative officer or assistant principal officer, with zero medical knowledge will be able to make a decision to overrule the medical evidence. This has to be re-examined. I understand there are potential court cases on this issue at present, whereby medical opinion has said one thing but the deciding officer has said another and the question is who is entitled to make a medical opinion. Most people would have thought it would be a person with a medical qualification, but the Government wants to stitch this in here, so that in all cases, and that is the reason it is here, it is ensured the medical person's view is not the view that prevails at the end of the day. If an administrative officer wants to overrule a medical opinion the legislation specifically provides a mechanism to do this and I believe it is wrong. I ask the Minister of State to revisit this. What is the Government trying to close off here? There must be some parallel mechanism whereby the medical evidence stands on its own two feet. Perhaps it must go for a higher medical opinion in the Department. The Department recently recruited a number of doctors to examine some of these cases on the disability entitlement of a person being cared for, but administrative officers should not make the decisions on people's severe medical conditions. It is that simple. I do not believe the Minister of State can stand over this provision in the Bill, bar that the Government is trying to close off what is common sense, but it is a bit of an inconvenience for the Department to allow a medical officer make a medical decision. The Government needs to re-examine this. With regard to section 8, I understand what is being said but I want to put a bit more into the public arena on this issue. It states that where an insurance company will pay up the money in a case where somebody had an injury or a disease, there is a mechanism whereby if the person has been in receipt of a payment from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection the Department can obtain the money directly from the insurance company because the State was already paying it before the case came to be settled by the insurance company. This legislation allows for the first time ever that payments to a person in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance can be added into the mix of what can be recouped from the insurance company. I have no problem with this and it makes sense, but I ask the officials to consider some of the cases I have dealt with. The other half of the equation - in several cases and I have been to an appeals officer who has overruled the decisions of the Department's deciding officers - includes cases where people have had to take the HSE to court for medical negligence. Where the State Claims Agency took the case, the person is awarded €50,000 or €100,000 as the case may be, and immediately when that money, which is as a result of the medical negligence of the State, is received people lose their social welfare entitlement because they have means. I have asked a series of parliamentary questions with regard to health, the HSE, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Minister for Finance on whether some provision can be made to calculate the amount of the lump sum to be given when it is accepted there is medical negligence such that it will not in some way reduce the person's entitlement to a social welfare payment. I had a case in this regard that I am thankful was overturned by the appeals officer, who saw sense and the foolishness of the legislation. A lady lost a child at delivery due to medical negligence and eventually, years later, got a settlement, which was paid into her bank account. She believed she received the amount in question from the State because of the State's medical negligence towards her but, lo and behold, the Revenue Commissioners informed the Department of Social Protection she had money in the bank and the latter came after her stating she had been claiming money to which she was not entitled and that she owed it €30,000. The State gave the woman €100,000 because of its medical negligence and another arm of the State came around to take €30,000 of it back. It was inhuman. They put the woman through torture several times. She lost her child and then had to go to the courts and get a settlement. Then, a couple of years later, she got a letter from the Department of Social Protection, and she had to go on her hands and knees begging and crying. It was unfair what was being done. She had the money and one arm of the State sought to take back what the other was giving because of the State's negligence. We are very quick to call money back from the supplementary welfare allowance side, which I understand, but this must be balanced against circumstances where a person is being given a payment by the State. I accept the State Claims Agency is not within the Minister of State's purview. I have confirmed by way of responses to parliamentary questions I have asked that the State Claims Agency is not allowed, by legislation, to take into account any knock-on effects that the granting of the lump sum for medical negligence by the State can have on one's entitlement to a social welfare payment. There is a lack of follow-through. This legislation is fine but it is only half the picture. If the Minister of State wants to be balanced, he has to balance up what he is doing with some acknowledgement of this issue. I had another case that was exactly the same. It involved a woman with a hand injury who got €100,000. I have encountered a couple of these cases. It is remarkable to note all the people who received money through the State Claims Agency because of medical negligence but who had money taken back by the Department of Social Protection, be it the disability allowance or whatever allowance they were then on because of the State's negligence. They are told they have money, thus affecting their payment. There is a lack of joined-up thinking. I ask the Government to stop the practice of the State giving with one hand and taking with the other. The issue of the public service card has arisen extensively in regard to this legislation. The issues raised by the Data Protection Commissioner have to be taken into consideration and fully answered. Funnily, even if I am in a minority around here, I must state the public service card is a good idea. It might not be politically popular to say that. I have a simple view: if one wants to interact with the State and wants a service from the State, the latter is entitled to have one mechanism by which one identifies oneself. People say that is a breach of this, that and the other but if there were proper data protection measures in place, it would be a correct approach to take. We all give out that, every time one goes to a different State agency, one has to have a different mechanism to prove one's means and who one is. The idea behind the card is good and my problem is that it is not going far enough. Let me state why. Some 100,000 of the 300,000 public servants work in the health service, which is the biggest arm of the State, and the HSE is now spending tens of millions of euro to introduce a new patient identification number system for patients in any hospital in the State such that if one is from Dublin and has a car crash in Cork, one's record can be found from the patient identification number. Lo and behold, that number is not the same as one's public service card number. It gets worse in the HSE. It has 1.6 million people in receipt of medical cards, using a different numbering sequence that is not connected to the patient identification number or the public service card number. Therefore, I believe there is a lack of follow-through and logic in Departments. I understand from my discussions with the various Departments that some genius will be paid millions to write a software programme to match up a patient identification number with the PPS number in some way. It is not designed for this. The medical card number, the patient identification number and the PPS number should be one and the same. I know I will get run out of this House for talking common sense but I believe that makes eminent sense, and I ask people to consider the practicalities when one is dealing with the State. It would make everybody's life easier, including the people with the medical cards or patient identification numbers. I ask that the Government consider joining up all the public sector numbers that are on cards related to different arms of the public service. I reiterate what Deputy Healy said about discrimination against women in respect of their contributory State pension. We all know of such cases. I had a case involving a lady who once did three weeks' work during summer holidays and then went to college in England and got married. When she came back, she was told she had a 40-year record on which her average would be checked. She was then told that, lo and behold, she was entitled to nothing because she did three weeks' work when she was 18 on a summer holiday. It is wrong, it is immoral, it is anti-women and anti-family. I hope that if the Department does not address this, somebody will take a case to the Supreme Court. The current arrangement will not stand a minute because it is totally discriminatory. I ask that this be dealt with. Much of this legislation is about the issue of arrears. I have encountered cases in this regard. Where someone is making an application for any new payment, the Department checks whether arrears are due. I have encountered people who worked for their lives and were told all of a sudden, on applying for the State pension, that they owed €8,000 from 12 years previously because, during a summer period, they claimed for their wives when they had part-time jobs. The applicants respond by asking why the Department did not tell them that when they were working with a salary and had the means to pay it. They tell the Department it waited until they retired and that it now wants the money taken from their pension. The administration of the arrears system by the Department of Social Protection leaves an awful lot to be desired. I will say more at the meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts because I have the chapter from the Comptroller and Auditor General's report. There are 130,000 cases of people who owe €100 or so. Remarkably, as I said on television some nights ago, there are 10,000 people who owe an average of €30,000 each, which amounts to €300,000,000. The Minister of State should get on his bike and chase the money down. If it amounts to so much in the cases in question, it should be collected where it is due. If it is not due, let us acknowledge that. In regard to all the lists the Taoiseach wants to have published, last year there were 167 convictions in court in respect of prosecutions under the Social Welfare Act. That amounts to a couple per week. We are passing legislation in this Dáil for those 167 people whose names are already in the public arena having been through the courts so that the Taoiseach can actually put their names in the paper. It is pathetic; that is all I have to say.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	370	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. It is fair to say it is a tidying-up exercise. There are many tidying-up measures in it in terms of the various areas of social welfare schemes. I welcome some of the measures, in particular the changes to be made for those in receipt of disability allowance and the blind person's pension. One issue I want to speak about is the implications of the Bill for Irish emigrants returning from England. Some people who were born here, educated here and worked here and who, through no fault of their own, were forced to emigrate to seek employment in the 1970s, 1980s or another time are now back. In some cases, they are elderly and in bad health and cannot claim a social welfare payment, or they find it extremely difficult to claim one. For this group, the bar is raised very high. The habitual residency clause is used and the affected individuals have to establish where their centre of interest is, their employment history, the length and continuity of their residence in Ireland, the continuity of their residence in another country, and their future intentions. The guidelines do state that a person who has previously been habitually resident in the State and moved to live and work in another country and then resumes his or her long-term residence in the State "may be regarded" as being habitually resident immediately on his or her return. It does not state "will be regarded". It should be changed to the latter. It seems that the affected are getting a double blow in that the habitual residency clause is being used such that they have to prove their case, which can take a considerable period. Another issue concerns the children of Irish emigrants who come here to live.I dealt with a case a number of years ago where a person returned to Ireland to care for an elderly citizen, her grandmother. She has no intention of returning to live in England, but faces significant difficulties. The person concerned is related to one of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation, which is somewhat ironic given what happened. I do not want to name which one because it will identify the person. There was nobody else to look after the woman's grandmother. She has spent a lot of time in County Offaly over the years, travelling back and forwards, and developed a special relationship and bonded with her grandmother, relatives and extended family. She was deemed not to be habitually resident in the State and faced significant problems in trying to make any headway. She was persona non grata for a number of years. I am highlighting the case because while I understand EU rules prevent discrimination on the grounds of nationality we need to have some balance. I do not want to be nativist but we need to consider those who have emigrated. One person who returned to Ireland was housed by an approved housing body, a small housing co-operative. Despite having a lease the person had difficulty establishing habitual residency. Such issues need to be considered. The rules seem to be very unfair. People have worked hard here for a period of time and, through no fault of their own, emigrated. They may return home following the loss of a relative in order to be with their extended family in the later years of their lives or may have fallen into bad health. I ask that such cases be examined. I refer to women's pension entitlements. The Minister of State was not the relevant Minister in the previous Government. I and, I am sure, the Minister of State are aware of a number of cases in our constituency offices of women who left the workforce due to childbirth. There was a marriage bar in the public sector for married women during the more Taliban period of our history which, thankfully, we have moved out of. We need to deal with the situation.  The changes made by former Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, discriminated against women and penalised them because they were forced out of work due to the marriage bar or child minding duties. In those days there were no child minders or crèches, things were difficult and families were bigger. Such situations necessitated one person being in the home, typically a woman. It was not ideal that they were forced into that. It is time that we examined the issue. There is a cost involved which is, I understand, approximately €60 million. I am open to correction, but I read such a figure in recent research. The figure may be higher. We need to move on the issue because we should bring the women affected back into the system. There is a lot of huffing and puffing and false information about single parents. There is fraud in every area, and I am not here to stand over that. Any parent who runs a house on €220 week, gets a child to school - in particular if he or she is attending secondary school and needs shoes or anything else - and is able to keep a roof over their heads is doing well. People are paying top-ups for private rental accommodation because we do not have rent controls, in particular in the constituency I represent. Those living in social housing should get medals by the time they have paid for everything.  We need to re-examine the income disregard related to returning to work in order to allow people to return to the workforce. A seven-year old child is not old enough look to look after himself or herself, regardless of what subsidies are available. There are question marks over what can be done in respect of childcare. We saw what happened in crèches following recent initiatives. Initiatives to subsidise child care are welcome. The problem is that many are being absorbed through increased costs. We need to examine how we can balance the system and get the best return for State money.  We are in favour of child care assistance and making it easier for women, in particular, to get back into the workforce. Things are very difficult for single parents. There are difficulties around the 14 or 15 weeks of the year when children are not in school. Some separated people, usually women, have two or three children and are trying to manage those situations.  The cut-off threshold needs to be examined. I am not trying to pick on the former Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, but it was during her term of office that the age was reduced to seven. As a parent and grandparent, I would not like seven-year olds to be left with just anybody or to wander the streets all day if I was going to work. We need to try to provide some extra support to lone parents. We also need to stop the trail of misinformation. People have come to my office about different issues and have referred to lone parents. There is no doubt that there is fraud in every system. When I point out to them that parents are running households on €221 a week they are gob smacked and cannot believe it. They think I am not telling them the truth and I have to show them the rate book in order for them to understand the payments. They should get more. Let us make it easier for people to get back to work and try to give them child care support to enable them to do so. The age limit is too low. I have seen the effects in my neighbourhood, where women are trying to juggle and hope they can work through the summer until the children are ready to return to school.

There are changes in it which reflect the fact that our social welfare system is quite complex. Whenever changes are made there can be unforeseen circumstances and not all of the intended changes can be captured in the legislation. Some of the Bill is a tidying-up exercise because legislation has given rise to the need to delete a duplication. In other cases, two or three different Acts need to be dealt with. I understand the civil registration aspect of the Bill deals with one of the changes where there is a mention of an ard cláraitheoir. My colleague mentioned one of the unforeseen consequences. In 2011 we debated the increase in the number of contributions required to qualify for the contributory State pension from 260 to 520 and the change to whole-of-work-life measures.We are changing the nature of pension provision in the Bill. The problem is that there is no mention of it because we never discussed it. The reason we did not discuss it is because it was quite traditional at the time for the social welfare Bill to be rushed through or guillotined so we never reached it. We never reached it on Second, Committee or Report Stages so there was no discussion and teasing out of the implications of some of the changes. I welcome that for the past number of years, at the very least, there has been no attempt to guillotine Bills and we can properly tease out their effects. I recollect that I mentioned that I have a problem with this; I do not know what is. That might sound silly in some ways but because of the complexities of our pension system and our social welfare system, my gut instinct was this was going to affect a certain cohort if it was introduced as quickly as it was because it came into effect a year later. All of us with constituency offices can see women in particular turning up and asking what happened because they do not have a full contributory pension. Yes, they can apply for the non-contributory pension but it has affected them and I would appeal to those looking at this to make a greater effort to inform people in advance. I know some people in the pensions section have made an effort to inform people in advance that they are short but there are a lot of people who will not be informed early enough to allow them to make up the difference to reach the 520 contributions. In one person's case, thankfully, she was informed early enough and had three months in which to make up three contributions. It does not sound like much. She had 517 contributions and was told seven years previously that she had enough contributions at 260. As far as I remember, she had 500 credits - whatever use they were to her because they were useless in terms of contributions. She managed to get an employer to take her on for three weeks at the age of 65 or 66, managed to make up the amount and was assessed based on lifetime contributions. The second part - the lifetime contributions - was interesting because she had taken a number of periods off for childbirth and to look after her children and that affected the full amount. I will not tease out all that but I congratulate those in the pensions section who have the foresight to look at people's pensions in advance and inform them. There is no system, as there was years ago, where someone could buy the contributions. Perhaps that could be looked at again and a cost put on it. Perhaps it is too costly or complicated but perhaps it could be looked at, particularly in cases where people are falling short by ten or 20 contributions in terms of qualifying for payments they made, because at the end of the day, some of these people worked for 30 years but it might have been a case of ten weeks here and ten weeks there. It takes 24 weeks to qualify.  Section 19 records the country of birth and citizenship when somebody dies. It might be worth recording citizenships because some people go through a number of citizenships. The explanatory memorandum mentions that this might be used in the future. I know people who are Pakistani or German and who then became Irish citizens. There are people who have moved around. It is a simple change that could be looked at.  The guardian's payment is a very good step but I have a problem with the fact that it still mentions orphans. The reason why it is called a guardian's payment is because of a campaign by myself and others to stop it being called an orphan's allowance. It talks about giving a payment to an orphan but in many cases, the people concerned are not orphans. They are the children of people who are not in a fit state to look after them so to all intents and purposes, they are abandoned but the Government is not going to use the term "abandoned children". It is about language. It was not accepted that this was the reason for the change.  The issue of welfare cheats is one of the key issues. As my party's spokesperson on social welfare for a number of years, I argued for more social welfare inspectors and still do. There is no reason for the change here. If someone is convicted of welfare fraud in a court of law, every single newspaper up and down the country will publish their name. The tabloids will broadcast it to the world so it is superfluous. If one wants a register, that is fine but one needs to be very careful going down this road because an appeal takes place later on. A person can be convicted today but they will have a number of months in which to put in an appeal. If we put that person's name on a register, we are condemning them. I give the example of a woman who came to me in absolute distress. The Department was looking for €20,000 from her for overpayments for 13 years. She asked me whether I still had a document she gave me 13 years ago. The data protection people here told me I should not have it and that it was in breach of data protection regulations. I had the document, which was from the Department and which stated that former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, had sent this letter, which was attached to it and said to sort this out and pay this woman the money and recognised the conditions and whatever else. This was the proof she needed to show that she did nothing untoward when the Department told her she had pulled the wool over its eyes and had never mentioned it. It was there in black and white 13 years later. We should be careful. I heard Deputy Michael Healy-Rae talk about overpayments earlier. We are going back years. If I overpaid the tax man, I would only be allowed to go back four years. Beyond that, the tax man can keep it whereas it is different when the State makes an overpayment even when it is the State's fault. In many cases we talk about, and we have had this argument before, it happens because of bureaucratic mistakes. Sometimes it happens because the person did not provide the documentation on time and sometimes it is fraud. If it is fraud, we should prosecute and recover it. I have no problem with that but we should be very careful when it comes to going down the road of the State becoming another court of law. There is enough bad material appearing in newspapers that leads to these people being sued. We do not want to contribute to that by publishing names ahead of schedule. If they are guilty of fraud, so be it. As I said, the newspapers will condemn them.  In respect of the other changes, there are issues around defined benefit schemes and the fact that companies continue to move towards defined contribution schemes. Any protections for defined benefit schemes should be introduced along with anything to prevent companies from moving to the lesser defined contribution option. We should not help anybody to move towards closing those schemes, which have stood the test of time, when it is only for the benefit of companies rather than workers.

I am taking ten minutes, Deputy Broughan is taking five and Deputy Wallace is taking five. I begin by acknowledging, applauding and thanking those individuals, families, organisations, communities and activists who continue to work for animal welfare and to expose the cruelty and neglect that goes on with animals in this country. There are positive measures in the Animal Health and Welfare Act but we would not be having this debate tonight if it was working and all its measures were being implemented. If we look at the facts, the national animal cruelty helpline recorded over 53,000 calls in its first three years with more than 16,500 in the past year, including a range of animal issues from neglect to health issues such as chronic skin conditions, inflammation, untreated illnesses such as cancer, living in appalling conditions with no access to food or water and being found in emaciated conditions. These cases are coming from many counties. The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, cares for all animals, including companion, wild and farm animals, and animals used in entertainment, sport and research. It has eight uniformed inspectors to cover 17 counties. How serious are we about animal welfare with only eight inspectors? Eight cannot even cover what is in the legislation. I believe we are paying lip service to animal welfare. However, those inspectors initiated over 70 prosecutions with 30 finalised in court but even though the Animal Health and Welfare Act allows for significant fines and imprisonment, the penalties imposed by the court are all at the lower level of the range and are consequently derisory. That speaks for itself. To look at particular examples, in a Topical Issue debate last year, I highlighted the matter of the abuse in puppy farms and gave the details about how it was in breach of the existing Dog Breeding Establishments Act. There were no upper limits. Inspections were by appointment with several weeks' notice. When improvement notices were given, the premises were invited to comply. A puppy farm passed by the local authority had multiples of the permitted number of dogs which were living in absolute squalor. County managers are being compelled into initiating enforcement procedures. We do not see any urgency in ensuring improvements are carried out and, in the meantime, the animals continue to live in appalling conditions. A vet in a certain county inspected an unregistered dog breeding establishment, found the dogs in unacceptable conditions and they were seized. He recommended that the owner be prosecuted, which happened, and he was convicted. While that case was pending, the same owner applied for a dog breeding licence and got it because the same vet granted the licence. He could have waited for the outcome. In another example, an improvement notice was given to a facility. Enforcement was not followed up and the facility took two years to comply, and animals continued to live in appalling conditions. I also highlighted the puppy farm in County Cavan which was the subject of a documentary which showed appalling abuse and because the ISPCA was critical of Cavan County Council, officials there and in Leitrim asked that the ISPCA refrain from directly criticising them. The ISPCA was working to ensure that councils were enforcing the Dog Breeding Establishments Act and applying existing guidelines. Another council had licensed a breeder for 300 dogs despite the fact the breeder did not have appropriate facilities or planning permission. Surely the local authorities, Department, vets and the Veterinary Council of Ireland should be on the same page as the ISPCA when it comes to animal welfare. The reply of the Minister of State, Deputy English, that night was, "that the scope of the existing guidelines needs to be enhanced as they are quite benign and represent a minimal standard that is probably no longer acceptable, particularly in view of recent issues that have arisen regarding some of the establishments", so a review of guidelines for dog breeding establishments would begin. In reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Clare Daly and me last June, the Minister of State, Deputy English, said that the public consultation process closed on 1 February 2017 and that he expected the findings in June 2017 and that they would be considered without delay. This is October. Where are those findings? I hope that when the guidelines come out, the next issue will be completely covered, which is the disposal of dog waste. There are at least 73 registered puppy farms, so at least 30,000 dogs being produced yearly. That is a lot of dog waste. Dog waste is linked with a number of diseases and is a serious threat to the environment, to health and to livestock if it is not properly disposed of. The Food Safety Authority has various rules and guidelines about untreated organic material, agricultural farms and agricultural land but it needs to consider dog breeding establishments too. A very detailed submission on this has been placed with An Bord Pleanála on a particular planning application for a particular puppy farm which had already been permitted by the local authority so the local authority is obviously not paying much attention to the health issues of dog waste and EU directives on the matter. There is a total contradiction with hares in that the hare is protected under the Wildlife Act but the Act also allows hare coursing which we know is terrorising one animal with another. It is unnecessary cruelty, from the netting process, the transportation of hares, handling of hares, keeping them herded and the practice of blooding. Then we have coursing trials which are not monitored by the National Parks and Wildlife Service, though it attended a recent coursing trial and found that the coursing club planned to hold between 130 and 150 trials using 64 hares. The hares are only supposed to be coursed once a day and are then released, so the maths do not add up. I would prefer to see an end to live hare coursing because there is an alternative, but in the meanwhile there is a need for coursing trials to be monitored. The National Parks and Wildlife Service should be informed of the location, dates and times and if it does not have enough personnel to monitor trials, they should be banned. We believe there is a strong lobby pressing the Minister to drop the condition that a hare would only be coursed once a day. Condition 20 of the licence to net hares is not being complied with, namely, that each surviving hare is earmarked with a non-toxic dye because we are reliably informed that a certain hare trapper goes to the release site to capture hares that have just been released and then goes around selling these hares to coursing clubs. Another hare trapper keeps a supply of hares at his establishment to sell on to coursing clubs which might be short of hares. Another contradiction is that greyhound owners, including those opposed to coursing, have to register with the Irish Coursing Club if they want their greyhounds to take part in track racing. The Irish Coursing Club is over 90% financed by registration fees but the majority of greyhounds do not take part in coursing and the greyhound industry and greyhound welfare could use some of that funding. Greyhounds can live for up to 14 years, yet the lifespan for Irish greyhounds is three to four years. Thousands are put to sleep yearly including at race tracks where injuries are sometimes not treated. We have cases of greyhounds being dumped with their ears burned to remove markings which could identify the owner. There is the recently highlighted case of doping and a bizarre explanation from a trainer-owner of how cocaine could be found in a dog. I could provide a list of prohibited substances that have been found in random sampling of greyhounds in the past two years and a list of trainers of those dogs who have continued training. More out of competition testing is needed, as is full publication of the test and, if a class A positive is found, the Irish Greyhound Board should inform the Garda and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine since it is a State-funded industry. Over the last year, campaign groups, individuals and the media have highlighted the fate of Irish greyhounds being exported to countries with poor or no animal welfare standards. Our greyhounds adapt well as family pets but when they are of no use here they are exported to horrific circumstances and cruel deaths to be used in the dog meat trade, as live bait in fights between wild animals in so-called zoos in places such as China, Pakistan, India and South America. They are also being exported through European countries and the US. If we are serious about animal welfare, we have to ban the export of all greyhounds to any country other than the UK with the exception of rescued greyhounds from established, reputable centres in Ireland going to reputable adoption groups abroad. We need more accurate and up-to-date traceability of all Irish-born greyhounds from birth to death. The general live exports of farm animals involve long journeys, overcrowded conditions, deprivation of food and water, inadequate ventilation and rough handling. They are going to countries with immensely cruel slaughter practices. Evidence is available for all of this. We know that fox hunting continues. I accepted a petition this morning from a gentleman who had collected more than 10,000 signatures of people opposed to fox hunting. Whatever chance a fox might have in a hunt, it has no chance whatsoever in the cruel, barbaric practice of the digging out of foxes. Fur farming continues, albeit on a much smaller scale now but it is estimated that over 200,000 mink are killed in the remaining three fur farms in Ireland. I am glad that we have an amendment here on animals in circuses, which I will also support because we know that there are animals in circuses which are completely unsuitable for those animals.We are still waiting on the roll-out of the vaccine which would eliminate the very cruel way badgers are treated. At the recent Ballinasloe Horse Fair, despite reduced numbers of attendees and animals there, the ISPCA was as busy as ever. Three ponies, three donkeys and ten dogs were removed. It goes on and on. The legislation is worthless unless it is implemented and it is not being implemented. I do not know whether that is through indifference, ignorance or disinterest, allied with a lack of the adequate resources and personnel to ensure implementation.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	379	I am delighted to have a brief opportunity to speak on this important motion brought forward by my colleagues, Deputies O'Sullivan and Daly, and the other members of the Independents 4 Change technical group. I commend my colleagues on this motion. While there has been some tiny progress on animal welfare since the 2013 Act, there are still increasing reports of animal cruelty, loopholes in regulation and insufficient monitoring and enforcement across the spectrum of animal care. As Deputy O'Sullivan stated, the Minister told the House this time last year that there had only been 13 successful prosecutions under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 in one year and that there were 38 prosecution files being processed at that time. These numbers seem incredibly low, given the many millions of animals reared each year. At present, there are 12 million domestic farm animals in the Republic alone. On 21 March this year, I introduced the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill 2017. A few hours ago, I asked the Minister whether he could incorporate this Bill into the Bill on the greyhound sector and I found his reply a little disappointing. All we were seeking to do in the Bill was to control the export of greyhounds, to provide for publication of the white list to which the export of greyhounds under licence would be permissible, and to make it an offence to export a greyhound to a country that is not included in the white list. Over recent years, the welfare of the dogs being exported, and racing and retired greyhounds has become a major campaign issue. Irish greyhounds were exported to Macau, China, to race in the famous Yat Yeun Canidrome. The public is very upset at reports of this and that dogs are raced to death and then end up somewhere in the food chain. The response from the Government and the greyhound board regarding the export of Irish dogs to countries with appalling or no animal welfare standards has so far been useless. While the white list that we proposed in the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill 2017 cannot provide for the selling on from other jurisdictions, it would give Ireland the opportunity to be a leader in this area. I listened carefully to campaigners who want the export of greyhounds beyond these islands stopped completely. I also welcome contacts with Ms Nessa Childers MEP to discuss the work of the European Parliament animal welfare intergroup this autumn and the possibility that the European Parliament can establish standards across the current 28 European Union member states. The Greyhound Rescue Association claims that there are approximately 38 greyhounds being put down monthly and traceability issues also remain because greyhounds are not microchipped from birth. The Greyhound Rescue Association claims that up to 10,000 of our wonderful Irish greyhounds could be unaccounted for each year. Earlier in the year, as I mentioned this afternoon, broadcaster Sharon Ní Bheoláin and "Prime Time" aired the famous programme "Gone to the Dogs", which put the spotlight on doping and the poor regulation generally in the greyhound sector in Ireland. The Minister stated earlier that this is an area about which he has concerns. Perhaps the Minister of State might respond comprehensively on that in his response. Animal welfare extends not only to our greyhounds but to all our animals. In keeping with the theme of racing animals for profit, I echo the comments of Deputy O'Sullivan in regard to coursing hares. Just last week, I asked the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to report on the monitoring of coursing trials around the country, whether breaches of trial rules had taken place in the last number of years and what the repercussions are for breach of the coursing clubs' trials rule. The Minister stated that hare course meetings are monitored as resources allow by conservation rangers of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of her Department. The Minister went on to state that due to a lack of resources, no monitoring whatsoever took place in 2015-16. My colleague also mentioned the abuse of a range of other beautiful animals, such as the mink. Perhaps we need to look into the future and change the structure of agriculture, which has developed into an industrial system. When I was a child, we reared pigs, cattle and sheep on a different, much more sustainable system. This incredible industrial process, which currently produces 33% of our carbon emissions and involves the transporting of live animals with considerable cruelty to those animals, is something that we have to start moving away from. We have a wonderful land. We have the resources to practice a much more sustainable type of agriculture as well. I think we should move towards that.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	380	I welcome Deputy O'Sullivan's Bill. The Deputy is not asking too much. What it amounts to is Deputy O'Sullivan thinks it is wrong that we tolerate cruelty to animals. The truth is that the vast majority of Irish people do not agree with any kind of cruelty to animals but we are probably not doing enough to address it where it does happen. The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which came into force in 2014, marked a significant step forward in animal welfare in Ireland. The then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, was certainly praised for his efforts, his openness to amendment, and general patience. A lot of work went into it. At the time, the Minister was criticised for the failure to deal with animal cruelty around hare coursing, digging out foxes, the use of traps, badger culling and fur farms, which Deputy O'Sullivan has already highlighted. The legislation empowered authorised officers to enter property, examine animals, and even to seize animals or other evidence when appropriate. It enabled authorised officers to deal with issues far more effectively than previously. However, significant problems still exist with the enforcement of the legislation. As Deputy O'Sullivan stated at the time, the proof of the pudding will be in the implementation of codes of practice and the resources provided. We need to see enforcement of the animal welfare laws. If necessary, if this is what it takes, there will have to be more severe punishment from the courts for those convicted of cruelty to animals. Lack of enforcement is a problem. The ISPCA argued that penalties imposed have not been particularly high and do not serve as a deterrent, and that generally speaking, penalties imposed have been at the lower end of the scale. Enforcement of many aspects of the legislation is dependent on ISPCA inspectors. They have a team of eight uniformed inspectors, who currently cover 17 counties - half of the country is not covered. In 2016, following a submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the committee recommended that given the ISPCA's service agreement with the Minister, the society should be given more funding to allow recruitment of enough inspectors to cover the whole of the country. This has not yet to happen. Similarly, the National Parks and Wildlife Service rangers go to hare coursing events and report on them, but as Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out, there is no monitoring of coursing trials which are organised prior to official hare coursing events to test the performance of the greyhounds and there are live hares used at these events. Animal welfare sanctuary volunteers and managers repeatedly state the legislation has simply not been acted upon. As to the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, the ISPCA has stated that there is a lack of enforcement, guidelines are not being met and there is widespread non-compliance. Animal shelters throughout the country are overworked and underfunded, and are exasperated with the Government's failure to deal with mandatory microchipping. Deputy O'Sullivan also referred to greyhounds, an issue we have raised here over recent years, especially on the abuse of drugs. Sadly, it is the bigger players that are involved in it. There have been some improvements made but a lot more work still has to be done for us to clean up the sector. I do not have a lot of time. I will touch on a protest last week against the export of live cattle. I managed a bit of notoriety among the farming sector for even attending it.Most people actually acknowledge that the travel time on the ships is too long and that it is not natural. We are sending cattle outside of the EU where EU rules, in terms how the cattle are dealt with or killed, do not apply. Is the Government doing anything about this? Surely, even from an economic point of view, we should be processing more animals at home and should stop the export of live cattle. That said, I do understand part of the problem. I know that a lot of the cattle that go abroad come from the dairy herd. Dairy farmers are using Holstein bulls to try to produce heifers for dairy and they end up with a whole lot of bulls that are not attractive to the meat industry here. Has consideration been given, as an alternative, to targeting cows that will produce Holstein heifers for milk through artificial insemination and using the likes of Red Aberdeen Angus bulls with the rest of the herd so that we would actually have a good beef product at the other side? Obviously, there would be a little bit of work involved in that but it is something the Government should consider.

First, I wish to emphasise the Government's commitment to animal welfare and to reiterate that this Government does not tolerate any instance of animal cruelty. There is no doubt that there is greater engagement than ever by the public at large with issues relating to animal welfare. This public interest has been given concrete expression in the Animal Health and Welfare Act which was adopted by the Oireachtas following extensive and positive debate. The Act provides a modern and robust framework for dealing with issues relating to animal welfare. I want to focus tonight on the significant progress that has been made in recent years in the area of the welfare of animals. In particular, I am very glad that the Private Member's motion acknowledges the progress that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 has brought about. That Act updated and replaced approximately 40 items of primary legislation in the area of animal welfare and health back over 100 years. The Act changed the basis upon which animal owners must treat their animals. It enshrined the principles of the five freedoms for animals, namely freedom: from hunger and thirst, from discomfort; from pain, injury and disease; to exhibit natural behaviour; and from fear and distress. These requirements are a fundamental shift in the way that this issue is dealt with under the Irish legal system. The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 is designed to allow intervention in a much wider range of cases than previously possible. As a result, minor cases can be tackled before they escalate and the Act is a vehicle to encourage and educate animal keepers. In the past, the Protection of Animals Act 1911 was the only recourse available and could only be used where significant suffering had occurred. This new approach means that we will be tackling problems while they are relatively minor, making the risk of escalation much lower. Enforcement is a complex issue and one which needs to be examined in detail. This is another progressive aspect of the Act, in that it does not just focus on prosecution, which is only appropriate in cases where there have been serious welfare issues that can be clearly demonstrated to the courts. The new enforcement approach reflects the need to intervene as early as possible in animal welfare situations. The Act provides for animal health and welfare notices to be issued by authorised officers. This means that minor situations can be addressed at an early stage and that encouragement, guidance and best practice are introduced rather than just punishment. In terms of actual prosecutions, 35 cases have been successfully prosecuted in recent years, with a further 26 in various stages of preparation with a view to prosecution. Furthermore, the Act contains provisions that where an individual is convicted of serious animal welfare offences the courts may ban them from keeping animals, or indeed restrict the numbers of animal they may keep. In some cases, welfare issues are due less to innate cruelty than to the animal owners' capacity to care for their animals being overwhelmed. This provision therefore allows for cases where an individual’s mental well-being is best protected by allowing them to continue to keep a few animals. The provisions of the Act are enforced by authorised officers of my Department, An Garda Síochána, Customs and Excise, the ISPCA and the DSPCA. This co-operation with other organisations has been a major departure under the Act and the arrangement has been working well. Individual officers of the Turf Club and Bord na gCon have also been authorised under the Act. I would like to express my thanks to these bodies for their valuable contribution to animal welfare. The Animal Health and Welfare Act has been very well received both upon enactment and as it has been rolled out and implemented. All of the major animal welfare NGOs and stakeholders have seen it as a major progressive improvement in the area. In addition, the Act sets out clear legally enforceable parameters relating to activities such as hunting and coursing which must occur in a lawful fashion that avoids wilful or unnecessary cruelty. The actions taken by my Department to protect animal welfare go beyond legislation, however, notwithstanding how progressive and flexible that legislation may be. The Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council, for example, is a multi-stakeholder group that meets on a national and regional basis and includes representatives of farmers, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and animal welfare organisations. This advisory council has been very successful, in the context of its regional forum, in acting as an early warning system. Similarly, where natural and weather events have led to problems in certain locations, my Department has acted quickly and effectively to bring emergency supplies of feed to particular premises where feed has been an issue. Since 2011, over €11 million has been provided in ex gratia payments, reaching approximately 140 animal welfare organisations throughout the country annually. Monitoring of animal welfare has been raised in this debate. Such monitoring occurs on a number of levels and forums. On the farm side, cross-compliance inspections by my Department flag up welfare issues and departmental veterinary staff carry out regular inspections. In the context of monitoring, the increased awareness of animal welfare means that the issue is something that can be raised whenever it occurs and this has been facilitated, in particular, by the animal welfare help line my Department has had in place for some years now. This help line, at lo-call 0761 064408, along with a dedicated email address, AnimalWelfare@agricufture.gov.ie, facilitates the reporting by members of the public of any suspicion of poor animal welfare or animal cruelty taking place whether within the realm of a farming situation, a sporting or recreational activity or indeed, in a public place or urban setting. All calls received are treated in confidence and are followed up by authorised officers. Similarly, a variety of people are involved with animals, all of whom are aware of welfare issues and who can flag them up, as and when they arise. Officers of my Department, officers of the ISPCA and the DSPCA, local authority vets, dog wardens in dog pounds, members of the public and animal welfare NGOs all play a role. I will be bringing forward a new greyhound industry Bill in the autumn which addresses the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions and improves integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector. The draft general scheme of the Bill has already progressed through the pre-legislative scrutiny phase and a memorandum will go to Government in the coming weeks requesting approval to publish the updated general scheme and to submit it to the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. There is a great deal of agreement on this issue. Animal welfare is an important issue. There have been huge improvements in the legislative and non-legislative regime that have brought about a change in attitudes in this country. The few individuals who do neglect and abuse animals find themselves more likely to be punished than ever before, which is as it should be. Equally, education, understanding and awareness continue to improve and raise standards of animal welfare in this country. In view of the many positive developments taking place in the area of animal welfare, I commend the Government's amendment to the House.

We are putting forward an amendment, however, which reads:To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:“ recognises:— the robust regulatory framework in place under the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which ensures the highest standards in animal welfare are maintained and a strict sanctioning regime for offenders;— how the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 gives authorised officer status to employees of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the Turf Club to carry out welfare related duties;— that the European Communities (Animal Transport and Control Post) Regulations 2006 established a vehicle inspections system nationwide on all forms of animal transport to ensure the protection of animals in transit, strict standards for animal handling, hygiene arrangements, feeding and rest periods;— that detailed inspections are obligatory before approval is granted to ships transporting animals, with current Irish regulations relating to the approval of livestock transport ships set at a higher level than what applies in many other European Union countries;— how all live animals being traded from the State must have a veterinary health certificate from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine confirming disease free status and notifying each animal movement via the European Commission’s Trade Control and Expert System;— the significant co-operation between Ireland and Northern Ireland in animal health and welfare with the highly important All Island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy being delivered in both jurisdictions as agreed by the North South Ministerial Council;— that cruelty to animals is unacceptable and should not be tolerated; and— the substantial work of individuals, families, animal welfare groups and activists in highlighting animal welfare issues; andcalls:— on the Government and relevant authorities to ensure that the current animal welfare protection regulations are robustly enforced and that any offences which occur are promptly investigated and the full sanctioning powers applied;— for adequate animal welfare funding by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to organisations who directly deliver animal care and welfare services; and— on the Government to ensure that the All Island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy is protected in upcoming Brexit negotiations to guarantee the continued operation of a unified animal health and welfare approach on this island.”This amendment deals with the most important thing that needs to happen, which is enforcement and ensuring that standards for the welfare of animals are prioritised at Government level. Resources need to be in place to ensure the regulatory system works, there are no instances of animal cruelty and that welfare is paramount. The motion outlines the progress that has been made since the introduction of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and states that public policy needs to be directed towards ensuring all possible measures are taken to protect the welfare of animals. The motion also calls for the introduction of a comprehensive system for monitoring the conditions in which animals are kept, and seeks robust regulations to protect animals from abuse, cruel treatment, neglect and poor living conditions. Our key point is that a very strong and robust regulatory framework is in place as a result of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which ensures high standards in animal welfare and that strict sanctioning is in place for offenders. It is important that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 gives authorised officer status to employees of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, the Dublin Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, and the Turf Club, to carry out welfare related duties. The motion also calls for funding to be put in place to back all this up in order that we can see real progress in the monitoring of animal welfare and ensure there is no place for cruelty. Where there are instances of cruelty we, as a State, need to be equipped to respond to it properly, to root it out and to bring the power of the law to bear on those who abuse it. My party was involved in the first draft of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 and, in previous Governments, Fianna Fáil introduced the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill 2010 and the Dog Breeding Establishments Act 2010, but since the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 was introduced, 34 successful prosecutions have been taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I understand an additional 26 are ongoing, with further prosecutions being taken at regional level by the Garda Síochána. There are inadequacies in the back-up and support available to ensure these measures are fully implemented. Everybody in this House and the vast majority across the board have great care and respect for animals. Animals play a very significant part in the lives of those who keep them as pets. I am my party's agriculture spokesperson and I engage with the farming community. I see at first hand the care and respect the farming community has for animals. It is crucial we have robust structures in place to ensure reports on those who do not respect animals or who oversee or inflict cruelty on them are acted on immediately. There need to be proper resources in order that the officers who oversee the legislation have a strong awareness of instances of abuse and can act immediately. We need an increase in spending from the Department to resource the agencies which enforce this legislation. It is not enough to have a dozen officers covering most of the country. The local authorities and veterinary sections are under significant pressure, and the Department needs to address this and ramp up its support. Before the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, there was a disparate set of regulations and laws around this area and it was important that it was all brought together in legislation which was clear and could be properly enforced. The introduction of fines was welcome and is proving to help streamline the system. The Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 introduced a standard maximum fine of €5,000 and, on major indictment, fines ranging from €100,000 to €250,000. They were welcome introductions to the oversight system. The Bill also ensured animal health and cruelty issues were brought together when, previously, they had been separate issues.

The welfare of animals is paramount for everybody involved in the agricultural sector. I am a farmer and farmers pride themselves on the way their animals are cared for. The standards in which animals are kept in this country are extremely high, though there are always a few exceptions. The majority of our dairy and beef farmers are in quality assurance schemes at the moment which have strict welfare regulations embroidered into them. Those regulations have to be adhered to if farmers are to have access to the market. In the dairy sector, 100% of farmers are in quality assurance and the percentage in the beef sector is also extremely high. In the bovine sector there is sometimes cruelty to animals but I was on the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council at its inception and we set up a liaison group with the ISPCA in order that the farming organisations could monitor these cases. Invariably, they were caused by psychiatric or mental issues with the herdowner. Whether a combination of bad weather or financial circumstances caused their mental stress, things got on top of them and they were not able to cater properly for their animals. Thankfully, there is now a structure in place which can deal with that. The stock on such farms can be greatly reduced and when he consistently fails to adhere to proper welfare standards, a herdowner can be prohibited from keeping animals on his holding. This ensures that, in the minority of cases where animals are held in poor conditions, the situation is rectified. There has been a lot of focus on live exports and our shipping regulations.Strange bedfellows come together at times. Commercial interests here have tried to put barriers in the way of life exports for a number of years. I compliment the Minister, since taking up office, on opening up extra markets for live exports, which is essential for the economic viability of our beef sector.  The regulatory standards under which our animals are exported are at the highest possible level. They are even above what the EU requires. The welfare of animals transported in ships is second to none. I note a parliamentary question was tabled today in which the level of mortality on those shipments is questioned. I can assure that Deputy that the economic margin for those exporters is tight. If for no other reason than economics, they will ensure the animals arrive at their destination in very good condition. To have people question the way our live exports operate is just not on. We find it frustrating at times to get ships registered for exporting our animals. It is a very slow process and probably rightly so. When those ships are passed for the transport of cattle for export, the standards at which they operate are second to none.  The greyhound Bill was mentioned by a number of speakers. It has gone through the Oireachtas joint committee and has gone to drafting stage. It will tighten up the regulations in the greyhound industry and restore confidence that the regulations that are in place will be properly adhered to. The stricter guidelines that will be put in place will ensure that there will be public confidence in the greyhound industry.  The export of greyhounds was also mentioned and it was stated that their export should be banned to certain countries around the world. Our greyhounds should be exported to countries where welfare standards are correct. That should be taken as a given. People should not make a statement to the effect that the United Kingdom is the only destination that is fit for the export of our greyhounds. That is not correct. Other countries have very stringent welfare regulations with respect to greyhounds. That can be monitored and regulated. The export of greyhounds is commercially essential to the existence of our greyhound industry. There has been a constant attack on hare coursing. People should recognise that were it not for the habitats that are regulated by the coursing clubs, the hare population in rural Ireland would be under serious threat. Coursing clubs put a great deal of effort into ensuring that a habitat exists for hares. All hare coursing is strictly monitored. People should recognise the role the custodians of the rural countryside play in protecting the hare.  While we welcome the thrust of the motion, as Deputy McConalogue stated, we have tabled an amendment to it. We hope the Government will put more resources in place because the welfare of animals is in all our interests.

I thank Deputies McConalogue and Cahill for sharing their time and giving me this opportunity to speak on it. I am not as well briefed as my two spokespersons on agriculture and I am coming at this issue under a completely different guise, as a person who loves animals. My family and I love animals. I see the wonderful work the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, does in supporting the various Departments and in working with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We had the Ballinasloe Horse Fair this week, to which Deputy O'Sullivan alluded. That fair gives a fantastic economic boost to the town and the surrounding areas, which is very welcome. However, it is very disturbing when one goes on to Facebook or Twitter and sees disturbed puppies or young dogs that are caged in and being kept in overcrowded conditions. The Minister of State spoke about the principle of the five freedoms for animals, namely, freedom from hunger and thirst, freedom from discomfort, freedom from pain and injury, freedom to exhibit natural behaviours and the freedom from fear and distress. That was not the experience of some animals this weekend, although that possibly happens in many places throughout the country. We have a large gathering in the Gallery tonight because a large proportion of our people believe in and live by those principles, just as do the Minister of State and I. It is quite disturbing to see animals in such conditions when one brings one's family to fairs or various events. That is not what we believe in. That is not what we have amended the legislation for and it is not what it is about.  Deputy Wallace spoke about not having enough inspectors or enforcements. We need to see more of that. The ISPCA is seeking that. It wants to help out more and to be more involved. It is the eyes and the ears looking out for the welfare of small animals, for the wee puppies being presented and for the aforementioned old greyhounds and the lurchers.  Deputy Cahill hit the nail on the head. He spoke eloquently about the farmers who work very hard to protect and mind their animals but a segment of society wants to make money out of breeding dogs and their subsequent portrayal in cages is not the way people want to see animals.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to free up resources to support the ISPCA, to allocate it more money and to ensure that the people who have the powers can ensure adherence to the regulations. Reference was made to there having been 35 convictions but we are talking in large-scale terms. Deputy O'Sullivan spoke about puppy farms. There is also the cruelty that takes place at fairs or in the trading of animals where one sees animals caged in the back of jeeps or trailers. People do not like that and do not want that. That practice has to end. We call on the Minister and the Minister of State to address that.  I support our amendment moved by Deputy McConalogue which calls "on the Government and relevant authorities to ensure that the current animal welfare protection regulations are robustly enforced and that any offences which occur are promptly investigated and the full sanctioning powers applied". We also call "for adequate animal welfare funding by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to organisations who directly deliver animal care and welfare services". I will mention the Heathlawn animal sanctuary in my area. We also call "on the Government to ensure that the All Island Animal Health and Welfare Strategy is protected in upcoming Brexit negotiations to guarantee the continued operation of a unified animal health and welfare approach on this island". I do not want to repeat myself. I support our amendment to the motion. We have the legislation in place and what is needed is its enforcement at this stage.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	385	I welcome the motion introduced by Deputy O'Sullivan. As outlined by a number of speakers, this motion is about the need to look after the animals both as pets and domestic animals in the farmyards across the country. Much of what is in the motion acknowledges there is legislation in place to deal with this but that it is not being given enough emphasis or resources. Nobody would argue with that. The fact that so few ISPCA inspectors are doing this kind of work is evidence that more resources need to be put into it. Many local authorities have vets that do some of this work. The experience most of us would have is that it varies in different counties according to the level of interest taken in it and the level of emphasis put on it. That could be examined to see how much more that could be strengthened. The Fianna Fáil amendment to the motion contains a great deal of what is in the motion using perhaps some softer language. I do not understand where it is going but I accept that is fine. The Fine Gael amendment to the motion pretty much says that everything is very good but in fairness to Deputy O'Sullivan and her colleagues who put forward this motion, their view and that of the vast majority of our people is that things are not perfect, that there are issues and that they need to be dealt with.The third amendment, which was tabled by Solidarity-People Before Profit, includes a reference to travelling animals in circuses. We support this amendment. It is clear that whatever argument there was 100 years ago for bringing exotic animals around for interested people to see is long gone, and it probably never existed. However, nowadays there is every opportunity for people to see these animals in a more natural habitat, in a zoo or on their television screens rather than having to see them in cages in circuses. We will, therefore, support that amendment. On cattle and farm cruelty, living in County Leitrim, which is predominantly an agricultural area, my experience was that over many years there were instances of cruelty in farmyards where a person may have had too much stock on the land and was not able to keep the animals. In fairness, it sometimes involved elderly farmers who kept the stock and did not sell their cattle and, as others said, they could have had mental health issues. In many cases, however, it was down to not having the correct set-up. In recent years, there have been many improvements in the housing of cattle, which have helped things greatly. I do not think, therefore, that it is as big an issue as it was in the past. That said, it still needs to be dealt with and appropriate measures need to be put in place. When I was growing up at home, we always had a dog and he was always the first to welcome us home. It did not matter what state we came home in, be it good humour or bad, the dog was always in great humour. The tail was wagging and he was happy to see us. That is one of the connections humans have with the canine. We have that connection and everyone recognises and understands it. If that is abused by anyone under any circumstance, all of us are affected by it and worried about it. The issue of horses was also raised. One of the symptoms of the Celtic tiger throughout the country was people who were doing very well for themselves getting a donkey, a pony or a horse for their children, even if they did not have 10 sq. yd. to put it on. When the bust came, we ended up with the country full of them and many were dumped along the roadside and neglected. There is a lesson to be learned there. If people are going to have animals, they need to have the appropriate means to take care of them. The neglect of horses, such as hoofs not being pared, which we see on Facebook and other social media, is down to individuals who allow it to happen. They need to be dealt with using the full force of the law. One of the problems highlighted in the motion is that in many cases people's experience is that the full force of the law is not used. We need to ensure that additional resources are provided in that regard. This concerns humans being responsible for what they have control over, and many people take control of animals. It may be in a farm setting and it may be their livelihood. If it is their livelihood, naturally enough it is in their best interests to ensure that the animals progress, thrive and do the best they possibly can. Those are the circumstances of the vast majority of farmers and those engaged in agriculture. The issue of exporting live cattle to various countries around the world has been raised. We see that going on. When we consider the kind of climate they have grown up in and flourished in here and the climate to which they are going, I accept that there is a point to be made about putting an animal on a boat and sending it to Egypt or some other hot climate and the need for strict regulations. Having said that, one of the reasons most people in the agriculture sector want to see a prosperous live export trade is the monopoly the factories have on the prices farmers get for their beef and cattle. Farmers see exporting their animals as a means to introduce a little scarcity and to increase the price. It is down to the economics of the situation. It is a problem that we need to be able to deal with, and it is a problem that is bigger than just the animal cruelty issue. It concerns other matters also. Everyone agrees that developing more markets for our beef, lamb and other meat products, processing the meat and creating jobs here is a much more appropriate way to deal with this than live exports. The problem is that the factories and the big processors have such a monopoly and stranglehold on the industry. If that was dealt with properly, it would assist greatly in dealing with the issue of live exports. I concur that there are strict regulations and that inspections are carried out. We have heard reports of abuse taking place, however, and those need to be addressed. I commend the motion. Sinn Féin supports the motion as it stands but we also support the third amendment. We will not support the Government's amendment or that of Fianna Fáil. We accept that the Fianna Fáil amendment is similar, but if we support it, the third amendment which refers to circus animals would fall and that would not be appropriate. In that context, we will support the motion as amended by the third amendment. Great credit is due to Deputy O'Sullivan and those who put forward the motion. It is not trying to rub anyone's nose in it. It is trying to say that there is an issue to be dealt with and the way to deal with it is to put more resources in place to ensure that the health and welfare of animals is looked after efficiently and effectively.
#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	386	I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion and commend Deputy O'Sullivan. The greyhound industry has experienced many problems and much controversy over recent years. I know regulation is coming, which is welcome. The industry, for its own benefit, has to ensure it does things right. Too much has been found out in the last while, which is not good for any industry, and it needs to be sorted out. Whether it is England or elsewhere, people bring their pets to different countries, even on holiday, and this is about how we look after them. They deserve dignity. People need to understand the issues surrounding foxes, deer, etc., in different areas. Rural parts of Ireland are managed landscapes. If foxes are not controlled, we will end up with the old fox waggling along a road with the hair nearly gone off him. That is the reality. People might not like to hear it but that is what happens. Do we want to see him killed with a car or dying a slow death? If they get too old, unfortunately that is what ends up happening. We saw the same problems in the deer sector. Throughout Ireland, as Deputy Kenny rightly pointed out, the dog nearly every night in rural parts of Ireland sleeps under the blankets on the bed. There is more thought won by it than nearly anyone else in the house. That is a true reflection. The minute a person arrives, the dog welcomes him or her. He is the one friend that will come out to see a person when everyone else is in bed. That is how those in rural parts of Ireland live. They treat things with respect and they love their animals. We are brought up in rural parts of Ireland to respect our animals in particular. Perhaps there are not enough people in the ISPCA, etc., and resources need to be invested to ensure that the regulation, which is already there, is working. There is another thing that people need to understand. It was referred to earlier. Perhaps a farmer has health issues and gets sick. I will tell the House what happens for those who do not understand it. Be it day or night, neighbours come around and help the person, and they look after their animals as well as their own.That happens in every village around this country and it is great that it does every day of the week. With live exports, we would want to watch where we are going in all of this as there is a commercial interest in this and other countries. It is well known that in some countries in Europe, other interests are paying people to ensure there are protests against live exports. I can tell Members tonight that if a ship is going from Ireland, there are regulations governing the treatment of animals on it. Sometimes we give out about a ship being held up because of licensing and all of that. In fairness, to say something about the Department, it is doing its job well in that respect. An animal on a boat tonight may be treated better than a person in a hospital accident and emergency department. That is a fact. This minute in any part of rural Ireland, if a person wants a doctor, it would take an hour. If anything is wrong with an animal, a vet would attend in ten to 15 minutes to ensure the animal would be looked after. Cattle are either slaughtered in Ireland or exported. There are lairage facilities and some people do not understand them. Videos have been sent to me by people who, sadly, do not understand the position. First, the video would be of cattle in some other country not in the European Union as the cattle did not even have tags. Second, they were in a one-man showband in some part of the world we do not know. People need to get the facts on what Ireland does. We have strict regulation in this country and in fairness to the Department, they are enforced fairly well. Ballinasloe Horse Fair was mentioned earlier and people from the Department go around there every day making sure things are done right. Are we going to go down the road saying that the fish in the bowl that the youngster got for Christmas is a victim of cruelty? What about the bird in the cage in most towns and cities around the country? Does that amount to animal cruelty? We must decide what we are talking about. People need to understand we treat animals as we are taught to when growing up. People in rural parts of Ireland do not just see a horse when they are 20. They may be brought up from a nipper with such animals. They might be brought up with cattle, sheep or whatever, but they are taught to respect them and be kind to them. In some parts of the country I do not like to see small areas in which horses are confined, and in my opinion there is not enough fodder or facilities. In such cases, people cannot give them the same respect as they get in other parts of the country. Nobody questions that there must be good animal welfare not alone in Ireland but in every country. If I have a car and I sell it to someone in Cork, how can I know what that person will do down the road in a year or two or three? I am not responsible for that person. My way of life is to treat an animal, car or whatever I have with respect while I have it. Ultimately, we must ensure we do everything as well as possible. In fairness to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, although I fight with its staff on many things, with animal welfare around the country in marts, factories and export facilities, it is pretty much on the ball. Those staff do not let much pass. They will ensure things are done right, which is correct. When cattle are going to a foreign land, it is a long trip, but many people have sailed to America on a boat. There are better facilities on that ship than were available when people travelled years ago, and rightly so. I agree with that. We need to understand the context of what we are doing. Whether we like it or not, farmers must make a living. One cannot keep every animal and look at them for the rest of one's life, petting them in the garden. A farmer would not survive like that. Cattle will clearly be fattened and killed. That is a reality in any walk of life. It is the same with chickens and other animals. By all means we must ensure we have proper regulation and enough people on the ground to enforce it. I agree with that 100%. Nevertheless, we must consider this in a proper context.
#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	387	I welcome this debate on animal welfare in Ireland, which is very timely. This is one matter in which I have been very involved, along with Deputies such as Deputy O'Sullivan. We have relatively progressive legislation on the Statute Book but despite this we are seeing an increasing number of reports of mistreatment and abuse of animals. It is clear there is a massive gap in resourcing when it comes to enforcement. Organisations such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals rely on public donations for up to 90% of their funding. I read the People Before Profit manifesto on animal welfare, which is a really good document, and I will point out three or four elements as I do not have the time to discuss it all. It seeks a full audit of animal welfare issues in Ireland and stricter punishment and serious fines for those who abuse animals for commercial purposes. It seeks promotion of responsible pet ownership through the school curriculum and the introduction of measures requiring all animals but especially pigs and poultry to be provided with adequate space, natural light and opportunities to carry out natural behaviours. There is one issue I want to speak of tonight that is very close to my heart. It is the matter of horse welfare, particularly in an urban environment. When I was a councillor on South Dublin County Council, I was shocked, to understate it, by the number of horses which were impounded, neglected and destroyed. Over the past ten years, tens of thousands of horses have been destroyed in this country. Over a period of four years South Dublin County Council saw up to 1,000 horses destroyed at the cost of approximately €1 million to the taxpayer. As a person who loves horses and all animals, I was shocked by this wanton neglect and cruelty, particularly in a country where the horse is an esteemed creature. I was taken aback by those figures, which can be depressing. As a councillor I wanted to try to do something about it. Over the years the figures have fluctuated. They have gone down a little but they are still way too high. The Minister was in Clondalkin in February for the opening of the Clondalkin Equine Club. It gives young horse owners a place to call their own and it is the first social horse project in Ireland where young horse owners can keep their horses in an urban environment. It is a really good project and although it is not perfect by any means, we are trying to promote education and responsibility in equine matters, as well as everything that comes with it. I have seen the worst equine neglect one could imagine but I have also seen the best equine good practice, and this should be promoted through other county councils around the country. It is a good project. There should be more enforcement to tackle people who neglect horses. Some people should not even own a goldfish, never mind a horse. The majority of people who own horses are responsible and take good care of those animals. There are a small minority of people who are unscrupulous. They are dealers of horses and they do not care about horses, communities that keep horses well or anybody else. Enforcement measures should be taken against them through the police, etc. The Control of Horses Act 1996 is good legislation but it is not enforced.Who was the last person to be sent to jail for abusing, neglecting or abandoning of a horse, or for dealing in horses? I cannot think of any examples. The Clondalkin Equine Project is a really good project. There is something amazing about seeing a young person with an animal. I am not a horse owner, but it is great to see a young person bonding with a horse. They get an education from a horse. The project is not perfect by any means, but what was happening before was not acceptable and now at least we are trying to address the issue. The people who run the equine club have gone down to Limerick and around different parts of the country to promote the idea of a social horse project. Orphan horse ownership is not going to be a panacea, but it is better than what is happening at the moment, where horses are impounded by the council and destroyed and the horse owners and taxpayers are losing out. I attended protests last week about the live exports of farm animals and hare coursing. Hare coursing is bizarre. More than 100 Deputies in this Chamber support hare coursing. I find it bizarre that somebody can get pleasure from chasing a hare around. It is completely alien to me. As long as we live in a society that is profit driven, we will always have cruelty. Industrialised farming is abhorrent, and as long as we live in a profit-driven society, cruelty to animals will exist. People have to speak up for animals. We need a society where animals and human beings try to co-exist without wanton cruelty. Most people are not cruel to their animals. We live in a country that loves animals, but a system is in place where industrialised farming kills animals horribly. We have to try to end it.

That is what they do. They do their best by their farms and their animals. They are the custodians of the farms, who inherit the farms themselves and wish to pass them on to the future generations. They do not want to do anything that would be in any way negative or bad for their animals. I compliment the farming community on changing and coming forward so much, with sheds and slurry storage. They are trying to improve their own little corner of the world and are doing a great job. I have had the pleasure of being in Agriculture House for many years and I am thankful to every single person who works there, in every department. As previous speakers might have said, there are times when we might be arguing about payments being delayed, but overall I thank every person working in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, whether in Dublin or around the rest of the country, because they are doing a good job. I would ask that they try to make sure that payments go out in time because they are badly needed. I am 100% committed to the future of live exports in this country. The highest standards are being applied, and anybody who thinks that animals are mistreated just because they are being carried abroad live is wrong. They have not been on board these boats or seen the conditions. People try to say that it is something that it is not. These people are in the business of exporting animals for sale. They do not want to lose animals or for animals to be mistreated. The animals are fed, watered, bedded and minded. I want to make that quite clear. We must be fair to our farming community. They are doing their level best to make a living, as if there is something wrong with that. Animals have to be reared to be killed and eaten. They do not jump from a farm on to a plate. It is obvious what has to be done.

I estimate that 99% of people care for animals, especially the farmers, and we have to recognise the great efforts that farmers have made. They have built modern, airy sheds with plenty of room for cattle. There is a magnificent outfit in Kilgarvan called the Roughty Valley Co-op. They have the most modern methods of feeding, treating and keeping the pigs. It has to be seen to recognise and appreciate what is going on there. It is a wonderful operation which has been run by a man called Christy Hussey for the past 40 years. We are very proud of it. I am getting many calls in Kerry concerning the doping of greyhounds in events throughout the country. It is affecting the trade, and I am asking that it be investigated and stopped. It is hurting many people who have lived for greyhounds and look after them very well. I support the live cattle trade because if we did not have it, the factories would have more of a monopoly. Indeed, they have too much of a stranglehold on the price that farmers are allowed to get for their efforts at the present time. There is not enough control of mink, foxes, badgers, grey crows, magpies, pine martins, Sika deer and seagulls, which endlessly afflict our domestic animals and ground nesting birds. That has to be addressed, and it should be addressed in this Bill as well.

We had every type of animal one might think of, including cows, pigs, sheep, dogs and hens. Reference has been made tonight to good animal husbandry in 99.9% of farms. Someone referred to mental health issues, and it is possible that on an odd occasion there is cruelty because of different pressures. I have great respect for Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, but I cannot agree with the thrust of this Bill. I have the height of respect for farmers and how they try to do their business, and also for the Minister and his staff. I again raise the issue of a particular cohort of people and a reply I received from the Minister concerning horses. Tipperary, and indeed Ireland, has a very proud equine industry. I was speaking to the Minister, who confirmed in a parliamentary reply to me that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine had given authorities €4.5 million to deal with the seizure and control of horses in the three year period from 2014 to 2017. It is staggering to see the industrial scale removal, seizure and humane killing of horses that local authorities have been engaged in. During that period, just under 25,000 horses were seized, with 16,971 of them subsequently being euthanised. What is going on? Why are this cohort of people exempt from all the rules? Why are the people present for this motion not concerned about that? It is not farmers doing this. These horses are being raised for sulky racing and everything else, and left for dead on the road, causing health and safety issues for the public. I know of a case of a horse which lost its foal and which was taken out of Littleton bog and brought to a refuge where it is still being nursed back to health. However, the refuge has now been ordered to give it back to the person who owns it. This is a criminal gang that brought the horse all over the world, from Ireland to England to America and back again. That is the kind of support the volunteers in the animal refuge are getting, with a paltry amount of money from the Department. I support coursing and the Clonmel coursing festival 100%. The coursing clubs do wonderful work in the habitats to keep up the stocks of healthy hares. People come to protest, cut the wires and let them out of the refuge to be slaughtered by trucks. That speaks for itself. The people who claim they are from animal welfare groups put broken glass on the greyhound tracks to rip up the greyhounds' paws. Is that animal welfare? These people get freedom to speak but a group of women hurt by abortion were not even allowed to speak in hotels around here last week as a result of the actions of protesters. We have very funny thinking about freedom of speech and who we look after and who we do not.

I salute her. I also acknowledge those present in the Gallery from a multitude of animal welfare groups throughout the State, many of whom have travelled long distances to be with us tonight. They are, by and large, volunteers who do what they do for no reason other than their love of animals. It is their expertise and experience which says that the regulations and legislation in place are not working despite, perhaps, the best intentions of those who introduced them. I am quite sure they have much better things to be doing with their lives than to be here. However, they are here to say that change is needed and that we are not doing enough. Man's inhumanity to man is often mirrored in our mistreatment of animals. It is a consequence of a society that commodifies animals for human profit. I was fully expecting somebody to say that there are far more important issues out there and ask why are we wasting our time on this. It is illustrative that nobody did so. This indicates that animal welfare is a serious issue, a fact that everybody acknowledges for a couple of reasons. Cruelty to animals is symptomatic of a deeper malaise in society and extends to a mistreatment of other vulnerable groups. It has also been scientifically demonstrated that those who exploit and show gratuitous and wanton cruelty towards animals often end up displaying similar behaviour towards their fellow human beings. We in Independents 4 Change make no apology for raising animal welfare and animal rights issues and we will continue to do that. As an animal lover and a vegetarian, I very much welcome Deputy O'Sullivan's motion. When a member of a country council ten years ago, I moved the first motion to prohibit the use of wild animals in circuses. It is an awful indictment of the State that this has not been sorted out. This motion is a timely reminder of the cruelty that happens. It is also a very straightforward motion. The intent behind it is to raise the standards of animal welfare and protection in this country, not just for domestic animals but for animals in captivity, in the wild, those bred for sport - even, despicably, for blood sports - those used for experiments or those bred for their fur or their meat. We could be here all night talking about any one aspect of that. There is no end to the cruelty demonstrated but I cannot deal with all of the issues involved. Let us consider the use of animals in farming and in sport, which, in many ways, could be viewed as legitimate cruelty. People who would be horrified to hear of a gurrier throwing a cat on to a bonfire have no problem with some of the exploitation that goes on in those spheres. I do not say that lightly or to be critical of the people involved but we, as a society, have to step back and consider those issues. Deputy Fitzmaurice said farmers love their animals. I accept that. Of course farmers love their animals. They are the means to their livelihoods. Did people in Ireland years ago love their children when they sent them to Magdalen laundries because they were pregnant outside marriage or when they slapped them for being bold in school? Society changes and evolves and we have different standards of culture and ways of addressing matters when we learn more. It is not a question of slagging off farmers but we do need to step back and consider how we use animals. I can say it confidently because I am a vegetarian but there is no economic or environmental sense in eating meat. It is interesting that Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, who did not bother to stay, has raised issues about this because he denies climate change. There is no doubt that the number of cattle being raised is a huge contributory factor in the context of climate change and emissions and, as a society, we have to address that. The case is the same for animals misused in what we call sport. Is it true that horses, when they are gainfully employed in our studs, are treated like royalty? Others said they have a better set up than homeless people. Yes, they do when they are employed productively but when they are not, tough luck. Drug use is part of that issue. We told the previous Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, that what became the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 was good on paper. We suspected at the time that it would have limitations. Sadly, this has proved to be the case, although the profile of issues of cruelty has been raised. Since the legislation was enacted, we have had several interactions with members of An Garda Síochána who have tried to deal with issues of animal cruelty. In the main, they have responded well but they have not really been given the legislation to equip them to do that effectively. I would like Deputies to think about what John FitzGerald asked today in a letter to the newspaper. Those who are correctly appalled by stories of animals found dead and starving on the side of the road, cats shot with pellet guns or thrown into fires, dogs found with their ears hacked off and so on also think hare coursing is all right. A hunted fox or a coursed hare feels pain. It does not matter to the animal that the person chasing him has a nice suit and lot of money in his pocket. Is that any different from a death experienced by being thrown on a bonfire in an estate in Dublin? The animals involved do not suffer any less. Without being flippant, I ask Deputies to stand back and consider that double standard. We often hear people express horror at how greyhounds are treated in other countries but we have no problem shipping them abroad. I put it to Deputy Fitzmaurice that if he sells a car to somebody he knows has been guilty of joyriding and killing people, then, as far as I am concerned, he is responsible. The analogy is a good one. By tabling this motion, we wanted to challenge some of those views. The ISPCA received 16,000 calls last year. That shows how much citizens are engaged in trying to deal with these issues. Only 16 cases were finalised in court and the penalties imposed were ridiculously low. Deputy O'Sullivan dealt with badger culling and so on. I want to deal with badger baiting, which is illegal in this State but which, as we speak here tonight, is happening. It is an absolutely reprehensible, cruel, inhumane activity that involves the invasion of a badger's habitat by trained terriers who drag out the badger. The horror show is usually organised by grown men. I have a picture of one such man here and he is wearing a balaclava and military gear. I would not like to cross him and I am sure our National Parks and Wildlife Services, NPWS, officers, would not like to cross him either. Generally, they pull out a mother badger that has recently given birth because her instinct is to protect her young and they will get a far better fight out of her as she fights for her life and to protect her cubs. Meanwhile they stand around and place bets on that activity. The "Panorama" programme highlighted what was going on in Ireland, namely, tourism in that type of barbarity, 30 years ago and it is still going on today. There are criminal gangs in the midlands that were arrested for incidents of badger baiting in 2013. In the two years before they were brought to court, those involved managed to polish and bring out an entirely professional operation - on Facebook - tracking badgers by means of a global positioning system, GPS, and a network of betting, and with appalling videos being shown. They came to court in 2015 and received three-month suspended sentences and then went off to hone their badger baiting skills, which they are probably using tonight.Just looking on Google can give an introduction to their activities. It is a patently illegal activity of which our National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, officers and the Garda are aware and with which they have tried to deal. However, what NPWS officer without a gun or an armoured car will take on some of these thugs? They are not able to deal with that. We need much more support for NPWS officers and for the Garda in dealing with these activities. I do not have time but the fact that some of these dogs are bred to spend their lives participating in these blood sports is the other side of the equation, and that is not to mention puppy farming and all the other barbarity. We will continue to raise these issues. It is clear the legislation is deficient. The efforts of NGOs and people such as those in the Visitors Gallery to highlight these matters is very positive and is something we will try to copy.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	393	I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I have listened attentively to all the contributions. I commend Deputy O'Sullivan and her colleagues on tabling the motion. As we gather here on the eve of world animal welfare day, and I consider the debate in all its contexts, there is more that unites us than divides us. It is a positive thing. There are probably issues on the extremes on which we will never agree but I will make some points from the perspective of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Anyone who breaks the law in respect of animal welfare issues will find no favour and no place to hide in the context of the Department. We take that position for many reasons. I was interested in Deputy Gino Kenny's contribution, and he made the point that a proper animal welfare system was impossible because our farming system was driven by profit. I ask Deputy Kenny to consider what would be the consequences for animal welfare were our farming system driven by poverty. I suggest they would be far more serious. We have a regulatory legislative framework to deal with animal welfare abuses. I listened last night to Michael Gove, my counterpart in the UK, who told the Conservative Party conference that it needs to urgently update its animal welfare legislation. My predecessor, Deputy Coveney, did that in 2013 and updated legislation that went back beyond the foundation of the State. We now have regulations and law that are fit for purpose and that cover a combination of my Department, voluntary and charitable bodies working as designated officers under the legislation, as well as local authorities, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Garda Síochána. The law, by and large, is fit for purpose and there have been a substantial number of prosecutions both at a central level by my Department but also along the line locally, by Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine officials, by the Garda and by dedicated officers appointed under the legislation. By and large, we have the regulatory and legislative framework.  Deputy O'Sullivan referred to Ballinasloe and incidents of concern that were apparently highlighted there. The very fact that there are designated officers there, identifying and following up on concerns regarding animal welfare is proof in a way that the legislation is fit for purpose. Does the identification of cases and our prosecuting cases prove that our system is not working or does it prove that we are effective in dealing with these incidents as they arise? That is the challenge. Are we ahead of the game and in control of the matter or are we playing catch-up? I do not state there is any cause for complacency. I return to the point made by Deputy Gino Kenny. Even only for reasons of commercial self-interest, it is in this country's financial interest to have the highest animal welfare standards. I have the privilege of being the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and I attend trade fairs and missions to promote Ireland as the food island, bearing in mind that not everyone in the places we sell our food is vegetarian, and our food includes meat and dairy products. Increasingly it is taken almost for granted and as a given that we produce safe, traceable, nutritious food, but increasingly in the markets where we want to be, those higher added value markets, we are asked about our animal welfare standards and our sustainability credentials. This returns to the point made by Deputy Clare Daly, wearing a vegetarian badge of honour, about sustainability and greenhouse gases and cattle rearing systems. It is often not recognised that we are the most carbon-efficient producers of dairy products in the world. If we dismantle our dairy systems on some altar of climate change - and I am not a climate change denier; while we are global leaders in dairy, we need to do more - it will only be displaced by other countries which have a higher carbon footprint. This is equally the case in the beef industry. We are facing challenges in the context of the European Union and beef industry access to our markets from Mercosur countries. We are the fifth most carbon-efficient producer of beef in the European Union and are committed to doing more in this area, but if we sacrifice our industry it will be displaced by countries because we are the largest producer and exporter of beef in the northern hemisphere. It will be displaced by countries that produce it with a far higher carbon footprint. It is 33% of our greenhouse emissions but that is because we do not have the history of heavy industry possessed by other industrialised countries. We are reducing the carbon intensity, which itself is a signal of our commitment. Ireland has a good record in caring for its animals. Unfortunately, instances of cruelty do occur. There has been significant progress in updating animal welfare legislation, particularly in the introduction of the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which provides for significant custodial sentences, up to five years in certain circumstances, and very substantial fines. That is the toolkit we use. That is for the worst circumstances. In other cases we need to work with people to ensure they address shortcomings but we are taking a significant number of prosecutions, largely due to my predecessor's efforts in improving that legislation.  Enforcement has been enhanced by a provision in the Act that allows some investigative powers to be given to members of NGOs. As I noted, some of those dedicated authorised officers under the legislation were present in Ballinasloe. My Department has been operating an animal welfare hotline since 2012 that facilitates confidential reporting of any suspicion of animal cruelty whether in farming, sport, recreation or domestic situations. I urge members of the public to continue to use it as means of drawing my Department's attention to instances of neglect. We will always follow up on those.  I wish to note the work of the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council. It is an independent advisory body to my Department, which identifies potential welfare cases before they arise on farms through its early warning intervention system for animal welfare cases which operates at national and county level and through which my Department has developed a very strong partnership with the IFA and representatives from the various county societies for the protection of animals. I reiterate the comments made by the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, in acknowledging the contribution of the animal welfare charities. The staff and volunteers of these organisations demonstrate commitment, professionalism and dedication in providing care and happy endings to abandoned and cruelly treated animals. Last December I provided €2.46 million to 137 animal welfare organisations and I will make further merited awards to these organisations that do invaluable work. The total we have given since 2011 is more than €11.26 million. I wish we were in a position to give more because I do acknowledge that very often these charitable organisations which are on the ground are able to do more effectively what the State could probably never replicate, and I salute their commitment and professionalism. I also acknowledge the work carried out by some welfare bodies, in conjunction with local authorities and with financial support from the Department, to develop facilities for urban and Traveller horse populations. I was out with Deputy Gino Kenny at the project in Clondalkin, and what he failed to mention, which I am sure was an oversight, was the project was funded to the tune of €500,000 by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine as a recognition of the role it plays in education by and large, but also in addressing the fitting and rightful recognition of the urban horse in the overall recognition of our equine sector in particular, which has come through a particularly difficult period. I ascribe a lot of the animal welfare issues, and particularly equine welfare, that have arisen in recent years as a consequence of the crash and the poverty rather than the profit associated with it. A number of other points were raised. In response to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, the greyhound industry has been addressed by the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and the need to address in a comprehensive fashion the concerns of the punters in terms of integrity in the greyhound racing industry is part of the new legislative framework that we will put in place. Deputy Martin Kenny spoke about the domestic dog. Deputy Doyle turned to show me his screensaver, which is a picture of his family dog, and by coincidence my screensaver is a picture of my family dog. It sums up in a way the special position of the dog in our affection and animal welfare at the highest level.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-10-03 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	396	I commend Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan on presenting this Private Members' motion this evening. I was delighted to sign up to it with the Independents 4 Change. I welcome the NGOs, volunteers and activists in the Gallery. It reflects the interest and concern people have in animal welfare and health. There is an expression that a society is judged by how it treats, supports and protects its vulnerable. I believe societies should also be judged by how they treat and respect animals who are vulnerable and who are in the care of society. I have serious questions on how the Government has responded to the housing crisis, where we have 3,000 children in hotels and hostels. As an Opposition Deputy, I believe we should also challenge the Government's policy on the Animal Health and Welfare Act. With regard to hare coursing, the 130 coursing trials using only 64 hares, which took place in September, have already been mentioned. This is against the provisions of the Animal Health and Welfare Act. We know of people taking the hares as they are released after coursing and collecting and selling them back in the interests of profit. There are many areas in hare coursing where there are serious problems and people are breaking the provisions of the Animal Health and Welfare Act. If the Government deems hare coursing worthy of licensing, we maintain it should be consistent and ensure all coursing fixtures are subject to National Parks and Wildlife Service monitoring. Where monitors are not present, coursing clubs have repeatedly shown over the years that they tend to act in breach of the licensing conditions. If the State lacks the manpower or commitment to monitor all these animal baiting events, it should stop licensing them and simply outlaw hare coursing, an option favoured by the majority of people according to opinion polls. I want to take up the point on animals being exported from Ireland. The Guardian did a very detailed examination of this back in May, which showed evidence of exported animals being cruelly treated from the point of view of welfare. It did not criticise the fact that animals are being exported and how they are exported on the ships. It was about where they ended up, often outside European laws, how they were treated, which was absolutely disgusting, with their throats being slit and their being hung by one leg and slaughtered while alive, and some of the conditions, such as having no water or food and the transport conditions of these animals. What we and people who are concerned about animal welfare want to hear is that there is real transparency, that any country to where animals are exported should be very clear that its animal welfare legislation should be of high quality also, and that wherever the animals are transported to, they should be respected in the same way as they are respected here, even though there is a huge question mark about how we actually use animals. We have been contacted by the ISPCA, which states it welcomed the Act introduced in 2014, but the punishments for prosecutions are too small and do not serve to create a deterrent to those who are cruel to animals. For cases dealt with by the District Court the fine is up to €5,000 or six months' imprisonment, and in the Circuit Court the fine is up to €250,000 and five years' imprisonment. The 2016 report by the ISPCA gives a few examples of cases that went to court. All the people involved were fined €500 and ordered to pay €750 costs. In only one case was the person disqualified for keeping dogs for two years. What should be done is that anybody prosecuted in the courts for cruelty to animals should be disqualified from keeping animals for at least five years. There should not be a maximum fine of €5,000 but a minimum fine of €4,000 or €5,000 for people who are found to be cruel to animals. Some of the cruelty the ISPCA has dealt with is absolutely horrific, and these people should not be allowed to keep animals in any shape or form over the next period of time. The ISPCA wants more resources and more officers on the ground, and this should be done. If the Minister cannot implement or provide this, it makes a mockery of the legislation. The Minister should deal with this and come back with how he intends to increase the number of officers in the area to deal with the issues.

I really appreciate all of the contributions made this evening. We cannot dispute the facts and evidence of animal neglect and cruelty because there are gaps in the legislation and because the legislation is not being fully implemented. It does not help that there are three Departments involved in animal issues. It does not help there is no consistency in the way councils apply the Dog Breeding Establishments Act and guidelines and the Animal Health and Welfare Act. For example, a breeder was found to have more than the specified number of dogs. Instead of the council prosecuting him, it just upped the number of dogs he could have. It does not help that there are repeated refusals by certain councils to release inspection records. What also does not help are the levels of secrecy and the difficulties that animal welfare supporters have in getting information, including through freedom of information requests, of inspections that have been carried out by local authorities, which, when they do get it, can be very heavily redacted. If there is nothing to hide, the information should be readily available. It does not help that there are authorities that choose to do nothing when cases of animal neglect and abuse are brought to their attention by individuals and groups, and then those authorities spend their time justifying inaction and they close ranks to protect their own. We have many responsible hard-working vets, including my own in Fairview, but there appears to be no one to follow up on those vets who are not enforcing the animal welfare legislation. I must ask what the role is of the Veterinary Council of Ireland regarding the statutory obligations of its members. The VCI can undertake investigations if concerns are raised, and it could make the industry substantially better. I had a look at the amendments. The Fianna Fáil amendment sets out the theory in legislation to ensure highest standards and a strict sanctioning regime for offenders. The Government amendment also mentions increased penalties but this is not happening, as Deputy Joan Collins has just pointed out. We are way behind other countries. The UK, for example, has increased sentences for people convicted of animal cruelty. In the USA, animal cruelty is now a class A felony, with the FBI tracking animal cruelty issues. The Fianna Fáil amendment states all live animals being traded from the State must have a veterinary health certificate when leaving Ireland but one should consider what happens to them en route and on arrival at a destination. There are facts and evidence to prove this. Admittedly, welfare checks are carried out but the reports are not always available, as I said, and we do not see the follow-up. Reference was made to the €2.4 million. It is good to see the Government giving more to animal charities but, in 2017, some €64 million was given to the greyhound and horse industries. It is the animal welfare charities that have to deal with the fallout of unwanted dogs and horses.  The Minister might clarify whether the Cavan puppy farmer who kept whelping bitches and unborn pups in the tiny wooden crates that are illegal under the guidelines is on the working group reviewing the dog breeding establishment guidelines. He might also ask Cavan County Council who was representing it on the working group because it refuses to disclose that information. Could he clarify whether the self-confessed biggest puppy farmer in Europe is still operating even though a closure order was sought because of the appalling conditions in which he was keeping the animals? I understand he is still operating with no planning permission but with the full knowledge of Offaly County Council, which will not issue enforcement proceedings. If a person is neglected, abused or badly treated, he or she has a voice, but animals do not. Only for the people in the Visitors Gallery and others who cannot be here tonight, and others like them, Ireland's reputation on animal welfare would be much worse. I thank them for their care, passion and commitment to exposing and eliminating animal neglect and cruelty. The one positive tonight is that we all agree cruelty to animals is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. I take that positive from tonight. It is good to hear Members talk about their love for animals but we cannot just rest there, with words and what is on paper, because there are too many documented cases of animal neglect and outright cruelty. If we have so much in common, we most certainly can make a difference on this matter.
