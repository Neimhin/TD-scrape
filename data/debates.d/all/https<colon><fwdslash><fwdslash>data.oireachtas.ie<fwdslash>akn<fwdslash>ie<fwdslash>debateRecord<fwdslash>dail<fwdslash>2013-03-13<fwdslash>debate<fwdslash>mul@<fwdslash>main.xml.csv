#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	Over the past two years, the Taoiseach has failed to do anything effective to help people in mortgage arrears. More than 180,000 mortgages are in arrears and the people involved are finding it extremely difficult to cope. Their experiences with the banks have been anything but pleasant. The Keane report, which was published over 18 months ago, made many recommendations, including the idea of split mortgages. We have learned that only about 50 such mortgages have been put into operation since the publication of that report. This is a damning indictment of the Taoiseach's lack of action on this front. The Taoiseach still insists that the banks must have a veto over any resolution of mortgage arrears or household debt. He was going to enact legislation to facilitate banks in repossessing family homes. To add insult to injury, he insists that families in mortgage arrears pay a badly designed property tax. It escapes me how people who cannot pay their mortgages could pay a property tax. People find this incredible. Senator Thomas Byrne and Deputy Michael McGrath published legislation in a constructive way in July 2011 which proposed the establishment of an independent debt settlement office. The Taoiseach did not take account of those recommendations. That legislation would have provided independent oversight of the resolution of household debt between banks and their customers. The Personal Insolvency Act is not yet operational. For over a month, I have been asking the Taoiseach to list the sections that have been enacted. At least 119 sections of the Act that is meant to deal with this issue remain unenacted or have not been commenced by the Government. The Cabinet sub-committee on this has only met twice since its establishment last July. All of this illustrates a lack of engagement and activity. In respect of the plan the Taoiseach is announcing today, this is not about targets. It is about the quality of the restructuring that will take place between the banks and customers in respect of their mortgages. It must make a difference on the ground.

Has the Ceann Comhairle ever heard anything as strange as that? I noticed that the leader of Fianna Fáil drew that by-election into his comments here. The first thing I will remind him of is that the previous Government refused to hold by-elections because it was always afraid of the people. It had to change the law to ensure that by-elections would take place within six months.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	8	This strategy has nothing to do with the by-election. Deputy Martin has pursued a misery agenda for long enough. I am not sure whether he is afraid he would actually sort this out, because when one looks back at what the previous Government did not do, one can see appalling behaviour and lack of competence on its part. Deputy Martin ignores the fact that the Government of which he was a central member was directly responsible for the infliction of economic burdens on every person in the country because of the way it allowed the banking system to run riot. People could not go to an ATM without getting notices that they had been approved for another €10,000, €15,000 or €50,000. This Government had to restructure and recapitalise the banks, change the boards and make a series of arrangements, including the introduction of the Personal Insolvency Act, which is not yet operational because the personal insolvency service will open its doors in early summer. There will be an announcement about that from the director, who has already been appointed and will be recruiting his staff towards the end of March. The Minister for Finance will set out all the details of the mortgage targets and timeframes today and there will be similar announcements by the Central Bank. As Deputy Martin knows, the Central Bank controls the licences and can apply any conditions it sees fit to banks that do not adhere to conditions or rearrangements for persons in distress. I told Deputy Martin yesterday that we want to see an opportunity for those 100,000 people who exist for the banks and for their families to have some sense of security for the future. The Government aimed to bring about a variety of opportunities, which now exist, for restructuring and establishing different arrangements for those clients. The details of that will be presented by the Minister for Finance today. It is not true for Deputy Martin to say that the Government has shown inaction on this. For the past two years, this has been one of the central issues for it. That is why we had the Keane report and why some of its recommendations have been followed through, although others have not been followed through to the extent that we would like. The Minister of State with responsibility for housing and planning has been very active in respect of mortgage-to-rent and split mortgage arrangements.Far from Deputy Micheál Martin's argument that there has been no activity on the part of the Government, the scale of the mess his party left behind was absolutely unprecedented in the history of the country.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	19	The Keane report was published 18 months ago and its recommendations have not been followed through. A total of approximately 50 split mortgages out of 182,000 mortgages in arrears does not represent action by the Taoiseach or anyone else. The Governor of the Central Bank said he was tearing his hair out. The Deputy Governor, Ms Fiona Muldoon, said last November that the banks were not doing what they should be doing in engaging with people. All of the political bluster from and the arrogance of the Taoiseach will not change these basic facts.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	23	-----who are working, who have salaries and who want to pay their mortgages. They have asked the banks to do a deal with them, but all they get in response is obstacles put in their way by the banks. There has been no action on this front. The banks were recapitalised to the tune of €9 billion to deal with the issue of mortgage impairment and mortgage difficulties, but there has been no engagement between the banks and their customers. I will ask the Taoiseach the same question again. Will there be independent oversight of the banks in their dealings with customers? To date, they have demonstrated, as evidenced by the remarks of the Governor and the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, that on their own and left to their own devices, they will not deal effectively with those in arrears. That is why the Government needs to intervene in an affirmative way to ensure there is independent oversight of the behaviour of the banks in their dealings with customers.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	29	I remind Fianna Fáil and the Government parties that there would not be a compulsion to hold by-elections within six months if Deputy Pearse Doherty had not gone to court to bring this about. The Taoiseach has been in government for two years and the number of families in mortgage arrears has almost doubled. Contrary to what he said, the Government has taken a softly, softly attitude to the banks. He did not need yesterday's report to show that the salaries of top bankers were too high, yet he is only proposing a 10% cut. The big issue is that he has given the banks a veto over any arrangements reached through the personal insolvency services. The record shows that the banks are unwilling to deal compassionately or efficiently with citizens in mortgage arrears. On top of all this, this week householders are receiving letters from Revenue about the tax on the family home. This tax was designed by Fianna Fáil and is now being delivered by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. It is a very unfair tax.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	30	I have a little question for the Taoiseach.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	34	I thank the Ceann Comhairle. The fact is Deputies know that what I am saying is accurate. People in the North pay rates for which they receive services which are denied to householders in this state. I refer to refuse collections, water services, prescriptions and free schoolbooks for their children. We have in this state perhaps the largest potholes in the western world.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	35	May we have a question for the Taoiseach, please?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	36	It was the Taoiseach who said this property tax on the family home was unfair. Does he still accept that it is an unfair tax? If he is changing tack now, explicitly that means he is admitting failure thus far. Does he accept that his hands-off approach to the banks has failed miserably?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	37	I do not agree. This year 65% of property tax revenue will be retained by the local authorities. The Government's intention is to bring that figure to 80% for use in the provision of services in the local authority areas where people pay their property tax. This is a fair tax, whereby those who have the most will pay the most. It has been set out to provide services in local areas. I assume the Deputy already pays tax on the premises he owns in west Belfast and that he will pay it on the house he owns in County Donegal. I assume he will also pay it on the other house in County Louth.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	38	Like the Taoiseach.

In respect of mortgages, the Minister for Finance will outline the details this afternoon. I wish to inform the Deputy that the banks do not have a veto over the insolvency legislation, nor do they have a veto over the reduction from 12 years to three.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	41	That provides an incentive for banks to sit down with clients to deal with their particular problems by means of the wide variety of opportunities such as those outlined in the Keane report and elsewhere to restructure and re-engineer their mortgages which are in distress. The Deputy's rant about evictions and house repossessions is nonsensical. I note that even his own spokesman on finance, when pressed in a recent interview, said repossessions would take place in a small number of cases - this is how everyone understands it to be - where no effort had been made to repay mortgages in cases where it was possible to repay them.  I reiterate for the Deputy that 65% of property tax revenue this year, rising to 80%, will be retained by the local authorities in the areas in which the property tax is paid for the provision of services and infrastructure.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	42	We need to deal with the substance of these issues. For a man from County Mayo, to even suggest eviction from or repossession of a family home - even if the number is small - would be justifiable is totally and absolutely reprehensible. Rather than jibing at us, I ask the Taoiseach to deal with the substance. One in four mortgage holders is in distress. People have had tax upon tax imposed upon them. They cannot pay it. That is the reality.What we have argued for is the establishment of a statutorily independent body that would impose settlements which would be legally binding agreements between mortgage holders and the banks and which would include - the Government has ruled this out - write-downs, where appropriate. What we are seeking would deal with the substance of the problem. The Government has a veto, but it has given this to the banks. It should now remove it. On the numerous occasions on which I have raised the issue the Taoiseach has stated the regulator does not want the Government to intervene and that, therefore, it cannot do anything. The Government has done very little of substance in order to put manners on the banks.

He also indicated that there had to be legal protection and legislative provision to the effect that banks could not swoop in and purchase homes. He went on to state the option of repossession had to be available to a bank if somebody with an ability to pay his or her mortgage was not doing so. The individual in question was asked, "So you are not ruling it out?" to which he replied that repossession should happen "Only for somebody who is completely defaulting on their mortgage and who has an ability to pay." Deputy Gerry Adams should not come before the House and state he has a new version of what his party's spokesman said on Monday.

What we want to do is get the people whose mortgages are either in arrears or distress to the point where they can enjoy the psychological relief to the effect that their homes will not be taken from them and where they can contribute to their local economies and live their lives. That is the reason the Minister for Finance and the Government, working with the Central Bank, are putting in place all of the arrangements that will be announced later today. Under these arrangements, targets and timelines will be set by the banks which now have staff who are trained to deal with the circumstances under discussion which are unique in each case. The repossession of family homes will be the very last resort. No Member of the House wants to see homes being repossessed. However, even the Deputy's party recognises that repossession will occur in a small number of cases.

These structures will be detailed later today by the Minister for Finance when he speaks on this matter.

#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	71	I was taken to visit a cluster unit in my constituency which had been lying idle for 15 years. The position is the same in several other such units throughout the country and this has resulted in an outlay of €2.5 million in rent each year, with no return for the taxpayer in the long term. I am informed that the leases for these properties are unbreakable. I am also informed that over half of the commercial premises leased by IDA Ireland are either unused and idle. One such premises in Dublin is costing the taxpayer €1.3 million per year. The cost for several others is €750,000 annually. Many of the leases on these properties are set to run for another couple of decades. I visited one premises in respect of which, when the lease expires, we will have paid €1 million extra. In the current economic climate which has been catastrophic for SMEs and small businesses how is it possible that such wanton waste of taxpayers' money is being allowed? We are leaving buildings idle and spending considerable amounts on leases and rates at a time when the country is literally on its knees and cutbacks are being made in disability and health services. The Taoiseach knows as well as I do that many start-ups fail in the first year because of the burden of rents and rates. I am aware of people who start up their businesses and are obliged to run their operations from a bedroom or sitting-room in their own homes for a year or two before they can rent suitable premises. Is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate whether all of the leases to which I refer are definitely unbreakable? If not, will he make urgent inquiries in order to discover whether we can extricate ourselves from them and vacate others which are coming up for review? Will he press for the development of a new scheme or initiative by means of which new uses could be found for the buildings to which I refer? Perhaps they might be given to companies either free of charge or at considerably reduced rates. I reiterate that we are wasting millions of euro of taxpayers' money each year in the current economic climate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	73	I thank Deputy John Halligan for raising this matter. IDA Ireland is the agency which has for many years dealt with inward investment. Of its type, it is one of the best in the world. It has an extraordinary record of success and last year was one of the agency's best to date. It works with companies that wish to invest in the country in the areas of manufacturing, research and development, innovation, etc. In the past the industries which used to be interested in Ireland required what were called "advance factories". The Deputy will be aware of them, many of which were smaller warehouses and units and built - either individually or in clusters - throughout the country. They were not confined to the south east or any other location. There are aging advanced factories at various locations which were never occupied or which were only occupied for very short periods. The reason for this is IDA Ireland was of the view that it was appropriate to have a building ready should companies decide to establish operations at particular locations. Matters have very much moved on and the vast majority of companies that wish to invest in Ireland now require greenfield sites of a much greater scale than was the case in the past. These companies want buildings to be designed to meet their needs and circumstances. The Deputy is correct when he states leases were entered into on a longer term basis for many of the older buildings, one of which has been unoccupied since 1998.I do not know the details of the contracts, but it is important that a company looking at Ireland and its distinct advantages, be it from the point of view of tax, talent, technology or track record, has access to buildings that are available. That is the reason IDA Ireland had a leased arrangement for a number of buildings that might be suitable for particular companies. The Deputy is well aware that the bigger companies require a much bigger scale and scope in terms of site acquisition. One can never estimate accurately what might happen. For instance, Eistech, which had only nine positions last year, has more than 400 now and it has announced a further 250 for Wexford. That company has expanded and grown rapidly because it does its business so well. There were 33 visits by IDA Ireland to the south east in 2012. The scale of interest is being highlighted by the authority for companies to consider. That is replicated at home by Enterprise Ireland, which is constantly engaging with smaller Irish companies that might like to grow, change direction or have the opportunity to expand their markets. The Deputy's point about the scale and the number of leases is correct. Traditionally, that is the reason that happened. It is very different now in that companies wishing to come here look for much bigger sites and buildings of a particular design that is suitable for their specific needs. We can examine the policy of holding on to much older advance factories or locations with IDA Ireland, but I believe in most cases the leases were set out for a longer period. The total outstanding balance payable on leases in County Waterford, for instance, to the end of their terms is approximately €1 million.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	74	I will make two points. First, my contact within IDA Ireland is a conscientious chap and it bothers him to think that all this money is being wasted every year. He made the point to me that in respect of some premises around the country that were taken on 15, 16 or 17 years ago, IDA Ireland now acknowledges it has no hope of introducing multinational companies into those areas because of their locations, but it is tied into these leases for another five or six years, which is a cost to the taxpayer. Second, in opposition we are often accused of not offering alternatives or making critical analyses, but at a time when new businesses, charitable organisations and youth groups are struggling, how can it be the case that half of all IDA Ireland premises, some of which have been lying idle for 15 years, may still be lying idle in five or ten years' time at a huge cost to the taxpayer? In the current economic circumstances, as the person in IDA Ireland told me, we can ill afford to waste €10, let alone €2.5 million, every year on empty premises when we could be helping out the people in this country.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	75	If we are talking specifically about older advance factory-type buildings which have lain idle or were used only for a very short time, I am not sure of the details of any particular contract or lease, but if somebody else wants to use one of these buildings, I am sure there is an opportunity for discussion or negotiation. If some local indigenous operator wanted to acquire a premises in which to do business, I am sure IDA Ireland would be willing to discuss that. IDA Ireland knows best, in terms of its success rate over the years, where companies might want to locate, and it cannot force them to locate in any particular area. The Deputy's point is that the buildings are in situ. In this city, for instance, the extent of interest in investing is very high. I am quite sure that empty buildings that are under lease are being viewed constantly by potential investors who wish to set up here. I can confirm for the Deputy that the line of investment and interest in investing in the country is very strong. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, was in Texas last week talking to people from 40 different companies. I hope to enhance that progress when I have the opportunity to meet with a range of potential investors in the United States next week. Also, with regard to indigenous operators, the Deputy will be aware that Irish firms employ more than 100,000 people in 50 states. Many of those want to expand, and it may be the case that the point the Deputy raised could be considered. I thank the Deputy for doing so.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	78	Speaking recently at the Near social justice media conference, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, said that new legislation governing media ownership is a concern that the Government must be prepared to engage with. He committed to new rules on media mergers, but he did not say when they would be published. He said that in the context of a remark that without State intervention in the media, what would emerge would be a small number of enormous commercial media conglomerates that are operated solely for profit by the privileged and the powerful. This is from the Minister for communications, Deputy Pat Rabbitte. I am conscious that the programme for Government committed to legislation in this regard. Last May, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, seemed to indicate that there would not be a separate media mergers Bill but that he would proceed with one Bill, the consumer and competition Bill. Regarding the comments of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, he said this was an issue of concern to the very fundamentals of democracy and media diversity. He is on the record as saying to the House that diversity of content and ownership is more important in the media than in other enterprises as it has an impact on the quality of our democracy. He said he is confident that the Bill will have regard to these principles. With regard to the Bill he was talking about, can the Taoiseach give a timescale for the introduction of the consumer competition Bill? Also, can he confirm or clarify for the House whether there will be separate media mergers legislation, as per the Minister's comments at the weekend, or whether the new rules pertaining to media mergers will be contained in one Bill? This has been ongoing for a year and a half, and there is a lack of clarity on it. There appears to be a Fine Gael position on this which is not in support of new rules about media mergers, and it is a different position from that of the Labour Party. I want to know the Government position on the promised legislation.

As is traditional at the spring meeting, economic policy matters will be at the top the agenda. This will not be a crisis meeting, like so many in recent times, as there is now a degree of stability in the markets. As leaders, we must not let this lead to complacency or a loss of momentum; rather, we must make every effort to use this vital opportunity to underpin stability and drive forward the reforms that will deliver growth and jobs. That is the message I intent to bring to the meeting. I will advocate that we place a firm focus on implementation of the many and varied measures we have already agreed to - implementation in terms of the economic surveillance involved with the European semester; implementation of our structural reforms and consolidation efforts; implementation of the compact for growth and jobs; implementation of our economic governance framework; implementation of what we have agreed to in addressing unemployment, completing the Single Market and introducing smarter regulation; and, critically, implementation of banking union. The meeting will be about implementation. The European Union is facing a credibility test - we must show people that we are capable of standing by what we have agreed to and delivering what we have promised. Before I say more about the European Council, it might be useful for the House if I update it on progress on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, even though it is not formally on the agenda on this occasion. Discussions at the European Council will be opened, as usual, by an address by the President of the European Parliament, Mr. Martin Schulz. He will come from this week's plenary meeting of the Parliament which will express its view on the agreement on the MFF reached by the European Council in February. There is a general expectation that the Parliament will vote in favour of a resolution calling on its negotiators to advance some of the issues of greatest importance to the Parliament such as flexibility, a mid-term review and own resources in the negotiations with the Council which Ireland, in holding the Presidency, will lead. I expect President Schulz to set out the Parliament's view in clear and forthright terms, which is as it should be. In my meetings with him I have reassured him that while our role is to represent the Council in the discussions ahead, we will work in good faith with him and his team in the interests of securing an agreement. This is very much in the best interests of the European Union and all of its institutions. To better understand the Parliament's position, I plan to meet President Schulz and President Barroso on the margins of this week's meeting. It is important that we keep up momentum. While the agreement reached at the European Council last month was an important achievement, there cannot be an MFF without the assent of the Parliament. That is what we are working to secure and I look forward to keeping the House informed as we proceed. It is in everyone's interests that it is concluded during Ireland's Presidency. As I mentioned, this week's meeting of the European Council will conclude the first phase of what is called the European Semester 2013. The key output in this regard will be guidance to member states on the preparation of member states' stability programme updates, under the Stability and Growth Pact, and national reform programmes, under the Europe 2020 strategy. The European semester process provides us with a basis for developing a shared appreciation of the priorities for action at both EU and national levels, as we seek to return to a path of sustainable and job-creating growth. The main EU-level focus is on supporting the development and implementation of jointly agreed priorities, while the main focus at member state level is on restoring competitiveness and bringing about a stronger alignment of budget priorities, employment policies and structural reforms. The effective management of the processes involved in the European Semester 2013 is an important priority for our Presidency of the Council. The European Council this week will reinforce very strongly the five headline priorities of the annual growth survey, including in light of the Presidency Synthesis Report, which was presented by the Tánaiste to the General Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday of this week. This Synthesis Report reviews discussions on the annual growth survey across various formations of the Council and is firmly supportive of the annual growth survey's orientations for actions by member states supporting competitiveness, growth and jobs. This means pursuing differentiated, growth-friendly fiscal consolidation; restoring normal lending to the economy; promoting growth and competitiveness for now and into the future; tackling unemployment and the social consequences of the crisis; and modernising public administration. It is critical that we maintain the momentum behind national level reforms in these areas, underpinned by the goals of the Europe 2020 strategy - supporting growth that is smart, sustainable and inclusive. I expect that our discussions in Brussels will also be informed by the recent agreement by EPSCO Ministers on the principles of the youth guarantee. Getting consensus here was an important Presidency achievement and, as the House is aware, this deals with unemployment and employment process for young people in particular. While we work to put in place conditions necessary to support a general recovery in economic activity, we must also ensure responses from our education and training systems that are effective and appropriate to changing labour market conditions. This means supporting employability, including through new partnerships with the workplace. There are currently 7.5 million young people across Europe who are not in employment, education or training. This represents approximately 13% of our fellow Europeans, aged between 15 and 24. This is simply unacceptable. To deal with that the European Council must act urgently. It has been clearly shown that youth unemployment can have lifelong effects, and everybody knows this. That is why we need to grapple with this challenge now through the rapid implementation of the youth guarantee as a key vehicle for mobilising support in this area. The youth guarantee is but one step towards addressing this problem, and I intend to insist that we build on this first step. As the House is aware, the European Council put a figure of €6 billion into the MFF for youth employment and to deal with youth unemployment over the course of the period to 2020. The overall objective of the guarantee schemes is to provide young people with better prospects for their future by ensuring that supports are available to them to enter the labour market. While acknowledging that different member states face very different implementation issues, I expect that progress will be supported by the youth employment initiative of €6 billion which was endorsed by the Council in February. I look forward also to co-chairing the Tripartite Social Summit tomorrow morning in Brussels. This is an important meeting with social partners at EU level and will provide a welcome opportunity to discuss with representatives of trades unions and of business the central issues in meeting the challenges of recovery. We will also exchange views on the social dimension of EMU, including social dialogue. This week's European Council will also take stock of progress in implementing the compact for growth and jobs. This means, in particular, EU-level actions that will support the more country-specific orientations of the European semester process. Our Presidency results, in pressing ahead with the Single Market, will directly contribute to this debate. As holders of the Presidency, we are prioritising agreement on the key Single Market Act I files that are ready for delivery. We regard as essential priorities key files such as accounting, professional qualifications recognition, public procurement, posting of workers and e-identification and e-signature - some of these are quite complex. At the same time we are aiming for as much progress as possible on key Single Market Act II files, as these are published over coming months. I look forward to this week's meeting of leaders highlighting progress on the Single Market, as a concrete means of driving growth and job creation. Importantly, this year for the first time, we will have the monitoring of Single Market happening within the framework of the European semester process, and this is an important further step. I expect that we will also look at the idea of smart regulation, with a view to a reduction in the overall burden of regulation, particularly on SMEs, which lie at the heart of domestic demand and sustainable job creation. That is why for instance the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, is changing the situation here to provide that by the year end there will be one portal for application for licences in respect of doing business in Ireland in particular sectors. The financing needs of the real economy are a further crucial focus in terms of EU-level actions supporting growth and jobs. This means restoring normal lending conditions and unlocking productive and growth-enhancing investments. To this end, I expect the European Investment Bank, EIB, will continue to play a crucial role, especially as with the recent increase of €10 billion in the ElB's capital, and this will allow the bank to lend an extra €60 billion to support jobs and growth. This week's European Council will take stock of the ongoing work on the strengthening of the economic and monetary union, or EMU as it is referred to, which President Van Rompuy was tasked with following up on by leaders last December. President Van Rompuy and his office are currently conducting a process of broad consultation with a view to him presenting a road map, as it is called, to the June European Council. As holders of the Presidency, we are co-operating closely with President Van Rompuy in this work, including through the facilitation of discussion among Ministers across a range of relevant formations of the Council. It is true to say that as we take further steps to strengthen economic governance and EMU more generally, these will certainly need to be accompanied by steps aimed at strengthening democratic accountability and legitimacy. To ignore this issue, or to underestimate its importance, would weaken the exercise, but we must also be careful to ensure that as we move ahead we do so on the basis of recognised value being added. I do not believe in change for change's sake. We have achieved a lot to date but that must be put in place before we move ahead. Even more importantly, we must keep our people with us as we strengthen EMU. The European Council will return to these issues for a broader discussion at its meeting in June. This week's summit meeting will again address the important issue of an integrated financial framework - or banking union. The Irish Presidency is giving top priority to progressing the legislative files in this area. I am pleased to say that the Irish Presidency won broad political support at ECOFIN earlier this month for the compromise package reached with the European Parliament on the capital requirements directive, or CRD IV as it is referred to, and we will now work to iron out the remaining technical issues with a view to reaching a final agreement by the end of this month. That is an important advance in its own right. On the single supervisory mechanism, we are working intensively with the Parliament, with a view to finalising the legislative process here within the next few weeks. We are also working hard also to see the operational framework for the direct recapitalisation of banks by the ESM finalised by the end of our Presidency. Nationally, of course, this issue takes on particular significance for Ireland, given that it will also address the issue of the definition of what constitutes legacy assets. As Presidency, we are also striving to ensure that agreement is reached on the bank recovery and resolution directive and on the deposit guarantee scheme directive by the end of June. We look forward also to the submission by the Commission of a legislative proposal on a single resolution mechanism by this summer. The agreement last June to break the link between sovereign and banking debt was a watershed moment in the crisis. In December, we set ourselves ambitious timelines for achieving the various pieces of legislation that are necessary to underpin that commitment. We now need to keep the pressure up for delivery. We cannot afford either complacency or loss of momentum.Tomorrow night, following the European Council's working dinner session on the European semester and economic issues, the 17 euro area leaders will convene for a euro area summit meeting. The President of the ECB, Mario Draghi, will introduce the discussion on developments in the euro area. As well as considering those ongoing challenges, leaders will also adopt a set of rules of procedure for future euro area summits. We will complete our discussions of economic matters on Thursday evening. On Friday, the European Council will discuss the EU's strategic relationships, particularly its relationship with Russia. EU Foreign Affairs Ministers, including the Tánaiste, took part in a broad-ranging discussion on the relationship with Russia at the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday of this week and the key elements of that will inform our discussion. This is a timely opportunity to discuss this as there is a shared understanding in the EU of the need to fashion a stronger, more coherent approach to Russia, to the benefit of both sides. One of the key themes running through recent discussions on Russia has been the extent to which the EU and Russia work together, in terms of mutual trade and investment, in our energy relations and as partners in international fora, in the pursuit of peace and security. The simple facts are that the EU is Russia's largest trading partner and Russia is the EU's largest energy supplier. That is an important consideration given the global changes in energy sources and pricing. This relationship has been further enhanced by a complex institutional framework enabling both sides to engage in regular political dialogue - indeed Russia is the only partner with which the EU holds a summit in each Presidency. The EU and Russia also co-operate effectively on critical foreign policy issues, including Afghanistan, counter-terrorism and the Middle East peace process. As in any important relationship, however, there are issues where we see eye to eye and issues where our interests, and indeed the values that define those interests, can differ very much. The EU and its member states have in the past year expressed regret and concern about internal developments in Russia that have challenged the ambitions of those who would wish to see a further growth in political pluralism, and at the level of the individual, in personal freedom and freedom of expression. These concerns are also likely to be discussed at the European Council, including the challenge of how best to communicate these concerns to our Russian partners in a frank and constructive manner. In our Presidency, as a member of the Council, and nationally I intend to play a fully engaged and constructive part during the deliberations on each of the agenda points at this week's summit meeting. As I said at the beginning of this short contribution, a push on implementation will be an important outcome of this week's meeting. To date Ireland, and the officials working for Ireland, have achieved quite a deal. We would like to think that by the end of our Presidency in June we will have again delivered, as have all other governments who have held the Presidency, a really effective Presidency in the interests of this country and of the Union as a whole. I will, of course, report back to the House, when appropriate, after this meeting of the European Council.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	194	The agenda for this week's summit yet again lacks either the urgency or the ambition required to tackle the immense problems facing the citizens of Europe. Since the last summit growth has fallen and an even deeper recession has been confirmed. Over 26 million people are now registered as unemployed including a further rise in youth unemployment. Uncertainty has returned to the bond markets. The latest projections show that no significant recovery is on the cards across Europe. Yet the leaders of Europe are to hold a two day summit which will consider no new initiatives and will again endorse a strategy which has not worked and will not work. The items to be discussed, and the draft conclusions, reflect a group of leaders who appear to have given up trying to find a better way forward. They seem completely unwilling to do anything other than implement fiscal controls and hope that lower trade barriers will solve everything. It is an unbalanced agenda which refuses to address the urgent need for strong countries to try to stimulate growth. It is particularly surprising that the Irish Labour Party is quietly going along with an agenda which appears fully to satisfy only the British Conservative Party. Before and after every summit the Taoiseach comes into the Dáil to talk about how giant steps are being taken to promote growth and jobs. The detail never matches the rhetoric. No action being discussed at this summit is capable of making anything but a minor and probably distant impact on the economy. Over the past two years the Taoiseach has firmly established his reputation as the most partisan and tribal holder of his office. Every day in this House he responds to legitimate questions with snide political point scoring.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	198	Throughout 2011 he said that Ireland's problems were entirely its own fault. He went to Berlin and the strongest argument he could muster was that it would be a win for the whole team to help Ireland. By October last year he had finally started to recognise the role of the European Central Bank and EU-imposed policies in driving Ireland out of the bond market. On Monday he sought to ratchet this up a bit more. He could not help throwing in a few partisan digs and heaping praise on his Government. He even managed to keep a straight face when attacking a bank guarantee for which he voted and which he re-enacted twice as Taoiseach. He also ignored his own repayment of unguaranteed, unsecured bonds long after the European panic had died down. Many people were struck on Monday by the fact that the new sharper demand for relief comes from a Government which has spent most of the past month declaring that it has sorted out everything to do with bank debt. The speeches of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste about how they have closed a chapter on bank-related debt are now apparently forgotten. This ongoing inconsistency is not just confusing for the public but it gets in the way of Ireland achieving the scale of relief which the justice of its case deserves. In the debate on the promissory note deal I laid out a series of additional reliefs which Ireland deserves on the basis of being treated equally and in light of policies agreed after 2010. In the midst of the Government's euphoria my party welcomed the deal but pointed out major, in fact possibly more significant, issues which had not yet been dealt with. There is nowhere on the record a statement from the Government setting out all of the measures from which it believes Ireland should benefit. The Government has not yet published information covering more than the next two years' impact of the promissory note deal. We know what it means for long-term re-financing but the net interest cost to the State has not been outlined and is entirely subject to ECB intervention. There are several outstanding areas in which Ireland deserves further relief. Existing loans should be placed on the same duration and interest rates as those available to others. Last week the Government attempted to spin that it was delivering a breakthrough for Ireland. It quickly emerged that the EU is considering a deal which involves each of the bailout countries. There is no Ireland-specific initiative. The sustainability of current bailouts is crucial for market confidence for all eurozone countries. This should have been on this week's agenda. The ECB should return to Ireland all the profits it is making on the holding of Irish debt. It is making half a billion euro in profit on Irish bonds and this should be returned just as similar profits are being returned to Greece. The ECB should allow the Central Bank of Ireland to retain its new holding of Irish bonds to maturity. If these are sold as soon as possible, which is something elements of the ECB says it wants and has the power to demand, it will cost us €1 billion a year in lost interest. This would wipe out most of the benefit of the deal for our annual budget. We need to define legacy debts and the role of the European stability mechanism in returning funds to Ireland as a result of Ireland's role in supporting the euro currency when it took on board such substantial bank debt, particularly in the pillar banks. Taken together, these measures represent a large sum of money which would relieve pressures on services and struggling families. London was probably the worst place for the Taoiseach to go to open a new line of argument on Europe because of the attitude of the Conservative government to the Union. Its agenda is a destructive one which wants to strip Europe back to being merely a free market.It rejects the broader more progressive agenda of the Union which is vital for ordinary citizens. Britain has opted out of trying to help Europe through its crisis. A tough message in Berlin or Frankfurt would have been far more impressive. The principal decision which will be taken at the summit is to sign off on the latest part of the European semester. This process embodies the overall economic strategy of the Union. The draft conclusions confirm the idea that European leaders continue to believe that fiscal controls are the primary means for tackling the crisis. They are holding to this line in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. The only people who believe there is no need for anyone to cut their deficits are those who either ignore reality or are only interested in exploiting public suffering. There are many countries such as Ireland where the facts of deficit and debt levels mean that bringing down the deficit is an essential part of restoring confidence. Of course, there are many ways of doing this and our Government has chosen to do so in a way which is directly undermining public support for fiscal changes. However, the majority of member states do not face similar conditions. The co-ordinated and ongoing contraction of public spending is damaging the European economy. Common discipline has been adopted for dealing with deficits but no such common discipline has been adopted for badly needed stimulus. In recent weeks, a series of studies has confirmed that the pan-European fiscal contraction is not only driving down growth but also reducing government revenues and, thus, making it harder to hit deficit targets. The policies which the summit will re-confirm this week are directly damaging Europe and driving unemployment. The fiscal treaty contains provisions which allow budgetary adjustments over a longer period. For countries which have a sustainable debt situation, the lack of any proposed stimulus funding threatens to make the recession worse. The European Council President, Mr. Van Rompuy, has written to all EU leaders to ask that they use this summit to give an extra push to Single Market measures. He has said, as did the Taoiseach on Monday, that these proposals are core to delivering growth. Broadening and deepening the Single Market is in the best interests of Ireland because of our highly competitive sectors which will benefit. It may also help slightly increase the long-term growth trend of the Union as a whole. What it certainly is not, however, is a way of tackling the crisis at hand. There are no projections from any economic body showing these Single Market measures having a significant impact in the next few years. In light of this, it is wrong for the Government to be acting as if this is the way for Europe to tackle the crisis. It is much worse that the Government sounds as if it is signing up to the Tory agenda of reducing Europe to a free-trade area. This is the attitude which has led to a cut in the European Union's budget at a time when it badly needs an increase. It is also the attitude that means vital social and economic policies of the Union are being cut back. One cannot claim to have an agenda for growth when the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, and the Research Horizon 2020 budgets will be cut by over 10%. This summit is considering no urgent measures to help Europe's struggling regions. It is recommitting the Union to a narrow agenda, based solely on fiscal controls and encouraging trade. It will ignore the need for stimulus spending by those who can afford it. It will address none of the urgently needed structural reforms to the Union. This summit will be another missed opportunity and may, unfortunately, see European leaders waiting for the next crisis before snapping out of their growing complacency.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	204	Deputy Crowe might deal with this as he is better briefed on it than I am. As we hold the Presidency, it may give the Taoiseach an opportunity to negotiate for a better budget and one that deals with issues such as youth unemployment and other matters. Last week's Eurogroup finance Ministers meeting considered the use of the ESM, European Stability Mechanism, to recapitalise banks. It is nine months since the Eurogroup committed to separating banking sovereign debt. The Government told us then it was a game changer and a seismic shift. It appears little progress has been made since then and a number of deadlines have passed. We were originally told that the details would be worked out by October 2012. As the Taoiseach said earlier, however:The agreement last June to break the link between sovereign and banking debt was a watershed moment in the crisis. In December, we set ourselves ambitious timelines for achieving the various pieces of legislation necessary to underpin the commitment. We now need to keep the pressure up for delivery.Will this issue be discussed at the upcoming summit? Has the Irish Presidency made progress on what is a critical issue for people? Every day without retrospective recapitalisation of the Irish banks is another day when the people here carry the burden of failed banking policies. It is far from clear that any move to recapitalise Irish banks retrospectively is being discussed. On Monday in London, the Taoiseach was critical of how the policies imposed on this State by Frankfurt and Brussels compounded the mismanagement of the State under Fianna Fáil. The Taoiseach has been in office for two years and nearly €20 billion of the money given to the banks has been under his watch. How much of the €30 billion of the people's money which was given to the pillar banks by the Government and its predecessor will we get back? The Government told us that Ireland would be treated equally yet this issue seems not to be high on the Government's or EU's agenda. We always make a point of wishing the Taoiseach well before these summits. At this summit, he must insist that if the ESM is to be used to recapitalise banks, then it must apply to legacy debts. Any deal agreed on reform of CAP farm payments scheme must be equitable and fair. As negotiations on the reform of the single farm payment enter a crucial phase, there is an intense and widespread debate in the farming community. Despite some of the perceptions being created, there are substantial numbers of farmers who wish to see a move away from the current scheme to one which will ensure a fairer and more sustainable system for small to medium-sized producers. The perception among the many small to medium-sized producers is that the debate has been skewed in favour of larger producers who are in receipt of large payments. Over 80% of farmers receive an average payment of just over €5,000. Just 1.62% receive more than €50,000 but that accounts for over 10% of the total payments. There is, understandably, resentment regarding the perception that farmers on lower incomes and payments are in some way unproductive. However, as we all know and as applies to other aspects of the economy, the largest employers and providers on this island and in this State are the small and medium-sized enterprises. What are needed are fair and equitable proposals for the future of CAP. It is also vital that a viable scheme is introduced to encourage the transfer of land to younger farmers to aid future development of the sector. The recent horsemeat controversy is ongoing. Last night, another product had to be taken from a supermarket's shelves when it was found to contain traces of horsemeat. Thousands of processing jobs and farm livelihoods are dependent on the beef and food sector across this island and the EU.There is a need for proper traceability and labelling to prevent manufacturers cutting corners by importing inferior or totally different product than advertised. Falsely labelling a product as 100% Irish when it is not undermines the reputation of Irish food produce internationally. Another important point, which has not been ventilated well enough, is that this behaviour totally undermines the rights of consumers. This is a blatantly criminal effort to defraud consumers. Although the EU claims to have one of the most developed traceability systems in the world it is clear that this is a Europe-wide criminal scam and the systems in the processing sector are not 100% fit for purpose. Will this issue be dealt with at the Council meeting? Will the Taoiseach provide an update on what steps have been taken at a European level to deal with it? The EU heads of mission Jerusalem report was handed to EU Governments in January. I welcome the commitment given by the Taoiseach earlier this week to have the report dealt with under Ireland's EU Council Presidency. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the report will be raised at the forthcoming EU summit? The report suggests that Israel and Israeli settlements in east Jerusalem and the West Bank represent the greatest single threat to the two-state settlement. It finds Israeli policy to be systematic, deliberate and provocative and aimed at making it impossible for Jerusalem to become the capital of two states. Given our history of peace making and conflict resolution on this island there is a particular responsibility on the Government to raise these issues. If God spares us it will be June before we know it. We are half way through March and that leaves only April and May and then the Irish Presidency will end. It would be a total disaster if we did not use the Presidency to promote peace in the Middle East and to stand up for the rights of citizens there. It is hard to hear what I am saying when the Minister for Finance is talking.

Will the Taoiseach indicate whether the issue of the future composition of the European Parliament will be on the agenda? When does the Taoiseach foresee this issue being dealt with by the European Council? Under the proposals this State is set to lose one of its seats in the European Parliament. Has the Government taken action to protect this Irish seat or does it intend to do so? The French Government used its veto on the issue of a seat at the European Parliament. If the French are prepared to act in their national interest at the Council then why can the Taoiseach not take the modest step of vetoing the loss of an Irish seat at the European Parliament?
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	210	The Taoiseach is probably aware that the EU multi-annual financial framework has been overwhelmingly rejected by the European Parliament. The resolution rejected the Council's proposals on the MFF and it was carried by 506 votes in favour and 161 against. That represents a hefty majority against the Council's proposals. The unhappiness of most of the MEPs who have commented on the MFF has been common knowledge. Five of the six major political blocs in the European Parliament urged their members to vote against the passing of this regressive budget. Despite the fact that there was a good deal of pressure from many Governments on MEPs they came into the European Parliament today and rejected the proposal. The Council proposal would have meant that for the first time in 56 years the EU budget would have been cut. That would have made no sense. The main argument was that while the EU has continued to face into this crisis with its huge socioeconomic problems it is continuing to expand and it would make no sense to try to cut the budget for this period. The issue with the EU budget is not only the size of the expenditure but also what the money is used for. The proposal by the European Council did not change the overall structure of the budget. The Council missed a real opportunity to refocus the budget strategically to promote growth and jobs. The EU Parliament's rejection of the budget has presented the Taoiseach with a lifeline and an opportunity to renegotiate a better deal. It gives all leaders throughout Europe a fresh opportunity to consider this area. Rather than seeing it as a setback - many will maintain it is just that - I see it as an opportunity to reconsider the budget area and how we spend our money. Savings in administration would have been made under the proposed budget and I broadly welcome those, but one issue the budget did not touch was the waste involved in having two seats for the European Parliament, one each in Brussels and Strasbourg. Ending the monthly charade of decamping thousands of MEPs, officials, documents and so on from Brussels to Strasbourg in favour of a European Parliament with only one seat has the potential to save an estimated €200 million per year or €1.4 billion over the seven year period of the current budget. I cannot understand it. Will the Taoiseach indicate whether member states will include this change in any new budget arrangements? The reality is that the Council's budget was an austerity budget and would have locked the EU in austerity for the next seven years. It did not contain sufficient spending to boost investment in jobs and growth and it would have left member states starved of strategic investment in key areas. The Government has told us repeatedly that the No. 1 priority for EU leaders is jobs and growth. Does the Taoiseach not accept that the Council's proposed budget only set aside a limited budget investment for jobs and growth? The EU Parliament's rejection allows the Taoiseach to argue for greater investment in jobs and growth, something the EU desperately needs. I hope the Taoiseach takes the opportunity given to him by the EU Parliament and that he uses Ireland's EU Council Presidency to negotiate a pro-growth, pro-jobs progressive budget. The Taoiseach referred to the €6 billion EU youth guarantee agreed as part of the EU budget negotiations at the last Council meeting. While I welcome any attempt to tackle youth unemployment in the EU much remains unclear about the nature and enforceability of the guarantee. Throughout the EU 22% of people between the ages of 15 and 24 years are unemployed and more than 30% of these have been unemployed for more than 12 consecutive months. Youth unemployment is one of the greatest socioeconomic problems the EU is facing and it must implement programmes to solve it. One of the greatest problems we are facing is the lack of hope throughout Europe and addressing this problem must be part of any package. The EU youth guarantee must be funded rather than simply a call on member states to make better use of the European Social Fund. Often, many young workers can only access precarious, temporary jobs or traineeships which offer little prospect of career progression. Youth policy needs to be more than recognised and visible; it must be robust and measurable. Action on this issue must address inequality in society and existing structural and systemic failures. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the guarantee will ensure that every person under 25 years of age in the EU will have access to and the right to qualified, adequately-paid stable employment and some sort of job security? Will they have a training or educational placement that will genuinely improve their chances and career prospects? Will there be operational programmes for young apprentices to enable them to finish training and begin fully-qualified work in their trades? We are seeking practical measures. I genuinely hope the youth guarantee effectively tackles the youth unemployment problem in Ireland and the EU. Does the Government have any plans to tackle youth unemployment crisis here before the youth guarantee becomes operational? That is the big question to which people at home seek an answer. What exactly will be introduced to break the cycle of youth unemployment?

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	212	I was in the City of London on Monday, where I met a number of prominent city people who asked me if I had come over with the Taoiseach who was in the Mansion House. They were not aware of the niceties of Irish politics. I told them I had not been invited to accompany the Taoiseach because I was not part of that cabal - I did not use that word. The Taoiseach will be interested to hear that they gave a eulogy about how well he was doing with the economy. Their analysis of what was happening here was very favourable. Although it was somewhat superficial, I let it go because I think it improper to express my own political opinions outside the country. Ireland is in a difficult position in Europe because of the extraordinary approval given to the Taoiseach and Government policy outside the country. I suspect this approval is swallowed a little too eagerly by the Government, but it is not the approval those at home necessarily consider to be worthwhile. There is a disconnect between Christine Lagarde, Angela Merkel and others who heap praise on the Government and the people who are suffering from its policies. The Taoiseach should use the opportunity provided by the summit in Brussels to tell them all is not rosy in the garden and that they have a misconceived and rather flattering picture of what is happening in Ireland. It is time they woke up to the fact that issues are emerging in this county which threaten to undo much of what the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance would describe as their good work and progress. It is an analysis with which I would not necessarily agree, but they should use it to their advantage nonetheless. The Taoiseach should remind the European Union that it has a responsibility to come to the rescue of Irish banks which are still in deep trouble. The claim that somehow the banks are on the trail to recovery is not accurate. Later today the Taoiseach will launch a programme on mortgage arrears. This train is coming down the tracks and an accident waiting to happen, as the extent of the problem has not been acknowledged. He rightly blames the Opposition for its disastrous economic legacy, but his Government has sat on the mortgage arrears problem ever since it took power. In 2009 approximately 17,500 mortgages were in arrears. That figure now stands at 180,000. What the Taoiseach and Ministers describe as their restructuring efforts have failed abysmally. Half of the mortgages that have been restructured are already in arrears. He needs to tell the European Union that we are in deep trouble with these arrears, instead of saying we are going to solve the problem by ourselves. The European Union has a responsibility because its banks lent the money that was lent on for these mortgages. He must get the Union to recognise this problem. The ESM must be used to recapitalise the banks because it is certain they will be looking for recapitalisation sooner or later in the light of the failure of the Government and the banks - they are in it together - to recognise the existence of mortgage arrears which will never be paid and cannot be paid. Pretending that the problem will be solved by more of the same failed policies will not work. If the Taoiseach can get the Union to recognise the need to write down and write off debts and for the banks to make proper provision for the bad debts that result from these mortgage arrears, he will have done a great service. The banks will need recapitalisation at some point, but that is the taboo we are refusing to tackle. If the Taoiseach tells our European colleagues that we are in trouble and will need recapitalisation because the banks' books do not recognise the debts, he will do us a favour. He should say to the European Union that all is not rosy here. We need its help and ESM money because there will be recapitalisation down the road.

They are littered with fine phrases about jobs, economic growth and returning to normal lending, but the reality experienced by people is one of deepening stagnation in the European and Irish economies and the persistence of the scourge of mass unemployment. The fact that 26 million people are unemployed across Europe, of whom 7 million are young people, is a stinging indictment of the failure of EU governments. It is a tragic waste of human resources and potential. The European Union has failed to make even the slightest dent on this most important of issues. The policy of debt and deficit reduction through slashing incomes and public expenditure has failed. The policy of bailing out private banks at all costs has not led to renewed or normalised lending to SMEs or the economy in general. In Ireland the policy of putting €64 billion of our money into the banks has not led to any meaningful action on the crisis in mortgage arrears which is causing suffering and anxiety in 180,000 households and placing a suffocating dead weight on the economy. Unless we deal with this problem, there will be no chance of meaningful economic recovery. The Government and Europe's leaders are hopelessly addicted to failed policies and the neoliberal dogma that by cutting public spending and incomes, the markets will eventually come charging over the hill to rescue us. They are hostages to Europe's banks and multinationals. Either they do not realise this or they will not admit it. We will not achieve growth or employment, unless we have investment. Since the height of the boom, investment in the State has dropped by 70% and it is not recovering, despite the Government's episodic announcements about this or that project. The overall level of investment has collapsed and unless we reverse that collapse, there will not be meaningful economic recovery. This pattern is becoming evident across Europe and spreading to its heart.As parties in government who have long been committed to the European project, Fine Gael and the Labour Party should consider that their beloved Union is now threatened with break-up because of its failure to deal with these issues. It should be a major cause for concern to those committed to the European project that one country is considering pulling out. God knows, if there was a referendum in Britain, it is very likely the British people would pull out, particularly given the malaise that now exists in Europe.

The payment of billions of euro in debt every year by taxpayers is crucifying families in this country, particularly low- and middle-income families. This debt is not the debt of the people. We are not and were not responsible for it and we should not be asked to pay it. It is the responsibility of the banks, bankers and bondholders. At the forthcoming Council meeting, the Taoiseach must demand a write-down or mutualisation of that debt, because while that debt hangs over us the economy will continue to struggle and recession will deepen. One of the headings for the Council meeting is the implementation of strategies already agreed. These are strategies of austerity and cuts, but that policy has failed and is deepening and prolonging the recession. This morning, I got a letter from the Mandate union which describes the situation in just a few sentences. The letter states that the recent job loss announcements and closures of B&Q, HMV, La Senza, Monsoon and Superquinn, to name but a few, are just the tip of the iceberg, that the reality in retail is that the whole sector is in crisis, with many companies, large and small, teetering on the edge of survival, and that the sector is suffering from a severe lack of purchasing power among consumers. This is the result of the policy of extracting billions of euro from the economy, which has put our domestic economy in huge difficulty. It has created a situation in which we have 430,000 people unemployed - over 14% of the workforce - of whom 60% are long-term unemployed. We have 27% youth unemployment and huge levels of emigration. The policy of cutbacks, austerity and the extraction of billions from the economy must stop. We must turn to a policy of stimulus and growth under which jobs can be created. Another matter the Taoiseach should address at the Council meeting is the issue of reduced support payments for redundant workers. This is relevant in the context of the multi-annual financial framework or budget, which the European Parliament has refused to pass. That budget proposed a reduction from €3.57 billion to €1.05 billion, a reduction of €2.5 billion or two-thirds, in support payments for workers who have become redundant, workers such as those from Dell, SR Technics, Waterford Crystal and Abbott Ireland, which suffered 400 job losses in the recent past. This fund has been hugely reduced. The Taoiseach must ensure that cut is reversed and that the fund is topped up to ensure there are reasonable and sufficient supports for redundant workers.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	230	I thank the Deputies who have contributed to this debate. As the Taoiseach said at the outset, the European Council will have an important focus on implementation. Shining a light on the ongoing need for implementation of the many measures which have already been agreed at EU level will represent an important outcome for Ireland and for the Union as a whole. In preparation for this week's meeting, I chaired a meeting of the General Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday. I assure the House that there is a shared commitment around the table to finding the right way forward and maintaining our commitment to getting public finances back onto a sustainable path while also providing space for the generation of growth and creation of jobs. This question is as vital for the Union and for the euro area as it is here at home. Getting the balance right will be at the heart of discussions at the European Council. In my discussions ahead of the meeting, including with President Van Rompuy, I have stressed that during our Presidency we are absolutely committed to this task. We are making good headway, for example, on the youth guarantee, on the banking union package, which is vital for stability, and on Single Market files, which have a real contribution to make, and we will keep the pressure up throughout our term. No lengthy debates about process and targets can substitute for concrete steps taken in the interests of our citizens, who need to be reassured that the compact for jobs and growth we agreed last June will make a difference. That is why the Irish Presidency is so dedicated to the agenda of stability, jobs and growth. In each discussion this week in Brussels, that objective will be at the heart of the Irish contribution. This meeting of the European Council will see a conclusion to the first phase of this year's European semester. During our Presidency, Ireland has been strongly committed to ensuring its effective implementation. The semester is about steadying the economies of the EU member states, identifying where challenges are emerging and, most important of all, strengthening our response to challenges, including through structural reforms and increases in competitiveness, both of which will generate growth and jobs. To this end, we prepared a comprehensive Presidency synthesis report of discussions on the annual growth survey across a range of Council formations. I presented this report to Ministers at the General Affairs Council in Brussels on Monday of this week and I am happy to say it was very well received. It is a good piece of work and points the way forward. The synthesis report clearly reinforces the priorities previously identified by the Commission, namely, fiscal consolidation, restoration of lending, promotion of growth, dealing with unemployment and modernisation of public administration. The outcome from this week's meeting should provide member states with useful guidance as they prepare stability programme updates under the Stability and Growth Pact and national reform programmes under the Europe 2020 strategy. It was clear from last year's lessons-learned exercise that the European semester should be an open and inclusive process, supporting meaningful engagement with parliaments and all relevant stakeholders at European and national levels. It is therefore appropriate that I acknowledge the work of our Oireachtas committees on finance and European Union affairs on the issue of enhanced parliamentary involvement in the European semester processes. I refer in particular to the COSAC meetings of parliamentarians from across Europe. This is further to the Ceann Comhairle's contribution to the European Parliament's Parliamentary Week of the European Semester at the end of January. These are important contributions to a key debate. Stronger economic governance arrangements need to be supported by stronger democratic legitimacy and accountability.This is an essential requirement, rather than an optional extra. I expect that leaders will reflect this point in their conclusions this week. I welcome the fact that the spring European Council will give specific emphasis to addressing unemployment, especially youth unemployment, which is undoubtedly the most pressing and urgent social challenge facing the EU today. This is a battle we have to win. The focus that will be given by leaders at this week's meeting is a close reflection of the priority the Government assigns to confronting the issue in Ireland. The breakthrough at the end of last month, when agreement on the youth guarantee was brokered at Council level by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, as she chaired the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council, sent a positive and most welcome signal that the Union is committed to realising the commitments previously made to address this issue. In conjunction with the youth employment initiative and the additional funds secured during the negotiations on the multi-annual financial framework, I am confident that the youth guarantee will make a real difference to the job prospects and lives of many younger people. They deserve nothing less. It is important that this week's meeting will focus on making a reality of the unrealised full potential of the Single Market through the timely implementation of the Single Market Act I measures and the Single Market Act II proposals, when they have all been made available by the Commission. Similarly, I look forward to leaders highlighting the considerable potential that lies in smart regulation. Reducing the regulatory burden, especially on our small and medium-sized enterprises, should provide a competitiveness boost and enhance the potential for job-rich growth. The European Council will return in June to consider in detail President Van Rompuy's roadmap on four potential elements aimed at strengthening Economic and Monetary Union. I expect that leaders will highlight the need for steps towards deepening integration to be measured so they can actually add value and be accompanied by an equal commitment to strengthening democratic accountability and legitimacy. Ireland, as the holder of the EU Presidency, is working closely with President Van Rompuy to facilitate discussions among Ministers across a range of Council formations. I warmly welcome the continued focus by the European Council on the delivery and implementation of the various measures which constitute banking union, including the single supervisory mechanism. The discussion that leaders will have at the European Council on the Union's strategic partnership with Russia is welcome and timely. The critical importance of the EU's relationship with Russia is borne out by the simple fact that the EU is Russia's largest trading partner and Russia is the EU's largest energy supplier. Beyond our mutual trade and investment, which are critically important for our economies and our citizens' welfare, the EU and Russia co-operate effectively in many international foreign policy areas in the pursuit of peace and security. I know from my work last year as OSCE Chairperson-in-Office and from my meetings with the Russian foreign Minister, Mr. Lavrov, that Russia plays a vital role on many issues by using its status as a permanent member of the Security Council and drawing on its extensive diplomatic experience and outreach. These issues include the protracted and delicate mediation with Iran to persuade it to abandon its nuclear ambitions, and the fight against terrorism. At the same time, there are some divergences in values. The EU needs to use the platform of its relationship with Russia to communicate its concerns about a number of recent developments, including those which relate to human rights. This week's discussion at the European Council will be an important one in that context. There will not be written conclusions on this issue. This should encourage the free-flowing and frank exchange that these issues merit.

No guillotine was needed because we got through our business ahead of time. I acknowledge the manner in which the debate was approached by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and their officials. We had a good session on Committee Stage. We got a feel for each other's positions on various issues. None the less, I have chosen to elevate a small number of issues for Report Stage debate because they need to be debated on the floor of the House. Amendment No. 1 relates to the proposal in the Finance Bill to tax maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and health and safety benefit in the same way that all other income is taxed. We debated this issue at some length on Committee Stage last week. When the Tánaiste took Leaders' Questions last Thursday, he gave the clear impression that this measure will not result in a reduction in people's incomes. I was annoyed because it was quite misleading. He said on a number of occasions "There is no reduction in income". He gave the example of a woman who continues to be paid by her employer during the course of her maternity benefit. It is true to say that after this change is made, women in the limited circumstances highlighted in the Tánaiste's example will not be any worse off, based on a comparison between what they earned while they were working and what they will receive when maternity benefit is taxed in the normal way similarly to the remainder of their salaries. Women in a small number of cases will be worse off, however, because they will not receive the bonus they would have received until now by virtue of the non-taxation of maternity benefit. That is just a small part of the picture, however. It was misleading of the Tánaiste to make those comments without giving the full facts. The bottom line is that the Department of Finance has estimated that a yield of €40 million will accrue from this change in a full year. Where will that €40 million come from? It will come from the pockets of pregnant women. That is the bottom line. In some circumstances, a woman will have used up her tax credits and her lower-rate band during the months she worked before she went on maternity leave, or she could use them up after she returns from maternity leave. I accept that will not happen in every case. It could also happen that the woman's partner or spouse will use her available credits and her lower-rate band and, as a consequence, her maternity benefit will be taxed in full. Some women who would otherwise have received maternity benefit of €262 per week will now receive maternity benefit that is reduced by €107 per week. I acknowledge that this will not happen in every case, but some women will be affected in this way. They will lose €2,800 over the course of their six months of paid maternity benefit. It is important to put those facts on the record because last Thursday's debate was misleading. Anyone who followed it would have formed the clear impression that no woman will be any worse off as a result of this change. That is simply not the case. Some women will lose the bonus they gained by virtue of the non-taxation of maternity benefit.I do not believe there is any objection among most Members of this House to deal with that issue but there will be other cases where women will lose out to the tune of €107 per week, or €2,800 over the course of the six-month maternity benefit. I know the Minister is not for turning on this issue. I wanted to put on the record that those are the consequences for some people and to, in a fair way, point out that some are affected very severely by this while others will not be affected as severely. I repeat what I said on Committee Stage last week, namely, this is a tax on pregnancy and it will affect women during a very important time in their lives, when they are bringing life into this world and should be given every possible support. The Government will say it is aligning this with the taxation of other forms of social welfare but, as I pointed out last week, there continues to be a number of social welfare heads that are not subject to income tax whereas this one will now be. It will have an affect. At the end of the day, it is €40 million out of the pockets of pregnant women. Let us call it what it is and not try to dress it up in any way that would mislead people.

Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire. Tá a fhios agam gur éist sé le cúpla des na pointí a chuir mé cun tosaigh agus tá súil agam go bhfeicfimid dul chun cinn ansin níos moille sa bhliain. Tá cúpla pointe a ardóidh mé féin le linn na Tuarascála. Níl mé chun dul tríd na pointí uilig atá pléite go dtí seo. Tá siad pléite go maith ó tugadh an cháinaisnéis isteach i Mí na Nollag. We are not going to exhaust the debate we have had since the first week in December, when the budget was introduced. We debated many of these issues in the resolutions on budget night and have debated them in the media and in this House in the intervening period, including on Second Stage of the Bill. The Committee Stage debate was good and useful, despite the fact many of the amendments and changes of direction my party asked the Minister to consider have been rejected. Like the previous speaker, however, I believe there are a number of key issues that need to be addressed on Report Stage. I recognise this is an issue on which the Minister will not budge. Nonetheless, it is important that we put down a marker. The taxation of maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and health and safety benefit is a cruel cut. That is what it is - it is a cut to pregnant women and a tax on childbirth. At the end of the day, we have to realise this State provides very little to pregnant women and newborn babies. We all know, as I know personally, the costs many families have to face in regard to a newborn child, for example, the cost of a cot, a car seat, a feeding seat, nappies, clothes and all of the additional costs people have to bear. Having maternity benefit exempt from taxation allowed, in some circumstances, that those who were pregnant and had a child had additional income to meet some of those costs, although it was not universal or across the board and depended on one's employment and tax situation. The reality, as the Minister well knows, is that it will now be a question for many women of when they fell pregnant. If they have their child before a certain date, they have the benefit of maternity benefit that is exempt from tax. However, if the child is born after a certain date, many people will pay tax on maternity benefit at the higher rate of 41%. For a single person who has a child after the date prescribed in this legislation and who is earning, say, €33,000, which is under the average industrial wage, this means her maternity benefit will now be taxed and she will lose out to the tune of €2,792.92. There are very few measures in the Finance Bill that have this deep an impact on individuals. We have discussed at length in this House the local property tax, which will be a huge burden on many individuals and families across the State, and the letters have started rolling out in recent days. Yet, that will not reach anywhere near this type of figure. Many women who are carrying a child in their womb will lose out, and they know the passing of this legislation today means they will see a reduction of €2,792 in the income they expected to have prior to the Minister's announcement. That is simply unfair. I do not believe we should tax maternity benefit. This State does not provide enough for expectant mothers and newborn children. This has been a very small gesture to compensate some women, although I recognise not all are able to benefit because they may not be in employment or their employers may not continue to pay them when they are on leave. However, for those who are in that situation, it is not fair to take this from them. I oppose section 8 and I support the amendment.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	235	Likewise, as I indicated on Committee Stage, I oppose this move to tax maternity benefit. In the various comments from the Minister and Government spokespersons when this issue was first highlighted, the defence put up was to suggest this was a significant anomaly where, if people were on maternity leave, they would end up with more than if they had stayed at work. The problem lies in the way that is put because, of course, when a woman is on maternity leave, she is at work. She is doing additional work, and it is additional work that benefits our society and our economy. Frankly, women are not sufficiently acknowledged for the role and contribution they make to our entire society and economy as a result of their role in bringing up children. We need more acknowledgement of that role and contribution, not less. I have no problem with women who are on maternity leave getting a bonus for giving birth to children and rearing those children in their early weeks and months. Indeed, I believe all women should get such a bonus and they should be recognised for the additional work they are doing for the whole of society, particularly when they work and then have to play this role as well. I do not believe this is acceptable. It is a cruel, anti-woman, anti-family and anti-child cut. Even at this stage, the Minister should row back on it. We have so often heard from the Government fine words about children and families, and the esteem in which the Government holds them, but we then see a measure such as this, which will penalise women and reduce a small extra acknowledgment of the important role they play in our society. I hope the Minister will row back on this, although he has indicated he will not.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	236	I draw attention to the supports other countries put in place, particularly the more enlightened countries in the northern hemisphere such as the Nordic countries. These countries look at the replacement of population and solidarity across generations because we need to replace our population if we are to afford to cater for our aging population. There appears to be evidence that many people are delaying having children. Income plays a sizeable part in that decision, but there are consequences arising from that delay. Often it is a riskier time for women, as the ideal time to have a first child is when one is in one's mid-20s. We must look at this issue in the round and not introduce economic measures that produce less desirable scenarios not just found in the economic area. For that reason, selecting a particular group sends a very bad signal. We do not have very large families anymore. It only happens for a very short period of time in somebody's working life. This measure is the wrong way to go.

To reduce it to fiscal algebra or arithmetic is a backwards step. Motherhood is a wonderful role which society can endorse and support through maintaining maternity benefit.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	238	We had a long debate on this issue on Committee Stage and I thank Deputies Michael McGrath and Pearse Doherty for acknowledging that we had a very good Committee Stage debate in which matters were discussed very thoroughly. I thank the Deputies who participated because one needs two sides to get a good debate going. It was a very interesting and helpful debate. However, there is a tendency in such debates for the Opposition to always concentrate on the individual, which is fair enough, but the individual can only be aided in terms of tax breaks and social welfare benefits at the expense of the generality of taxpayers. It is my job to look at this generality. Deputy Michael McGrath has pointed out, rightly, that the full year yield of this measure is €40 million. We are phasing it out, but as the benefit is not being taxed until mid-year, the real effect will be felt in a full year. If we do not reduce the imposition, that €40 million will fall on to be met by other taxpayers - the poorest of the poor, as well the richest of the rich. The taxes paid by way of VAT and excise duties by people who do not even have an income tax liability go into the pool of taxes from which the funding for measures such as this come. It is not enough to argue all the time about the individual benefit, fly the flag for motherhood and say this is a dreadful imposition. One must look at what is happening across the board also. It would be great if we were living in the virtuous society to which Deputy Peter Mathews aspires where we could make our decisions without any acknowledgement of the fiscal consequences, but the hard facts are that one person's relief is another person's tax. We must always approach these issues to see whether we can achieve the best balance.  During the good years when the barns were being filled with wheat, as they were before the plagues in Egypt, many very generous measures were brought forward and at the time they were justified. We all supported them and they were a good idea, but there are some we can no longer afford. We are in a position where hard choices must be made. We see the Minister for Social Protection having to reduce the respite care grant for carers, at a total cost of €26 million. Not taxing what is an additional benefit for women on maternity leave adds up to €40 million. These are the choices that we are faced with and we must make the choice.  The Opposition would be right if there was not already much support provided in the tax system for pregnant women and children. Generous entitlements to paid maternity leave were increased to 26 weeks on 1 March 2007. Additional entitlements to unpaid maternity leave are also available, increased to 16 weeks from 1 March 2007. We are all familiar with child benefit payments and family income supplement is available to families on low pay. The one parent family payment is available, while the one parent family tax credit of €1,650 is payable to any single person with a child under 18 or over 18 years who is in full-time education or permanently incapacitated. Our benefits compare quite well to those available in many European countries. The duration of maternity leave is 26 weeks, or one half of the year. In Belgium, it is 15 weeks; in Denmark, 18 weeks; in France, 16 weeks; in Germany, 14 weeks; in Italy, 20 weeks; in the Netherlands, 16 weeks; and in Spain, 16 weeks. Compared to most other countries, about an additional ten weeks maternity leave is given in Ireland.  Deputies are all aware of how the payment works. The minimum payment is €217.80, while the maximum payment is €262 per week, but 90% of recipients receive €262 per week. For example, a schoolteacher on maternity leave has the same take-home pay in or out of work because her salary is deducted by €262 and replaced by €262 in maternity benefit. An anomaly arises in the sense that when she was in receipt of the €262 in her salary, it was taxed, but when she receives it in maternity benefit, it is not. We are removing that anomaly because persons in these circumstances have higher take-home pay than they would otherwise.  Deputy Michael McGrath is right in that there are other cases in which one can show losses. It is complicated because for some the losses are made up by having a tax credit; therefore, if someone is out of work for one half of the year, in many cases, they will not have used up their tax credits which will balance the maternity benefit payment.  Overall, there is a saving to the Exchequer in a full year of €40 million, but it is a question of choices. It is not free in the sense that the figure of €40 million comes from other taxpayers and if I do not get it in this case, I will have to get from somewhere else. Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett would have no problem in finding it. He will tell me to tax the rich. I have been searching for the small group of extraordinarily rich people who would pay all of our bills without making any imposition on anybody else if only we could find and tax them. We have been looking for two years and not found them.On the balance of judgment, this is a fair scheme and measure.

We can be proud that this is one of the countries leading the way on the issue of treating women well when they are pregnant and giving birth. The Minister has stated this change will yield €40 million in a full year. Is there any estimate of how much would be saved if, what the Minister terms, the loophole was closed to ensure that, as he spelled out in his reply to Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly's amendment, women would be no better off as a result of receiving maternity benefit for six months? Are figures available for the numbers of women who are paid in full by their employers while on maternity leave as against those who are not? The public sector scheme is a generous one and women continue to be paid, by and large. However, in the private sector the position varies significantly. The vast majority of small and medium enterprises, for example, cannot afford to continue to pay women their salaries while on maternity leave. Is there any estimate of how much of the €40 million would be saved if the change was restricted to ensuring women who are paid their salaries while on maternity leave would not benefit from this bonus, or this anomaly, as the Minister terms it?

We are discussing whether to tax a social welfare benefit. In deciding that it would only be taxed in the case of some recipients and not taxed in the case of others - not so much on the basis of income but on how their employers treated them - one would be in a very thin legal position in which to make that differentiation. We are in a position where it can be either taxed or not taxed and I have decided to tax it.

This measure is far from fair. There are other options the Minister should consider to save €40 million and which have been presented to him by our party and others. He referred to the period of 26 weeks paid leave, but I point out to him that if this section was not enacted, women to whom I referred on maternity leave after 1 July this year would be the beneficiaries of €2,792. He has reduced their paid maternity leave from 26 weeks to 15. Instead of being paid €262 a week for 26 weeks, maternity benefit will be paid for 15 weeks. This is far from fair. I know I have to be brief, but we have made our point and I oppose the section, as there are other ways to save €40 million. This benefit is also for the newborn child who depends on his or her mother for everything. The benefit should be universal. There are some things in life that should be available to everybody, regardless of income, although I acknowledge this may throw up anomalies. Sinn Féin does not believe in the taxation of child benefit, even for the super-wealthy; rather, it believes they should pay their appropriate part in direct taxation. That is the best way to deal with this issue. Maternity benefit is particular to women and we have been given an insight into the lack of their influence at Cabinet level by the fact that this proposal has made it this far.

His defence for this move to effectively cut maternity benefit does not recognise the contribution and role of women in society as a whole and the economy. When he argues that we have to make fiscal choices, he is implying that there is fiscal rectitude and proper fiscal management, on the one hand, while, on the other, there is a giveaway to women who are having children. He argues that even though we might like to be able to do it, we cannot really afford it and that it is not in the interests of the economy. The point we are making - a point also made by Deputies Peter Mathews and Catherine Murphy - is that women are making a very significant - I would describe it as unparalleled - contribution to the economy in bringing up children. The Minister might consider that many countries in Europe such as Germany, for example, have real problems with an ageing population. That will be an economic problem. Therefore, encouraging, rewarding, incentivising and supporting women who make the choice to have children - in addition to working in other sectors of the economy - is a positive measure which is good for society and the economy as a whole. It is a false argument to set one against the other, as it is not a case of the individual against the rest of society. In fact, these individual women are making a very valuable contribution. In some ways, the Minister's attitude sums up an ideological view that sees human beings as being in some way a burden on the economy, that the more we have, the more burdensome they become and that we cannot really afford this burden. That is a view which sees things completely the wrong way around. Those who generate wealth and economic activity are these very human beings. The idea that people should not be fully supported and that role should not be fully acknowledged is wrong, even in difficult economic circumstances. This is a mistaken cut which must also be viewed in the round, with the cuts to child benefit and the cuts affecting lone parents. These cuts have all hit women who are having and bringing up children. At least let us be fully honest when debating alternatives. The Government endlessly repeats that there is no pot of gold. I am not saying there is, although some gold was discovered in County Wicklow recently which we should investigate.

The economic cost of an oil spill in the bay would be far greater than the cost of any benefit we might receive. In any case, we would not receive the same benefit as the private multinationals. The Minister has alternative proposals which have been put to him by various Members. As I pointed out to him, responses from his own Department indicate that 108,000 people - the top 5% of earners - are earning over €100,000 a year, with average earnings of €185,000. On average, they are paying an effective tax rate of 36%.

Like Deputy Pearse Doherty, I proved this in my own life because I have quite a large family. Deputy Boyd Barrett can rest easy because we do not have a big problem in that regard. His definition of wealth being an income of €100,000 is rather undermined by his claim that the average tax take on that amount is only 36%. Even if one subtracts the 36% from €100,000, it means that the very wealthy people to whom the Deputy refers still have €64,000. That is their net take home pay. Does he propose to take hundreds of millions of euro more from them? If one uses net rather than gross figures, the picture is slightly different.

There are large numbers of women in the group that is going to have to come up with the €40 million. Many of those women are poor and they will be obliged to pay for this out of their family budgets. Choices must be made. In our wider family and in our circle of friends, we can all identify young pregnant women or young married women who plan to have children in the future which this may affect. We can identify with the individual and the personal. However, there are other women who are anonymous and frequently poorer than those in receipt of benefits and who must pay the relevant amount in tax. One can say that this is all right because only €40 million is involved. Such amounts all add up, however. We continue to spend significantly more than we raise in taxes. The Government's job, among other things, is to reduce the gap between the two. A series of difficult choices must be made in order to get us there. Those choices involve increasing taxes, as in this case, or reducing expenditure, as in many others. They are difficult choices and we are engaged in making them. Deputy Boyd Barrett can disagree with what is proposed but if he does so, there is an obligation on him to inform me from where I might obtain the €40 million.

Those of us who sat on the Opposition side of the House have had the same experience as him on many occasions. The purpose of the exercise should be to try to do the best we can by way of research.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	268	I move amendment No. 3:In page 23, between lines 7 and 8, to insert the following: "17.—The Minister for Finance shall, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the provision of early access to pension benefits in certain limited circumstances including employer paid contributions, regular employee contributions, self-employed personal pensions and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts.".We discussed the issue to which this amendment relates on Committee Stage. I thank the Minister's officials for circulating his speaking note for Committee Stage, which was quite useful. I will certainly seek a copy of the report that was brought to the Economic Management Council, EMC, in September 2011. The ad hoc group responsible for compiling the report, which was chaired by the Department of Social Protection, recommended that pension savings being locked away until pension age should be maintained. In his speaking note, the Minister also indicated that an OECD report on this issue is currently being compiled. We will await the findings that will be contained in that report. I am trying to establish Government policy in respect of this matter. A particular decision was made in the context of the budget and an initiative has been taken in respect of certain AVCs. However, the latter is quite restrictive. Is it Government policy that it would not be wise to grant employees or self-employed persons further access to pension funds which goes beyond the scope of what the Minister is proposing in this Bill and as announced in the budget? Is it the case that the Government is giving this a go and that it is not prepared to move any further at this point? Is the reason for this that the Government is in possession of a report which indicates that the State could be exposed to additional liabilities in the future if people's pension provisions were eroded by them accessing their funds early?

I am concerned about some of the aspects of the relevant section. As stated on the earlier amendment, the universal social charge, USC, will not apply and, therefore, people with AVCs are not the poorest in society. These individuals have pensions and they have been able to top them up from their incomes. Basically, the Minister is not applying USC to these individuals and they are obtaining a benefit as a result. There is a major issue relating to pensions which must be examined. I have no objection to amendments Nos. 3 and 4, which basically call for the laying of reports before the House. However, I am not committed to supporting them in the context of the direction they propose we should take. This entire issue must be examined. The more consideration we give to pensions, the better. I am of the view that there has been wholesale abuse of the taxation code in the context of pension reliefs. I spelt out specific examples in this regard on Committee Stage. As the Minister stated, for every tax relief of which a person avails, someone else must pay tax. Studies relating to pension tax reliefs indicate that 80% of such reliefs go to the top 20% of earners in society. We are not talking about €40 million in this regard, we are talking about something in excess of €500 million. That is a massive amount of money. We cannot justify the continuation of these tax reliefs into the future. The Government is moving in the right direction but is doing so far too slowly. I have a number of concerns regarding what it is doing but we will debate those in respect of later amendments. The reports that are being sought in amendments Nos. 3 and 4 would be welcome. The more information we have at our disposal the better.

It proposes the preparation of a report for the House in respect of pre-retirement access to all forms of pension savings in certain unspecified circumstances. What I have done, following quite an amount of consideration, has been measured. I outlined my concerns with regard to this matter on Committee Stage. I do not intend to return to this area of pension law during the remainder of the lifetime of the Government. I do not want to create any expectation to the effect that a more generous scheme might be introduced in next year's finance Bill. That will not happen. If I was to raise such an expectation, people who want to access AVCs might wait until next year to do so. If, on the other hand, I stated that it was going to be more restrictive next year, it would have the opposite effect and there would be a rush to access them.I do not want either to incentivise or disincentivise and saying that I will go back into this next year would have an effect one way or the other. This was done after careful consideration, and it will stand.  On Deputy Doherty's point about the tax forgone, that is precisely why I made the announcements at budget time that tax relief on pension contributions would only apply in future to pensions valued at €60,000 or less. I gave notice of that because it requires not only tax law but pension law to be changed. That will have the effect of achieving significant savings in the coming years as contributions are no longer incentivised through the tax system for very large pensions. In the meantime, and in parallel, the Minister for Social Protection is also examining the generality of pension provision. There is quite a good deal in play already on the pensions front. I have set up a cross-departmental committee to examine my piece of it to ensure that the restrictions I announced in the budget will take effect from 1 January next year. It is quite severe, as the Deputy knows.  The Deputy will be familiar with the calculation of public service pensions. A pension of €60,000 would be based on 50% - I think 40 80ths is the correct calculation - of a salary of €120,000. In effect it means that once one's salary increases to €120,000, any contribution one makes to a pension fund or an investment fund beyond that will not have the benefit of tax relief. When one considers the private sector in that respect, it was common for people on very large salaries not only to pay annual amounts but for their employers to also pay annual amounts and sometimes bullet-type payments that were very large, and there were no limits. I will bring legislation before the House when we can get into this, but it certainly goes in the direction the Deputy is signalling, and we can debate the detail when the legislation comes before the House. I am not moving on this today, but I do not want to raise any expectations of a prospective change to what we have announced in the budget either next year or in the medium term.

They have only just started working on it and therefore I cannot give the Deputy a more precise timeline, but the timeline I would like is to get it done before the summer.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	276	I move amendment No. 5:In page 27, to delete lines 8 to 26.This is connected to the issue we discussed regarding the pensions. We thrashed this issue out on Committee Stage but I raise it again because we should sound alarm bells about what the Minister is doing regarding the approved minimum retirement fund and the requirement to have a pension income of €18,000, which the Minister is reducing to €12,700. That is not prudent. We spoke earlier about the pension reliefs. Sinn Féin is not arguing for the suspension of all pension reliefs, although some people might ask why we should give anybody relief to invest in pensions, but we recognise there is a pensions time bomb. The focus has gone off that because the country is like a time bomb, so to speak, and we need to stabilise its finances, but we also need to encourage people to invest in their pensions. However, the way the pension reliefs are structured, very few people benefit. The people who need to be incentivised to invest in pensions are not getting the benefit. We argued that pensions relief would be standardised. I acknowledge the Minister is considering introducing that next year and while I am disappointed it cannot be done this year, and bring in the additional tax, he must examine standardising pension reliefs. The linkage I am making is that pension reliefs can incentivise people to put money in for the future. It is prudent that they do that for all the reasons that have been spelled out in numerous reports by successive Governments. Heretofore, a minimum retirement fund had to be established to the value of approximately €100,000. What the Minister is proposing in this legislation is to reduce that figure substantially from €119,000 to €63,000, and to reduce the minimum pension income from €18,000 to €12,700. As I explained earlier, someone on an old age pension currently gets approximately €12,000 and therefore the requirement to have that €700 extra put away is not good enough. It is not incentivising people. The other issue is that in reducing the minimum retirement fund to the level the Minister is proposing, it will push the remainder of the funds into ARFs, which are taxable. Issues arise about that also. It is not prudent. I understand it is part and parcel of this policy to which the Minister is committed, but it is not prudent that we are reducing these thresholds to this level. I have raised that issue again in these amendments to send a signal that what the Minister is doing here is very dangerous. It is not sending out the right signals. He has said this caused a shock to the system in the past but as I said to the Minister earlier, he has not come forward with a sunset clause in this regard. Therefore, if the Minister were to introduce it and increase it again in three years' time, it would cause another shock to the system. I am very concerned about what the Minister is doing here on the issue of pensions into the future.

These substitutions deal in one way or another with the temporary rescinding of certain provisions included in the Finance Act 2011 relating to ARF access conditions, which were introduced in the context of the extension of the ARF option to all defined contribution occupational pension arrangements at that time. The impact of the Deputy's amendments would be to continue with the more challenging conditions attaching to accessing the ARF option, which my changes are designed to ease, for a transitional period and which will have the greatest impact on those with modest pension incomes and modest pension savings. It emerged during the debate on Committee Stage that there may be some concern or misunderstanding about the motivation behind the changes I have proposed. It may help to clarify the situation, therefore, if I explain the background and the rationale for the changes in more detail. The flexible options at retirement are the ARF option, as it is commonly referred to, which was introduced in 1999 to give certain individuals with mainly defined contribution type pension arrangements more choice, flexibility and control regarding the use of their pension funds at retirement at a time when the only available option was to purchase a pension annuity. Such annuities were viewed as poor value at the time partly because of the fact that in most cases the annuity effectively died with the annuity holder and left nothing to be handed down through the annuity holder's estate. The ARF option was later extended to all holders of additional voluntary contributions. Today, retiring individuals in defined contribution pension arrangements still have the option to purchase an annuity but as an alternative they can draw down their remaining pension pot after taking the tax free retirement lump sum by way of a taxable lump sum or invest it in an approved retirement fund, that is, the ARF. Debate adjourned.

Déanann an Coiste Rialtais ar an Ghaeilge agus ar an Ghaeltacht, a bhfuil an Taoiseach ina chathaoirleach air, maoirseacht ar bhonn leanúnach ar an dul chun cinn maidir le forfheidhmiú na Straitéise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge.

Cuirim fáilte roimh an eolas, ach tá súil agam go mbeidh níos mó cruinnithe ag an gcoiste. Bhí an tAire Stáit ag caint ar "Prime Time" aréir mar gheall ar thábhacht an choiste seo agus an Taoiseach mar chathaoirleach air, ach an bhfuil aon rud déanta ag an Aire Stáit nó ag an Rialtas mar gheall ar an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge? Tá alt in The Irish Times inniu a thosaíonn leis na focail seo "Cúrsaí teanga ag dul in olcas de réir na tuarascála is déanaí ón Choimisinéir Teanga."

An chéad rud a rinne muid, mar a dúradh sa bhfreagra a thug mé don Teachta, ná go bhfuil an fochoiste Rialtais againn a thagann le chéile agus a bheidh ag teacht le chéile chun monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar an straitéis 20 bliain. Freisin, tá sé mar phríomh cuspóir i gclár an Rialtais an straitéis 20 bliain a chur i bhfeidhm. Chomh maith le seo, tá Acht Gaeltachta tugtha isteach a chuireann lenár gcumas agus a thugann bunús reachtaíochta don straitéis 20 bliain. Mar shampla, anois tá sé mar dhualgas agus mar fhreagracht ar Údarás na Gaeltachta an straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm sna ceantair Gaeltachta agus táthar ag tosú ar an obair sin i láthair na huaire. Tá siad ag dul amach go dtí na ceantair ar fud na Gaeltachtaí agus ag tabhairt deise dóibh a gcuid pleananna teanga a dhéanamh amach. Chomh maith le sin, tá sé mar fhreagracht ar Fhoras na Gaeilge an straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm sa chuid eile den tír. Táimid ag díriú isteach anois ar theallaigh agus ar an chaint, an chanúint agus an teanga fhéin. Mar adúirt mé, tá freagracht bhreise ar Údarás na Gaeltachta. Ní hamháin go bhfuil cúraimí fiontraíochta orthu, ach tá cúraimí teanga agus cultúr orthu chomh maith. Tá siad chun iad sin a chomhlíonadh go héifeachtach. Tá coiste nó bord úr ar an údarás agus tá an-mhuinín, an-dóchas agus an-mhisneach agam go ndéanfaidh siad an jab sin go héifeachtach, go cuimsitheach agus go hiomlán.

Mar is eol don Teachta, thóg an Roinn sin cinneadh deireadh a chur leis an deontas d'ábhair oidí don tréimhse éigeantach a chaitear sa Ghaeltacht ón bhliain acadúil 2012 go 2013 ar aghaidh. Ina theannta sin, tá sé i gceist go mbeidh na hábhair oidí ag caitheamh dhá thréimhse coicíse um Cháisc sa Ghaeltacht feasta in áit trí seachtaine le linn an tsamhraidh, mar a bhíodh go dtí seo. Is dul chun cinn é sin i mo thuairim. Bhí go leor plé ag mo Roinn leis na páirtithe leasmhara maidir leis na hathruithe seo. Mar chuid den phlé sin, eagraíodh cruinniú ar na mallaibh faoi chathaoirleacht mo Roinnse ar a d'fhreastail ionadaithe ón Roinn Oideachais agus Scileanna ó na coláistí oideachais agus ó Chomhchoiste Náisiúnta na gColáistí Samhraidh, nó CONCOS mar a thugtar air. Rinneadh scrúdú ar na himpleachtaí ar fad maidir leis na hathruithe atá i gceist ar mhaithe le bailchríoch a chur leis na socruithe sa Ghaeltacht. Tá cruinniú eile beartaithe nuair a bheidh cúrsaí na Cásca críochnaithe i mbliana agus nuair a bheidh an pictiúr níos soiléire maidir leis na hathruithe atá i gceist.  Ar ndóigh, is cuid lárnach den chéim B.Oid. í an tréimhse a chaitear sa Ghaeltacht agus tuigim go bhfuil freastal ar na cúrsaí sin éigeantach chun cáiliú mar mhúinteoir bunoideachais. Is féidir liom a rá go bhfuil méadú tagtha ar líon na gcoláistí Gaeilge a bhfuil iarratas ar aitheantas déanta acu ar mo Roinn chun cúrsaí a sholáthar d'ábhair oidí, cé nach bhfuil figiúirí ar fáil fós don líon ábhar oidí atá cláraithe ar na cúrsaí sin um Cháisc i mbliana.

Caithfidh mé a rá, i ndáiríre, nach bhfuil sa ráiteas sin ach praiseach amach is amach. Ní chreideann éinne ar an taobh seo go bhfuil an Rialtas ag cur an straitéis 20 bliain i bhfeidhm i ndáiríre. Níl aon cheann de na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge lánsásta - ainmnigh eagraíocht amháin atá sásta - leis an méid atá an Rialtas ag déanamh chun an straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá formhór acu ag rá go bhfuil an Rialtas ag déanamh damáiste don straitéis. Tá siad glan in éadan na slí ina bhfuil an Rialtas agus an Roinn ag feidhmiú. Leis an fhírinne a rá, tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil an tAire Stáit sásta leis ach oiread. Tá mé lánchinnte go bhfuil a fhios aige ina chroí go bhfuil an Roinn ag dul in éadan na straitéise. Is féidir na hábhair oidí seo a thógáil mar shampla. Freastalaíonn na hoidí ar an nGaeltacht chun a gcuid Gaeilge a fheabhsú, de ghnáth. San aimsir atá caite, bhí maoiniú ann le haghaidh na socruithe seo. Rinne an Rialtas cinneadh fáil réidh leis na deontais seo. Tá sé seo díreach in aghaidh na straitéise, a deireann go gcaithfidh na hábhair oidí níos mó ama a chaitheamh sa Ghaeltacht chun feabhas a chur ar a gcuid Gaeilge. De réir an Teaching Council agus grúpaí eile, caithfear feabhas a chur ar chaighdeán na n-ábhair oidí. Conas a bhfuil an tAire Stáit in ann a rá go bhfuil an straitéis 20 bliain á chur i bhfeidhm nuair atá a mhalairt de bharúil ag gach eagraíocht eile ar an oileán seo? Is sampla díreach é seo den chaoi ina bhfuil an Rialtas ag dul in aghaidh na straitéise.

During my visit to Beijing I had official talks with the Chinese Minister of Culture, Cai Wu; met the leaders of some of China’s most important cultural institutions, including the National Library, the Palace Museum and the National Centre for the Performing Arts; and met a gathering of high level business contacts. I also had engagement with a range of practitioners in the cultural sector, discussed Ireland’s Presidency priorities with the EU delegation and visited the Beijing-Dublin International College, the new joint campus of UCD and Beijing University of Technology. During the official engagement with Minister for Culture Cai I discussed his wish to extend the memorandum of understanding on cultural exchange and co-operation between Ireland and China when it expires at the end of this year. In the context of a new memorandum of understanding, I also expressed the hope to him that 2014 would be designated a year of Irish culture in China, with a number of cultural events taking place to mark this designation. On my return, I asked my Department to put together the outline of such a programme, in consultation with our embassy in Beijing and consulate general in Shanghai. Minister Cai raised with me the possibility of China establishing a cultural centre in Ireland. China now has ten such cultural centres overseas and the total number will grow to 50 over time. I also discussed the subject of EU-China relations in the cultural sector with Minister Cai who believes Ireland’s Presidency of the European Union presents an opportunity to deepen cultural relations between China and the Union and I have agreed, as chair of the Council of Ministers of Culture, to raise this matter at the May meeting of the Council.  In other engagements, during my meeting with the vice president of the Palace Museum, I discussed the potential for enhanced co-operation between the Palace Museum and the Chester Beatty Library which has a world class collection of oriental books and artefacts. I also discussed the upcoming visit to China by the Royal Irish Academy of Music with the National Centre for the Performing Arts.  I attended a reception for approximately 200 high-level business contacts, co-sponsored by IDA Ireland and A&L Goodbody and sourced through the Goodbody Chinese law firm network which was launched by the Taoiseach last March. This included a 60 minute private performance by the Riverdance cast, a show which is extremely popular in China. I used the opportunity to highlight to this group Ireland’s economic recovery and attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment.

We could also double or treble the number of Chinese students who come to Ireland and have a foreign exchange programme for Chinese and Irish students. The Institute of Technology, Tralee, has a good quota of Chinese students and it is only one such example of an Irish educational institution. I understand there are approximately 3,000 Chinese students in Ireland and believe we could increase that number to 30,000, which would represent a huge investment in the economy.

I am convinced there is huge potential to develop links with China not only cultural but also economic. We can leverage cultural events in order to attract investment. We need only consider the companies that attended the special Riverdance performance. Representatives of all the top companies in China attended and unless they were interested in Ireland and perhaps especially interested in Riverdance which is a major brand in China, they would not have made the effort to come from all over the country to attend. I view cultural events as a great calling card for this country in China and I am convinced that we can leverage much more economic activity from them. Riverdance has resulted in huge connections in China where it has had a huge impact. It is amazing how it has resonated with its people. I understand the show, with the new dance being created by John McColgan and Moya Doherty, will tour China again next year. We should avail of these opportunities to attract as much attention to Ireland as possible. I discussed with the Minister the possibility of designating 2014 as the year of Irish culture in China and he was very receptive to the idea.

The council is funded by my Department and statutorily independent in its day-to-day operations, including funding decisions. Details of all funding provided by the council for arts practitioners, arts groups and venues, including arts centres, are available on the council's website at www.artscouncil.ie. My Department's direct role in the funding of the arts relates in the main to the provision of capital funding. In Ireland there is no formally accepted definition of an arts centre, but it could be assumed to be a space which provides theatre space, gallery space, venues for musical performances, workshop areas or arts educational facilities. During the years capital funding has been provided for many projects which now provide such facilities. Details of funding provided by my Department for such facilities in the years 2010 and 2011 are available on my Department's website at www.ahg.gov.ie. An equivalent list of funding for 2012 and 2013, to date, is included in an appendix to this reply which will be circulated in the Official Report. The appendix also includes details of some current funding, including the philanthropy initiative, paid by my Department to arts organisations in 2012.

I tabled this question in the context of two important developments - two significant speeches made by the President, Michael D. Higgins, in Paris recently, one at UNESCO and another in the Pompidou Centre where he talked about the importance, not least at a time of recession, of investment in the arts and culture and also the very disappointing development in Limerick where the Belltable Arts Centre has gone into liquidation, having provided a superb service on a regional basis for the people of the greater Limerick area for the past 32 years. Given that we are agreed that the network of arts centres developed across the country during the past two or three decades has brought the arts to the people in a very meaningful way and made a range of arts activities accessible to people in rural and provincial Ireland in a way that would not have been otherwise possible, will the Minister provide assurances that, in respect of the Belltable Arts Centre, some initiative can be taken to ensure the arts centre will be open in 2014 when Limerick becomes the first city of culture? Will he also assure us that there will be continued investment in the other network of centres across the country?
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	311	I thank the Deputy for his question. The Arts Council has primary responsibility for the funding of centres across the country. As my predecessors in the Department made a huge investment in the Belltable Arts Centre, obviously we are very concerned about what is happening. Together with my officials, I will do everything possible when the current process is completed to ensure the centre will again be used as both a performing and visual arts centre. It is situated in the middle of Limerick city. I was in Limerick only last Monday and visited places such as Moyross and South Hill where there are some thriving arts communities and I was very encouraged by what I saw. The arts community was strong in pointing out that there were no facilities in the centre of town where the Belltable Arts Centre was located and in which the Daghdha Dance Company had a performing area. I agree with the Deputy that it is very important that the Belltable Arts Centre function again as an arts centre. My Department and I, together with Limerick City Council, will certainly do everything possible to ensure that will happen. It is very important that it should happen.

I am reassured by what he said and sure we will have an opportunity to return to this matter again. In the light of what has happened in Limerick, has the Minister had any engagement with the Arts Council or is it surveying arts centres across the country to ensure other centres will not find themselves in the same situation as the centre in Limerick? Furthermore, is he aware if the Arts Council provides any financial or management training for the boards of arts centres? It is essential that boards have the necessary skills to ensure the centres are made as financially viable as possible.

A centre would have to show that it had the capacity to operate and due diligence would be applied to all centres. I will convey what the Deputy has said to the council. As a country, we have made a huge investment in arts centres in the past 20 years. The total investment, including current and capital funding, made in the previous ten years prior to my coming into office amounted to nearly €1 billion, a huge investment. It is important that we ensure these centres which were provided mostly with funding provided by taxpayers will remain open, that there will be a proper programme in place and so on. I take the Deputy's point and will convey his question to the council on it providing a service for the centres to ensure they are administered properly and cognisant of the financial arrangements necessary to ensure their viability.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	314	UNESCO sets out a formal process for State signatories to the World Heritage Convention for the purpose of nominating properties on their territories for inclusion on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The nomination process is initiated by the relevant State authorities, which draw up a tentative list of what they consider to be the most important heritage sites within their national boundaries. The tentative list is compiled with a view to providing a shortlist of potential sites for possible submission to UNESCO for inclusion in the World Heritage List. UNESCO will consider nominations for World Heritage status only from those sites included on a nation's tentative list. In 2008, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government established an expert advisory group to review Ireland's tentative list and to identify the Irish heritage sites which best met the criteria for inclusion on the World Heritage List. A particular criterion is for a site to be considered to be of outstanding universal value, defined by UNESCO as meaning that it is of "cultural and or natural significance which is so exceptional as to transcend national boundaries and to be of common importance for present and future generations of all humanity." Following full public consultation and consideration by the expert advisory group, a new tentative list for Ireland was approved and submitted to UNESCO in March 2010. The list was selected following an inclusive, consultative and scientific process that set out to identify the sites that most closely corresponded to the selection criteria laid down by UNESCO and, crucially, that met the definition of outstanding universal value. The sites were selected on the basis that they stood the best possible chance of successfully making their way through the rigorous evaluation process applying to nominations put forward for the World Heritage List. A proposal for the historic city of Dublin is included on Ireland's tentative list with the justification for its outstanding universal value based, inter alia, on the development of Georgian Dublin, the city's contribution to world literature, the establishment of the Wide Streets Commission and the range of buildings of high architectural quality. I am, of course, acutely aware of the significance of the GPO and Moore Street area as the location of key events that ultimately led to the foundation of the State and of the importance of preserving and celebrating that legacy as part of our national history and heritage.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	315	It is almost impossible to talk about Dublin's rich literary tradition without simultaneously acknowledging the centrality of the battlefield site. Sean O’Casey’s work, particularly his dramatic trilogy, use both the events and the setting of Moore Street and the GPO in 1916 as a central prop. If one extracts the events and setting from O’Casey’s work it becomes meaningless. Does the Minister agree that the events, setting, streetscape and urban fabric of the site had a major influence on the social and cultural evolution of the people of Dublin? Does he accept that James Joyce extracts from the rich urban quilt the key personalities, eccentricities and stories without which he could not have written Ulysses? Does the Minister agree that the city, particularly the city centre and the Moore Street battlefield site as a setting, has made an extraordinary contribution to world literature and that the site in its totality, with its literary, architectural and urban fabric, needs to be recognised as having had a formative influence on the writers mentioned, on the works mentioned and on others writers such as George Bernard Shaw, Roddy Doyle and Brendan Behan? Will he acknowledge that the site has been a central element in works considered to be of great human creative genius?

We have several tentative sites. The next step is to evaluate the sites further with a view to ultimate designation. Representatives of the Céide Fields, including Seamus Caulfield, were in contact with me and I met them. They are very anxious to designate the Céide Fields in Mayo as a World Heritage Site. There are some concerns there about planning permission, as there are in Clonmacnoise. In order to advance the process I have requested that UNESCO send us its expert in this area very soon to discuss the tentative sites and how we can advance them to full heritage status. That is the next step in the process. Becoming a World Heritage Site is quite complicated. There must to be major consultation with stakeholders, including the local community. That is a fundamental part of the process. Following submission of a nominations file to UNESCO, it is evaluated by three advisory bodies, including the International Council on Monuments and Sites, the World Conservation Union and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property. There is a process of evaluation to go through that takes some time. I hope that after this meeting and following this consultative process, we will have a clearer pathway forward.

Does the Minister accept that symbolically the site represents a significant aspect of Irish identity, in that it informs our sense of what it means to be Irish, and that this same landscape is now in a worrying state of decay? The State should without further delay take ownership of the site on behalf of the people.

Dublin City Council and An Bord Pleanála approved an application for planning permission for the site. There is one section that my predecessor designated as a national monument, which is in private ownership. Any work to be carried out on that requires my permission. This area of Dublin, not only the site concerned, needs major upgrading, rejuvenation and revival. We all agree on that and it would help if we could do it in the context of the centenary of 1916.

As the Deputy is aware, I have responded to a range of questions from him on these matters over recent months and have also supplied him directly with a significant volume of information about assistance provided to arts and heritage groups from my own Department, the Heritage Council and the Arts Council. I share his view that the arts, culture and heritage sectors continue to offer vital opportunities for the provision of important cultural, social and employment benefits to communities throughout the country. The nature of employment within the arts sector encompasses a wide range of activities, while cultural and heritage tourism is one of the most important elements of Ireland's tourism product. I should also say that the Government appreciates and values the contribution the arts sector makes to the internationally renowned artistic and cultural reputation of this country. I have outlined previously for the Deputy a range of ways in which my Department and relevant bodies within its remit are seeking to support cultural and heritage initiatives in conjunction with local groups and communities. These include cultural tourism initiatives such as the St. Patrick's Day celebrations, Music Day and Culture Night; the extensive support provided by the Arts Council for festivals and other arts and cultural events across the county; the range of activities organised by the Council of National Cultural Institutions and other cultural venues supported by my Department; the philanthropy leverage initiative, funded by my Department; the many cultural and heritage events being held under the auspices of both The Gathering and our EU Presidency cultural programme; a number of web-based projects being developed by my Department to promote greater appreciation and understanding of Ireland's heritage as a valuable amenity for residents and visitors alike; and other collaborative work with bodies and groups such as the Heritage Council, the Irish Heritage Trust, Fáilte Ireland, and Leader groups.Within the current economic constraints, investment in the arts, heritage, culture and creative sectors is more important than ever, having regard to the employment intensity of these sectors. While I know the Deputy appreciates the funding difficulties facing all Departments at this time, he can be assured I remain committed to securing the best possible level of funding for these sectors. The specific allocations to be made over the next three years will, of course, be dependent on the budgetary and estimates cycles in each of those years.

The Minister recently visited Donegal where he got a good insight into heritage projects there. While I was not able to attend the meetings he had with local groups due to the meeting of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly, on behalf of the groups I thank the Minister for giving up his time. In his response the Minister referred to local community engagement with any potential interpretative or visitor centres for historical sites. In Donegal, there are two sites where we could realise massive potential. Malin Head has an historic tower which was used in the past by Lloyds of London, Marconi, the Admiralty and the Army as a coastal defence system in both world wars, respectively. It has been a local ambition for many years to get an interpretative centre there. Whatever influence the Minister can use in conjunction with the Office of Public Works would be important. The second site is Fanad Head lighthouse. There is an application for INTERREG funding for a necklace of visitor sites at lighthouses around the coast. This would make a massive contribution to the maritime tourism sector. A decision on the Fanad Head lighthouse site is imminent and I hope it will be successful.

There is a good example already in County Clare and the residents of Valentia Island are looking to develop their lighthouse as a tourist attraction. I will give whatever support I can to this initiative. I will be speaking to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, later this evening and I will refer to the tourism potential of our lighthouses around the coastline.

It is important all Departments are mindful of their responsibility towards the Irish language and they provide bilingual services as required. I saw the report of the Coimisinéir Teanga. The Minister of State, Deputy McGinley, is aware of these issues. For the past 30 years, more than any other Member, Deputy McGinley has been one of the strongest proponents of the Irish language. Since he became Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, there was never more Irish spoken in the House. We are mindful of this report and we will be addressing the various issues raised. A special committee on the Irish language, chaired by the Taoiseach, is in place and the report will be discussed at its next meeting.

According to Fáilte Ireland, some 3.5 million overseas visitors engaged in cultural activities while in Ireland in 2011. Over 2.5 million tourists visited historic houses or castles, while 2 million visited our archaeological monuments. Cultural institutions under the aegis of my Department attracted some 3.5 million visitors in 2012, with over 3.7 million visitors to heritage sites where the Office of Public Works provides a guide service. As well as gaining an insight and appreciation of Ireland's rich and diverse heritage and history, overseas visitors spent an estimated €2.8 billion during their stay. I am committed to availing of every possible opportunity to project a positive global image for Ireland and am particularly conscious in the context of 2013 being the year of The Gathering initiative. My Department is actively engaged in a wide range of activities to this end, both in co-operation with bodies such as Fáilte Ireland and the Office of Public Works, and in promoting its initiatives such as our places to see and monuments to visit websites. These provide directions to lesser known heritage sites and details of what the visitor can expect to find on arrival. In addition, my Department provides core funding for the Heritage Council, which supports a range of initiatives, including national heritage week. This year, in conjunction with Fáilte Ireland, my Department is also initiating a pilot programme, the Historic Towns Initiative, in Youghal, Westport and Listowel with the Heritage Council and the local authorities in each town. This initiative is intended to promote heritage-led regeneration with the objective of harnessing cultural heritage to create desirable places to live, do business and visit. These are but a sample of the overall range of initiatives and programmes my Department is helping to promote, support or guide as a means of preserving the quality and diversity of our built heritage, increasing awareness of that heritage and positively promoting Ireland's image abroad as a good place to visit or do business.

Notwithstanding this, I am aware that the security of the collections is a matter which is routinely kept under review by all of the institutions. My Department maintains appropriate contact with them on the subject of their security measures and the arrangements in place to ensure the protection of the collections in their care. My Department owns several pieces of art and other artefacts in its own right in a number of properties. In light of a recent incident involving the loss of several items held in private storage on behalf of my Department I instructed as follows: that an inventory and physical check take place in respect of all artwork, furniture and other similar items held by my Department; in cases where any such art and other artefacts were held in storage, they should be moved to secure State facilities; and that a review be carried out of the procedures and protocols in place relating to the storage of art and artefacts by my Department. All of these actions have been completed. Separately, the Office of Public Works is responsible for the care and management of art pieces in a wide range of State properties.

There are two areas of concern. Last October, the OPW reported that 37 pieces of art in these Houses were unaccounted for and this was widely reported in the national press at the time. What has happened to these? Given that I come from Kildare I am especially interested in the fact that there was apparently a theft of items which were being kept in storage in County Kildare. This was discovered in October when several of those items were offered for sale. The Minister has informed us that the audit is complete and that a review of security provisions is taking place. I put it to the Minister that one of the things highlighted by the storage issue is that we should not have items that have been bequeathed to the State kept in storage. Given the facilities we have in this city and throughout the country, including all the arts centres and museums, does the Minister agree that it would be desirable for anything in storage that can be taken out of storage to be taken out and made available in order that people can enjoy them? They should be on public display.

They were taken from Killarney House and put in storage pending the restoration of the house which is under way. There is an active investigation of the theft being carried out by the Garda authorities under the direction of an assistant commissioner. At the moment I have been advised not to dwell on the issue for operational reasons. Obviously, we are taking this seriously and progress is being made. I agree with Deputy Ó Fearghaíl that we have good storage space in Swords at the moment. Any property in the ownership of the State should not be in private storage and if it is not on display in the credited museums to which Deputy Ó Fearghaíl referred, then it should be in State storage. This is what I have directed people to do. The items from Killarney House were taken from where they were and placed in storage. Many of the artefacts in question from Killarney House are now in State storage in Swords.

The decade of centenaries programme is committed to following the historical timeline of the period 1912-1922. Therefore, commemorative initiatives in 2013 are focused primarily on the events of 1913, including the passing of the Third Home Rule Bill in the House of Commons, the 1913 Lock-out and later in the year the centenary of the founding of the Irish Volunteers. I am working with ministerial colleagues, the Defence Forces, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, national cultural institutions and academic and community partners on the programme of events for this year. The events of 1913 are of tremendous importance in understanding the revolutionary period and presenting the Easter Rising in context. To ensure that the State produces a comprehensive, inclusive and authentic programme of commemorations an expert and independent advisory group on commemorations has been established, chaired by Dr. Maurice Manning. The group will commence a national consultation process on commemorations shortly with a series of meetings in regional centres at which they will seek suggestions and contributions from individuals and groups on commemorations in the decade of centenaries.

The event is open to everyone and takes place on O'Connell Street. Representatives attend from all political parties North and South. The annual event was initiated in 1996 and it has proven to be very successful since then. It is a dignified occasion. The families of the 1916 leaders attend and the event is run to a high standard. There is an event to commemorate the execution of the leaders as well. This is a Government event and this year it will be held on Wednesday, 8 May in Arbour Hill. This year the focus will be on the Dublin Lock-out and the founding of the Irish Volunteers in November. We will follow this timeline but the event on Easter Sunday will ensure that 1916 is commemorated appropriately. Obviously, there will be other events throughout the country as well.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	342	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 38 and 42 together. Nos. 14-17 Moore Street are the subject of a preservation order under the National Monuments Acts. The effect of the preservation order is that any works affecting these properties require the consent of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht under section 14 of the National Monuments Act 1930, as amended. The landowner’s application to my Department for consent to proposals that include the provision of a commemorative centre to the 1916 Rising and its leaders on the national monument site is being examined.The approval given by An Bord Pleanála in 2010 for the wider development that includes the national monument site requires the applicant to revert to the planning authority with revised proposals in respect of certain elements of the development. The processes under the Planning Acts and the National Monuments Acts are entirely separate and any requirement or condition imposed under one process stands independently of the other. My consideration of the consent application and the associated environmental impact assessment is being undertaken on that basis.  As part of the consent process under the National Monuments Acts, the applicant was asked by my Department to submit an environmental impact statement on the proposals for the national monument site. This is in accordance with section 14D of the National Monuments Act 1930, as inserted by the European Union (Environmental Impact Assessment of Proposed Demolition of National Monuments) Regulations 2012. The new provision places additional responsibilities on landowners in respect of national monuments protected under the National Monuments Acts. An environmental impact statement was submitted to my Department on 25 January 2013. In accordance with the consultation procedures prescribed in section 14D of the National Monuments Act 1930, it was made available for a five week period to allow for examination by the public and lodgment of submissions or observations with the Department.  In the meantime, the Department has informed the consent applicant that the newspaper notice published on 18 January 2013 on the submission of the environmental impact statement was not compliant with the requirements of section 14D of the National Monuments Act 1930 in that it did not state the nature and extent of the proposed demolition. The applicant has accordingly been required to publish a further public notice, the timing of which is a matter for the applicant. In practical terms, the requirement for a new public notice will recommence the five week period for submissions or observations to my Department on the environmental impact statement. It will be open to Dublin City Council’s Moore Street advisory committee to offer its views on the environmental impact statement during this period. Having completed the prescribed consultation procedures in relation to the environmental impact statement, I will then proceed as quickly as possible to undertake a formal environmental impact assessment and make a decision on the consent application itself.

I appreciate the intricacies of the planning system and the sensitivities involved but can the Minister indicate a definite timeframe in which a decision will be made on Nos. 14-17 Moore Street? It was previously suggested that tripartite meetings should be arranged between the National Museum, the Department and the developer. Have those meetings taken place? Is the Minister in a position to provide a briefing to Opposition spokespersons on the matter? There may be aspects which would be useful for us to learn but he may not want to put them into the public realm. On the general issue of heritage and the Rising and the revolution, will the Minister consider developing a revolutionary heritage trail in Dublin which might take in significant sites around the city? The sites associated with various artists and writers are an important element of heritage tourism in Dublin and there is similar potential for the history of the Rising.

I have no problem with arranging a briefing for Opposition spokespersons and anyone else who may be interested. A number of briefings have been provided by the developer, my departmental officials and staff of the National Museum, including to the all-party Oireachtas 1916 centenary committee. I will arrange for an additional briefing for Deputy Ó Fearghaíl. As we were not happy with the notice, we asked the developer to publish another notice including all the information required to allow people to respond. As soon as that process is complete I will proceed with the final environmental impact assessment. This will involve an examination of the developer's environmental impact statement and the other observations that have been made. It is my function to make a decision which I will then take to the Cabinet. The process has not been delayed by my Department. We had to follow a certain procedure but due to the European Court of Justice judgment the developer had to produce an environmental impact statement. We are complying with all the regulations and ensuring that proper procedures are followed.

It is up to the developer to finance the project. There is also a proposal for the GPO which has more certainty because it can be controlled by the State. I am supporting the GPO proposal along with An Post and the OPW. As regards Moore Street, my only responsibility is to determine whether the proposal by the developer is suitable for Nos. 14-17, which are in private ownership. I have asked the developer to go through various processes in order that I can make a determination. We are going through a legal process and once the necessary information is supplied to me I will make a decision at the earliest opportunity. I hope to make a decision by the end of this Dáil term.

He stated that the remainder of the site is in the hands of An Bord Pleanála, Dublin City Council and the developer but the State, in the form of NAMA, has total control over the site. Nothing will happen without NAMA's permission.Is it possible that the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht could have influence with NAMA in how the rest of the development takes place, especially given that Moore Lane and Henry Place are pretty significant in addition to 14-17 Moore Street, which is obviously the centrepiece? At the moment we are looking at eight floors in the laneways, and it would be wonderful if there could be some setback in the laneways. Most people agree that the original application was for a very large development and it would not be unreasonable to scale it back somewhat with some setback for the laneways. The Minister has previously told me that his remit is confined to 14-17 Moore Street, but I am sure he might have some influence with NAMA.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	356	Neither my Department nor I had anything to do with the granting of planning permission on this site. I want to make that clear, because there is an insinuation to that effect. All I have to do is to determine whether the proposal for 14-17 Moore Street is suitable for that monument. Planning permission was granted by Dublin City Council and I understand it was more or less unanimous, with no objections at the time it was granted. In 1999 planning permission was granted to demolish every building on it. As I understand there were very few dissenting voices on the previous occasion when permission was granted. It then went to An Bord Pleanála and has gone through all those procedures, which I have nothing to do with. I cannot change the planning permission that was granted on the site. However, in consultation with experts in my Department and the National Museum I can determine whether the proposal for the national monument is a suitable proposal for that site. I will determine that as soon as I get the information I must get because of the legal issues involved. I am following that procedure very carefully because this is very contentious, as the Deputies know. As for the suggestion of contacting NAMA about a specific site, I am sure I would be precluded from doing that.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	357	I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise this issue and I am grateful for the attendance of the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock. I wish to raise the widespread concerns among the Protestant community over the future of educational facilities, with particular reference to primary schools. There are 199 Protestant schools in the State: 124 Church of Ireland, 24 Presbyterian, one Methodist and one Quaker. Fifty of these have fewer than 30 pupils. Fifty are in Dublin, with the remainder dispersed around the country, many in rural locations serving rural families. There is real concern in the Protestant community about smaller schools. It is estimated that 20 of these schools will become one-teacher schools by the year after next. I regard the concept of a one-teacher school to be somewhat undesirable. I would be anxious to hear the Minister of State outline how this will work and how one-teacher schools can be managed. Forty of these schools have fewer than 26 pupils, and 90 have between 26 and 86 pupils. Some 50% of Church of Ireland schools are directly affected and will lose a mainstream class teacher on current enrolment as a result of last year's budget. Depending on enrolments over the next four years, a further 10% of schools could be affected. The cuts will render many of these schools less than viable and many will need to close. This can be compared with the figures for Catholic schools and for schools generally: 11% of Catholic children are in a school of fewer than 86 pupils, while 12% of all children in a school of fewer than 86 pupils. Protestant children are three times more likely to be affected by the change in pupil-teacher ratio than those in other schools, which I believe is unfair. What form of dialogue, consultation or negotiation does the Minister plan in order to deal with the issue? There are other issues of concern to the Protestant community, including teacher allocation reductions; school transport reductions and eligibility changes; reductions in capitation grants; the removal of the minor works grant after this year; changes to school enrolment, which will undermine the ethos safeguards that have been guaranteed since the foundation of the State; and changes to the role of religious education in schools arising from the patronage forum report. In essence, many schools in my constituency and in the constituencies of the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, serving a geographically dispersed and culturally distinctive community in rural areas, will close. The question of amalgamation has been raised, but I do not know what the guidelines are for amalgamations. What dialogue has there been on proposing amalgamation? In most cases, when schools are closed, it will mean the loss of Protestant schools, not only across large areas of the country but to large sections of Irish society. This is an issue of major concern across communities where education is being sent on a downward spiral. I am not asking for any community to be treated differently, but I want communities to be treated fairly. I want to see meaningful action on the part of the Government to reassure minority communities that there is a place for diversity and pluralism within the system for education provision.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14707	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	358	I am taking this Topical Issue matter on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn. I thank Deputy Charles Flanagan for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the position on the issues raised. The Government has protected front-line services in schools to the greatest extent possible in the recent budget and there will be no reduction in teacher numbers in primary schools and in free second level schools for the 2013-14 school year as a result of the budget. The DEIS scheme for disadvantaged schools is also fully protected, with no overall changes to staffing levels or funding as a result of the budget. How best to sustain education provision for widely dispersed and small local communities presents a particular challenge, especially in any locality where enrolment is declining to single figures. The Government is intent on fostering pluralism in school provision. Supporting small communities, including minorities, in maintaining their schools is part of that policy.The value for money review of small primary school provision is at an advanced stage of preparation. The Department expects to publish the review, at which stage its findings can be debated. At post-primary level and in order to promote fairness in funding second level schools, a two point increase in the pupil-teacher ratio in fee-charging second level schools will be introduced in September 2013. There are 55 schools, out of 723 post-primary schools, charging fees, ranging from €2,550 to €10,065 for day pupils. The State pays the salary of one teacher for every 21 pupils in these schools, compared with the salary of one teacher for every 19 pupils in schools in the free education scheme. A ratio of 18.25 pupils to one teacher applies in DEIS schools. The pupil-teacher ratio will rise to 23:1 in fee-charging schools from September 2013. However, these schools have the resources, through fees charged, to employ teachers privately, an option not available to schools in the free education scheme. A report on the analysis of the tuition income of fee-charging schools, carried out by the Department of Education and Skills and published on Tuesday, 5 March, shows that fee-charging schools have considerable discretionary income and are best placed to manage with reduced public funding. There are some concerns within the Church of Ireland community about the recent budget measure affecting fee-charging schools. The Government recognises the importance of ensuring students from a Protestant or Reformed Church background can attend a school that reflects their denominational ethos, while, at the same time, ensuring funding arrangements are in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. The Minister has welcomed the recent announcement by Kilkenny College that it is entering the free secondary school scheme and will cease to charge fees from September next. It is a welcome development that the school considers that its future can best be secured through the free scheme and that it can continue to deliver a Church of Ireland school ethos for families in the south-east in this way. In regard to capitation, the Department provides capitation funding for all recognised primary schools and second level schools within the free education scheme. There has been some reduction in the level of capitation funding in recent years owing to the need to operate within our tight budgetary requirements.  With regard to the fee-charging Protestant schools, there is an arrangement whereby funding is provided by my Department for the Secondary Education Committee, SEC, an organisation run by the churches involved in managing the Protestant secondary schools. The SEC disburses funds to the Protestant fee-charging schools on behalf of pupils who would otherwise have difficulty in meeting the cost of fees and who, in the absence of such financial support, would be unable to attend a second level school of a Reformed Church or Protestant ethos. Funding amounts to €6.5 million annually and this fund ensures necessitous Protestant children can attend a school of their choice. Regarding school transport provision, a number of changes have been implemented in the primary and post-primary school transport scheme. These changes are being applied equitably on a national basis. I confirm that the Minister and his relevant departmental officials will continue to engage with the relevant education sector stakeholders, including the Church of Ireland and boards of education, on education provision for all areas.

First, will the Minister of State provide a copy of the guidelines set down by the Department to encourage amalgamations or the process leading towards amalgamation? My understanding is that the position is far from clear and that there is not the level of consultation the Minister of State would like to see, although I accept what he said about there being an opportunity to engage in consultation in the future. It is essential that there be such consultation. Second, does the Minister of State accept my belief that the concept of a one-teacher school is wholly undesirable and that one-teacher schools do not work? If schools are to close in many parts of the country, there will not, therefore, be a school of the same ethos where children can obtain an education simply because the distance involved will be too great and the area too remote. In effect, where Church of Ireland or other Protestant schools close throughout the country but particularly in the west and County Donegal, there will not be an education of choice available to such children. That is undesirable and I want the Minister, without treating people differently, to ensure they are treated fairly in this regard.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14707	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	362	I take the Deputy's point on the position in certain areas of the country where there is a one-teacher school and, owing to geographical or other considerations, pupils may not be able to avail of the nearest school with their ethos. This is an issue with which we have to grapple. I know from my experience in my constituency where the Department has had consultations with the local bishop that there are ongoing discussions on how we can sort out these issues. In that sense, there is an open door. On the point on one-teacher schools, I would be of the mindset that we need to take these examples and grapple with them example by example. I would certainly have an open mind in facilitating that process.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	364	I appreciate the opportunity to raise this matter which concerns an anomaly resulting from the decision to abolish the State transition pension from 2014 and what I believe to be a group of forgotten pensioners. The Government aims to save €60 million in a full year following the abolition of the State transition pension from next year. The effect is that, instead of a State pension being available to certain retired persons at the age of 65 years, from next year they will not be able to qualify for a State pension until they reach the age of 66 years. Based on the claim pattern of transition pensioners in recent years, we know that approximately 15,000 people are affected by this change. These are individuals who would have qualified for the transition pension up to the current year but who will not now qualify. Again, based on claim patterns in recent years, approximately 2,000 will be in the position where they have left work and have no entitlement to a State pension. These figures would be expected to grow in the coming years because of the demographics involved but also because it is planned to further raise the State pension age to 67 years in 2021 and 68 in 2028. Most of these 2,000 workers will be in a position where they will be forced to retire at 65 years, arising from long-standing contractual arrangements with their employers, but will be without a State pension on which to fall back. In some cases, they will, of course, be entitled to some form of occupational pension and, in others, some of them may, in fact, be able to find alternative work. In a great many cases, however, they will simply be left stranded. It will mean that many will be forced to sign on the dole for one year in order to have income support. They will face the ridiculous situation where, at the age of 65 years, after years of employment and, in some cases, a lifetime of unbroken employment, they will be forced to endure a gap year before the State will step in with a pension entitlement. They will be considered too old to work by their previous employer but too young to claim a pension from the State. As a recipient of jobseeker's benefit, they will be subjected to the same activation measures required of those genuinely seeking work.They will end up competing for work and training places with much younger jobseekers. The live register figures will be inflated next year, artificially raising our headline rate of unemployment. This is not just a problem in 2014 but will be a problem every year afterwards and will grow even worse as the retirement age is further extended. In 2011, the Government was forced by the troika to legislate to raise the pension age. I accept that there was nothing it could do about that. However, it has done very little since then to address the anomaly that has arisen as a result of that legislation. It is outrageous that the State would effectively turn its back on people who have worked all their lives and tell them that now they have reached the age of 65, they must go on the dole. This is a real insult to that group of people who, in many cases, have worked all their lives. They are very much the forgotten pensioners, ignored by both Departments responsible for labour law and social protection. I call on the Minister to ensure this issue is addressed before the abolition takes effect from January 2014. It is simply too insulting to those people involved and it is a disgrace that there is no plan in place to address this serious anomaly.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	365	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Social Protection. The sustainability of the pension system is a particular concern because of the demographic challenges Ireland faces, the associated increases in pension and other age-related costs and the deterioration in the public finances. The findings of the recently published actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund showed that the percentage of the population aged over 65 years is projected to increase from 11% of the total population in 2010 to 15% in 2020 and to 24% in 2060, that the pensioner support ratio is projected to decline from 5.3 workers for every individual over pension age in 2010 to 3.9 workers by 2020 and to 2.1 workers by 2060 and that in the medium to long term, pension-related expenditure will account for an increasing proportion of fund expenditure, rising from 57% in 2011 to 85% in 2066. This means that in the future, the task of financing increased pension spending will fall to a diminishing share of the population. The State pension transition is paid for a maximum of 12 months and is currently available to people who retire from work on reaching age 65, provided they satisfy the necessary PRSI contributions and are retired from insurable employment. This pension was introduced in 1970 when it was known as the retirement pension. It was designed to bridge the gap between the standard social welfare pension age, which at that time was 70 years of age, and retirement age. Over time, the age for State pension contributory pension was reduced to 66 years, with State pension transition being payable at age 65. This will now change in 2014 as provided for in the Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2011, to which the Deputy referred. In 2014, State pension age will be standardised at age 66 and State pension transition will cease to be paid. In addition, the age at which the State pension contributory will be payable will increase to 67 years from 2012 and to 68 years from 2028. This decision to increase State pension age was taken in the context of changing demographics and the fact that people are living longer and healthier lives and is one of a number of measures implemented to improve the sustainability of pensions for the future. The abolition of the State pension transition removes the associated retirement condition which acts as an incentive to leave the workforce. This has been widely criticised as a barrier to older people remaining in employment. There is no such retirement condition attached to State pension contributory. In terms of the overall numbers impacted from the abolition of the State pension transition in 2014, an analysis of 2012 figures for the State pension transition indicates that an average of just 13% of those awarded the State pension transition came from employment in the period immediately prior to the receipt of this payment. A significant proportion - 51% - was already in receipt of a social welfare payment prior to claiming the State pension transition. A similar result emerged from an analysis of 2011 the State pension transition recipients. This would indicate that a significant number of people have already left employment well in advance of pension age. It also reflects the fact that there is no statutory retirement age in Ireland. In terms of financial supports, social welfare benefits will continue to be available to the age of 66 for those who are contractually obliged to leave employment. Also, existing legislation provides that jobseekers whose benefit expires in their 65th year will continue to be paid benefit up until the age of 66. In order to improve pension sustainability and adequacy in the future, it is recognised that in line with increases in pension age, people should have the opportunity and be encouraged to work longer. In the employment relationship, responsibility for setting retirement age is a matter for the employer-employee relationship and the contract of employment. However, it is recognised that the range of policy areas which influence working and retirement decisions fall within the remit of a range of Departments and require a co-ordinated response if labour market participation rates and effective retirement ages of older workers are to improve. In this regard, an interdepartmental working and retirement group chaired by the Department of Social Protection is currently considering cross-departmental policy issues that may support longer working and thereby improve the sustainability and adequacy of pensions systems. This group, which includes the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Justice and Equality and Defence, is considering the broad range of issues impacting on the labour market participation of older workers and will prepare preliminary proposals detailing measures which may encourage participation and retention in the labour market of older workers. As social structures in Ireland are changing rapidly, the structures of our social support need to change to accommodate this. The standardisation of the State pension age at age 66 in 2014 is one of the measures planned which aims to improve the sustainability of the Irish pension system.

I said that there was a need for a plan to be devised to deal with this anomaly. The Minister of State knows from his own background that people have contractual arrangements whereby they are required to retire at 65. The State is abolishing the State pension transition so people are being left high and dry between the ages of 65 and 66. Does the Minister of State believe it is fair that the State turns its back on people when they are forced to retire at the age of 65 who may have worked their entire lives from 16 or 17 years of age, may have unbroken work records of 48 or 49 years and paid into the social insurance fund for all of those years? Does he believe this situation should arise because it will arise for about 2,000 people and increasing numbers from next January? I am asking him to give an assurance today that the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection will devise a plan to deal with this very unfair anomaly which will arise next January.

Any particular proposal as to what such a plan might contain should be put to that working group. I understand the issue raised by the Deputy but the legislation is there and the decision has been made in that regard.
#AnneFerris	unknown-#AnneFerris-party	unknown-#AnneFerris-dob	unknown-#AnneFerris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	369	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topical issue as it is one that must be dealt with the greatest urgency. The Irish Heart Foundation has been running a campaign to safeguard Guthrie cards over ten years old which are scheduled to be destroyed by 31 March. These cards, which number nearly one million, are very important as they contain priceless genetic information, including the ability to identify those at risk of sudden cardiac death. I understand the decision to destroy them came about because they were in breach of data protection legislation. I certainly respect that a person's data are of the utmost importance and must be protected. However, I do not believe the correct balance has been struck on this matter. The arbitrary destruction of these cards is too extreme a response and I call for it to be suspended. Recent polling illustrates that the HSE's information campaign has been ineffective with only 12% of the population aware that the cards are to be destroyed. It is clear that the crucial issue of genetic diagnosis was not addressed in the policy review.The human tissue Bill could take account of both the data protection requirements and the need to protect the Guthrie cards by providing for an opt-out system. Other countries such as New Zealand, Sweden and Denmark have legislated to protect these cards. This unique bio-bank of vital genetic data should not be destroyed. I urge the Minister of State not to allow this to happen.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	370	I endorse everything Deputy Ferris has said. The deadline is 31 March but I ask the Minister of State to consider rowing back on that deadline and entering into further discussions about data protection. I do not think the full import of the destruction of these cards has been considered. It would be a very great loss of genetic information in the context of modern technology and advances in genetic and DNA diagnostics. Once these cards are destroyed we will never be able to recover that information. The Irish Heart Foundation has strong views on this issue, explaining that these samples contain priceless genetic information that can be used to identify people at risk of sudden cardiac death. Unless the destruction is halted, we will lose the only remaining opportunity to obtain a genetic diagnosis for the extended family members of more than 1,000 infants, children and young adults who were victims of sudden cardiac death. Those cards are in the possession of the State. Cardiac conditions which may be fatal if untreated could go undetected with the destruction of these cards. As Deputy Ferris pointed out, an opt-out system is available in other countries; the destruction of a card is only done at the request of the owner. I am convinced that most people do not know this is being planned. This debate may be of benefit in raising awareness of what is going to happen if the deadline is not extended beyond 31 March 2013. An extension would at least allow people to request the retention of these cards if that is possible.  I urge an extension of the deadline and further discussion. As Deputy Ferris said, the human tissue Bill may be a legislative mechanism for addressing this issue to ensure that this very important body of DNA information is retained rather than destroyed. Such destruction could cost lives, particularly considering the advances in DNA and genetic diagnostics.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	371	I am about to read the official reply but I do not disagree with any of the points made by the Deputies. I thank Deputies Anne Ferris and Billy Kelleher for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to update the House following on the update provided to the Seanad last month by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Dinny McGinley. As Deputies will be aware, the national newborn screening programme tests thousands of children annually to identify medical conditions which, if untreated, result in severe physical, mental, or developmental harm. The screening programme offers the opportunity to intervene and dramatically alter a child's life course. Screening cards for newborn children taken between 1984 and 2002 were retained without the informed consent of the parents or guardians of the children. Consequently, there is no written consent for the retention or use of these cards for research or other purposes. In late 2009, the Data Protection Commissioner received a complaint from a member of the public about the retention of newborn screening cards. The basis of the complaint, which was upheld by the Data Protection Commissioner, was that newborn screening cards should not be retained indefinitely without consent as this breached the Data Protection Acts 1998 and 2003. The Data Protection Commissioner stated: "[I]t is important to make clear that the position that developed was unlawful and could not be allowed to continue." Following the ruling, a series of meetings were held between the deputy Data Protection Commissioner, representatives from my Department, the Health Service Executive and the Children's University Hospital, Temple Street, which resulted in a number of changes to the national newborn blood spot screening programme. It was agreed with the Data Protection Commissioner that in order to comply with data protection legislation, cards older than ten years would be destroyed. I reiterate there is no written consent from parents for the retention or use of these cards for research or other purposes. My colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, requested the HSE to conduct a review of the decision to destroy these cards, following receipt of representations from a number of people and organisations which pointed out their potential value for research. I understand that the issue is to be dealt with at a meeting on 28 March, in advance of the deadline of 31 March 2013. The review examined both the legal and ethical basis for the retention of newborn screening cards and the potential use of the existing cards for research purposes. The report and recommendations of the review group were submitted in January 2012. The review reaffirmed the original decision reached in 2010 that in order to meet both our ethical and legal obligations, newborn screening cards older than ten years should be destroyed. Following careful consideration, this recommendation was accepted. The review group also explored how the cards could be made available to the research community in a way that is compatible with ethical and legal obligations. In the interest of facilitating research, the HSE launched a public information campaign on 8 January 2013. This campaign offered members of the public the opportunity to have their screening cards returned to them prior to any destruction of the cards. This campaign will run until 31 March 2013, after which the retrieval procedure will begin. The length of time it takes will depend on how many cards are to be returned. However, no material will be destroyed before all requests have been processed. My colleague, the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, is seeking information from the HSE as to the effectiveness of its campaign to ensure people have been adequately informed of their rights. The results of the Red C poll on the effectiveness of the campaign are quite telling.

She is correct that the Red C poll shows that only 12% of the population are aware that the cards are to be destroyed. This is a telling statistic which is a reason for the deadline to be extended. The importance of these cards cannot be overestimated. Information supplied by the Irish Heart Foundation today states that the Dutch Parliament is currently reviewing legislation to protect future Guthrie cards. Ten years ago, the Dutch Government ordered the destruction of similar cards, and this decision has been regretted ever since. We do not want to be in the same situation in ten years' time. Measures could be included in the human tissue Bill. I ask the Minister of State to say how the issue will be dealt with on 28 March.

The Red C poll showing a figure of 12% awareness is indicative. We all live by Red C polls in this House. It is clear that the information campaign is not resonating with the public. Conditions such as haemochromatosis and risks such as sudden cardiac death could be identified from the DNA information on these cards. I understand the complexity and constraints of the issue. I urge the Minister of State to see if the deadline can be extended. Perhaps the Attorney General could advise whether the human tissue Bill could be a means of addressing this issue. We could very easily regret the destruction of such a significant body of information, which could be of great benefit to the generations coming after us. I urge caution in this regard. I ask the Minister of State to use all possible mechanisms between now and 31 March. As the Red C poll has shown, nobody knows that this is happening.

The Joint Committee on Health and Children will be dealing with the issue in detail on 28 March. It is important that this meeting is being held in advance of the deadline of 31 March 2013. It is very difficult to deal with an issue retrospectively. However, we need to consider further how to deal with it.The Data Protection Commissioner indicated that the situation which has developed is unlawful. Our job is to deal with legislation and make things either lawful or unlawful. That is what we do every day of the week. The information contained on the cards in question relates to matters about which we do not even know yet. It is an incredible resource, particularly in the context of any developments which might take place in the future in respect of diabetes, liver disease and - as the Irish Heart Foundation has pointed out - cardiac-related issues. Imagine what would be the position if it were possible to check the records to see who might have a predisposition to sudden adult death syndrome and to discover how we might deal with it. The type of resource that is available in this instance is both unique and incredible. We must examine how we can ensure that this resource will be protected. Perhaps the way to proceed is by introducing an opt-out clause. This is a very serious matter and we should not be rushed into dealing with it. We should take on board the Data Protection Commissioner's opinion but we must also consider how we can protect the resource.

During the past 18 months I have been involved in numerous meetings with representatives from South Dublin County Council, the National Roads Authority, NRA, and other interested parties, including community groups, Dublin Bus and the Garda traffic corps, in respect of a serious and emerging issue, namely, the bottleneck on the N4 at the Palmerstown intersection. I have long been an advocate of free-flow traffic systems at peak times. I am sure the Minister of State is aware that in the region of 60,000 vehicles pass through the Palmerstown junction at peak times each day. This is a major junction of great significance. If there is an accident or a traffic light malfunction at this major junction if weather conditions are bad, this can give rise to widespread disruption in Palmerstown itself and in the surrounding areas such as Lucan, Kilcock, Maynooth, etc. Traffic coming from the city centre can also be adversely affected. This junction is so significant that it regularly features on AA Roadwatch reports. An extremely serious development which has taken place at the junction recently came to my attention. This development came to light following meetings in which I was involved and requests I made. I hosted a number of meetings which were attended by two senior officials from the NRA and a senior official from South Dublin County Council. Those individuals pointed out that in the context of the free-flow arrangements which obtain on the M50, entering and exiting the motorway at Palmerstown depends on traffic light sequence at the junction to which I refer. More alarming, I have learned that the traffic management system at the junction is likely to crash soon because the relevant equipment - computer relays, ducting and cables - has reached end-of-life phase. If this issue is not resolved quite quickly, it will have a profound impact on traffic not only in the Palmerstown and Lucan areas but also throughout the city. In order to ensure that this matter does not reach crisis point - particularly in the context of its impact on the emergency services, on employment and on businesses in Palmerstown, which could suffer as a result of delays caused - the junction must be upgraded quite quickly. I wish to read into the record a quote I came across when carrying out research recently, namely, "should these signals fail and work becomes necessary in an unplanned manner, there would be major capacity restraints which would adversely affect the flow both to and from Dublin City and would result in the possibility of traffic queuing onto the M50 as well as affecting traffic flow along Kennelsfort Road where considerable and commercial industrial development takes place". The downgrading of the N4 at the Palmerstown junction has resulted in the NRA not funding the essential equipment that is necessary. The experts state that we are sitting on a ticking time bomb. The reality is that the previous Government did not make any provision for the upgrading of the traffic management system in Palmerstown. It has been left to us to do so and we must find a solution because the likely outcome is completely unacceptable. As already stated, that outcome will have an impact not just on the immediate area but also on Dublin city and surrounding areas. I would be very grateful if the Minister of State would give this matter some consideration.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	377	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar. The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources, supplemented by State road grants. The particular section of road to which the Deputy refers was recently downgraded from national road status, previously the N4, to regional road status, now the R148. There have been very large reductions in roads expenditure over the past number of years and there will be further reductions in the coming years. Let us contrast the figure for 2007, when there were grants of €607 million available towards regional and local roads, with that for this year, when the level of the grants has fallen to €349 million. I am sure the House can see that in light of the current financial position, the main focus must be on the maintenance and repair of roads in which we have already invested and that this will remain the position in the coming years. The reality with regard to funding means that in all areas of activity, priorities have to be set. In this regard, it should be noted that the initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is a matter for the local authority. In July last year, the NRA invited applications in respect of consideration for funding under the specific improvement grant scheme. Local authorities were asked to ensure that their total cost of applications did not exceed their 2012 grant allocations. That would allow South Dublin County Council to apply for funding of €800,000 under this grant category. The R148 project was not among the priority projects submitted by the council within the expenditure limit allowed. South Dublin County Council may fund the project in question from its discretionary grant. It has been allocated €736,775 under this grant category for 2013. In addition, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport recently wrote to local authorities offering them more flexibility in their regional and local road grants. Councils have the opportunity to use up to 30% of their restoration improvement grants and reallocate it to their discretionary grants. In South Dublin County Council's case, this will amount to €556,641 should it wish to avail of the flexibility to which I refer. That would bring the total discretionary grant available to the council to €1,293,416. It is appreciated that many local authorities are in a position where they are trying to implement savings. However, it is important to reiterate that the role of Exchequer grants in the context of regional and local roads is to supplement councils such as South Dublin County Council in their spending in this area. The reality is that the available funds do not match the amount of work required. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and local authorities are working closely to develop new and more efficient ways of delivering the best outputs possible with the funding available to them. Given the likely continued squeeze on Exchequer funding, this concentration on efficiency is essential in order to achieve the best outturns for the limited moneys available.

I fully understand the situation in which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Government find themselves. If the funds had been made available or if the previous Government had invested wisely, an underpass would have been built at Palmerstown on the N4. Such an underpass would have been similar to that which was put in place on the same road at the Newcastle Road interchange and which has proven to be very successful. The Minister of State and I both served on South Dublin County Council and we are aware of the constraints under which it is operating. From the discussions in which I have been involved, I am aware that the local authority - for the reasons I have outlined - sees this matter as a priority. As stated earlier, we are sitting on a time bomb and I do not want to think about the consequences when the traffic management system at the Palmerstown junction crashes. In light of the significance of the traffic management system to which I refer, South Dublin County Council has applied for a separate grant of €300,000. I would be very happy to obtain further information in respect of that matter and pass it on to the Department.I hope the Government will be able to assist us because the local authority does not have the resources. The money is required to upgrade this road because of its significance to the greater Dublin area.

It is an excellent local authority but, as was acknowledged by the Deputy, it must operate within the constraints that face it, and all of us. In so far as it is regarded as a priority by South Dublin County Council - the Deputy said that was the case, and I have no doubt it is a priority - there are always competing priorities. The council will have to bring forward its application in the same way as any other council, within the parameters of the rules and opportunities that apply to Exchequer funding, as I set out in the reply. I take the point the Deputy has made, but the response clearly sets out the position.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	382	I repeat, for the sake of continuity, that the ARF options were later extended to all holders of additional voluntary contributions. Today, retiring individuals in defined contribution pension arrangements still have the option to purchase an annuity, but as an alternative they can draw down their remaining pension pot, after taking the tax-free retirement lump sum, by way of a taxable lump sum, or invest it in an approved retirement fund, ARF. I will continue now with the briefing note. Withdrawals from ARFs are liable to income tax at the ARF owner's marginal income tax rate and to universal social charge, USC, in the same way that regular pension income from an annuity is so liable. The options to invest in an ARF or take a taxable lump sum are subject to conditions. These are that the individual must be over 75 years of age or, if under that age, he or she must have a guaranteed level of pension income in payment for life at the point of retirement. The level of this guaranteed pension income was set at the equivalent of €12,700 per annum on the introduction of the ARF option in 1999. If an individual cannot meet the guaranteed pension income requirement and does not wish to purchase a pension annuity, he or she must invest in an approved minimum retirement fund, AMRF. The amount required to be invested in an AMRF was set, on the introduction of the ARF option, at the lower of €63,500 or the remainder of the individual's pension pot after the tax-free lump sum has been taken. In essence, an AMRF is a very restrictive type of ARF in that, once invested, the capital in an AMRF cannot generally be accessed until the individual reaches 75 years of age or meets the guaranteed pension income requirement before then, at which point the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF. Income generated by the AMRF investments can be drawn down and the capital in an AMRF is available at any time for an individual to purchase a pension annuity should he or she wish to do so. These arrangements are all about giving individuals choices depending on their particular circumstances. The Finance Act 2011, as well as extending the ARF option to members of defined contribution pension schemes in respect of their main benefits from those schemes, also increased the guaranteed pension income requirement for ARF purposes from €12,700 to the current value of €18,000 currently and the maximum set-aside amount for AMRF purposes from €63,500 to the current value of €119,800. As mentioned, these limits had not been changed since the introduction of the ARF option in 1999. As these changes were introduced with immediate effect from the passing of the Finance Act 2011 on 6 February 2011, they had an impact on individuals retiring after that date by requiring them to meet a higher guaranteed pension income threshold for ARF purposes or, where they did not meet the guaranteed pension income test, invest a higher amount in an AMRF. The impact of these changes was felt much more severely by those with modest pension pots. By way of illustration, it is much more onerous for an individual with a pension pot of, say, €200,000, who, after taking a 25% tax-free lump sum of €50,000, must place almost €120,000 in an AMRF to be locked away until he or she reaches the age of 75 in order to be able to place the remaining €30,000 in an ARF than it is for an individual with a pension pot of, say, €1 million to comply with the same requirements. As mentioned during the Committee Stage debate, I received many representations, including from the Pensions Ombudsman, about the fact that these changes were introduced without the provision of adequate transitional arrangements. It has been put to me that it is unfair that many individuals who had been planning for retirement based on the original requirements of the legislation were suddenly faced, and indeed continue to be faced, with having to meet much more stringent conditions without any time to prepare for them. That is the reason I have decided to reinstate the old limits of €12,700 and €63,500 in respect of ARF options exercised on or after the date of the passing of the Finance Act 2013. It is intended that the higher guaranteed pension and set-aside limits introduced by the Finance Act 2011 will be put in place again in three years' time, which will give individuals preparing for their retirement after that period time to adjust to these more stringent higher requirements. In addition, to ensure that individuals who were affected by the higher limits in the period since the passing of the Finance Act 2011 - that is, since 6 February 2011 - are not disadvantaged, I am making two other changes in subsection (6) of section 17. First, I am providing that where such individuals have guaranteed pension income of at least €12,700 on or after the date of the passing of the Finance Bill, any AMRF they have immediately becomes an ARF, and second, even if they do not have a guaranteed pension income of that amount, if they have set aside in an AMRF a capital amount greater than €63,500, the amount above €63,500 immediately becomes an ARF. Similar provisions are made to deal with situations in which an individual retains his or her pension pot in a vested PRSA rather than exercising the ARF option. Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendments Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive, would deny these changes and are a natural consequence to his amendment No. 5, which seeks to retain the more stringent ARF access amounts. For all these reasons, I cannot recommend these amendments.

There is no guarantee that the Minister will be sitting in that chair in three years' time. My point is that the legislation does not provide for that. Unless I have missed it, the legislation does not state that this is a transitional arrangement; the Minister might point to such a statement if I have missed it. In three years' time, if a finance Minister does not do what the Minister has indicated is the intention, there will be no transitional arrangement and we will be back at square one. Can the Minister reassure me that that is not the case?

To include a commitment that something will be done or something will automatically happen in three years' time does not meet the needs of the House. Three years is a long time and, as the Deputy said, it is unlikely that I will be sitting here then. There could be a change of Government or a change of personnel. It is important that in important situations the House exercises its will by way of primary legislation.I do not want a situation where one arrangement falls out and another falls in on the basis of a line in a Bill. The record will show what the intention was when we made the provision. The Department of Finance will have it on file and the incoming Minister in three years time will be advised. It will then be up to the next Administration to decide whether it will do what we committed to do. One cannot tie in subsequent Administrations by a legislative provision.

We have dealt with such sections within the Bill. Provisions on the taxation of third level fees deal not only with taxation this year but consider the policy of the Government to increase fees incrementally over the next number of years. The Minister has allowed for that in the Bill even though that policy has not been implemented. I raise this matter because we are in dicey territory. There was a reason the limits were set and the Minister appears to agree with them as he has indicated an intention to bring them back to the same level in three years time. He said it was unfair in terms of the transition which I can understand. I do not dispute that people got a shock. My point is about provision in legislation for a sunset clause. We all know that such clauses are included in legislation time and time again. It is not just a statement. If I was out there next year and was unaware of the conversation that took place here or on Committee Stage and started to look at the situation with PRSAs, I would see what the limits are. I would not see that the limits will only be the limits for 2013, 2014 and 2015. That is what is missing. If a Minister for Finance makes the adjustment in 2015 or 2016 to increase this, one will have the exact same situation regarding the ombudsman that no transitional arrangements were put in. There was a statement from the Minister but no transitional arrangements are made. It is an area of concern. I highlight it again. It is something that will have to be revisited whether in the Bill before us or in a future finance Bill. While the amendment proposes to leave the limits as they are, we should at least provide to bring them back to the original level. It would be up to a future Government to decide to reduce them once again, if it so wished. If the intention is to increase them to that point, that should be stated in the Bill through a sunset clause or a specific reference.

I am providing them with notice now that the higher limits will return in three years time. It provides rational people with the opportunity to plan to make provision for their pension schemes. A future Minister may change that. Deputy Doherty drew a parallel with the taxation of the student contribution for higher education. In respect of that provision, I was merely following the policy decision made by the Minister for Education and Skills who carried it forward to 2015. It was therefore appropriate for me to carry it forward on the tax treatment to 2015 also.

Yesterday and today, the House has debated a Sinn Féin motion on job creation. It is one of the major issues which must be resolved to get our people back to work. Schemes like this one can play a central role to provide opportunities for businesses and for people to get back to meaningful employment. This scheme originated from similar schemes which first surfaced in 2003. Certificates must be issued in respect of all schemes. In respect of these schemes, 335 certificates have been issued. There is clearly an issue with all of the schemes. There have been reviews and evaluations of previous schemes but there is also an issue with this one. Sinn Féin has spoken to people at the coal face including on county enterprise boards who are unaware that the scheme exists. We are not seeking to have the scheme scrapped but rather to examine it to see what are its deficiencies, where we can strengthen it, how to get the best out of it and to determine if it is fit for purpose. The scheme is being extended in the Bill in small areas but before we look at it further we need a proper review. Given that the scheme commenced in 2011, sufficient time will have passed in the next year to have an evaluation to ground an informed decision as to how and where the scheme should be improved.

I do not have a full year's statistics available on the impact of the incentive. Last year, I reviewed the film relief scheme and on foot of that made substantial changes to the operation of film relief in the Bill. My Department has commenced a review of the research and development tax credit this year. The review will consider the design and structure of the credit and the contribution of research and development to productivity and growth. The employment and investment incentive and seed capital scheme will be reviewed in due course. It is too early for it to be subject to a review now. I draw the attention of Deputies to the economic impact assessment which was completed by my officials before the new incentive was introduced. The review is available on the Department of Finance website. When introduced, the incentives retained the original expiry date for the business expansion scheme of 31 December 2013. The extension of the incentive is subject to State-aid approval by the European Commission. In that regard, it is important that the application for the extension of the incentive be made without delay. My Department will commence the application process shortly. A review would, of necessity, delay such an application. I do not consider it appropriate to include a commitment to examine and review any incentive in the legislative base as reviews are normally completed as part of the annual budget and Finance Bill process. For these reasons, I cannot accept the Deputy's proposed amendment.

My request is to carry out the review in advance of budget 2014. It is a scheme which has seen only 335 certificates issue since 2003. Any companies applying must have a clearance certificate from Enterprise Ireland. It is not a massive scheme. Its parent schemes have not worked and we do not know if this one is working. The Minister will have sufficient information by autumn 2013. I am not asking for bells and whistles. The scheme could play a part in getting people back to work.We teased this issue out on Committee Stage. Not only should the Government have access to information, the Opposition should also have access to it. I ask the Minister to carry out an analysis on the strengths, weaknesses, deficiencies and possibilities of the investment incentive and seed capital scheme before 2014 in order that we can measure how best to deal with it in next year's finance Bill if the need arises. The Department carried out reviews of the film relief, but that is not the type of review we are talking about. The amount of tax forgone is nothing near that. It is a different type of review. I am not opposed to the scheme, but there is a problem with its parent schemes and there is potentially a problem with this scheme given the lack of knowledge about it.

Section 31 provides for a scheme of accelerated capital allowances for the provision of facilities for the purposes of the maintenance, repair and overhaul of commercial aircraft, and it is intended to apply for a five-year period, commencing by ministerial order. These capital allowances, in the form of industrial buildings allowances, will allow for the write-off of qualifying expenditure over seven years and will be subject to the normal conditions and restrictions that apply to the use of such allowances by investors in projects of this type. This is a targeted relief and has the potential to encourage a very promising industrial sector from the perspective of long-term high-quality job creation. During the debate on Committee Stage, I undertook to consider whether this relief could be extended to the area of aircraft dismantling for the purpose of salvaging and recycling of aircraft parts and materials, in addition to the activities already allowed under the legislation as drafted. This is referred to as parting out in the industry. A strong case was made by Deputies Mulherin and Naughten that such an extension would be of benefit, particularly to Knock airport. Having considered the matter, I am satisfied that an extension of the capital allowances relief to this sector would be beneficial. For these reasons, I am proposing amendments Nos. 12a and 14a to section 31. The extension is to apply generally and will not be restricted to Knock airport. There are two amendments, the first of which provides for the extension of the relief. The second allows for commencement by ministerial order of the different elements to be done at different times. During the debate on Committee Stage, it was put to me that the various restrictions on the use of such allowances should be relaxed for this relief in order to make it more attractive. I indicated during the debate that I was not disposed to agree to that, and I repeat that point. This is a generous relief and there is no need to make it any more generous. I commend the amendments to the House. I trust Deputy Naughten will consider amendment No. 13 to have been dealt with. Deputy Pearse Doherty wishes me to report to the House within three months of the coming into operation of the section on its impact on regional airports and rectify any distortions to competition that it may have caused. The Government regularly examines supports for all sectors of the economy as part of the annual budget and finance Bill process. The relief provided for in the section is available for these activities at any airport. Nothing in the legislation restricts the relief to any particular airport. The amendment I have introduced widening the scope of the relief to salvage operations will also be available without restriction to any of our airports. It is not necessary to put into legislation commitments of the kind suggested, certainly not in advance of the section's coming into operation. The legislation is framed in such a way as to avoid the kind of competitive distortion that Deputy Doherty is concerned about. I do not anticipate such a problem at this stage but I intend to keep the relief under review over the period of its operation to ensure it operates properly. In that way, I can make whatever changes seem necessary and there will be an opportunity for any such proposals to be debated in the House. I am not prepared to accept amendment No. 16.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	394	I seek clarification on amendment No. 12a. Deputy Michelle Mulherin has been pushing the issue and is to be commended. It is a useful amendment. Why is the amendment structured in this way, in contrast to the amendment I submitted? The objective behind it is to ensure that if Ireland West Airport wanted to build, for example, a hangar to dismantle end-of-life aircraft, it could do so and avail of the incentive. Up to now, the legislation was drafted in such a way that it would not facilitate this. The Minister has broken the section into subparagraphs (i) and (ii) and has made provision for the subsections to be implemented at different stages. The original intent of section 33 was to be an incentive to Shannon Airport, and it was constructed in such a way that only Shannon Airport could avail of it. Deputy Mulherin and I asked the Minister why that should happen, and the authorities of Knock airport have also written to the Minister and explained the difficulty with the structure of section 33. In light of the reasoning behind the original incentive - to support Shannon Airport - it seems the way in which the amendment is structured will allow the Minister to tell Shannon Airport to construct its hangars for maintenance, repair and overhaul of aircraft while holding off on the second element, the dismantling of aircraft, until a future date. Subsection (2) facilitates such phasing. Why has the Minister decided to go down that road rather than accepting the all-encompassing amendment I proposed so that the overall maintenance of aircraft and the dismantling of aircraft were provided for in the same order? Is the objective of this to treat all airports equally? The Minister said the reason for the inclusion of aircraft dismantling was to facilitate the request made by Deputy Michelle Mulherin and articulated by her in respect of Knock airport. Why has the Minister taken this approach? Amendment No. 15, which deals with Ireland West Airport, has been ruled out of order, but the sentiments are expressed in amendment No. 16, tabled by Deputy Pearse Doherty.A concern has been raised by Ireland West Airport, Knock, about the way in which this section is structured. I agree with the Minister that it is a generous amendment but that is only the case if an airport has a substantial income in the first place. Given the change in the structure and ownership of Shannon Development, Shannon Estates will now come under the control of Shannon Airport. There is a substantial landbank there and Shannon Airport has a substantial rental income on an annual basis. The way in which this amendment is drafted facilitates Shannon Airport. I have no difficulty in facilitating Shannon Airport. We want to see a thriving airport in Shannon; it has always been a linchpin of tourism development in our region. However, what we seek is a level playing field. A commitment was given at the time the original announcement was made regarding the restructuring of Shannon Development and Shannon Airport that any incentives that would be made available would be accessible on an equal basis to all airports. However, the difficulty is that the way in which this section is structured does not allow Knock airport to avail of the incentives. In order to avail of them, an airport must have a substantial rental income in its own right. As Knock airport does not have a rental income and is servicing a debt of €10 million, which it is doing successfully, it is not possible for it to raise the necessary capital to invest in its hangars. It cannot offset such investment against rental income in the way Shannon Airport can. To put it in plain English, if tomorrow morning Shannon Airport were to invest €7 million in the development or refurbishment of hangars at a 4% interest rate over a seven-year period, that would constitute a direct subvention of €1.75 million to the airport. It would set Ireland West Airport at a strategic disadvantage compared to Shannon Airport in attracting in that type of investment. I would welcome such investment coming into Shannon, but all we are looking for is a level playing field. The Minister made the argument on Committee Stage that he did not want to establish an incentive scheme that could be exploited, as has happened in the past. I believe we would all agree that is not the way we want to go. This provision is specifically for aviation facilities and therefore it cannot be exploited to any great extent. Credit needs to be given to Ireland West Airport, which has increased its passenger numbers by 350% during the past decade, thereby supporting some 900 jobs in the region with very little Government subvention to date. It seeks a slight change in the legislation as it is currently proposed which would allow unused capital allowances to be made available against an investor's other income, specifically in regard to aviation facilities, as outlined in the legislation. That would ensure that Knock airport would be treated on an equal basis to Shannon Airport and that it too could attract investment. I ask the Minister, when responding, to address two further issues. One is the correspondence he has received from Ireland West Airport, Knock; I ask him to specifically outline the Department's position on that. The other is the Government's position on a development plan that was submitted by Knock airport to the previous Government, which failed to act on it, and which is now on the desk of the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. This needs to be acted on. It could potentially create 500 new jobs in a region that is an unemployment black spot. This ties in with the amendment tabled by Deputy Doherty.

Bhí sé ar mo chúl agus ní fhaca mé é. Sílim go bhfuil léargas maith ó thaobh na ceiste seo curtha os comhair an Aire ag an Teachta Naughten agus ag an Teachta Mulherin as Contae Mhaigh Eo.  Bíonn daoine ar fud an iar-thuaiscirt ag déanamh freastail ar an aerphort seo. Cé go bhfuil aerphort againn i nDún na nGall fosta bainimid go leor usáide as an aerphort i gCnoc Mhuire.

Cosúil le Teachtaí eile, fuair mé litreacha ón aerphort ag iarraidh orainn leasú a chur síos ar an mBille. Ní aontaím le gach rud atá ráite ins na litreacha sin. Like other Deputies and the Minister, I have received correspondence from Ireland West Airport, Knock. In terms of some of the issues it has asked to be considered, I am not 100% sure that what is proposes is the best approach. However, what I am sure about is that this section should not disadvantage Ireland West Airport, Knock. That is the reason I asked that a review or report be commissioned to examine this section to ascertain whether it places Knock airport at a disadvantage. The case was put very well by Deputy Naughten. I heard what the Minister said on Committee Stage - namely, that this section was devised for Shannon Airport because there is a market there that we need to grasp. I raised concerns about the aviation sector on Committee Stage and said that we need an in-depth examination of the sector to establish whether we are getting bang for our buck. I spelled out the position with regard to the aviation leasing sector to the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, on Committee Stage. Some 50% of aviation leasing occurs in this State. The value of the aviation leasing sector to the State is €80 billion. The sector has a stock of 3,000 commercial aeroplanes, yet it employs only 1,000 people. It is not a labour-intensive sector. The question is whether we are getting bang for our buck. What we have in the Bill is a specific identification of another market this country can grab, so to speak, in the same way we grabbed the aviation leasing sector. That is to be welcomed, but we must make sure we get a return. We must make sure also that we do not disadvantage other airports. I have nothing against the Government's having a policy position that identifies niche areas for different airports. In some respects, that is a positive development - for example, if there is a certain area into which an airport should develop. I welcome the Minister's amendment on the end-of-life treatment and dismantling of aircraft, where a niche can be found for Ireland West Airport. The major issue, however, is that this is an add-on, and the amendment is amending a section that is tailor-made for Shannon Airport to try to benefit Knock airport in respect of this area of activity. The section is specific to Shannon Airport and has been designed in the knowledge that Shannon has income in its own right, which Knock airport does not have.

He might correct me on that because one of the issues Knock airport has brought to my attention is that it does not have that additional income, and the way in which this section is devised means it will be unable to benefit from it. Section 23 relief needs to be consigned to the State's history books, but there must be other ways to ensure that Knock airport can benefit from this section. That is the reason I have proposed in my amendment that a report be completed on section 31, with a focus on its impact on regional airports, examining whether they are at an unfair disadvantage, and that the Minister consider proposals to rectify any distortions in competition.I heard what the Minister said about this being subject to state aid rules; therefore the European Commission will adjudicate on distortions in competition. There are, however, other areas with which the report can deal, specifically all of us in the House want Ireland West Airport and all our regional airports to flourish. Are there other tailor-made solutions or can we tweak this section a bit more to benefit the airport, recognising that the Minister has brought forward an amendment that possibly can benefit that airport?

I support Deputy Naughten and commend the Minister for the changes he has made. Deputy Mulherin has also put a great deal of work into this. The difficulty is that there is no fair play. It was always my contention that the deal announced for Shannon Airport before Christmas was going to put Ireland West Airport at a disadvantage. This amendment, and the Minister confirmed this to the Oireachtas Select Sub-Committee on Finance last week is motivated in the first instance by the prospect of revitalising Shannon Airport through having these services. Knock is in a position to do the same but it is not in the same development position. As well as handing the advantages of this amendment to Shannon Airport we have handed it a rent roll through the former properties of Shannon Development. It can use the rental income-----

That is welcome. We have a chance to open up an industry here. Shannon is so much further developed than the other regional airports that they need to be given the status to get there too. None of us wants to go back to the days of section 23 but surely it is within the knowledge of the Department of Finance to come up with a scheme that will assist in aviation development and maintenance and create employment at any airport that has the skills to do so. There are very few airports that have the runways and space for this kind of operation. Knock happens to be one. As it has a 25 hectare site and the requisite runway size, it does not involve massive development. A few weeks ago the Taoiseach, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister of State for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ring, and Deputies Mulherin and O'Mahony came down in a blaze of glory to the airport. Deputy O'Mahony has been tasked with preparing a report. For Deputy Naughten's information I want to clarify that a report was prepared at the behest of the last Government. It targets aircraft maintenance and was presented to the last Government at the end of its term. It could be acted on straightaway. The Minister might clarify his contention that Shannon will not get an advantage. Would he consider giving a commitment that he will not commence this section until such time as the report on the future of Ireland West Airport, Knock, being prepared on the Taoiseach's wishes, is delivered some time in May? Then we can see what options that report outlines for developing employment and other industry around Knock Airport and if the section has to be further amended at that stage then surely we can do so. To commence this scheme and allow further advantage to another airport would be wrong in that vacuum.

I also acknowledge the contributions of Deputies Naughten and Calleary and other colleagues who support Knock. Already Knock has some small business in this area. It wants to grow that and build more hangars. Knock has been growing in leaps and bounds and we should pay heed when it identifies areas of concern that put future growth at risk and areas where it needs some State support. We definitely get value for money when anything is put into Knock. The evidence is there in its growth in spite of the odds, including at times political odds. Some of the amendments to this section have been disallowed. I support the spirit of Deputy Naughten's amendment although I understand that it cannot be considered. Deputy McGrath proposed that there be a report. I do not feel there is any great need for a report because that might just be procrastination. We need action. The Minister said on Committee Stage that this section was first drafted in the context of the development at Shannon Airport joining up with Shannon Development and the new company being formed so we know that Shannon was to the fore in the Minister's mind. He then acknowledged that it applies to all airports. The reality is that there will be no great benefit to other airports if they do not have the same profile and rental income as Shannon. I know the Minister will clarify this point. I have tabled several parliamentary questions which satisfy me that Shannon has rental income of approximately €6 million per annum with the potential to rise to between €10 million and €13 million. By virtue of that and the way this provision is structured the airport will be able to set off capital allowances in full against rental income on properties in the domain of Shannon Airport over a seven year period to its benefit. Knock Airport, because of its financial structure cannot get a loan to build hangars will not be able to avail of this provision so it is looking to outside investors. Knock tells us in its submission that it needs this provision to be more attractive to outside investors. That is our point, investors would be incentivised. On Committee Stage I put forward several proposals, one of which was a section 23. I can understand why the Minister would have reservations about that. There were other minor amendments which would be in keeping with the provision, which could be attended to, would be beneficial and fulfil Knock Airport's request. Parking the section 23 relief I asked that the Minister would consider this when he brings the Bill to the Seanad where he would have another opportunity to amend it. The Taoiseach is aware of this. I have written to him to suggest that the tax relief be available against other income and that the unused capital allowances would not be restricted to the life of the building but could be carried forward until used up. The capital allowances would not be deemed specified relief, which is used by high income individuals. These are not very far-reaching amendments. Shannon Airport has been accommodated but we do not want to be accused of favouritism. We should try to help Knock Airport. Now is the opportune time. The Minister has explained to us that this particular tax relief has to be approved by the European Commission. Now is the opportunity to amend it and forward it to the Commission. There is legitimate cause for concern because of the package put in place for Shannon and the potential adverse impact of this competition on Knock Airport following State intervention in another airport. I would like to see the amendments I have described made to this Finance Bill. They would assist the case. There is universal support for these amendments. Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil, and Independent Deputies support such a change. If we do not take some action in this sphere we are compounding the problems facing Knock Airport and throwing away an opportunity. I urge the Minister to consider this when the Bill comes before the Seanad.

I will tell him what I said. Any of the provisions in the Bill can be used by any airport. There is a tax break for any airport to build hangars and the apron outside a hangar. There is no tie-in with Shannon Airport. There is no suggestion the new Shannon Airport Authority will be the investor. This is a provision for private investors who might go to Shannon or any other airport to build hangars for aircraft refurbishment. It is a tax break for private investors. All this rigmarole about Shannon Airport having rented buildings around the airport has nothing to do with this. It would not be applied to rented buildings which represents income for the day-to-day running of the place because it had no other income for years. This is about private investors coming into airports. If Knock, Dublin, Cork or any other regional airport can attract the activity of refurbishment of aircraft as a business, wants to build hangars and aprons to facilitate this activity and if it can get investors to invest in it, it can do so. It will be on exactly the same basis as Shannon Airport. The only advantage Shannon Airport has is that historically it has had a small refurbishment industry which it is now trying to expand in its new circumstances where it has been separated from the Dublin Airport Authority and is receiving a mandate to secure its own future. If Knock Airport wants to build hangars and can attract the activity of aircraft refurbishment, it will receive the same tax breaks. There is no Shannon Airport-specific measure. This measure applies to all airports.

I had a specific question on how the amendment would be implemented. Will the Minister come back to it when he is wrapping up? It seems the first phase could benefit one airport over another. I accept the point the Minister has made on private investors. The section, as drafted, is aimed at structuring it for private investment in an airport. Has the Minister been given an indication that there are private investors willing to invest in this incentive as structured, or is this a speculative amendment in the hope there will be investment on that basis? Knock airport's concern is that it would not be able to attract private investors on the basis of the provision as structured. It believes the only airport that can avail of this incentive is Shannon Airport. To correct the record, on Committee Stage the Minister made the point that this section was motivated by the intention to revitalise Shannon Airport.

In fairness, on Committee Stage the Minister explained the incentive would be universally applicable to all airports, but he also stated it was designed specifically for Shannon Airport or that the airport would benefit potentially from it. Is there not a concern that Shannon Airport can do this on its own and does not require investors? Accordingly, the problem is that Ireland West Airport would need an investor, while Shannon Airport can do it on its own and use the capital allowances against its income. Will the Minister address that issue in his final reply?

There is nothing in the section that refers to a specific airport. The motivation for it was an incipient industry at Shannon Airport which the authority thought it could develop further. The second largest Russian airline, Transaero, has acquired an Aer Lingus hangar at Shannon Airport and is doing work in it. The company will go further under certain circumstances and it is a potential investor. However, it has made no commitment as yet. The aircraft refurbishment industry at Shannon Airport has the potential to expand. In that context, it is possible other investors will come in also. IDA Ireland has stated there is quite a lot of interest in this provision. It did not state, however, there was quite a lot of interest in locating at Shannon Airport. Instead, there is quite a lot of interest in locating in Ireland. This provision will apply at Dublin, Cork and Knock airports because I presume if one is flying in aircraft to refurbish them, one requires runways of a certain length. Accordingly, opening such a facility at a small regional airport would not be viable. Members know my position on development. With the difficult economic state in which we are, if there are ideas that have the possibility of creating investment and jobs, I am prepared to try them out. I want to try them out in a fair way that would not disadvantage anyone. There is no disadvantage in this provision for Knock airport. If it can attract an industry that refurbishes aircraft, it will receive the tax break to develop the hangars and pads, the same as any other airport. When the debate on this issue started on foot of correspondence from Ireland West Knock Airport, Deputies Michelle Mulherin and Denis Naughten, supported by Deputy Pearse Doherty, brought up the issue of another suite of proposals which would be specifically for Knock airport. It was a whole load of stuff to do with section 23, with which we are familiar, such as write-offs against rental income elsewhere. I am not introducing section 23 measures for Knock airport or any other place in the country. Another amendment was proposed which I thought was interesting. The case was made by Deputies Michelle Mulherin and Denis Naughten that the section restricted the refurbishment activity to the repair and overhaul of aircraft. That is what is happening where the industry has commenced at Shannon Airport. The intention of the work being carried out on the aircraft at Shannon Airport is that they will fly and carry passengers again.It has been pointed out that there is an opportunity for breaking down and recycling aircraft as well. In such cases the intention would be not to fly them again. There is an interest in establishing that operation in Knock and that is why we included the dismantling provision. Deputy Naughten asked why I did not accept his amendment and why I did it this way. It is normal enough that an idea comes from an Opposition Deputy and the Minister picks it up. Then he gets advice from his Department and from the drafting services. The Minister relies on that advice and rather than accepting the amendment as drafted he tries to ensure it is absolutely legally sound and drafted properly.

My question is why it was broken in two. It could be implemented at different times.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	428	It is broken in two because that was the drafting advice we got. There is no intention to commence them at different times; my intention is to commence them at the same time. The issue of the commencement order is to allow both of them to get through state aid provisions in Europe before they are commenced. I could try to commence them now but they do not have state aid permission and such a move would be quasi-legal if not downright illegal. I have to get them across the line in Europe before they become operational. I assure Deputy Naughten that any commencement order or orders will be numbered (I) and (II) and whether I need one or two it will be done on the same day. There is no issue with this. There is absolutely no discrimination. I wish Knock airport every success and I hope it is successful in attracting industry. The only advantage for those in Shannon is that they have an industry up-and-running in a small way and they are keen to build it up further. They believe they may have the potential to do so. The relief would involve consortia of investors. The high earners restriction will apply, the limit on sideways setting of capital allowances will apply and the termination of unused capital allowances will apply. Deputy Mulherin asked why I was putting in these restrictions. The reason is that I do not want tax reliefs abused in the way they were abused in the past. I do not want tax reliefs applied to an airport but used for buildings somewhere else in the country by means of a transfer of rental income for tax relief accrued at the airport building. I want it absolutely focused in order that the tax relief delivers on the purpose for putting it in our tax law in the first place. That is why these restrictions are in place. I am not going to introduce any section 23 incentives which would give rise to something west of Ireland Deputies should be familiar with, that is to say, all those buildings on the upper Shannon unused and empty. They were driven by tax breaks that were badly focused and I am not going down that road. I will help Shannon in any way I can-----

That is the business we are in. The west needs special assistance for development and if we can do it this way, well and good. However, a state aid issue will still arise. Several other questions arose about the leasing companies here. Deputy Doherty by implication questioned how much benefit they were to the economy. The leasing companies manage 20% of the world's passenger airplanes. Some 3,500 commercial aircraft are managed from Ireland and they are valued at more than €80 billion. There are 1,000 direct Irish jobs in aviation leasing and between 500 to 1,000 indirect jobs. SMBC Aviation Capital is based in Ireland and is the world's fourth largest aircraft leasing firm. ICBC Leasing Ireland, a subsidiary of Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the world's biggest bank by market capitalisation, manages €1.5 billion worth of aircraft assets from Ireland. The aviation sector generally contributed €4.1 billion or 2.6% of GDP and accounts for 26,000 direct jobs and 16,000 indirect jobs here. Ireland hosts Aviareto, the international registry body for aircraft, and it will remain here until 2016, further proof of Ireland's acknowledged leader status in the aerospace sector. IDA Ireland has indicated that there is considerable interest in companies establishing in Ireland and there is ongoing discussions with these companies. It has further advised of considerable interest in the air traffic control proposal coming from Ireland. The contribution of the aerospace industry to the economy in Ireland is significant. In 2007 the total corporation tax contribution from the industry was approximately €300 million. A further €135 million was injected into the economy in the form of expenditure on professional services and physical infrastructure, including rent, telecommunications and day-to-day expenditure. The expenditure generated approximately €4.9 million in VAT receipts. Clearly, there is a benefit to the economy. The refurbishment industry is likely to be more job-rich. If we could get the refurbishment industry going then there would be considerable engineering and technical employment, which is usually reasonably highly paid like other heavy industries, and it would be of benefit. If some business could be attracted to Knock I would be delighted and I hope there are plans in Knock to deal with it. There is one matter of concern which I do not wish to over-stress but I will mention it while Deputy Calleary is here. His colleague, Senator Marc MacSharry, lodged a complaint with the competition directorate in the European Commission in January following the measures announced in the budget for the aviation sector. He is basing his complaint on possible unfair treatment for Knock airport. Will Deputy Calleary deal with it privately or should I go to Deputy Timmy Dooley with it?

I challenge Deputy Calleary to point out anything in the legislation that cannot apply equally to Knock airport and Shannon airport. The threat to Knock is not from Shannon and the threat to Shannon is not from Knock. The threat is that those in a larger airport such as Dublin will use this and attract the refurbishment industry, and the best of luck to them because they have many advantages that the west does not have. That is where the threat comes from but it does not arise from anything we are putting into law. The law is treating all airports equally. What is going into law is applicable to all the airports. The airports must get out and try to attract investors in and, if they do, the best of luck to them, but it is a level playing field.

Amendment No. 17 provides for an analysis of the cost of tax expenditures and their impact on job creation, the volume of new start-up companies and the prevention of job losses. We have been looking for a provision of this nature for quite a while because it is appropriate that we examine the larger tax reliefs, in particular, to determine their cost to the State and whether they offer value for money and provide jobs. Not all tax reliefs provide jobs because some are focused on bringing in revenue. We need to get a proper picture of tax reliefs and whether they are working. I refer to the example of the special assignee relief programme, SARP, for which figures are not yet available one year later. It allowed high earning individuals coming from abroad to discount 30% of their income, up to €500,000, for tax purposes and provided a tax relief if they sent their children to private schools in the State. The programme remains in operation even though we do not know whether it has worked. After an appropriate period of time it is important that the cost of a tax relief be estimated. For all we know, 2,000 of these individuals could have landed in the State to have their children educated free in private schools. It is not that significant, because we would have heard about it otherwise, but as a substantial measure which the Government has linked to job creation, we should be able to evaluate its impact. I spoke earlier about the aviation leasing sector. There was a long discussion on this issue on Committee Stage and I am very supportive of the State's efforts to capture activity in that sector. Successive Finance Bills have provided incentives to the sector, including a measure contained in the Bill before us to which nobody in this House objects other than on the basis of achieving a level playing field. If we need to offer an incentive to attract jobs, let us do so. However, given that the leasing sector is valued at €80 billion, or 61% of GNP, the question arises of whether we are getting bang for our buck. Can we tweak the incentives to get a bit more from the sector without jeopardising what we already have or scaring off further investment? We need to know how much these tax expenditures cost. The Minister makes the argument that certain reliefs are so insignificant that they do not need to be costed, but a substantial number are not costed. When introducing a tax we have to find out, after a period of time, how much it is costing the State, because otherwise it is back-of-the-envelope stuff. We cannot afford to do that any longer. I proposed a period of three months in my Committee Stage amendment, but I appreciate that three months may not be appropriate, given the need to allow sufficient time to elapse. When the information becomes available after the following tax year, there is no reason the cost and impact of a tax expenditure should not be set out. We need to make a proper evaluation of tax expenditures. This is not an argument to get rid of all tax expenditure, because I hope I have made it clear that we have to incentivise certain sectors. However, we also have to know that the incentives are working and are not being abused. If we had had such a measure in the days of section 23 tax reliefs, perhaps we would not be dealing with the disaster of all the empty houses in County Leitrim and the Shannon basin. The Government of the day might have been able to hear the alarm bells. This amendment is tabled in good faith and I hope the Minister will give an undertaking that he will move in this direction.

He has increased the period of consideration from three months to one year. I would not have gone as far as him because it would be useful to have the information in advance of the next budget to allow the Dáil to decide whether the tax expenditures stack up. The Minister is a proponent of evidence-based policy-making. As a leading Opposition Member he spent many years interrogating Government policy in finance and other portfolios. The only comparative analysis on this issue that I could find is a study of OECD budgetary processes, which indicates that Ireland's budgetary process is the second worst after South Africa's. Two scores caught my eye in particular. On the amount of time Parliament is given to interrogate a budget in advance of its introduction, we scored zero out of ten, and on the amount of information given to Parliament to interrogate a budget, we also scored zero out of ten. I acknowledge, however, that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is making a genuine effort to provide additional information and transparency on expenditure and the process is slowly beginning to improve. When Deputy Pearse Doherty proposed his earlier amendment on Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, rightly pointed out that our job as parliamentarians is to hold him to account and interrogate legislation on behalf of the people. He went on to say that we get the analysis three months after the budget. However, that is the heart of the problem. We are only provided with some analysis - not enough - three months after the budget has been introduced. The study on budgetary processes included a bar graph which set out when parliaments got information on budgets. Generally, this varied between one month and six months before the budget. In only one country, Ireland, the Parliament got the information subsequent to the budget. We are a complete outlier in this regard. Deputy Mary Lou MacDonald and I asked for a regulatory impact analysis to be carried out prior to the introduction of the budget, including equality-proofing, gender impact analysis and poverty impact assessments. These are the types of analysis carried out in other developed democracies. The Minister agreed to investigate the Scottish model for equality budgeting, which is held up as good practice by boffins in this area. As a first step, I ask him to accept this amendment. It is a small and reasonable request that the Dáil should at least consider the impact of changes to tax law.In his amendment Deputy Pearse Doherty has drawn attention to job creation costs for the State, which are very important. He includes in his amendment the words "and other such impacts", which I believe is equally important. We need to look at the poverty impacts of these tax breaks or changes. We also need to look at an analysis of their gender impact and to consider the revenue and cost implications for the State. There are two other issues I would like the Minister to think about. Other Parliaments have their own budgetary office, staffed by analysts and this practice seems quite successful. Obviously, the Cabinet gets its advice and analysis from the Civil Service and the Minister gets his from his officials. Many other parliaments have a budgetary office and I suggest this as a possibility. I do not say this lightly. I appreciate hiring more people for our Parliament in the current environment is very difficult. However, it is certainly something that should be considered. Second, something I imagine has caused the Minister no lack of frustration over his career in politics is the part of the Constitution which says that nobody except the Minister can table an amendment that produces a charge on the State or has a tax implication for a citizen. The amendment I put forward concerned maternity leave. In good faith I tried to table something that would achieve what the Minister stated he wanted to achieve, but which did not have negative effects. However, my amendment was ruled out of order for some reason such as it fell between two Departments. The Government has plans for various referendums, but it seems that one of the things that hampers this House doing its job is the clause that means the majority of proposals we would like to make cannot be made, although I know there are ways of playing games with them, such that we can include something that would counter the cost. It would be great if the Minister could accept Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment, or something very like it. I would love the Minister to consider changing the Constitution in order that we could do what we are meant to do - interrogate the legislation and propose sensible amendments.

We had a discussion on this issue on Committee Stage and I appeal to the Minister, on the grounds of transparency and the public's right to know how public money is being spent, to consider the amendment favourably. It is interesting that when we look at the cost of any of the social welfare schemes, we know exactly the number of claimants and exactly what the scheme is costing us. However, when it comes to tax provisions, there is a veil of secrecy around a number of them. From experience during the years, I know that often when one puts a question on the cost of various tax schemes to the Exchequer, the response is regularly to the effect that the data are not collected in a format which allows the Minister to answer the question. It appears very convenient that it is not collected in that format. A number of cases come to mind. Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to the special assignee relief programme, SARP initiative, and we still do not have information on that. We do not have information on the grounds for the introduction of that initiative initially. Was there, for example, any kind of cost-benefit analysis done on it? It still strikes me as strange that in spite of introducing that preferential treatment for executives coming from abroad, the argument is still made on a regular basis that we cannot have a third rate of tax because it would frighten off executives coming in from abroad. There is no consistency on that issue. I would expect we would have some data available for 2012 at this stage, the third month of 2013, on the basic numbers claiming SARP relief and some estimate of the cost of it to the Exchequer. There are several other examples of areas where information is lacking, for example, pension tax relief, an area costing almost €3 billion. There is major public debate on the cost of child benefit and the possibilities for making savings there, yet it is different when it comes to pension tax relief. We know from ESRI estimates that approximately 80% of pension tax relief goes to the top 20% of earners and we know that in the case of child benefit, it is paid for every individual child. The pension tax relief allocation is deeply unfair and very difficult to defend from the point of view of equity. However, when we look for the data on pension relief, we must rely on ESRI estimates. During the years, when we looked for data on who was getting that tax relief or the numbers of claimants within different income bands or on the size of pension pots on which relief was being granted, Revenue and the Department stated they did not collect the data in that way. I find it incredible that the Minister for Finance is continuing with a regime where between €2.5 billion and €3 billion is spent on pension tax relief, yet he cannot produce the data giving a clear picture of that massive expenditure. I appeal to him that, on grounds of transparency, the public and public representatives are entitled to that information. How does the Minister know whether he is getting value for money? How does he know whether there is any equity about the situation if he does not produce that basic information? I appeal to him to look at this again. The Minister should also look at who is claiming tax relief on health expenditure. There is no breakdown available on this for the public. Again, in the case of landlords and the tax reliefs they get, there is no breakdown of the data. In the past few days, I sought data regarding tax relief for educational institutions and sporting bodies, but again, the claim was that on the grounds of confidentiality that information could not be provided. We know what the various Departments and the social services cost. There is infinite detail available on that. Tax breaks and reliefs can be considered similar expenditure and we should be entitled to information on them. I strongly support Deputy Pearse Doherty's amendment and urge the Minister to give a commitment here that he will request Revenue to collect data in a way that will allow people to make a judgment on whether we are getting value for money from the various tax relief schemes.

If they did, we would be able to make better policy decisions, no matter who was in charge of the ship of State. It is important to know where revenue is generated, the costs that apply to that revenue, the taxation applicable and where growth or contraction is happening in various industries and sectors. This makes sense and will help us to organise our thoughts better coming up to budget time. It is something that needs to be done immediately.

At that stage, when talking about what happens in Scotland, I made a commitment that one of my political advisers would examine this without prejudice and we would see where we could go. I will include this matter also and ask him to examine it and see if we can go forward on it. As a general proposition, I agree that things must change. The budgetary rules will change anyway, driven by the European Union, and our budget will be earlier this year, sometime in the middle of October. I will take proposals to the Government on how we move towards that and will keep in mind what the Deputies have said. It can be frustrating to be in opposition at times and it is very hard to get data on certain occasions. At other times one is swamped with data. With the little help that Opposition Deputies have, making sense of data is often a problem in itself. With regard to the Revenue Commissioners answering parliamentary questions or saying they do not have the data accumulated in a particular way or a way that can be released, that is not my experience. I clear my written parliamentary questions personally, a couple of hundred of them every week.It is very seldom that I do not have a full answer. I would not come across such an instance each day. I might come across one each week. Usually, my answer is that the information requested is not to hand because not enough time has been available to put it together. I generally say I will put it together and communicate it to the relevant Deputy by letter. Some Deputies such as Deputy Pearse Doherty table many questions to help them with their research. The Deputy can vouch that I usually give very full answers and that I communicate by letter subsequently if the data are not compiled within a short period of time. I think the data are available now. Details of personal and company taxation cannot be revealed because they are confidential. When somebody tables a question seeking details about a specific taxpayer or a small group of taxpayers in a way that would make an individual identifiable, he or she does not receive these details. That is the way the Revenue Commissioners operate. We might return to this issue. I will get the political adviser I have in mind to call Deputy Pearse Doherty to discuss what he wants and we will see where we can go. I agree with him in principle that the way we do our business is unsatisfactory. While I would not say there is no proper scrutiny, I accept that frequently the Opposition is not given sufficient information to do the job it is supposed to be doing. The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, will now take over from me. I ask Deputies to excuse me, as I have to leave.

I genuinely and passionately believe we need to change things in this regard, although I welcome the Minister's statement that he intends to get his political adviser to contact me. I reiterate that I welcome the position he outlined on Committee Stage about looking into the Scottish model of equality-proofing. As I have said in this House previously in my capacity as finance spokesman, since the Government took office, I have seen a marked improvement in the transparency of the information given by the Department of Finance in response to parliamentary questions. I cannot say the same for other Departments because I am not as familiar with them. I remember that when I tabled two very similar questions to two Ministers in the Government, I was able to obtain the information from the Department of Finance but not from the other Department. I will say, however, that there has been a marked improvement. While I agree with the Minister that we can have an overload of information, I do not think information should scare anybody. It is up to people to decide what to do with it. As we move in that direction, we should take the lead and embrace it, rather than having to be dragged there kicking and screaming.

The Minister might consider bulking up the specific library and research team that deals with these issues. In the current environment it is probably not appropriate for us to set up a full budgetary office in this Parliament. The library and research team does a phenomenal job in trying to give us neutral and robust analysis. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, to bring the idea of employing a small number of extra people with expertise in finance and economics as part of the library and research team to the Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Brendan Howlin. The team that is already in place is phenomenal, but it is massively under-resourced. I think it has one person with a background in economics. It used to have two. The hiring embargo means it now has just one. If the number was increased to four, it is possible there could be a step change in the analysis available to the Members of this House. I ask the Minister of State to take this suggestion back for consideration.

The House passed the resolutions on budget night and we have debated the matter since. This Report Stage debate follows our previous consideration of the Bill on Second and Committee Stages. I have tabled this amendment to reiterate that the increase in the price of cigarettes which I do not oppose has nothing to do with the promotion of public health. The problem is that the market is flooded with illegal cigarettes, or contraband cigarettes, to use the proper terminology I learned from Deputy Peter Mathews the last day, that can be bought in any town or village for €4. If the Government was serious in this regard, it would ring-fence some of the huge profits the State brings in from the imposition of duty on cigarettes to deal with the sale of cigarettes on the black market. I have tabled this amendment to ask it to do so. I am not opposing the price increase; I am saying it should be done in a genuine manner. I am only opposing it in so far as I do not believe it is about public health. It could be argued that the increase in the price of cigarettes will dissuade people from buying cigarettes. That may be a valid argument, but my view is that the price increase will push people into buying cigarettes for €4. In such circumstances, the State receives no tax and people smoke more because they are getting cigarettes for half the price. This issue needs to be considered in a genuine manner. Television documentaries have exposed the lack of scanning equipment and facilities available to be used when lorries arrive in this country. The black market activity is an issue. If the Government was proposing to increase the price of cigarettes to bring in €50 million - that is not the accurate figure in this case - and promising to use that money directly to tackle and stamp out the illegal sale of cigarettes, I would support it.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	460	This section of the Bill confirms the budget increases in the rates of tobacco products tax. When VAT is included, the increases amount to 10 cent on a packet of 20 cigarettes with pro rata increases on other tobacco products, with an additional 50 cent increase on a 25g pack of roll-your-own tobacco. As a result of the budget increases, the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category has increased to €9.30. The excise duty component of this price is €5.57. The total tax, inclusive of VAT, is €7.31. In the case of roll-your-own tobacco the increase in total tax, inclusive of VAT, amounts to approximately 60 cent per 25g pack. The excise duty component of this increase is 49 cent. This measure is expected to raise €25 million in a full year. I listened to what Deputy Pearse Doherty had to say about the black market. While he made some fair points, I do not think I was entirely in agreement with him when he said the increase was not about public health. I have to suggest, based on what I know from my day job as Minister of State at the Department of Health, that it cannot seriously be argued that price is not a relevant factor in one's decision to smoke cigarettes. While it might not be the only factor, as the Deputy outlined, it is certainly relevant. It cannot seriously be argued, therefore, that price issues have no bearing on public health. Revenue has achieved considerable success in combating smuggling. In 2012 it seized 95.6 million cigarettes, with a retail value of €43 million. In the same year, it obtained 57 convictions relating to cigarette smuggling, with fines of €93,500 and 26 custodial sentences, of which seven were suspended, being imposed.In addition, there were another 75 convictions relating to the sale or keeping for sale of unstamped tobacco products, resulting in 21 custodial sentences and fines of €153,000. The overall strategy being employed by Revenue to tackle the illicit trade is multifaceted and includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem; developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis; ongoing review of operational policies; development of analytics and detection technologies; optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and inland; intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises; and multi-agency operations, particularly in regard to large maritime importation and checks at markets. There is a good deal of activity being pursued by Revenue in this regard, which I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge.

I have a lot of respect for Revenue and believe its resources should be increased, as I have argued in our alternative budget and as Revenue has also argued when suggesting it could make a net gain of some €94 million for the State if it was allowed to hire additional staff to deal with black market activity and compliance. The point I am making is that the motivation behind this measure is not public health. As I said, increasing the price of cigarettes will deter some people but others will just go into the hands of the black market. While I do not have the figures for how much is spent by Revenue on trying to curtail black market activity in regard to cigarettes, I would not think it is a huge amount. If the Minister announced today €25 million had been raised from the suggested provision, this would not just have the benefit of hopefully deterring some people from smoking cigarettes because the price is beyond their reach, but would also mean a possible doubling of the fund to deal with the issue. Any success by Revenue is to be welcomed but we just have to look around us to know contraband cigarettes are all over the place. The figure was given at the last meeting of the committee that one in three or one in four cigarettes are contraband. The market is flooded and the situation is out of control. If this were a genuine public health issue, I am sure the Minister of State in his day job would welcome the provision of serious resources in this area. At the end of the day, the Government's intention is that nobody would smoke, which would be great for public health, although that is easier said than done. That said, the State will lose a huge amount of revenue, given it gets something like €5.77 from every packet. I would put it up to Deputy White, as the Minister of State at the Department of Health, that if we are genuinely serious about this, we would be not just putting money in our pockets in terms of increasing the amount we are taking in, we would be tackling the area where we are losing out. If the Government wanted to look at this selfishly in terms of increasing revenue and forget about the public health aspect, given people who are addicted to nicotine will always pay the higher price anyway, this measure would see a benefit in terms of additional revenue which could be then put into dealing with the issue of public health promotion and other preventative measures in trying to encourage people to come off cigarettes. The increase in the price of cigarettes is not something to which we in Sinn Féin are opposed but we are opposed to the motivation behind it and the fact the Government is not using the resources to actually deal with the problem, which is widespread at this stage.

Deputy Pearse Doherty is correct that the scale of the contraband or black market is huge. The only way this will be grasped with any effectiveness is by providing resources for Revenue, Customs and Excise and the Garda, and that needs to be done. We know, for example, that the number of young women who are smoking is rising, we know very few older people give up smoking and we know the volume market for cigarettes is constant, if not rising. The black market criminals are gaining in volume terms because the cost to them of importing and distributing the cigarettes is very low, even when compared to a price of €4 a pack. We have to grasp this. With all due respect to the Minister of State, dancing around the edges with advice sheets and statistics on how many criminals were apprehended, got custodial sentences and all the rest is nearly irrelevant. We have to gear up and get the equipment to do it. We should find out who are the shipping agents and shippers for the containers that come in, and give them the hefty fines, rather than those who are caught with the cigarettes in their possession. That will force them to find out what is in the containers.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	463	The issues that have been raised about public health are very fair. Several public health initiatives are being taken in the area of cigarette smoking. The Minister for Health has made a number of announcements and I support very much, as I am sure we all do, the measures it is intended to take in regard to cigarettes, in particular with regard to packaging. Cigarette smoking is a public health concern and, in particular, a concern of mine, of the Minister for Health and of the Department of Health. This has been made very clear and Members will see more on this in the coming period. Legislation has been proposed by Members of the other House in respect of where cigarettes can and cannot be smoked. There is a major concern and priority attached to the issue of cigarette smoking as a public health imperative by the Minister and the Department of Health. I agree with Deputy Pearse Doherty to the extent that he makes the point, as I would, that public health has to become a whole-of-government concern and not just simply be packaged into one Department. Health and public health is more important than practically any other consideration in government. It is far too important to be left to the Department of Health. It has to encompass and comprehend efforts across the board, including across all Departments and the wider public administration. On the question of whether there is a will, I indicated earlier the achievements that have been made by Revenue. I was reading from the advice sheets to which Deputy Peter Mathews took such exception, but I am simply giving information to the House as to precisely what has been achieved.

I raised this issue in detail when I spoke on Second Stage and if the officials present today were here on that day, they will know what I was talking about and will hear it again to some extent. I was originally dealing with section 49 of the Bill, as initiated, and it has now become section 51 following the amendments on Committee Stage. Section 51 deals with the mineral tax rebate on auto diesel for haulage and bus operators, and I welcome this provision. However, the section has a number of unintended consequences and the two paragraphs of amendment No. 19 are designed to deal with these unintended consequences of what is otherwise a very good provision. As I said, the section deals with haulage operators and I am not referring to the bus transport issue. The essence of the question is who is eligible for the fuel rebate, which comes back to the question of who is a qualified road transport operator. Section 51 defines a "qualifying road transport operator" as a person who holds a national road haulage operator’s licence or an equivalent EU licence, or a person who holds a national or international road passenger transport operator's licence or an equivalent EU licence.They are the people who will benefit from this fuel rebate, which is what the Minister intended. However, there are people in the haulage business who, because they do not have one of these licences, do not qualify as road transport operators. This amendment aims to include these people. The first paragraph of the documentation by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport to guide applicants for road haulage licences contains a section on who needs a road freight carrier's licence. It states that a licence is required when goods are carried for hire or reward. That is the essence. The documentation goes on to clarify matters. We are giving a fuel rebate but it is based on the definition coming from the Department. The officials in that Department probably understand more about this issue than staff in the Department of Finance, but I am sure the latter Department has checked it, and I am sure it consulted the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport before drafting section 49 when the Bill was originally published. The documentation goes on to discuss the hire or reward issue. Hire or reward haulage arises when one is paid for carrying someone else's goods. If a person only does work on his or her own account - that is, carries his or her own goods in his or her own vehicles, driven by himself or herself or his or her employees - he or sh e does not need a carrier's licence. The Minister of State can see the anomaly right away. If a business is transporting its own product, it does not require a licence. If it does not have a haulier's licence, it does not qualify for the fuel rebate, even though it is in the transport business. The word "not" is heavily underlined in bold in the documentation from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. Many companies in the transport business do not have a road freight haulier's licence because the Department specifically says they do not need one if they are drawing their own goods. The second stage of this document lists a number of other people who are exempted and do not require a freight carrier's licence. The first page of the Department's documentation on the road haulier's licence lists a group of people who do not require a licence. Page 2 lists another group of people who are exempted from requiring a licence. Do not ask me the difference between the two, but the Department has listed them separately. I am using the Department's phraseology when I am speaking here today. It states that a number of categories of person carrying his or her own goods do not require a licence and then states the categories that are exempted, mainly in the agricultural area. It states that one is exempted from the requirement for a carrier's licence if one proposes to carry any of the following commodities in the State only: cattle, sheep, pigs or turf; milk to a creamery or a cream-separating station; milk containers to or from a creamery or cream-separating station; livestock by farmers for neighbours locally; and newly harvested wheat, oats or barley during the period 1 August to 30 November each year from a farm to a place of storage, assembly or processing. Again, the documentation underlines the fact that these categories are exempt. There seems to be an exemption from the requirement to have a road haulier's licence for people in the transport business who are collecting milk from farms, delivering it to creameries, delivering from creameries to processing plants, collecting grain and transporting animals from farms to marts and from farms to factories. There are quite a large group of people who are either not required to have a licence or exempted from having a licence, but because they do not have a licence, they cannot get this fuel rebate, even though they are as much a part of the transport business as everybody else. The purpose of this amendment is to include such persons in that category.  Many companies in the agricultural area have their own transport lorries and do not subcontract their haulage out to independent contractors. As a result, they do not have road haulage licences and, therefore, cannot avail of this rebate. I am asking the Minister to widen the definition of those eligible for this measure to include the two categories from the Department of Transport documentation to which I have just referred. I welcome section 51 of the Bill. The legislation will force companies to contract out their transport. The tax rebate incentive can be granted to a subcontractor but not to a company carrying its own product. I accept that this is an unintended consequence. However, if two lorries are drawing from a factory, bakery or other business and one is owned by the company while the other is owned by a licensed haulier, it is most unfair that only one will be eligible for the fuel rebate. I ask that this be examined, which is the essence of the point I made here on Second Stage. People might find the wording of the amendment unusual but, having consulted with people in the industry, I found it was the only way we could come up with a formula of words to capture those who are exempt, primarily in the agricultural area. All of the products I have mentioned in the agricultural area are part of the food industry. Amendment No. 19 provides for the following people to be added to the list of those eligible: a person who holds a community licence within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council, a business transporting its own goods, and a person who holds a community licence within the meaning of Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council. Regulation (EC) No. 853/2004 lays down specific hygiene rules for those who are carrying foodstuffs. The people about whom I am talking are in the business of carrying foodstuffs. Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005 deals with the protection of animals during transport. Those two regulations deal with the carrying of foodstuffs such as milk and grain, as well as livestock. People involved in that industry who are carrying those commodities cannot operate without complying with those regulations, and the fuel rebate should be extended to them. The amendment also includes a reference to businesses transporting their own goods. The Minister will be aware of this. I am conscious of representations made and delegations received in the Department of Finance recently. There are many large employers that are doing their best to keep employment here and that have their own fleets of lorries on the road. Let us be clear: we are talking about lorries, not taxis or small trucks or vans. I do not know about double-axles or vehicles weighing 7.5 tonnes. We are talking about big lorries. I am conscious of one company that employs 400 people, whose representatives met with the Department of Finance to make the case that because it is running its own trucks - as it is trying to keep jobs in-house, look after the people who work for them and keep them in jobs - it cannot avail of this fuel rebate, whereas if it had subcontracted its transport business, sold off its trucks and asked an external haulier to handle transport for it on a contract basis, the haulier would get the fuel rebate because, as a licensed haulier, it would meet the definition.  The real difficulty is that the Government now putting small to medium-sized businesses that transport their own goods at a disadvantage compared with other businesses that use registered hauliers to transport their goods. Some of the bigger companies will have contracted out their transport and will get all the benefit, while the smaller businesses that have tried to keep transport functions in-house are put at a financial disadvantage. I sincerely ask the Minister to take into account of those people who in normal circumstances would have had a road haulage licence and would have been eligible for this fuel rebate but do not have it solely because the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport has said that because they carry their own goods instead of somebody's else's they do not need a licence, because the haulier's licence is only for those who carry goods for hire and because that Department specifically exempted agricultural businesses carrying food and livestock. This could be because, traditionally, there is much transport in that area and the Department possibly felt that to include all of those businesses as registered hauliers would have been an undue cost burden on that industry.It is now to their disadvantage. They are not allowed to benefit because they do not have a road haulage licence. The Minister of State could respond by suggesting these companies should apply for road haulage licences in order that they would be eligible for the fuel rebate. I consider this to be fraudulent taxation practice and think Revenue would take a very dim view of it. It would not be a valid approach to tell people who up to now have not had a licence to apply for one in order to receive the tax rebate. I would not expect that to be part of the Minister of State's response. A person who may not understand the intricacies of taxation law and the complications it might cause for a company taking that advice might be tempted to do so. However, it would not stand up in a court of law if Revenue were to take action.  I did not receive a response on these specific issues when I raised them on Second Stage. I may have taken a lot of time to complete my contribution, but I do not think my points were ventilated to this extent before. I ask the Minister of State to consider the case I have made.

These groups should not be left at a competitive disadvantage. They have to meet certain licensing requirements relating to the transportation of foodstuffs and livestock set by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Therefore, it should be fairly easy to ensure they are not exploited. It is a fact that fewer businesses are hauling their own goods and many of them are sub-contracting out this work. We should not be encouraging businesses to lay off drivers. It is a pointless exercise applying for a licence, even if it is feasible to do so, which it may not be, and which they do not require. I do not know how such an application would be dealt with by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, but we should not encourage people to go down that road. A very limited number of individuals are in these categories. Businesses in both categories are struggling, in particular, those involved in supplying the agricultural community. The CAP proposals and the proposals for a reduction in funding currently on the table will make matters far worse. A reduction in funding to farmers would have a direct impact on those supplying services to farmers.  Businesses hauling their own goods will be left with two legal choices, either to attempt to struggle on at a financial disadvantage compared to competing businesses which have sub-contracted out this work or else to lay off their drivers and incur the financial burden of redundancy payments to staff who would probably be recruited by the sub-contractor or set up as self-employed hauliers to haul the same goods. Many companies struggling to keep their heads above water will be faced with a significant financial burden. Cashflow difficulties are common. The amendments are, therefore, commendable and I hope the Minister of State can accept them.

What we are trying to achieve is containment or a reduction in the costs of transport and haulage for industries and businesses in the agricultural, manufacturing and distribution sectors. We are not attempting to rebalance and change the competitive forces within existing industries. It is a matter of trying to introduce fairness into how the rebate scheme is applied. What has been put together would achieve its objective. In case there might be a temptation for haulage businesses to carry goods for others, I suggest it should be stated it only applies where they carry their own goods exclusively.

#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	473	I thank the Deputy. A "qualifying transport operator" for the purposes of the repayments scheme, as Deputy Sean Fleming has outlined, is defined in subsection (1), by reference to the provisions of national and EU law, under which transport operators are required to be licensed. The proposed amendment No. 19 would add two EU regulations, as outlined by Deputy Sean Fleming, in the areas of food hygiene and livestock transport, to the provisions referred to. The amendment is not required because even though these regulations set down requirements for the transportation of animals and food products, they do not provide for transport licensing requirements. The transport licensing requirements, as they stand, are adequate and comprehensive for the purposes of the section.  The amendment also provides for the extension of the relief to own account operators. In introducing this rebate of excise duty on auto-diesel the Minister was seeking to reduce costs in respect of export-led growth for small businesses and to assist the tourism industry in the year of The Gathering. He is very conscious of the costs involved to the Exchequer and the extent to which such a scheme could be open to abuse. Accordingly, one means of facilitating compliance is to restrict access to the scheme to tax-compliant and licensed operators. In providing the relief it is not believed own account operators are, for the most part, in competition with hire and reward operators, as most are, by their nature, providing transport services for their own products. In this regard, while the Minister appreciates that companies have reduced overheads as far as possible, own account operators do have a greater facility to incorporate transport costs within the overall cost of the product. As the Minister stated on Committee Stage, his main concern in this area is to ensure the risk of fraud around the rebate scheme is minimised and the need to hold an operator's licence from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, or an equivalent licence recognised under EU law, is a significant element of the compliance regime in this regard.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	474	I thank the Minister of State for providing that response, but it is not satisfactory. I do not believe it reflects commercial reality to say a company carrying its own goods is not in competition with registered hauliers. They are in competition. Every company has to look at its costs which will include the cost of transport. Whether a business transports its own goods or sub-contracts this work, it is a financial decision. Every company running a fleet must bear in mind what the cost would be in sub-contracting out the work to a registered haulier. Every business has to keep its costs down in order to be competitive. It will always consider the cost of using external hauliers. I, therefore, reject the premise that small businesses are not in competition when carrying their own goods compared to registered hauliers. The price comparison between the two is fundamental to every business. We want to keep own account operators rather than have the work contracted out to external hauliers, many of whom may not be based in Ireland.I have never driven from Portlaoise to Dublin or vice versa during the past two years without encountering one of that company's trucks. The company in question is not Irish. Small local businesses which carry their own goods are in competition with some of the multinational transport companies, some of which are not based in the State. I am disappointed by the Minister of State's reply. I accept that making the change at this stage was probably too much of an ask, particularly in view of the number of people involved. However, the point we are making is, in essence, extremely fair. There should have been a fuel rebate for those involved in the transport industry. The way in which the rebate, in the context of the definition, is restricted in the Bill has led to the exclusion of many who transport their own goods. These individuals may now be of the view that they have no option other than to let their employees go and hire in external contract hauliers to do work previously done internally.

He has put up the posters, distributed the leaflets and taken out the advertisements and can now announce that the €1 increase in the price of a bottle of wine is no more. He is sitting in the chair that matters and should not allow Fine Gael to bully him anymore. He can accept the amendment and live up to the commitment the Labour Party gave to the electorate just two years ago. That is the sum total of what I have to say. The Minister of State knows that it was wrong to increase the cost of a bottle of wine by €1. The Labour Party led the campaign on this matter and I ask him to respond appropriately.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	478	I notice the Deputy has offered no suggestions as to how we might circumvent the greatest difficulty in this regard, namely, the fact that the expected yield from the increases in question is €180 million in a full year. If there is a serious proposal to the effect that these increases should be removed, there would have to be at least some marginal effort on the part of the Deputy - the House and the Minister would ultimately have to become involved - to explain how the resulting hole of €180 million in our finances could be filled. As the House is aware, section 58 confirms the increases in the rates of alcohol products tax announced in the budget. When VAT is included, these increases amount to 10 cent on a pint of beer or cider, 10 cent on a measure of spirits and €1 on a bottle of wine, with pro rata increases in the case of other products. It is not proposed to accept the amendment.

If we are to believe the media, his party has argued for the introduction of some of these measures in order to bring in additional revenue. I was being genuine when I made my opening comments. What is being done is simply wrong. I refer, in particular, to the €1 increase in the price of a bottle of wine. That is a massive increase which will affect those who have been hit really hard up to now. The increase is also disproportionate. For someone with a large income who can afford to spend €20 or €30 on a bottle of wine, an increase of €1 does not constitute a major burden. However, for a person who likes to drink wine on a special occasion and who can afford to spend €7 to €10 on a bottle - as, in the light of the pressures they are under, is the case for the majority of people in the country - this is a 12% increase. That is just wrong and I cannot support the measure. This matter has been well ventilated, but I still find the Minister of State's defence of the €1 increase in the price of a bottle of wine quite amusing.

I hope further proposals in this regard will be forthcoming from the Minister in the near future. Such proposals are very much overdue. Will the Minister of State address the issue of claims made for VAT rebates in respect of below cost sales of alcohol? In effect, the State, through the Department of Finance, is subsidising the low cost of alcohol. That low cost is giving rise to so much trouble in society. It should not be beyond the wit of the Department to bring forward proposals, whereby the big multiples, in particular, could be prevented from claiming VAT rebates in respect of below cost sales of alcohol. I understand the grounds on which VAT rebates are allowed in cases where, for various market reasons, products are being sold below cost. However, the multiples have made a conscious decision to sell below cost - this is a marketing tool - and they should not be allowed to claim rebates in respect of this. The State should certainly not be subsidising the sale of cheap alcohol through VAT rebates. Will the Minister of State raise this matter with the Department and request that the serious loophole to which I refer and which is contributing to much of the damage being done in society be closed off?

The challenge we face is how to go about addressing it. I ask the Minister of State, particularly in the context of his portfolio in the Department of Health, to consider a proposal made by the vintners before Christmas in respect of the introduction of a lid tax. That proposal has a great deal of merit. The Department of Finance has indicated that because of EU law, it is not possible to proceed with a lid tax, but I do not believe that is the case. Such a tax could allow us to circumvent the challenges we face in the below cost sale of alcohol. It could also allow us to circumvent some of the challenges relating to minimum pricing, while bringing in additional revenue for the Exchequer. There is huge merit in the proposal to which I refer, about which I spoke on the night the budget was introduced. I am disappointed that provision has not been made in this regard. I would like a detailed justification to be provided as to why the proposal was not progressed. It may not be possible for such a justification to be provided now, but I would like the officials from the Department to indicate at some point exactly where the challenges and difficulties relating to the proposal lie.

In the context of Deputy Denis Naughten's point, I am advised that the Minister for Finance met those who brought forward the proposal on the introduction of a lid tax.

It involves extending the carbon tax to solid fuels. The issue of major concern relates to the purchase of coal, in particular, but also briquettes. As the Minister is well aware, this is a poverty related issue. It is a fact that the poorest families in Ireland, even if they are fortunate enough to have central heating, cannot afford to turn it on. Increasingly, families are turning to solid fuel and this increase which is being phased in from 1 May onwards to May 2014 will eventually add about €2.50 to the price of a bag of coal. That is a significant increase which, when multiplied by the number of bags of coal families use over the course of a year, represents a major imposition. The truth is that there are many people who cannot afford even to light a fire. During the debate on Committee Stage the Minister made the point that there were environmental issues to be considered and that this was part of an overall strategy. I care about the environment as much as the next person, but I care even more about an elderly person at home tonight - it is a very cold night - who may not have the money to light a fire. The fuel allowance has been restricted in recent years and people are feeling the effect. I know the Minister of State does not have the authority to reverse this decision in the House tonight, but I felt the need to highlight again that it was the wrong decision. It is cruel and will affect the very poorest.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	490	We discussed the issue of fuel poverty on Committee Stage. I agree with Deputy Michael McGrath that this is a poverty issue. Some people will not be impacted on by this increase in the price of a bag of coal or a bale of briquettes, but others will. They do not have a range of options such as being able to fill their tank with oil and turn on the heating. As I said at the finance committee, even those who have central heating - not every house does - may not have thermostat controls to allow them to turn off the radiators in different rooms. They cannot afford to keep all rooms warm or even at a reasonable temperature. That is what it has come down to for many individuals. In recent days I have been talking to people in my constituency and others. I was on the campaign trail with Darren O'Rourke yesterday in Meath East where I advised a person to apply for the winter fuel allowance rebate from Britain as a result of the European Court of Justice ruling that anybody in receipt of a British pension, including a partial pension, could avail of that allowance, which is between £100 and £300, as long as they submitted the application before the end of March. I am aware there is anger in Britain that the Irish can keep their homes warm as a result of funding from its Exchequer, as well as people in France, Spain and elsewhere, but that is the ruling and of what people can avail. It has come as a huge relief to people because keeping their homes warm this winter is a source of serious concern for them. We have a fuel allowance for people in receipt of social welfare payments, but in Britain there is just one simple payment in the winter period. If we take the example of somebody who heats his or her house for just half the year using two bags of coal per week, the increase on a bag of coal as a result of this measure will be €2.50, or an extra €5 per week for the person concerned. That amounts to €130 for half the year. We should not forget that they may have to heat their home during the spring and summer. This means that if they had a budget for heating their house last year and only have the same budget this year, they will have to go without heat for four and a half weeks. That is the impact of this measure. As I said, some people will be able to absorb it without blinking an eye, but others will have to do with less heat. That is the reality. This is not about changing behaviour because people have cut their expenses to the bone; they are rationing the coal they put on the fire and cannot afford to install a different type of heating system in their homes. There are supports available from the State, some of which are very good in terms of the grant required to carry out the work, but one has to spend a substantial amount of money before one can avail of the grant and that is beyond their means. This tax is wrong and was not poverty proofed. It would have been common sense and the right thing to do to poverty proof this measure. An impact assessment should have been made to determine how this measure would contribute to fuel poverty and the impact on people's health and well-being. At a very minimum, there should have been compensatory measures to deal with that part of it. This is dressed up as a carbon tax that will be good for the environment and so on, but it is a serious issue because when the price of fuel and the cost of heating one's home is increased, fuel poverty kicks in. This is a live issue. Those of us in this House may not understand it with the salaries we are on, but it is an issue that affects people across our communities the length and breadth of the State and this measure will exacerbate it.

It would be a tax incentive to encourage people who, unfortunately, have turf banks on designated bogs, mainly in the west, to go out and cut them this year. The Government is stating that if they go out and cut turf on a turf bank, they will not pay the tax, but if they buy a bale of briquettes, they will pay the increased rate of VAT. It has been telling people not to cut turf and entire regions of the country were sterilised because of this, which was a stupid move in the first place. There was a lack of joined-up thinking in that regard. Now, through the Finance Bill, we are saying that if they comply with the law and purchase solid fuel, as they are being asked to do, we will tax them. What message will this send in my constituency and every other affected by this measure? In my part of the country up to 50% of some communities rely solely on solid fuel as their only source of heat. On a county basis, 37% of homes in County Offaly rely on solid fuel alone. The figure is slightly less than that in my constituency, but it is a significant proportion of the population. There is a direct connection between a large proportion of the population using solid fuel and access to turf banks. Sadly, the National Parks and Wildlife Service has decided to designate the many parts of the country where turf banks are located and sterilise these bogs. What is going on does not make sense and I ask the Government to reassess this measure.On the one hand, we ask people not to cut turf and say we will pay compensation or provide alternative sources of fuel. In some cases, people are still arguing with the Department to have a decision made. On the other, we are introducing a tax they will have to pay when they comply with the law, regardless of whether it is an ass. It does not make sense and I ask the Government to reconsider.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	492	Like other Members, I come across people who have a stark choice to make between heating their homes or putting food on the table. It is a choice not everybody faces, but it very stark for those who do. The issue of fuel poverty must be examined when proposals like this are brought forward. I accept the point that in some parts of the country people do not have a choice about the type of fuel they use, but where they do, it is often the case that they choose solid fuel because they can control their expenditure. If a person switches on a button, he or she cannot see where the money is being eaten up. Elderly people choose solid fuel for that reason. One has to ask if there is any cost saving in circumstances in which being cold in one's home brings on medical problems. Where there is a saving on one side, there may be a cost on the other. A lot of pain is associated with this issue for some groups. Poverty proofing of the measure is, therefore, essential. The measure is not a carbon tax, it is a general tax. If it was a real carbon tax, the proceeds would be ring-fenced and set aside for retrofit programmes and the generation of renewable energy sources. As they are not ring-fenced, it is impossible to point to where the money will be spent. There is a great deal of resentment from people who would otherwise have goodwill towards a tax that would provide supports for people to increase the level of insulation in their homes. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources told me in reply to a parliamentary question that the number of people availing of the retrofit scheme had all but collapsed. That is because supports have been removed. Let us not call this a carbon tax when it is a general tax. The Government will lose any goodwill there is towards measures which change behaviour if people cannot see a relationship between the tax charged and the benefits on the other side.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	493	I support the amendment. Whatever about the principle of a carbon tax, this provision impacts disproportionately on poor people and those on low incomes. The application of the tax as a blunt instrument means it takes no account of ability to pay. We already have a significant fuel poverty problem. If the Government was serious about the issue and took any account of ability to pay, it would have introduced compensating measures on the welfare side. Unfortunately, it has not done so. Like so many other provisions in the recent budget and in keeping with the main thrust of budgetary policy in recent times, it is an across the board measure. Significant and growing numbers of people are under immense presssure to keep body and soul together in current circumstances. They cannot afford the extra burden this measure imposes. There will be an increased problem of fuel poverty and more and more people will not have sufficient heat in their homes, with the attendant consequences for health and premature deaths. It is completely unacceptable that this blunt instrument will be used in this way. In recent years there was a commitment to poverty eradication and the equality proofing of new taxation measures. I ask the officials, through the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, if there has been any such proofing on a measure which will have a significant impact on people who simply cannot afford any more taxes and cannot, as it stands, afford to heat their homes. It will also impose significant additional costs on organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul which is already under enormous pressure to help the growing numbers of people who do not have the wherewithal to survive with basic dignity. Has any ruler been run over the measure to gauge its impact from an equality or poverty eradication point of view? I appeal to the Minister of State, given his ministerial role in the Department of Health, to reconsider the measure which will have very negative impacts on a group of people who are already under severe pressure.

This tax will hit larger numbers of poorer, older and vulnerable persons. Aside from the heat generated by an open fire, there is the companionship and psychological benefits it provides. The hearth was the heart of a house. In these times of severe financial strain and difficulty, it is one small corner of cheer and warmth in a house. A tax at the rate suggested on such an important element of the home is something we should rethink. I would hate this tax to become the thoughtless tax.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	495	The section the Deputies seek to have deleted makes a number of changes in preparation for the introduction of a solid fuel carbon tax from 1 May 2013. The section provides for the application of the carbon tax to solid fuels as announced in the budget. It is the last element outstanding in the application of the carbon tax. To alleviate the impact on lower income households, the tax will be applied in two phases - €10 per tonne of CO2 emitted from 1 May 2013 - therefore, it will not take effect until next winter - and a further €10 per tonne of CO2 emitted from 1 May 2014. This brings the carbon tax on solid fuels into line with the tax on all other fossil fuels. A number of further amendments will be required to clarify the scope of the tax. Any person who first supplies a solid fuel product in the State is an accountable person for the purposes of liability and payment of the tax and any such person must register with the Revenue Commissioners. Where solid fuel is supplied as a raw material for the manufacture of a solid fuel product, the tax will be charged on the first supply of the manufactured product in the State. The section before us comprises part of the revenue raising element of budget 2013 and, accordingly, the proposed amendment must be rejected. I heard the point made about whether this was truly a carbon tax. I respectfully say to the House that it is a carbon tax and that it is about sending a price signal that there is a cost associated with the consumption of fossil fuels to the detriment of the environment. Solid fuels have the highest carbon content of all fossil fuels. As they are considered the dirtiest fuels, it is important from an environmental impact perspective that we tax them.  Deputy Róisín Shortall asked about the extent to which these measures are assessed. I assure her and the House that taxation measures such as this are very carefully considered by the tax strategy group. The impact of taxes and tax changes is very carefully considered by the Government in the context of budgetary measures.It is important to point out that the fuel allowance payment under the national fuel scheme to assist with home heating, payable to people in receipt of long-term social welfare payments, will continue to be made at €20 per household per week for a 26 week period from October to April. The budget for the fuel allowance in 2013 is estimated at €210 million. Since 2000 over €115 million has been paid in grant support towards 270,000 upgrade measures in 110,000 homes under the better energy, warmer homes scheme. It is acknowledged that the carbon tax on solid fuels will have an impact on households. That is why the Government chose to wait until after the winter period to introduce the tax and introduce it on a phased basis across this year and next. This is a carbon tax which has been directed at a particular end, but it has not been done in a way that is oblivious to the impact on families, particularly, low income families.

When is winter in this country is the subject of another debate. At the same time as the tax is being introduced which will affect one third of households in my county and one in four in counties such as Galway and Leitrim, the Government is trying to ensure compliance with the law on turf cutting. The turf cutting season starts at the same time as the tax is being introduced. This displays a lack of joined-up thinking on the approach being taken on the issue of turf cutting and the impact of fuel poverty. This applies particularly in the parts of the country in which people are dependent on solid fuel. A substantial cohort of the population faces this additional tax. That fuel allowance is not increasing is one aspect, but many families are not eligible for it. They are struggling to meet their fuel bills and may not have been able to avail of the energy efficiency incentives. This is putting the cart before the horse.

Most of the groups working in the area claim it is a significant problem. Does the Minister of State accept this point? Does he accept that, by introducing additional taxes, the problems will be exacerbated? If it does not happen this winter, it will happen next winter. The number of people grappling with the problem of fuel poverty will increase. If the Minister of State accepts this, will he give an undertaking to address the point? Poverty eradication is a whole of government issue. Will the Minister of State give an undertaking to raise this point with the Minister for Social Protection with a view to introducing a counterbalancing measure prior to next winter?

I had hoped the Minister would be in the Chamber, but I understand he cannot be here.  The figures for car sales came out last month. The sector is in serious difficulty, as the figures show. The amendment concerns increases in VRT imposed under the relevant section. The country is in trouble as is reflected in the figures for the sector. This is an unfair burden to place on people. I teased out this point in detail with the Minister who suggested he was open to examining some proposals. That is the reason I had hoped he would be present in the Chamber and I tabled the amendment to ventilate the issue. The increase in VRT is not the right thing to do, as motorists are being screwed left, right and centre on transport issues. I come from County Donegal where we do not have the option of jumping on a Luas tram. There is not one inch of rail in the county and the public service busses are something we see on television. People must, therefore, jump into their cars. After the increases in fuel prices which have happened consistently in recent years, VAT and motor tax as a result of budgetary measures, we now see an increase in VRT. There must be some relief and a reprieve.

Since publication of the Finance Bill one month ago, 6,000 people have left the private health insurance sector which is haemorrhaging policy holders because of the spiralling cost of health insurance. Something must be done urgently to keep younger, healthier people within the sector. My proposal concerns lifetime community rating, a concept which has been on the Statute Book since 2001 without anything being done to make it happen.In this respect I am specifically concerned that people would shop around for health insurance. We are told by the regulator that they are being encouraged to do so. The difficulty is that the legislation, as worded, will penalise anyone who shops around after renewing his or her health insurance policy. Many of the health insurance companies have offers of discounts or free cover for children at different times of the year. There is an advantage for health insurance subscribers, especially if they pay their premium on a monthly basis, in switching from one provider to another, but based on the legislation there will be an in-built disincentive to switch health insurance providers because subscribers will be liable to pay the levy on a second occasion. We sought clarification on this issue on Committee Stage and the Minister said this would not happen. I seek clarification in the House that no subscriber will have to pay the levy a second time within the year covered by his or her policy as opposed to wa calendar year. If a subscriber renews his or her policy on 1 April, I seek clarification that in the following 12 months the subscriber will not have to pay the levy a second time. My understanding is that while the Department of Finance has given a commitment that it will issue guidelines to the Revenue Commissioners, the statute will have to be changed because, as it stands, it is flawed. Why was the statute not changed on Report Stage to correct the anomaly in the system, rather than leaving it for 12 months during which perhaps a problem might arise resulting in subscribers having to retain uneconomic health insurance policies and being forced into a situation where they would have to cancel their policy rather than switch provider?
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	507	Most of us wish people did not have to feel there was a need to have health insurance. However, with the queues for treatment in the health system, many believe there is a requirement to have health insurance. I believe in the principle of community rating and that cross-generation solidarity is required in terms of health insurance premiums. Was any calculation made of the fallout from this proposal in terms of the number who were likely to fall back on the public heath system and the pressure this would place on the system, or of the ratio of young people who would withdraw from the system as people reviewed the expenses on which they could cut backs? What analysis, if any, was made of the pressure this would place on the public system while waiting for a more general system to be put in place?
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	508	Deputy Denis Naughten's amendment proposes the deletion of section 83 which provides for the new rates of health insurance levy to pay for risk equalisation credits which were introduced under the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012. These credits replace the previous system of age-related income tax credits which were in place from 2009 to 2012 and which were temporary arrangements. If the rates of health insurance levy provided for in the section were not in place, sufficient money would not be available to fund the risk equalisation credits. That is the reason it is essential that this be done. On that basis, the Minister cannot accept the amendment proposed by the Deputy to delete section 83. However, I propose to deal more generally with the issue of community rating and risk equalisation. Under the principle of community rating which all sides of the Oireachtas supported when the Bill was introduced - we dealt with it as recently as last week and I have forgotten precisely the stage it is at, but it is at an advanced stage and there is wide support for it in the House - everyone is charged, under such a scheme, the same premium for a particular health insurance plan, irrespective of age, gender and current or likely future state of his or her health. Community rating, therefore, means that the level of risk a particular consumer poses to an insurer does not directly affect the premium paid. The pricing of risk across the community of insured persons clearly requires robust mechanisms to share costs when there are several insurance companies in the market. The standard transfer mechanism to support community rating is called risk equalisation. Perhaps we might return to the more general background to risk equalisation later in the debate. It is an indispensable requirement in the overall scheme for the funding of health services that we have risk equalisation. The scheme being put in place by the legislation achieves this and I regard it as essential in respect of where we will take health services and their funding. There are many issues we are addressing and that will be required to be addressed in the future, but it seems that risk equalisation and the necessity for it is a settled issue politically across the board. It is an indispensable provision in terms of where we are headed and where we need to go.  In 2012 the age-related income tax credit for insured persons aged 60 years or older was increased significantly in order to keep down the cost of health insurance for older people. Without this support, health insurers would have had a strong financial incentive to segment the market by offering policies targeted at young people to the disadvantage of older customers. With effect from the end of March 2013, the risk equalisation credits will increase substantially over 2012 levels for higher risk groups, particularly men aged 70 years and above. For example, the risk equalisation credit for a 75 year old male with advanced cover has increased by €400, or 20%, from €2,025 in 2012 to €2,425 in 2013. The risk equalisation credit for an 85 year old male has increased even more. Each year the Minister for Health makes a recommendation to the Minister for Finance in regard to the stamp duty required to support the scheme. The risk equalisation system is designed to be self-financing. The stamp duty receipts are set at a level to fund the risk equalisation credits. The level of stamp duty required, therefore, is reflective of a number of factors, including market ageing and claims inflation. Claims inflation across the health insurance industry impacts on the cost of increasing risk equalisation credits for older and less healthy insured persons. The levy increase, effective from 31 March, represents an increase on a non-advanced product of €5 for a child or an adult. In the case of an advanced product, the increase is €25 in the case of a child and €65 in the case of an adult. "Non-advanced cover" means, broadly speaking, health insurance policies for public hospital cover only. "Advanced cover" means policies covering both public and private hospitals. The full definitions of both terms are provided in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2012.  I am conscious of the time remaining, but in fairness, I should deal with the issue Deputy Denis Naughten raised as it is specific.

The rates set must also take account of the ageing market profile and claims inflation. I am pleased to note in this regard that the Health Insurance Consultative Forum, having been established by the Minister for Health, has been tasked with driving savings in the market, the effect of which should be to minimise the need for increases in premiums. If the risk equalisation rates are set too low, the risk equalisation scheme will be ineffective and result in higher premiums for older and less healthy members. As I have indicated, as that would break community rating, we must prevent this from occurring. There is no increase in costs in the market. The levy is recycled into risk equalisation credits for those who need support in the overall context and in the spirit of community rating.

Unemployment is a huge problem in this State and we need to act sensibly to protect and develop jobs in the real economy. We also have to be honest and open on this issue and deal with the facts. In 2012 almost 12,800 full-time jobs were lost to the economy and replaced by 14,000 part-time jobs. There has been a rise in under-employment with almost one third of part-time workers seeking additional hours. The Government's action plan on jobs fails to have annual targets for job creation or reduction in levels of unemployment and has failed the test of tackling unemployment. We also have to look very seriously at the failure of the bailout banks to support small and medium enterprises with increased new lending. The largest employer, the Government, has also shredded 30,000 jobs which has undermined public services. That is often left out of this debate. The employment crisis makes differing impacts on communities across the State and the Government has failed to address these inequalities. We have also seen the resilience of the SME sector and the workers who have continued to work and produce goods and services in an economy which is being undermined by Government policy. Emigration is rarely mentioned. We are losing 1,600 young people every week. We have spent millions of euro training and educating these people and now they are on the road to Australia, New Zealand, England and America. The Government cannot ignore the SME sector and more needs to be done for it because it is the economy in communities that needs to be serviced. For example, in the Howth area, in my new constituency, Dublin Bay North, the proposed pay for parking is a huge issue. It will lead to major loss of jobs in the catering and tourism sectors, if the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and the Government implement it. This could affect between 300 and 500 jobs in the Howth region. I urge the Minister of State at the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy McGinley, to listen and to support the people of Howth by blocking the fee for parking issue because many retailers, small businesses and restaurants need support. If the Government implements this policy it will damage the integrity of those local jobs. I urge Deputies to support this motion. It is a very important motion and debate on jobs and we should all rally behind it.

I want to concentrate on Donegal where the crisis is probably at its bleakest. We have heard much about the success of the Government and the IDA in attracting investment to the country in the past year. We are told they have brought in over 12,500 jobs. Only 28 of those were in the north west and exactly zero in Donegal. An export-led recovery means nothing for the people of Donegal when we see that there is no commitment to foreign direct investment in the north west. The so-called action plan for jobs has not delivered. I do not believe it will deliver because the Government has made no commitment to the domestic economy. There are few if any supports for businesses that are struggling in the domestic economy. As businesses have closed in the county there has been a cycle of reduction in spending power in the local economy leading to more closures and that cycle continues. The decline in traditional industries such as fishing has removed a vital income from many rural areas around the county and the failure of the Government to deal with the fishing ban in area 6A has caused many people to lose their livelihood. In my own town of Killybegs fish processors have received grant aid to improve their production facilities that has led to the loss of hundreds of jobs as the processors have become more efficient. This is justified by the Government in order to improve the viability of the remaining jobs but the lack of response to support replacement jobs has sapped local confidence. This Government has to re-focus on the domestic economy and SMEs to ensure that we can grow jobs. There has been some minor good news too. I recently attended the Enterprise Ireland High Potential Start-up Roadshow where six Donegal enterprises were show-cased. These businesses are focused on export which shows some sign of hope for job creation. If these enterprises can grow and develop the county will benefit. If the Government does not support the local economy, however, and the small retail and employment sector serving that economy, the ability of these businesses to maintain themselves in the county and to develop and grow will be greatly undermined. The Government needs to focus on the local economy to make sure that the issues that have starved spending and stifled business are addressed. This includes dealing fully with the mortgage crisis by write-downs of unsustainable debt and not simply re-stating existing policy again and again.

We lost 14,000 full-time jobs last year. If it was not for emigration the unemployment crisis, which is already very severe, would be at absolutely catastrophic levels. It really seems as if emigration is the Government's jobs policy and that is a shame for any Government, given the history of this State. I have made those points many times as have others. Tonight I want to concentrate on two particular issues. The Government goes on and on about the need to upskill, re-educate and re-train people. I have just come from a meeting in Dún Laoghaire organised by teachers in the further education sector where they protested about the Government's plans to increase the staff-student ratio from 1:17 to 1:19. They point out that this sector has been absolutely critical in finding a pathway into third level education and employment for many of the people who are not suited to the normal CAO and academic system. It has been a very successful sector and they pointed out that as a result of what the Government is doing in our area alone 14 jobs will be lost, across the country 500, and thousands of places for students, particularly those from disadvantaged areas, who had a pathway into further education and employment, will be cut. How can the Government claim that it needs to re-train, re-educate and re-orientate our economy and at the same time slash a sector which will be absolutely critical to achieving that end? I appeal to the Government to back off on the increase in the staff-student ratio, take away the caps from the further education sector and protect and develop this sector which will be critical to re-training people who need to work or are coming out of school. My second point is about forestry. There are many studies which show in detail that every 15,000 hectares of forest planted can generate 500 or 600 jobs. We have completely failed to deliver on our afforestation targets. In Switzerland, a country half the size of ours, 100,000 people work on the same amount of forestry as ours yet only 10,000 are employed here. The Government proposes to sell off the harvesting rights to that forestry rather than have a programme of public investment to develop the forestry sector and create potentially 50,000 or 100,000 jobs over ten years if we meet our afforestation targets. I urge the Government not to sell the forestry rights and instead to invest in this sector to create jobs and revenue for the State.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	516	One of the key elements in securing Ireland's future is the proper investment in our human potential. Education and training is key. The Government unfortunately has not given education and training anything like the priority it should. In an employment crisis one of the last areas in which we should be making this type of cut is education and training. A key part of the answer to unemployment and disadvantage is to expand educational and training opportunities and play to our strengths. An example is the problem we are having trying to fill vacancies in the high-tech sector. Companies in the area are filling vacancies from abroad because of the lack of suitably qualified Irish graduates. Last year 2,000 of these jobs went unfilled.We are constantly told how a company has announced X number of jobs and another has announced Y number of jobs. The expectation is that these jobs will be filled by people who are on the unemployment register. However, up to 2,000 positions at the company in question were filled by people from outside the State. In yesterday's edition of The Irish Times a well written article by Dan Hayden explained how IT education at second level in Ireland was far behind that in other countries. Our teachers are not sufficiently qualified to introduce new learning models to make the best use of technology. The national curriculum is far behind that in the likes of South Korea. This is deplorable. There is no point in rolling out broadband to second level schools if the curriculum is not in place or the schools do not have the computer equipment to take advantage of it. One key point in dealing with our economic problems is that we need to get people back to work. This is absolutely essential if we are going to pay for public services without imposing significant new taxes, particularly on the low to middle income groups. Education and training have to focus on what they require. We need to be examining the skills that are deficient in the economy. We need to ensure those unemployed or in the education system will be filling new jobs, too.

There are many reasons we might not want to get out of bed in the morning, but there are many good reasons, too, if we focus on them. There is hope on the horizon and evidence of economic recovery, with increased foreign direct investment, exports and employment. We have also tackled problems such as credit availability for business, creating new financing options in the process. It is easy to sneeze at these developments and make nothing of them. However, the significance of 15,000 jobs created in the past 18 months is stark when compared to the 250,000 jobs lost before the Government took office. Arguably, they were in areas that could never sustain the level of growth they had enjoyed, areas that were inflated. Inevitably, the bubble had to burst. This was akin to a tsunami which swept over the country and, regrettably, this economic catastrophe caused damage everywhere. We must focus bit by bit on recovery. Apart from foreign direct investment and reorganising of the public finances, there has been a dogged campaign by the Government to improve our relations with our trading countries. We have looked outward and rebuilt trading relations with the United Kingdom, other European countries and the United States, while building new relationships with China. Credit must be given to the Taoiseach for his energy, enthusiasm and positivity in the face of a wall of negativity from the Opposition benches which is also affecting the national psyche. In doing so, he has restored confidence in this proud country which is shouldering a terrible legacy, one which it is not shirking. Rebuilding our trading relations with the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the United States and China is no mean feat considering the position the country found itself in with the IMF. I have no problem with Ministers travelling abroad for St. Patrick's Day, but there is always a nice howdy-do listing where they are going. What is forgotten is that there are millions around the world of Irish descent and many more not of Irish descent who embrace Irishness and all want to be part of our recovery. They want to be acknowledged as part of our solution and that their talents and achievements are ours. Sinn Féin's economic policy hinges on sky hooks and pie in the sky stuff. If it had its way with its wealth tax proposal, we would not have a farmer left in the country worth talking about. Sinn Féin's motion calls for €13 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the European Investment Bank to be used to fund a stimulus package. This is from the very party the financial policy of which was to renege on the promissory notes signed by the Minister for Finance in the previous Government. How could we then go back to the European Investment Bank to ask for cash for a stimulus package? This is just populism and determined by whatever is going down at home. We need to focus on indigenous resources and industries. We used to have a linen industry and other cottage industries. We also have a religious heritage that does not receive mainstream tourism promotion. We have the best renewable energy resources such as wave and wind power in the whole of Europe.

I support the amendment to it and the intense focus the Government is placing on supporting job creation through the Action Plan for Jobs. While I welcome major job announcements made during the tenure of the Government, including 500 jobs in gaming firms EA and BioWare, it is the Government's focus on exporting firms and the small and medium-sized business sector that is the real success of policy to date. This intense focus will remain on these sectors in coming months and years. Regarding small and medium-sized businesses, the Government has given due recognition to the important issue of local authority rates. It is welcome that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, has written to local authorities asking them to exercise restraint or, where possible, reduce commercial rates for 2013. To date this year, all bar one of the rating authorities have either reduced their rate or kept it the same, resulting in an average decrease from last year to this year of 0.34%, following on from similar decreases of between 0.3% and 0.6% in the preceding three years. Rates remain high and our focus will have to remain on the subject, but we also have to recognise their importance to the local government system, yet small businesses are the lifeblood of economies in villages and towns. Our focus must be on doing everything in our power to assist such businesses, particularly given the extremely difficult trading circumstances that prevail. Another item which ties in with the issue of rates is water charges. The Government has committed to the introduction of domestic water charges and it is anticipated that the labour-intensive process of installing water meters on 1.35 million domestic properties will sustain over 1,500 jobs for the next two years. These new jobs will be most welcome for the thousands of former construction workers now seeking employment. Another welcome aspect is that these jobs will be spread across the country rather than concentrated in one area. I note the social inclusion element of the contracts require that Irish Water hire 10% of people from SMEs, 10% from the unemployment register and 5% from the apprentice, graduate or school leaver sector. These jobs will be much sought after but will provide opportunities for people from these sectors who often are those most in need of employment. It is particularly welcome that one in every 20 workers will be a school leaver, apprentice or graduate, as too often young people find that they are left with no work opportunities on leaving school. Many who used to be self-employed but are now unemployed find they have had not built up enough PRSI credits. This issue still needs to be addressed. There are too many people not getting the supports they need from their social welfare offices. For a long time, when they were employed, they paid high rates of tax and provided for the economy but now find themselves outside the circle. We need to make changes either in the Department of Social Protection or the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to find supports for them. Once they cannot get into social protection system, they are barred from the training programmes it provides. It must be remembered the very last place in which these people want to find themselves is their local social protection office.We have had a situation whereby we have seen changes in recent years. I welcome many of the Government announcements but we must remember those people, especially those from the construction sector, who have lost their jobs. Many of these people attend clinics throughout the county. They will not re-skill or retrain in many of the areas in the high technology sector to which we have referred. We must find another construction sector but it will not be where it used to be. We cannot go back there but we cannot ignore the number of people who have come from the construction sector and who are now out of work. The Government has achieved a good deal in two years but there is a good deal more to do.
#MichaelConaghan	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-party	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-dob	unknown-#MichaelConaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	524	Coming out of the recession in the 1980s successive Governments focused their attentions on building a broad-based sustainable economy. That approach was best exemplified by the rainbow coalition of the 1990s with the Labour Party Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, at the helm. However, in 14 years of power Fianna Fáil deconstructed this model at the bidding of their friends the developers, the builders and the bankers, who completed the golden circle. They skewed a sustainable economy and replaced it with a narrow, fragile economy built on the unsteady foundations of a construction bubble. As a consequence, when the bubble burst jobs were lost at an unprecedented rate. The construction sector was ravaged and the retail sector followed suit. Some 300,000 jobs were lost in only three years, the last three years of the Fianna Fáil Government. Unemployment jumped from 5% in 2008 to 14% by the time this Government took office in 2011. The scale, magnitude and speed of the structural collapse of our economy is unprecedented. This Government has taken on no ordinary task. Rebuilding a shattered economy is the first objective of the Government. We need to create sustainable jobs for the thousands who have found themselves without work. One consequence of the economic collapse and the parallel banking crisis was that the flow of foreign investment to Ireland dwindled and major multinationals made thousands redundant. Confidence in Ireland evaporated internationally and in the markets. This was only two years ago. Who would have thought that only two years later confidence would be rebuilt? This Government has restored confidence in the country. International investors now have renewed faith in Ireland. Unemployed construction workers form the greatest single category of people left unable to find work in recent years. However, the Government is taking steps and making investments that will provide hope to a great many of them. Major infrastructural projects will offer thousands of jobs to unemployed construction workers and give a welcome boost to the local economy in areas of Dublin struggling with high unemployment. The construction of the new DIT campus at Grangegorman will see the creation of many jobs for construction workers and the Grangegorman Development Agency has put in place an employment charter that will see a portion of these jobs go to local people and those on the live register. Similarly, the Government deserves great credit for ensuring that the national children's hospital project will go ahead. This will represent a significant boost to the south west of the city and the many unemployed construction workers in the area. I have worked closely with St. James's Hospital and the Department of Social Protection to ensure that as many of these jobs as possible go to local people. Beyond the children's hospital and Grangegorman projects, we should consider further infrastructural projects to create jobs in urban communities. The DART underground project is one such example. The business case for the DART is rock solid. It will bring great coherence to the existing transport infrastructure and create many jobs. Every effort should been made by the Government to ensure that the necessary capital investment is found for this major project as soon as possible. The green economy can also play an important part in securing sustainable employment for those with the relevant skills in the construction field. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, announced recently that as many as 5,000 jobs will be created in the green energy sector through a €70 million energy efficiency fund. This, along with more than 4,000 jobs supported by retrofitting schemes, shows how the existing construction skills of the unemployed can be redeployed through appropriate training to meet the new needs of the country and the economy. These measures will bring to approximately 10,000 the number of former construction workers supported by green energy schemes. Furthermore, the development of green energy through the proposed major wind farm projects offers further opportunities for those who developed their skills during the construction boom to apply them to the new economy. Most employment in Ireland is in the small and medium enterprise sector. The Government recognises the value of the SME sector in supporting our economy. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, is working to create an environment in which small and medium enterprises can flourish. The Government has set about identifying the factors inhibiting the growth of the sector and is tackling them in a strategic way. The strategy is to remove the obstacles, offer advice and build the capacity of our entrepreneurs to create jobs. Credit is the single greatest issue and this is why the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has launched two major new schemes to get credit flowing to businesses again, the credit guarantee scheme and the microfinance scheme. This will allow small businesses to grow and create jobs. The JobBridge scheme has been a major success for the Government. Some 52% of people who have finished JobBridge internships have gone on to secure full-time employment. Further measures, including the JobsPlus scheme announced as part of the Action Plan for Jobs recently, will incentivise employers to take long-term unemployed people off the live register. The youth guarantee, which the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, recently secured agreement for at European level, will offer either a job, work placement, traineeship, internship or education for every person under 25 years of age who has been out of work for more than four months. These are only some of the measures the Government is taking.

#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	527	Every aspect of the economic strategy of this Government during the past two years has been predicated on the ambition to put our people back to work. That is the end objective of every action. However, before that could be achieved and before the private sector could begin to create jobs certain transformations had to be realised at a macro level. It was necessary for the Government to get the public finances in order. That process is well in play and we are on target. It was necessary to tackle the promissory note question which had the potential to cripple totally and stagnate the economy in the coming years. That has been dealt with. It was necessary to re-establish our international reputation by the foregoing two actions and more generally to ensure inward investment to the country. That has been done. It was necessary to deal with the interest rate question and the cost of borrowing and that has been achieved. The proof that these background things are working is the fact that during the past year some 12,500 new jobs have been created by the private sector. It is a small number but it is a real start and an indication that the macroeconomic policies are working and that they are beginning to be translated into real-life situations. That is real progress. I wish to focus on some of the particular responses to unemployment that have begun and which will be crucial in the coming years. The youth guarantee scheme sponsored by this Government and agreed at European level has remarkable potential. I wish the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, and the rest of the Cabinet well in its implementation in this country. A €6 billion fund has been created at European level. This represents a real stimulus and I hope we will achieve matching funding here. Tragically, there is 30% unemployment among young people in the 18 to 25 age bracket. The scheme means that any young person who is unemployed for four months will be guaranteed a job or training course. All empirical evidence suggests that young people who are unemployed for a long period are likely to remain in that predicament into adult life and beyond. Early intervention is critical to deal with the unemployment question. Another remarkably important issue for this country is the need to develop an information and communications technology strategy and that is already in play. The Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation discovered that there are 4,500 information and communications technology jobs available in the country, while in Germany there are 400,000. A strategy has been put in place. A total of 900 places were created last year and 760 new places will be created in 2013 for information and communications technology honours degree courses. That is an important strategy. The tourism initiative involving a 9% VAT rate has worked and, as Deputy Mulherin noted earlier, the potential for Irish tourism is considerable and not yet properly tapped.The credit guarantee and microfinance schemes are important in this regard.  The IDA will have to regionalise its inward investment efforts to the greatest extent possible.  Investors are free to go where they want but inland areas do not have the same pull for job creation.  Investments tend to go to the big population centres on the east coast.  I appeal to the Government to be proactive in that regard.  I would also like to see a variety of initiatives being taken at departmental level in the energy area.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	528	Lasts night's debate was robust but I did not find its tone particularly helpful.  The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, were passionate in describing what they are trying to achieve for the betterment of the country in terms of creating jobs and ending the blight of emigration.  This Private Members' motion is not helpful.  Instead of identifying areas in which we might act further, it claims we are acting wrongly.  On my first day in this House I endorsed the Cabinet and identified the acronym of TEAM - tourism, energy, agribusiness and microenterprise - as the four core competencies on which we could build our recovery.  However, the overwhelming momentum for the country was negative.  We were dealing with a banking collapse and a lack of confidence throughout the country.  People were taking their money out of their accounts and crossing the Border to lodge them in bank accounts in Newry.  The country was locked out of the bond market and people did not see any potential for growth.  The self-employed have played a central role in creating jobs.  We need to breed entrepreneurs like Gerry Kennelly, who operates a youth entrepreneur programme in County Kerry.  That is the way forward.  Our public sector is quite good by European standards but we also need entrepreneurs who are knowledgeable and who can be ambassadors.  The people who will leave these shores on behalf of IDA and Enterprise Ireland over the coming weekend are doing a great job promoting the country as a place to do business and showing off the calibre of the Irish people.  We are intelligent, hard working and passionate.  We are Anglophones with a good corporation tax rate and, most important, we want to win.  We want to give ourselves a proper standard of living and a future for our children.  We will none the less have to address the issues of reskilling and retraining.  We cannot simply move people from construction to information technology.  We need not only commercial initiatives but also infrastructure projects backed by the State and the European Investment Bank.  Unfortunately, I come from a county which has an infrastructure deficit.  The European Union provides a regional aid programme for Ireland but County Kerry has the second lowest level of disposable income of the 32 counties.  Unemployment rates in the county have increased by 160% in the past five years.  The south west regional authority is the second most efficient and prosperous in Ireland, after Dublin, but if Cork and Kerry are separated the latter is the least looked after county in the country.  The BMW region is able to attract foreign direct investment as a result of the incentives it can bestow on foreign companies.  Other than a technology park in Tralee which employs 400 people, Kerry has received only two visits which were orchestrated by Government Deputies.  The strategy on jobs is Dublin centric.  The best way to achieve equalisation is to find out what we are most capable of doing.  We need to work with the institutes of technologies and universities.  We plan to push for university status for Tralee but we also need a plan for expanding industry.  This has been a good day for mortgages.  Two key issues arise for my generation, namely, unemployment and personal indebtedness.  I welcome the statement by the Minister for Finance on dealing with personal indebtedness because it will give people head space as well as pocket space.  We also enjoyed success in raising money in the markets earlier today.  Two years' ago there was no way we could have raised €3 billion.  We were oversubscribed by 400%.  More than 400 private investors endorsed what we are doing.  The bond market is the lifeline of the country.  We have been endorsed for doing the right thing but austerity is not prosperity.  We cannot fix everything immediately but the momentum is in the right direction.  If the Deputies opposite will not help they should get out of the way but otherwise they should get onboard to push in the right direction and get the people of our country back to work.  There is no point in speaking in this House unless one contributes something positive.

As the Deputy is aware, one of the main themes of that book was that all animals are equal, but some are more equal than others. As far as Sinn Féin is concerned, I see it as a two-headed monster, with one head facing the North and the other the South. It sees all Irishmen as equal, but some more equal than others.

Some €6 billion in funding is being provided from the pan-European fund that is being set up for youth unemployment and I hope we can obtain a significant proportion of that because youth unemployment is a significant issue here. Some €2 billion in funding is also available from the development capital fund, the partial credit guarantee scheme, the venture capital fund and a variety of national pensions reserve fund SME funds to try to stimulate our economy and get people back to work. These initiatives are practical and realistic. If there is a criticism to be made, it is that the Government needs to tighten up on its figures. I am sorry for Deputy Doherty. He is not the son of God and will not be able to re-enact the miracle of the loaves and the fishes if he is ever in power here. There are significant financial constraints in the economy, but we are working with them to get people back to work. The Minister should be congratulated on the work he is doing to focus in on and target areas where we can create employment. We have been very successful in that over the past couple of years. We have seen an increase in jobs within the private sector and have seen international confidence restored and I hope this translates across the country over the next couple of years. I hope we can have a positive outlook and see the potential of our young people and get them into work and training. There is a significant number of initiatives in place and we must target as many people as we can for reskilling and retraining. They have worked in unskilled jobs, but now need to acquire the kind of skills necessary today. The Government is working to do this. That is what we hope to achieve for everybody in the country.

That is a failure of political leadership and a failure of every Member in the House who supports a Government with its head stuck in the sand. I got a letter today from an individual who talked about the misery of being unemployed and about having to turn to professional counselling services to try to scrape her way out of the dark hole she is in. She is still unable to get on a job activation scheme. I know the situation from people in my constituency who have never seen the good times, if they ever existed, where employment was available. We in Donegal and the north west, in particular in the Border region, have always suffered from a higher level of unemployment. The level of unemployment today in Donegal is 28%. Some Deputies think that is acceptable and some of them think it is acceptable to come in here and talk absolute nonsense and rubbish without any reference to the facts and figures. Let us look at the details of Sinn Féin's proposal. Earlier I heard Deputy Mulherin say that Sinn Féin's wealth tax would scare off every farmer in the State. Has she not read our policy document? It states that farm income and farm assets are not included in the assessment of wealth tax. Perhaps she has not looked at the legislation we drafted and published, which provides more detail on this. Perhaps her contribution was just lazy political representation from a party that has shown a pathetic attempt to deal with the massive crisis we face. There are things that can be done. What both parties in government said when in opposition was that there would need to be an investment in the real economy to get people back to work. We agree with that. Where we differed at the time was with regard to the scale and size of that investment and how it would be done. I would settle at this point in time for the then Fine Gael or Labour Party plan for employment in this State, because at that time they were promising to put €7 billion and more into the economy to get people back to work. The young people of this State and the mothers and fathers who must wish them goodbye at Dublin, Cork or Knock airports cannot wait for another two years for the Government to get its act together. This needs immediate action and attention. The figures do not lie. There are 430,000 people unemployed, some 60% of them long-term unemployed. One in every three young person in the State is unemployed. This is the shameful record of a Government that has its head so far in the sand that it cannot see what is happening in its communities. It should have had the decency to say it wants to do more, rather than trot out the kind of bull that has been thrown out tonight. This type of attitude from the Government gives no hope to people who are suffering due to long-term unemployment. There is no recognition from the Government of the crisis that is gripping communities the length and breadth of the State.

They are not available to be invested in jobs. In the same way, the money raised in taxes in this State is not available to be invested in jobs because the Government is putting it into the black hole of the banking system. We have demanded a stimulus package. If one invests money in jobs, one gets a return on that. It is basic economics. The Government and its predecessor have failed miserably to invest in jobs. This Government has invested in retraining and reskilling programmes, for which I accept there is a role and a need. The problem at the moment is that there are no jobs at the end of these programmes, which means the Government is investing in emigration. It is paying to retrain and reskill Irish citizens before they go abroad. Our investment in skills is benefiting the economies of other countries, such as Canada and Australia. When I was in London last weekend, I learned that many Irish people with very few skills are ending up there because there is nothing here for them. God love them, there is very little for them in London either. The Government is not doing anything to give them hope for the future. Where are the jobs? That is the elephant in the room.

I accept that an appalling mess had been created over the previous 13 or 14 years. Nobody would deny that. When they came into power, Government representatives liked to talk about jobs, jobs and more jobs. Since then, we have had many launches and relaunches but things have not really improved on the ground. My constituency of Laois-Offaly seems to have been completely forgotten about. IDA Ireland's record in the area is absolutely disgraceful. There were two visits by IDA Ireland-sponsored companies to County Laois in 2011. Last year, there were no IDA Ireland-backed visits to the county even though IDA Ireland facilities are lying empty throughout the county. County Offaly has not fared much better. It received one visit in each of 2011 and 2012. Unemployment in counties Laois and Offaly has increased since the Government came into power. I wish I could stand here and say otherwise, but I have to set out the facts exactly as they are. When the Government took office, some 8,546 people were unemployed in County Laois. That number has since increased to 8,858. Over the same period, the number of unemployed people in County Offaly has increased from 9,234 to 9,270. They are the facts of the Government's record. The Government's job creation plans appear to be in tatters. I do not know whether its promises have been abandoned. The figures show that the dole queues in towns like Portlaoise, Portarlington, Rathdowney, Birr, Tullamore and Edenderry are expanding, unfortunately, even at a time of mass emigration. It is obvious from Deputy Mulherin's comments that she has not read Sinn Féin's job creation proposals. She came in to make a false accusation before running out of the Chamber. It is a pity she did not stay for the rest of the debate. The same thing applies to Deputy Lawlor. I would like to highlight three areas of the four-year stimulus package we have proposed. The fund that would be put in place as part of this proposal would have the potential to create up to 150,000 long-term and short-term jobs. Our proposal to re-establish the sugar beet industry, which was closed under the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government, would be of particular benefit to the midlands and the south east. The demise of the sugar industry had a negative impact on both regions. Over 350 farmers in County Laois alone were affected by it. Contractors and seasonal factory workers are jobless as a result of the closure of the industry. The site of the original factory on the Laois-Carlow border is derelict. We are proposing that a factory be re-established. The location in question, right on the edge of County Laois, is ideal as it would serve the midlands and the south east. We hope the Government will support our proposal, which involves the development of a bioethanol industry alongside this sugar processing facility and has the potential to create up to 5,000 jobs. We are also calling for money to be invested in water infrastructure. The Government is proposing to take money out of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and put it into meters. A comparison between the figures for Wales and the figures for Dublin will demonstrate why this approach will fail to save any water. Meters do not save water. One can save water by fixing the leaks in the system. The problem is that the Government's proposal will create some short-term jobs, but it will not save money in the long term because the leaks will continue. Sinn Féin's more sustainable approach, whereby this money is used to fix the leaks, will lead to a better return in the medium and long terms. We are also asking the national private pension industry to invest €3 billion in retrofitting. This green economy approach would pay back a dividend. The potential exists to retrofit 500,000 homes. It is estimated that this would bring a return of €748 million per annum. When one considers that this would amount to almost €7.5 billion over ten years, it is clear that a great deal of money is involved. Money would also come back in again from that. We believe the potential that exists in the wind industry must be harnessed in conjunction with local people. It would be preferable if the industry were owned by co-operatives or semi-State bodies, rather than foreign multinationals that would like to export cheap electricity from this country while we continue to import costly fossil fuels to fuel our homes. Rather than allowing these companies to export wind energy cheaply to England, we want it to be done the other way around. If we have surplus electricity, it will not be a problem if it is exported to England, Scotland, Wales or anybody else who will take it. I ask the Government to consider the three positive proposals I have made. I believe we should always make positive proposals. Some of those on the Government benches who have spoken this evening have ranted. They should not do that. They should examine what we are actually saying. Much of the media ignored what we said when we launched our document last autumn. We are not making these proposals to score points off anybody. We are making an honest attempt to highlight some areas in which jobs can be created. We urge the Government to give serious consideration to our proposals. We did not pluck them out of the sky. We have examined best practice in Europe and across the globe. We have studied the ideas that have worked in other economies. We ask the Government to give them serious consideration.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	551	The rural economy needs to be central to any jobs stimulus programme. Agriculture remains the most important indigenous sector of our economy. It has the potential to play a central role in future growth. It contributes over €20 billion to our national income. It accounts for 10% of exports. Crucially, the sector is far less dependent on imported inputs although it depends to a certain extent on imported fuel, the cost of which is unpredictable. If we are to ensure the future viability of farming, it is crucial that the current negotiations on the reform of the farm payment scheme have a positive outcome. The current single farm payment system is clearly unsustainable and moneys are unfairly distributed. Less than 2% of farmers receive payments of €50,000 or more. Some of these payments are made to businesses rather than to active farmers. Over 40% of farmers receive €5,000. I hope the outcome of the negotiations will see a decisive shift in favour of the majority of Irish farmers. The crisis caused by the discovery of horsemeat in burgers has brought attention to the need for a fair trading scheme for suppliers. While the crisis has reflected badly on the overall food sector, farmers are as much the victims as anyone else. They have had to deal with processors that apply downward pressure on the prices they are paid. Questions need to be asked about why any processor would need to import beef, or what is supposed to be beef, into this country. If the food industry is to fulfil its potential, it needs to be properly regulated in terms of traceability and content. My colleague, Deputy Stanley, spoke about beet sector. The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is well acquainted with the beet sector in Mallow. He does not need to be reminded of the disgraceful behaviour of Fianna Fáil in government, with Mary Coughlan at the helm. Along with Greencore and the IFA leadership, it sold out a viable sector of the agriculture industry in questionable circumstances.The loss to workers in the factories, as well as to the contractors and producers, is something we are still suffering today. My party supports the re-establishment of the sugar sector, which will include, as well as the production of sugar for food, the establishment of a bio-refinery plant to produce ethanol from beet. The estimated cost of the project is €350 million, with the potential to create up to 5,000 jobs. In the broader economy, there needs to be a specific focus on the potential for enterprise and job creation in rural communities. To address the clear imbalance in job creation, regional and sub-regional job creation targets should be set out for Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and other enterprise support agencies. One of the reasons farmers are at a disadvantage with processors is the shift away from co-ops. The surrender of power to large agri-businesses needs to be reconsidered. There should be a proactive plan to establish co-ops and to aid job creation in rural communities, including the creation of tax incentives for co-ops that create employment in rural or disadvantaged areas. In addition, vacant premises belonging to Údarás na Gaeltachta, the IDA and other public bodies should be made available for co-op use. One of the key barriers to the development of rural enterprise is the lack of high-speed broadband coverage. The ESB, Bord Gáis and Coillte could work together to roll out a comprehensive high-end broadband network. The ESB already owns 1,300 km of national fibre-optic network, Aurora Telecom is a Bord Gáis Enterprise company established in 2000 and operating specifically in fibre-optic network services, and Coillte has 220 mast sites and 100 new rural broadband sites. We are obviously opposed to the sale of Coillte. Its resources should be used as part of a job creation programme and we should further develop its role in eco-tourism. With ten forest parks and over 150 recreation sites, Coillte is a leading provider of outdoor recreation in Ireland, with an estimated 18 million visits to lands under its management this year. My own county of Kerry is an unemployment black spot, particularly the major town of Tralee. I listened aghast to Deputy Arthur Spring when he spoke about bringing two IDA visits to Kerry. It was a token appearance in the county which was brought about by pressure from my party, particularly our councillors and elected representatives, which tried to embarrass the IDA into doing something positive and constructive for our county. It has done nothing to bring any jobs into the county, not just this year or last year but over the past decade, during which time we hardly saw the IDA in the county. We need to decentralise the powers of the IDA to take into account the rural and disadvantaged areas of the west coast and the south west. It needs to be directed to go into those areas and to operate beyond a 50-mile radius of Dublin.

If it did nothing else, this motion would be valid because our unemployed citizens, of whom there are more than 430,000, are fast becoming the nameless, faceless people of our society. Unemployment is treated by many in the media and by the conservative political parties almost like the weather - something we can do nothing directly about. The only difference is that the weather is more talked about than unemployment. The neoliberal economic outlook sees employment as a by-product of the main economic activity, which is to make as much money as cheaply as possible in the shortest possible time and, invariably, by smallest possible number of people. Our view is fundamentally different. We ask what is the purpose of economic activity, and we answer that it is for the greater good of all the citizens. It includes the social economy, the voluntary and community sector, State-provided public services and enterprises, and businesses from the craft workshop employing two people to the multinational plant employing 2,000. The State has a role in all of these sectors, either directly or indirectly. Yet the Government speakers responding spoke as if this was not the case, and as if Sinn Féin had not presented alternative measures to address the unemployment crisis. This is most certainly not the case. Read the motion. Read our jobs plan. Look at the proposals made by the progressive voices who offer an alternative to the futile and sterile austerity strategy that is condemning a whole generation to unemployment and emigration. Our motion identifies essential measures to reverse the unemployment crisis, including calls on the Government to establish a jobs stimulus fund of €13 billion, target investment towards projects that will create employment, develop infrastructure and enhance our competitiveness, abolish upward-only rent review clauses, address excessive utility, legal and insurance costs, introduce progressive commercial rates and combat cartels, develop schemes that will guarantee young people jobs, training or continued education, develop regional targets and budgets to promote job creation and tackle economic inequalities, and work with the Northern Executive to promote an all-island approach to skills, job creation and economic growth. In responding to the motion, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, claimed the IDA had had its best years in a decade in the past two years. I have news for the Minister, news I have already brought to his attention. It is that the IDA was never seen much about the place in my home county of Monaghan during the so-called Celtic tiger or for decades before it, never mind during the current recession and jobs famine. The record shows that in 2012 the almighty IDA created a grand total of three jobs in County Monaghan and it lost ten, a net loss of seven. In the same year, Enterprise Ireland helped create 294 jobs and lost 142, a net gain of 152. That is based on the entrepreneurial spirit of the people of my home county. Of course, these are pathetic figures by any measurement. It is, sadly, what we have come to expect in the Border counties, but especially in County Monaghan. Small as the figures are, I believe it is very instructive that there is such a contrast between the IDA and Enterprise Ireland figures, with no other county showing a greater disparity. Our county has long been characterised by the industriousness and enterprising spirit of its people, as reflected in the many small and medium-sized enterprises. Many of these have gone under during the recession, with lights in businesses going out one by one in the streets of towns and villages across the country and region. However, many survive, and they need support and encouragement. They have got precious little of it from this Government or previous Governments. I want to conclude with this comment. I noted the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Perry. In his patronising and highly inaccurate speech, he spoke of Sinn Féin "coming down here". Well, I never. He trotted out the now usual coalition guff we have had to listen to here again this evening about our stewardship in the Executive in the North. Let me tell the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, and anybody else on the Government benches that Sinn Féin comes to this Chamber from the north, south, east and west of this country, and they can be damn sure we are here to stay.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	553	There were more than 17,000 citizens on the live register in County Louth when the Government came into power. Now, two years later, there are 17,207. The only reason the figures are not worse is the high level of emigration. Some 87,000 citizens left this State last year. Any government which looks to emigration, particularly of its young people, as a solution is a government that is not worthy of office. The last time citizens fled overseas in these numbers was after an Gorta Mór. In the last four years, this State has shed more jobs per capita than any other Western state since the Great Depression. That is the scale of the crisis. There are huge numbers of young people unemployed. The current rate is about 27.7%, which is one of the highest across the EU. As the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, must know from his constituency, these high levels of youth unemployment and emigration are having a devastating effect, particularly in rural Ireland.Local towns, villages and townlands are unable to field full GAA teams because so many of our young people are playing football, camogie and hurling in Perth, Brisbane, Vancouver, Boston and London. Sinn Féin and I have no hesitation in welcoming jobs announcements when they are made. There have been positive investments in Louth in recent times, among them PayPal and Ebay. These announcements are good news, particularly in the Dundalk region, and will hopefully draw the attention of other companies to the potential of Louth as a location for investment. However, when we look in more detail at the PayPal announcement, we see that as many as one half of the 1,000 jobs delivered will be filled overseas due to the language requirements. This Government needs to put in place a strategy that ensures we have the necessary skills for companies which want to create jobs here. It is also true that what has been announced thus far is only a drop in the ocean compared to what is required. Census figures show that County Louth is enduring the worst jobs crisis in decades with an unemployment level that is almost 5% higher than the State-wide average. Some of the many Government announcements never even come to fruition. In November 2012, the Minister of State with responsibility for the NewERA project announced that Nextag, a major network of shopping comparison websites, was to set up its new international headquarters in Drogheda, recruiting 125 people. In February, it was left to the IDA to announce that the promised investment would not be going ahead. The Government's approach to the jobs crisis has been to over-spin and under-deliver. We were told in September 2011 that the strategic investment fund was to be a major plank of job creation. Yet now 18 months later, there has been no legislation to establish it. The Government's stimulus plan, if it ever does happen, is unambitious and provides for only a €2.25 billion stimulus. The plan does not even recognise the scale of the crisis. Sinn Féin has put forward a fully costed jobs plan to deal with the need for growth, jobs retention, youth employment and the creation of new jobs. These are the kind of solutions the Government needs to start implementing and the kind of solutions that Labour - the party that claims to represent the interests of workers - should be proposing and implementing to create jobs and sustain existing jobs but Labour has lost its way. I commend the Sinn Féin motion to the Dáil and call upon Deputies, in particular the Minister for State because we cannot give up hope and because he is from a good lineage, to show an example by voting for this motion and against the Government amendment.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14707	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	556	This is particularly so since I have served in this House since 2007, longer than the Deputy yonder. I know I have earned my place here. Over the past two nights, there is no doubt that we have had an interesting and passionate debate and valid points have been made by both sides. Sometimes it turns a little bit raucous and many interventions have been quite rhetorical. In response to some points made by parties across the benches, if we are talking about the restoration of this economy and society, one must take cognisance of the fact that for the past decade or so, investment was primarily in construction, which fuelled the economy across many sectors. When that sector collapsed spectacularly along with the creation of the credit crisis, this Government when it came into power had to set out a new foundation and start investing in new areas so that one can upskill and retrain the very workers who have lost their jobs and now have to emigrate and about whom Sinn Féin is talking. One must put in place a set of new ideas that will begin new investments in a myriad of new sectors across the economy. If we are to have a motion in this House about labour market activation, I would rather the parties opposite interrogated Springboard, Momentum, the ICT skills conversion courses, the redundant apprentice placement scheme and schemes of that nature. If there is a critique of those schemes, I would like to hear it. One either agrees that the schemes are necessary or one does not. If we do not have schemes of that nature, we will not provide opportunities for those people, mainly young men who relied on the construction sector, to get back into work. In the two years that this Government has been in existence, we have put a myriad of schemes in place of which there has been a large take up. They have been quite successful, particularly JobBridge where a number of people have secured full-time jobs. I agree with some of the points made by Members opposite in respect of certain areas of Ireland where we have not had the foreign direct investment that is so necessary to sustain those areas. It is a pity I have only one minute left because I am only getting started. I have offered Sinn Féin a chance to sit down with me and interrogate each of our policies, many of which I cannot articulate because of the limited time I have on this motion, and I think it will take me up on this offer. I have offered it a chance to go through and critique each one of those schemes as long as it is an objective critique and not rhetorical and empty so that we can work with parties opposite regardless of their hue to get us out of this crisis. Sinn Féin may score points but that is its prerogative as an Opposition party. This is the boxing ring and that is the job of Opposition but if it is going to interrogate the Government, it should not use empty rhetoric and at least come to us with something specific that critiques the policies we are putting forward. It must acknowledge that there has been real growth in the economy, that there has been an net increase in jobs, that we are continuing to win the type of investments that are necessary across a myriad of sectors and that we are investing in these sectors. I attended an InterTradeIreland event last week. It is a North-South body created as a result of North-South relations. I met with a representative from Sinn Féin at that conference. There is an acknowledgement that if this island is to flourish, it must be on the basis of building cross-Border and bilateral links with our neighbours. The more we can embed that within the system and the more opportunities we can create through agencies like InterTradeIreland, the more we will raise the economic ship of this island. I apologise for the fact that I do not have enough time to respond to all the points raised.

It could be argued that they did very little even in opposition to articulate an alternative but they certainly did not create the mess of the property boom and bust. They were not at the reins when employment started to plummet. There would be an element of unfairness in blaming the Government for the mess created by Fianna Fáil. However, if I crash my car and bring it to someone who swears blind that they will fix it, charges me and takes a great deal of time doing little more than pretending to fix the problem, the mess becomes their fault.The people were told that the Government would fix things, that there would be plenty of jobs, but there has been nothing of the sort. There have been plenty of cuts, with unemployment, emigration and platitudes. This is not solving the problem. I say to Fine Gael and the Labour Party that it is their problem and that they must deal with it. Try as they might, members of Fianna Fáil cannot make it any worse because they are on the Opposition benches. However, the Government parties have made it worse, with unfair budgetary attacks on low and middle income earners and those on social welfare. Since the Government took office in February 2011, the unemployment figures in Finglas and Ballymun have remained relatively static, but that is as a result of mass emigration. Many football teams are struggling with numbers and have been forced to merge. Thankfully, Ballymun Kickhams have reached the all-Ireland final and I wish the team all the best. They will bring some hope to an area which, despite the very costly and protracted regeneration programme, remains a black spot for unemployment and an area of extreme deprivation in parts. A recent map drawn by the International Centre for Local and Regional Development shows that most of Ballymun and Finglas was suffering deprivation, while some areas suffered from extreme deprivation. That is not news to me. I have called on the Government to develop a jobs task force to focus on the most deprived areas, but these calls have fallen on deaf ears. In some parts of Ballymun and Finglas unemployment is nearly three times the national average. An economy cannot be built on unemployment. We cannot build an economy with more than 400,000 people relying on social welfare payments to feed themselves. We certainly cannot build an economy on the export of our young people. Some 167,000 people have left Ireland since the new Government was formed and many thousands more have given up the hope the Government will do anything to help them. It has utterly failed to create jobs and most of the time it looks like this is not its focus. It seems much more at home in extending European debts and attacking the low-paid rather than getting people back to work by encouraging job creation. The Government's plan has been high on rhetoric and low on job creation. Sinn Féin has produced numerous major plans to create jobs and kick-start the economy, a fact the Government, so uninterested in significant job creation, has ignored. It is disappointing but not surprising. Sinn Féin states job creation is the No. 1 priority. We have followed through on this commitment. At the end of 2012 we produced a plan to invest €13 billion in stimulating the economy, €100 million of which would save 15,000 jobs at risk. These are the businesses the Government has failed by imposing spiralling rates and the continuation of upward-only rent reviews. This plan would be funded by €5.8 billion from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, €1.534 billion from the European Investment Bank and €3 billion from the private pensions sector; it not cut €2.6 billion from capital projects as the Government plans to do in the next four years. According to the ESRI, the investment of €13 billion would create an average of 156,000 immediate and long-term jobs. Part of the plan includes a house building scheme to provide social housing which would create thousands of jobs with a costed investment of €1 billion. Instead, the Government spends more than €500 million a year on rent supplement and hailed social leasing as a panacea. This subsidised no one, except landlords, and it is unsustainable. People are struggling. The Finglas town centre has been allowed to be run down and is a shadow of its former self. The post office in the centre of the village is under threat and even larger businesses and companies are fighting to hold on. I support the motion.

On the point about cross-Border trade, IntertradeIreland is an outworking of the Good Friday Agreement, a cross-Border development body. However, there has been not one whit of development of cross-Border trade in recent years. On Tuesday night I was in Dunshaughlin canvassing with my colleague, Darren O'Rourke. The overwhelming issues that came up, at door after door, were unemployment and emigration. In the two years the Government has been in office it is clear that the crisis engulfing the country has not lost its intensity. A total of 300,000 people remain unemployed, 60% of whom are now long-term unemployed. Youth unemployment is running at 27%. A total of 87,000 emigrated last year, the highest figure since the Famine period.

It has never been our contention that the Government has been doing nothing. The evidence shows that its policies and strategy are failing. Last year the Taoiseach promised the creation of 100,000 net new jobs by 2016. Last year the economy lost 12,800 full-time jobs, with an increase of 14,000 part-time jobs. The increase in the number of jobs was on the basis of an increase in the number of part-time jobs. At the current rate of job creation, it will take 83 years to achieve the Government's target of creating 100,000 jobs and 250 years to eradicate unemployment in the State. These are the statistics. In many ways, the Minister of State has been given an impossible job.

If he says job creation is his No. 1 goal, his productivity is poor, with a rate of 100 part-time jobs a month. On the question of priorities, a total of €64 billion has been piled into the banks in recent years. In sharp contrast, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is operating on a reduced budget and capital investment budgets are cut, year on year. The SME sector cannot access funding from the banks. The recent ISME survey found that more than half of the applications for funding had been refused. For Sinn Féin and everyone else outside of the Government parties, the only measure of the success of Government policy is the creation of jobs. A total of 80% of all the jobs in the State are created in small and medium enterprises in the domestic economy. That is the real economy, the ignored economy. Sinn Féin's policies are designed to fix the real economy. The country is blighted with infrastructural inadequacies.

#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-03-13 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	575	I encourage the Deputies opposite to listen to the National Competitiveness Council which has stated there are severe infrastructural gaps which significantly reduce competitiveness. Six months ago my team and I met the troika which also acknowledged that there were infrastructural gaps. Fixing them would create sustainable efficiencies and enhance competitiveness in the future, making Ireland a better and more attractive place in which to do business and attract foreign direct investment. ln a counter-cyclical fashion, it would put people back at work.I refer to those who were hit hardest by Fianna Fáil's mismanagement of the economy. Sinn Féin has identified €13 billion of investment that could be accessed and put to productive use. When we met the troika, we asked if this money is available. The troika acknowledged that it is available. Government priorities and a lack of political will are the only things delaying matters. We identified feasible opportunity-costed projects such as those relating to broadband provision, transport infrastructure, sustainable energy, energy efficiency and regeneration and also school and health care capital development projects. These investments would create 150,000 jobs now. Sinn Féin wants to tackle the major market distortions the Government has allowed to remain in place, including the use of upward-only rents, the continued existence of cartels and excessive utility, legal and rates costs. The Government is rolling up procurement contracts and thereby making it impossible for small companies to access new business. It has ignored Sinn Féin's policy on progressive commercial rates, which would make it easier for struggling businesses to survive. The Government is closing down the county enterprise sector as it currently exists and is lumping it in with local authorities. It is doing so against the wishes of every major organisation that represents small and medium enterprises. The lack of action on upward-only rents is reprehensible and is delivering the killer blow to many retailers that are teetering on the edge. This week it is the turn of Monsoon Accessorize, which is about to close ten of its 18 stores. As a result, the majority of the company's 269 workers are under threat of losing their jobs. The Government must tackle this problem as a matter of urgency. The difficulty is that many of the Government's benefactors and backers are large landowners. It is they who represent the vested interest in this instance. The Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Perry, who previously said upward-only rents are not leading to business closures, last night indicated that there is no such thing as forced emigration. Those who operate in the real economy are genuinely concerned about the Minister of State's ability to do his job. The level of disconnect between Deputy Perry, who has responsibility for 78% of the jobs market, and reality is absolutely staggering. The Government has sought to create unsustainable competitive advantage through the erosion of worker's rights, the creation of inequality, the introduction of wage reductions and the maintenance of single-figure effective corporation tax rates. Sinn Féin is seeking sustainable competitive advantages in the areas of education, transport, broadband and energy efficiency and independence. Time is running out in respect of this matter. If the current rate continues to obtain, some 250,000 people will emigrate on this Government's watch. Unless this Administration changes direction, it is going to be too late.

I am advised that this does not arise under the interim risk equalisation scheme, nor will it arise under the permanent scheme. The charge to stamp duty arises on the renewal of a contract or on entering into a contract or renegotiation of the terms of an existing health insurance contract. For example, a reduction in cover would not be treated as renewal of an existing contract or entering into a new contract but as an amendment to an existing contract. The stamp duty or levy would be paid by reference to the accounting period under which the contract was initially renewed or entered into. The renegotiation of a contract to change cover would not be regarded as a renewal or as entering into a new contract. In the same way, a move from one insurance provider to another will also not result in double payments of the levy. It is not feasible or practical to draft legislation to cater precisely for every possible exceptional administrative scheme arrangement. Rather, it will be sufficient for the Revenue Commissioners, where necessary, to issue guidance notes to address any such issues that arise. They have been clear as to their intentions. I hope that addresses the Deputy's point.

It seems to be a practice within the VHI, as opposed to the other insurers, to bill a person for the levy for the full year if he or she was paying on a monthly basis. Under the old system, the payment was on an annual basis. Now that it is on a quarterly basis, does this mean a person will only have to pay up to the end of the quarter and the new insurance company will take over from then on, or will the practice that has existed up to now continue? The difficulty is that this creates a barrier to switching mid-year.

If someone renews a policy with the VHI on 1 April, paying from his or her salary on a monthly basis, but finds on 1 June that Aviva has a better deal and moves, VHI will charge an exit fee and the 12-month, annualised figure for the levy. I understand the argument is that the VHI has already paid the levy to the Revenue Commissioners. Now that the Revenue Commissioners will receive the money on a quarterly basis rather than on an annual basis, will the penalty for someone exiting from the VHI be less than was the case heretofore?

If there is a suggestion or a doubt over whether they may be occurring, it is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners. We will draw the Deputy's point to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners to allow them to straighten it out with VHI. There should not be double payments.
