The Committee of Public Accounts is a select committee and the main audit committee, the objective of which is proper oversight of Government expenditure in all Departments.  It has divided only once — on its establishment there was a vote for the position of Chairman.  Let me give an example to show how everybody works together on the committee.  It spent 18 months on a very effective investigation into FÁS under the then Chairman, former Deputy Bernard Allen.  Any Member who has served on the committee — Senator Deirdre Clune was a former colleague of mine on the committee — will know that it operates in a non-partisan and non-political way in the best interests of the taxpayer.  I will not refer specifically to which committee should conduct the banking inquiry, but we are all agreed that such an inquiry should take place.I draw the attention of the House to another matter.  Only two weeks ago the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, wrote to the Committee of Public Accounts and for the first time in the history of the State used Standing Order 163(7)(a) to halt the investigation of the committee into the Dublin Docklands Development Authority.  This Standing Order has never been used by a Minister of any party to halt an investigation of an committee.  Within one week, before the committee had produced its initial interim report, the committee received a letter from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, stating it was his belief that the matter would sit better within the remit of the finance committee.

The Government tried to reform the committee system but it rowed back on it.  That is okay because one will not get everything right the first time.  I welcome the announcement of two new committees to allow them to work better and more effectively.  Let us think about what is happening with the Committee of Public Accounts where two Ministers, Deputies Rabbitte and Howlin, are both saying that perhaps we will have a rerun of the investigations referendum to give additional powers to committees.  This is supported by Senator Bacik.  The public decided, very clearly, that it did not want additional powers to be granted to the Oireachtas.  Then two Ministers impugn the integrity of the independent chair of the Committee of Public Accounts.  They impugned his integrity and also undermined the independence of the committee.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Is the Senator seeking a debate on Oireachtas reform?

First, the committee system and the main ranking committee of the Oireachtas has been undermined.  Any future Government, and not just this one, can decide that if it does not like the structure of the committee or who is chairing it then the committee will not be allowed to investigate and a new committee may be set up.  That has never happened before.  The Committee of Public Accounts deserves its right and independent status, and to be independent of party politics.  The Government trumpeted the reform agenda but has, in the space of two weeks, done more damage to the independence of the committee than has ever been done before.

I would like the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform — and I mean "reform"— Deputy Brendan Howlin, to explain to me as a taxpayer, a citizen and a Member of the Oireachtas how he can decide that the Committee of Public Accounts, the main audit committee, should not oversee the banking inquiry.  Furthermore, I would like the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, to come in here and explain to the House why he is the only Minister in the history of the State to invoke Standing Order 163(7)(a) to halt an investigation.

At this point it is not for us to say which committee should conduct the inquiry, but it is clear we need full powers of inquiry for Oireachtas committees generally.On a different note, I welcome the news that negotiations are beginning on the rescheduling of Ireland's bank debt and that a decision will be made by October.  Members on all sides of the House very much hope the negotiations will go well and that they will result in a successful resolution for this country in October.I commend the Atlantic Philanthropies organisation funded by Chuck Feeney for the immense work it has done in recent years in terms of investment in civil society in Ireland and the huge contribution it has made on many issues, including children's rights and penal reform.

It was suggested he had been ambushed by one of the few members of the press who was unfailingly courteous and well-bred in dealing with every member of the public, including politicians.  I say this as someone who does not have very amicable feelings towards the press.  The issue was highlighted and treated in a way that created a moronic distraction from the real issues.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	82	Perhaps the Leader might allow me to finish.  I am seeking a debate on the press, the media.  It would have served the Taoiseach right if he had fallen into a flower pot full of carnivorous pansies — it would have taken a lump out of his backside — as he had refused to give a straight answer on the issue of gay marriage.  The only person in the country who had the guts to stand up and let everybody know that he was thinking about this serious issue was Mr. Bertie Ahern.  Every available committee has avoided it.  The Taoiseach is avoiding the issue of the press on which I asked for a proper debate.  We had a debate, but my colleagues were limp; the Minister was certainly limp.  I asked if an inquiry would be established and the answer was no.  I asked if we would send a representative to the Leveson inquiry and the answer was no, even though Ireland had been mentioned repeatedly as a place in which these practices were known to continue and sworn evidence had been given at the Leveson inquiry.  Were we going to send a representative?  The answer was no, but, apparently, a representative will go.  He will be the Press Ombudsman, Mr. John Horgan.I refer to the evidence given by the British Prime Minister who was afraid to take on the British media and could only manage rather than confront them because they would remorselessly, ceaselessly and mercilessly go after him, his family and friends if he dared to confront them.  The response to all the evidence, including accumulated evidence of criminality, of people taking their own lives and being financially ruined by the gentleman in question who is charged with defending the public, is that it appears from the Leveson inquiry that some editors might not be quite up to the mark.  If this is the evidence that will be given on behalf of Ireland because the Government does not have the wit to send somebody, it is a poor reflection.  I propose myself and shall write to Lord Leveson to offer myself to give evidence on what is actually happening in this country in the media, to which no one in government or in Parliament has the guts to stand up.  I am well aware of the way the press will take revenge on me, as it has traditionally done on any person who has dared to challenge their unelected, unaccountable and unrepresentative tyranny in which the rights of ordinary people are transgressed.  I am serving notice that I seek a debate and, if no proper person is appointed, I will offer myself.  It does not mean I will be taken, but I will certainly offer myself to give evidence and the evidence I would give might open a few eyes in this country which have been deliberately closed against events they think are too unpleasant to confront.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I seek a debate on concert promoters and how outdoor concerts, in particular, are managed.  I note the sad events at the Swedish House Mafia concert at the weekend in the Phoenix Park.  Coming from a county in which eight people lost their lives at an outdoor concert 25 years ago, it was sad to hear about the loss of life and people being injured at the weekend.  I call on the Leader to invite the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, to discuss policing arrangements at concerts and protocols with concert promoters.  I will also ask the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to request the attendance of the Garda Commissioner to outline the arrangements made with the Garda Síochána.  I will also ask the committee to request the attendance of MCD, the concert promoter, to provide an account of security.  The streetlights from the Phoenix Park to the city centre were switched off on Saturday night which meant some 45,000 young people had to walk the roads of the Phoenix Park without street lighting.  The Phoenix Park should not be made available if it is not a safe and appropriate place.  Many questions must be answered by the Garda Síochána, the concert promoter and management in the Phoenix Park.  Until there is a proper inquiry and detailed explanation, Phoenix Park should never be used as a concert venue.
#DennisODonovan	unknown-#DennisODonovan-party	unknown-#DennisODonovan-dob	unknown-#DennisODonovan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on the pilot training students who are trapped in America.  In the past 15 months some 180 students, not all of whom are Irish, have paid approximately €15 million through the Pilot Training College in Waterford, a sister company of Pilot Training Company Florida which trains young people to be airline pilots, mainly commercial pilots.  Since the story broke two weeks ago, I have had serious concerns about the lack of sympathy and concern on the part of the State, particularly the Minister responsible, Deputy Leo Varadkar.  I ask that the order of the House be amended to request the Minister to provide us with a detailed explanation of what happened.  Some of the statements issued by the parties involved in this matter are a source of serious concern.  We were told eight or nine months ago, for example, that the Irish Aviation Authority had received, through the auditors of PTC Waterford, confirmation that it was in a position to accept money to train these pilots, yet the Florida Institute of Technology which delivers the training stated yesterday that it had received no up-front payment and was owed €1.4 million in fees.  What has become of the €15 million received by PTC Waterford in the past 18 months?  This is a very serious issue and there are important questions to be answered.  I have been contacted by distraught parents throughout the country whose children are in Florida packing their bags, having received notice to quit from the landlord of their accommodation.  Most of them have not even completed 15% of their training, despite having handed over €85,000.  That sum would put a student through the full seven or eight years of training for medicine or veterinary medicine, yet no recompense or alternative training has been offered.When I raised this issue with the Leader, he suggested it be dealt with by way of an Adjournment matter.  However, there are broader issues involved.  What has happened to the €15 million paid to PTC Waterford and who is accountable for same?  There is clearly an issue in regard to light touch regulation, given that this is the third time such an incident has occurred on the watch of the Irish Aviation Authority.  The Minister must get a handle on this matter.  I am asking that he come before the House to answer a series of questions.  Last week I sent him a questionnaire containing 15 questions, but I have received no response.  In fact, when I contacted his office on Monday of last week, a staff member informed me that the issue was not even the Minister's responsibility.  Something is seriously wrong.  We have a duty of care to these young Irish people.  This House is the appropriate forum in which to hold a debate on the matter and I demand that it take place today.
#JohnWhelan	unknown-#JohnWhelan-party	unknown-#JohnWhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnWhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I share Senator Denis O'Donovan's concerns and apprehensions about events at the pilot training school in Waterford and its partner school in Florida.  I urge the Leader to invite, at the earliest opportunity, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to intervene in the matter.  The State cannot abandon these young students who have each forked out €85,000 for training.  These are ordinary working families, including some, from Stradbally and Portlaoise, to whom I have spoken, who borrowed the money to allow their children to train as commercial pilots.  They are not wealthy people who can afford the loss of such a sum.  As Senator Denis O'Donovan observed, the young people concerned are facing a very distressing situation in Florida, caught between a rock and a hard place.  Remaining would be in violation of their visa conditions, which would prohibit them from travelling in the future.  It would be absurd for anybody who aspires to be a pilot to take that chance.  The bottom line is that the State gave its imprimatur to this school.  Moreover, my understanding is that the Department, through Enterprise Ireland, is a stakeholder in the facility which was sanctioned by the Irish Aviation Authority as recently as 2010.  Parents and students were entitled to believe it had the backing of the State as a fully funded and reliable operation.  The statements released by the college on 3 and 9 July are of no comfort to the students and their families who are being given the run-around.  The Minister cannot wash his hands of the matter.  I, therefore, urge the Leader to take on board Senator Denis O’Donovan’s request.  While I am not seeking an Adjournment debate on the matter, I ask the Minister to show a more earnest concern on the issue.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	86	We have now had 20 summits on the eurozone crisis.  The latest continued for nine hours and has been adjourned until October.The Ministers at those conferences have kicked the can down the road so often they could go to a concert in the Phoenix Park and fit in with the other people attending.  We have to move away from the nods and winks, and the "It will be all right on the night" style of governance.  In the Financial Times yesterday, Wolfgang Munchau stated that the eurozone crisis will last for 20 years.  He stated:The message I took away from the summit is that the eurozone will not resolve the crisis.  In that sense, it was indeed a "historic" meeting.We need to know whether we are looking for €32 billion, €64 billion or as much as €279 billion, which, according to the University of Limerick study, is the figure we owe on the covered debts of Irish banks.  As a result of so many people failing to solve the crisis for the 20th time we need an independent council of economic advisers at European Union level, rather like our fiscal council.

I ask that our Ministers make that point because we cannot continue with euro crises happening all the time when there is massive unemployment throughout so many member countries.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I join with my colleagues, Senator O'Donovan and Senator Whelan, in expressing concern about the trainee pilots.  Eighty-five thousand euro is a great deal of money for people to invest only to find they are keeping their side of the bargain but the people who agree to provide the training are not keeping their side of the bargain.  It is important that there is a full investigation into this matter and a debate on it in the House.I raise the issue of the decision by Allied Irish Banks to withdraw the medical graduate loan scheme.  It has decided it will no longer provide loans for students who want to train to be medical doctors here.  It is extremely disappointing that a bank which is owned by the Irish taxpayer has decided it will not provide funds for young people who want to train to be doctors here.  It is sad that this bank has decided to withdraw the loan scheme and not provide funding for people who have the necessary criteria to get into college and who want to further their careers by obtaining a medical degree.  If they cannot get a job here they can get a job anywhere in the world with a degree from an Irish university.  This move is extremely disappointing.  We should ask the Minister for Finance to come into the House to deal with this matter and discuss the reason the bank has taken this decision when all the other banks have decided to provide loans for students attending Irish universities.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I support the call made by Senator O'Donovan to discuss the breakdown in the commercial relationship between the pilot training centre based in Waterford and the Florida Institute of Technology.  A number of Senators made the point that many young Irish trainee pilots have been left high and dry, and there is a responsibility on the State to protect young people who find themselves in this vulnerable position.  There are issues in regard to visas.  I am aware that the institute in Florida is doing its best but the Government has a responsibility also, especially in view of the costs many of these young people and their families paid out to ensure their children get the education and training they need.It should be stated also that the State has made a significant contribution to this pilot training centre.  In 2008, the centre received €18,000 in support from Enterprise Ireland.  In 2010, the State agency invested €400,000 of taxpayers' money to take out what are called repayable preference shares in the company.  There are legitimate questions which need to be answered.  Questions arise in regard to the role of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, and the reason it failed to spot this problem, and there are issues of regulation.  Also, there are question marks over the Government's response and the supports it is giving to the people who find themselves in this position.It is not good enough to say that we should raise this matter on the Adjournment when we are talking about a very serious issue affecting many young people who have been left stranded.  There is a responsibility on us to have a full discussion in the House on this important issue to allow us ask the important questions of the Minister responsible, namely, the practical supports he will give to those young people who find themselves in this position and the steps he intends to take to ensure such mistakes do not happen again.
#JimmyHarte	unknown-#JimmyHarte-party	unknown-#JimmyHarte-dob	unknown-#JimmyHarte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I support other Members who raised the plight of the trainee pilots, one or two of whom are from the Derry area.  The families of these trainee pilots have invested a great deal of money in the training course and now face the possibility of that career being taken from them at short notice.  I hope a resolution will be found so that they can complete their training.I also wish to get an explanation from the Minister for Justice and Equality on the reason the High Court which is hearing appeals on circuit is sitting in Castlebar but is hearing up to 12 cases a day from County Donegal.  One case being heard in Castlebar involves people from north Inishowen, which means they must make a round trip of 300 miles.  It is the first time in the history of the State that the High Court on circuit has been held outside County Donegal to hear cases related to people from County Donegal.

I compliment Senator O'Donovan on his excellent work in this regard since it was first brought to his attention on 26 June 2012.  I spoke to their spokesperson in Florida, Mr. Conor Deeney from Derry.  They feel let down by the Government as they have been left stranded in Florida and the Government is taking no responsibility in this regard.  The Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is on radio and television programmes day and night.  It is amazing that one Minister could be given such exposure and yet say nothing.

These young people have invested between €85,000 and €91,000 for a course in the private Pilot Training College in Waterford, which is partly funded by Enterprise Ireland and registered by the Irish Aviation Authority.  We have a direct responsibility in this regard and we cannot wash our hands of it and stand idly by.  To be in government means Ministers take responsibility and action.  It does not mean one gives soundbites on RTE or other media.

The Florida Institute of Technology is owed $1.4 million, equivalent to €1.13 million, and has taken action.  The chief executive of the Pilot Training College in Waterford, Captain Mike Edgeworth, has made no statement and furthermore the offer of places to complete the students' studies in England will require that further fees be paid, which will not be provided by the State.  This is a very serious matter.

I have no doubt they will be.  The drink and drug-fuelled violence that ensued was appalling and horrific, and shocking for the image of Dublin and the country.  The same can be said for the level of under-age drinking that occurred, with people wandering the streets out of their minds.  I support the calls for the Minister for Justice and Equality to come to the House for a debate following examination of the matter by him, the Garda, the promoters and the Office of Public Works.  I am not sure the Phoenix Park is suitable for a concert by such an act.

I refer to the behaviour, conduct and the manners of these young people on the streets of our towns, and not only on O'Connell Street about which Senator Sheahan spoke recently.  One finds it around St. Stephen's Green or anywhere, and I witnessed it myself recently.  It is shocking that these people, young boys and girls who look no older than 15 or 16 years of age, are out on the streets insulting people, visitors and locals alike.  It is absolutely shocking.

I am sure cigarettes will be mentioned during the debate.  As someone who is bitterly opposed to smoking, I believe Senator Crown will make a strong case for banning smoking altogether.  A figure I read today that caught me by surprise was the seizure of 7 million cigarettes at Dublin Port yesterday.  That means 50 million smuggled cigarettes have been seized in Ireland in the past six months.  That is a huge figure.  Many of those cigarettes were counterfeit and would have endangered health even more than the risk of cancer from normal cigarettes.  The Retailers Against Smuggling association has brought the matter to our attention and has called for a minimum fine of €10,000, as against the current fine of €1,000 which does not act as a deterrent to cigarette smugglers.I am not sure I am terribly enthusiastic about the Retailers Against Smuggling because I am sure it is looking after its own interests.  That said, we must accept the case given that 50 million illegal cigarettes have been seized already this year.  There must be something that we can do or action we can take.  I am told smuggled cigarettes are on sale at every farmers' market and every fair.  Surely we can take steps to stop it.  Some years ago one could not walk down Talbot Street or Henry Street in Dublin without being offered illegal cigarettes or cigarettes being sold for a low price.  We have talked about alcohol being sold at below cost but cigarettes being sold at below cost do just as much damage.

#JohnKelly	unknown-#JohnKelly-party	unknown-#JohnKelly-dob	unknown-#JohnKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I want to question the role of the Civil Service here.  Who runs the country?  Is it the civil servants or is it the Ministers and Government? Since I was elected to this House, I have been infuriated by various Departments and how the Civil Service has misguided Ministers.  The Department of Education and Skills recently gave the wrong information to the Minister on the issue of a small school.  The Department apologised subsequently for its mistake but the damage had been done to the small school in my area.  At committee meetings, officials from the Department of Social Protection tell us how they are dealing with appeals, how fast the scanning system is working and that the turnover time is three to four months, when in reality I had to write a letter this morning for a client who applied for carer's allowance last November and who has heard nothing since then.  The Department of Health was advised by HIQA that Roscommon County Hospital was unsafe — and, consequently, we lost the accident and emergency department — yet it never visited Roscommon hospital.  Officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government do not want my Wind Turbines Bill 2012 to see the light of day because it is contrary to the wishes of the Irish Wind Energy Association.  However, the worst example is something that happened recently.  I earmarked the need for an ambulance base in Ballaghaderreen, given that we are 30-plus miles from every hospital.  I suggested to the county manager that we co-use the fire station in Ballaghaderreen and he considered it a great idea.  I put it to the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, who said it was a great idea.  I put it to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Phil Hogan, who agreed it was a great idea.  The chief ambulance officer for the western region sat down with the acting chief fire officer in Roscommon for five hours and they drew up an agreed plan.  The station officer at Ballaghaderreen fire station and all the staff are agreeable.  Mr. Colm McCarthy reported that services should be co-used and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has said it is Government policy to share services.  Yet a senior civil servant in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is trying to block it.  I call for a debate on the role of civil servants and how they interact with Ministers.  Who has the power?

In between we have had several other cases which should bring home to us that we have a ticking bomb in society when it comes to anti-social behaviour.  In fact, it is more than anti-social behaviour, because that is giving a respectability to what is happening.  It is sheer and brutal violence, not just among the perpetrators but targeting innocent people in the community.  On television programmes recently I saw individuals who said they were walking down the street, not interfering with anybody or having an argument with anybody, and young boys and girls approached them and brutalised them on the street.  It may seem the talk of an old fogey to speak about the abuse of alcohol.  However, there is no doubt that alcohol is severely abused here.  It is a drug.  If we do not stand up and put our heads above the parapet, once and for all, backed by the media and all those who want a properly regulated society, we will reach a point of no return.  The wake-up call from the Phoenix Park is but the start.  Given the seriousness of the situation I ask the Leader, before the summer recess, to allocate a couple of hours to allow us debate the issue in detail.  We must put our stamp, as an arm of Parliament, on what is happening and call for severe remedies — I am not talking about penal remedies — in the context of legislation.  If that is not done following this wake-up call, we have missed another opportunity and we will be back here discussing it again in a couple of years.
#MichaelMullins	unknown-#MichaelMullins-party	unknown-#MichaelMullins-dob	unknown-#MichaelMullins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I strongly support Senator Ó Murchú in regard to the concert in the Phoenix Park.  While insufficient arrangements were in place for the orderly running of a concert, it is clear most of the problem was alcohol-fuelled.  Clearly, a major scandal here is the issue of below-cost selling and a lack of control of alcohol.  The multiples are running rings around us as legislators and around the Revenue Commissioners.  There are three issues, including the damage to health and the associated costs of rehabilitating people severely damaged by alcohol.  The loss of revenue to the Exchequer is alarming.  A colleague produced figures over the weekend showing that one item sold below cost by Tesco during a bank holiday weekend cost the State €250,000.  This one item over one weekend puts the magnitude of the problem in context.  It is causing damage to small businesses and it is closing down pubs.I was in a small shop in Kilconnell, outside Ballinasloe.  The owner of the shop told me he was not renewing his liquor licence, which costs €1,000, because he cannot compete.  It cost him over €24 to buy a case of alcohol direct from the supplier.  It was being sold in a multiple in Ballinasloe for €18.  That is another €1,000 lost to the State.  We need a debate on how alcohol is regulated and controlled and how the State is losing so much money through the manipulation of the system, to their advantage, by the multiples.  They are destroying the lives of so many young people.  I support the call on the Leader to do something about this at the earliest possible occasion.
#MarcMacSharry	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-party	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-dob	unknown-#MarcMacSharry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	129	On the same subject, I welcome a debate on the issue.  Of the 45,000 people who attended the concert, many had a good time.  I had family members at the event.  However, there is an alcohol issue in the country.  One of the first steps we could usefully take is to provide an opportunity to invite young people's organisations to the Chamber.  We have afforded organisations which wish to abolish the Seanad the opportunity to use this Chamber.  We could listen to young people, for a change, and to what they feel are the steps to be taken to assist them to enjoy themselves.  Far be it from me, as a relatively young Member of the House, to dictate how I think they should conduct themselves at a concert and whether alcohol should be available to people of certain ages.  It would be useful to listen to them.  In the earlier part of the autumn, perhaps the Leader can facilitate a debate by selecting a number of organisations representative of younger teenagers and those approaching their late 20s and 30s to inform the House how it can assist them to provide ways to enjoy themselves.On the issue of below-cost selling, the groceries order was mentioned yesterday.  The interference in it by previous Governments was not helpful.  One must consider the elimination of the pub throughout Ireland, where barmen and responsible bar managers can control the environment and the level of alcohol being consumed by people.  It is a better approach than the cheap below-cost selling by supermarkets used to attract people to buy other goods.  If the approach is to be useful, it must start with young people, not with Members.

The people have paid the price for the terrible negligence and behaviour of people who did their jobs and did not do their jobs in respect of the bank guarantee.  We owe it to the Irish people to establish facts and culpability.  Regardless of what has been said today, let there be no banking inquiry until we can establish facts and culpability.Like others, I refer to the terrible loss of life at the concert in the Phoenix Park.  I extend my sympathy to the families involved.  As a parent of one teenager and one younger person, I know fellow parents are tearing their hair out.  We are failing completely with drugs, drink and young people.  We are totally lost and we must use this moment to unite and deal with it.A range of solutions is required.  Will the Leader invite the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, to the House to discuss legislative, educational and parenting solutions?  It is the norm now for young people to walk around with a crate of beer under their arms.  I saw a young man walking along the street the other day with a crate of beer in one arm and a loaf of bread in the other.  Children are losing weight because they are consuming too much alcohol and not eating.  What happened in the Phoenix Park at the weekend is horrific.  It is an issue not only for concert promoters but also for nightclub owners.  There are frequent incidents in nightclubs of young people being kicked in the head while they are on the ground.  It is a wonder more are not killed as a result of such incidents.

The first person who overdosed at the concert at the weekend got into difficulty early in the evening, at 7 p.m.  We need to quit talking about this problem and instead agree to address it in a multi-pronged way.  If legislation is required, it should be introduced without delay.

We have had many debates in this House on the need to curtail alcohol advertising, particularly where it is linked with sporting events in the context of sponsorship.  There has been a great deal of hand-wringing, but we seem to fall down when it comes to specific actions in this area.  I asked some weeks ago whether the Government has specific timelines for introducing legislation to address these problems.  I look forward to a greater urgency in this regard.I welcome Senator Healy Eames's reference to the importance of education in tackling the widespread misuse of alcohol.  I suspect that a survey of citizens on what they consider the main national emergencies facing the country would show a universal focus on the economic crisis.  At the same time, however, there is a type of dullness of thought around the severe problem of alcohol abuse in this country now and into the future.

Of course, not everybody behaves in this manner, but it is a sad reflection on those who do.  While I agree with Senator MacSharry that it is appropriate to listen to young people, I warn against a kind of timidity whereby we would stand back from declaring to the younger generation what it is we expect of them.  We must be far more ready to lead by example ourselves and to tell young people what is expected of citizens of this country.  Let us listen to younger people by all means, but we must also be clear and focused in our strategies for dealing with this serious problem.
#CatherineNoone	unknown-#CatherineNoone-party	unknown-#CatherineNoone-dob	unknown-#CatherineNoone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	136	I am loth to repeat what has already been said.  I agree in particular with the points made by Senators Labhrás Ó Murchú and Michael Mullins on the events in the Phoenix Park at the weekend.  I take this opportunity to express my sympathies to the families of those affected.  Nobody expects a young person who goes out in the evening to attend a concert not to return home.  In my professional life I often defend nightclub and pub owners who are sued when a person is seriously injured on their premises.  Notwithstanding the frequent debates on the broader issue of alcohol abuse, the deaths at the weekend must serve as a serious wake-up call to all of us in this House.  We cannot have a situation where young people have such easy access to cheap drink and drugs that they can get themselves out of their mind to the extent that they will treat other people any which way.  Such behaviour presents a serious threat to the person engaging in it, to others and to society.We must have a zero-tolerance approach on this issue.  It has worked in New York and can do so here.  I urge the Leader to invite the Minister to the House to discuss possible legislative solutions to deal with the problem.  Senator Rónán Mullen got to the nub of the matter in his suggestion that this is not something children are picking from the trees.  Rather, they see older people behaving in an inappropriate away because of excess alcohol consumption.  It is learned behaviour which is cultivated and promoted among younger people.  I have spoken about this issue numerous times.  We have already held a Private Members' session on the below-cost selling of alcohol.  I back up the comments of Senator Mullins in this regard.  The multiples are running rings around us and we need to take control of the issue.  There may be a loss of money to the Exchequer.  We are broke at the moment and we need the money but that is a minor issue compared with the fact that people can go into supermarkets, see stacks of drink everywhere, bring it home and stuff themselves with it.  They can end up in hospital and endanger other people.  I am passionate about this issue.  We need to get the Minister in here to discuss it as a matter of urgency.

I call on the Leader to do his utmost to get it on our schedule, if possible.  I commend the Senators who have raised the matter, in particular, Senator O'Donovan, who has given strong leadership on this from day one.  It is an important issue and we stand to be counted on how we support our young people, especially when they are in trouble abroad.I am horrified at what occurred in the Phoenix Park but it is not a once-off phenomenon.  Only last week an eminent journalist died following an unprovoked, random attack.  Some months ago there was mayhem in the streets of the city in the mid-afternoon.  Last year, a young Polish man, a shift worker going to his place of work at 7 a.m., was kicked to death on the streets of Dublin.  It is not only a city phenomenon.  It is taking place in rural towns and villages after night clubs close at weekends.  There is always a concern at festive occasions that something like this will occur as well.I heard a well-known, long-established and experienced county councillor on the radio recently.  He was discussing the fears of elderly people living in rural places.  We have gone back to the days when, out of fear, people hid bill hooks and pikes in the thatch to protect themselves.  This is taking place at a time when we are being threatened with the wholesale closure of police stations.  The Leader knows what I am talking about because he raised the issue only last week, as did Senator Leyden.

I seek assurance from the Minister that the presence of the Garda in rural places will be protected.  It is not all about drink.  The emphasis so far has been on drink and, certainly, it is a significant factor, but drug abuse is ten times worse and more at the root of the problem.  One can drink so much but somehow manage to behave oneself, but if one takes those drugs — people are prepared to pay any price for them and price is not a factor——

I am not satisfied it is being addressed with the urgency it demands.  There seems to be an authority in charge of every second thing in the country.  The Irish Aviation Authority appears to be washing its hands of this problem.  The statement on its website suggests it is looking for other training for those students but it does not state that the other training colleges will not charge those students more money.  This must not and, one hopes, will not be allowed to happen.  I call on the Leader to ensure the Minister brings the Irish Aviation Authority to heel and determines whether the authority sought evidence, which it has the power to do, that this school had enough funds in its kitty to run the course and take on students.  That is one of the primary aims of the Irish Aviation Authority but I am unsure whether it has done so.  If it has done this, the money should be there to pay for the training.  Why is it not there?  The Minister must find out.  There is no way those students can be asked to pay for it.I wish to raise an issue with the Minister for Health.  Why are people not availing of the free dental scheme?  Only 600,000 people took up the scheme last year but 3.3 million are entitled to it.  This is the only health area where, out of a budget of €63 million that was allocated in 2011, only €51 million was spent.  Will the Leader ask the Minister for Health about it?  We know oral health is related to heart disease and every other type of health.  It is preventive medicine and will save the country money.  If one avoids dental treatment for too long, it becomes much more expensive.  It is throwing good money after bad to say the only ones entitled to receive dental care are emergency cases.  I ask the Leader if we can have a debate on this issue as it is looking at it the wrong way.  We should be providing funding for preventive dental care services.

Following the expenditure of some €64 billion, one of the committees of the Houses, under the stewardship of Deputy John McGuinness, has published a roadmap for how such an inquiry could take place.  I was flabbergasted and taken aback by the comments of a Minister on Sunday.

I have raised the issue here on a number of occasions, but I am not holding my breath that something will happen because it is six weeks since I wrote to the Garda Commissioner about the activities engaged in on O'Connell Street, the Liffey boardwalk, etc., and I have yet to receive a reply.I want to pose a question about the shambles at Ulster Bank and make the following points.  If wages are still being paid into customers' accounts, lodgments are still being made and money is not being distributed to pay bills by direct debit, etc., it is safe to assume that Ulster Bank has built up significant deposits in recent weeks on which, no doubt, it will have earned interest.  I seek clarification on the interest it has earned on such deposits since the commencement of the IT glitch.  I assume the idea that it should profit in any way from this affair would not find favour.  I hope, therefore, that any interest earned on deposits will be given to customers.  Personally, I am sick of hearing the CEO of Ulster Bank state customers will not be out of pocket.  I believe the figure being amassed on a daily basis on deposits is massive.  One must deduce, therefore, that it is not in the bank's interests to sort out the IT problem quickly because it is earning significant interest on deposits on a daily basis.

I was saddened when I heard about them on Saturday morning.  Perhaps we do not need an inquiry to find out what happened but a complete ban on the holding of concerts in the Phoenix Park.  As someone who grew up and, perhaps, knows every blade of grass and nook and cranny in the Phoenix Park and every street adjacent to it, the OPW has done a phenomenal job in recent years in attracting visitors to it.  Irrespective of what inquiry is done by the Garda, security company, concert promoters or Office of Public Works, nothing will change what was done in the Phoenix Park by a few young people.  Thousands of people use the park daily.  It is home to Dublin Zoo and hosted the Bloom festival over the June bank holiday weekend.  Wonderful cycling, motor, athletics and cricket events, to name but a few, are held regularly in the Phoenix Park, but one does not hear anything about the benefits it provides for the good citizens of the country.  Why has the Phoenix Park been brought into disrepute?  The reason is that concerts, whether held here or anywhere else in the world, attract drugs and alcohol.  I drove through the Phoenix Park on Thursday last at approximately 5 p.m., which was several hours before a concert was due to commence, and I was appalled to see people carrying crates of beer and consuming drugs in full view.  The issue is not the security at concerts, as the promoter, Garda and Office of Public Works will agree, but the fact that the grounds of the Phoenix Park are too large to secure.  I ask that the Minister of State with responsibility for the park, Deputy Brian Hayes, ban concerts in the park.

The young man in question, as a university student, had been attacked in the centre of the capital 25 years ago.

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	166	A large number of the issues raised require a detailed response.  Senator Darragh O'Brien raised the issue of the Committee of Public Accounts carrying out an inquiry into the banking sector.  The Government is determined to get to the bottom of what took place on and around the night of the bank guarantee.  Its objective is to ensure the most effective mechanism is used to get to the truth.  The focus is to have a very robust form of inquiry within the confines of the Constitution and which sheds as much light as possible on who was involved, politically and administratively, in the decision-making process that resulted in the State being in the debt-ridden position we are working hard to undo.Since the outcome of last October's referendum, substantial and detailed analysis has been carried out on the scope for Oireachtas inquiries operating within the parameters set out by the Abbeylara judgment.  The main conclusions of this legal assessment are summarised in the recent letter sent by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to the Chair of the Committee of Public Accounts following the Government's consideration of options for an Oireachtas inquiry into banking matters at the end of last month.  As the Minister's letter makes clear, the work carried out by his Department and the Office of the Attorney General highlights that there are two main options which need to be evaluated carefully in determining an appropriate legal framework for an Oireachtas banking inquiry.As regards the committee that should deal with it, I have an open mind on this.  I actually believe the Committee of Public Accounts should be the one that deals with it but the Government needs to reflect on the basis of the Attorney General's legal advice as to what type of inquiry meets our objective and is legally robust.  I believe this is what everybody in the House wants and Members have commented in that regard.  It is important we examine all the proposals and listen to the views of both committees and of the wider Oireachtas.  However, it is essential we get the structure right, which is what everybody in the House wants.  We will have the Minister, Deputy Howlin, in the House on Friday next so we will have an opportunity to raise items with him then.With regard to the issue raised concerning the Minister, Deputy Hogan, I understand court proceedings were issued against Dublin Docklands Development Authority last week so perhaps that may be the reason.  However, I am not sure why that action was taken.Senator Bacik called for a debate on the merits of another referendum on Oireachtas inquiries, which we may consider.  She also mentioned the excellent work of Mr. Chuck Feeney and his charity organisation, which is closing down.Senator Norris referred to the Leveson inquiry and the press.  We had a very comprehensive debate on the whole area of the media on 22 February, in which Senator Norris took part.  We are also looking for a debate on media ownership, which I am trying to arrange with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte.  We cannot be having debates on the press every day in the House as there are other things we have to do.Senators Martin Conway, Paul Coghlan, Eamonn Coghlan, Labhrás Ó Murchú, Marc MacSharry, Michael Mullins, Fidelma Healy Eames, Rónán Mullen, Catherine Noone, Ned O'Sullivan and Tom Sheahan spoke about the incidents in the Phoenix Park on Saturday last.  I share the widespread public concern at the series of disturbing incidents which took place at the concert.  Gardaí are reviewing what happened and are in touch with the concert promoters in this regard.  I agree that what we have witnessed, even in photographs in the newspapers today and earlier in the week, is absolutely appalling, and it is wrong to see that type of behaviour on the streets of our capital city.  It was brought to my attention that before they went into the concerts, many people were loading up their beer on the steps of the Courts Service, the main court building of this country.  This should not be allowed to happen; of that there is no question.  More generally, it is worth noting that developments will be taking place in the near future in regard to licensing of the event and security sectors, so there will be an opportunity for the House to discuss the whole question of security for such concerts.The question has been raised as to whether such concerts should be allowed in the Phoenix Park.  Again, we will certainly raise the point mentioned by Senator Eamonn Coghlan with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and the OPW.  I am sure people will have second thoughts about holding such concerts in the future when we see such despicable behaviour.  I would agree with all the Members I have mentioned that most of the trouble was fuelled by young people drinking to excess and, indeed, taking illegal drugs.  I will certainly try to arrange a debate in the House.  Senator MacSharry raised the question of young people coming to talk to the Seanad in this regard.  I know this is an issue Senator O'Keeffe has raised with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and we are endeavouring to have young people come to the House, perhaps in the autumn, to discuss a number of problems which they may have.  These incidents were undoubtedly deplorable and must be addressed.  On the issue of anti-social behaviour, the Garda Síochána uses the broad range of current legislative provisions to tackle all such behaviour and street violence robustly, including conduct attributable to excessive drinking.  These provisions include powers granted under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts.  In addition, the Criminal Justice Act 2006 introduced incremental procedures for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  Gardaí may also issue fixed-charge notices in respect of offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct.  In other words, a range of mechanisms and legislative processes is already in place,  but the measures must be implemented.  If the Garda requires additional resources to do so, those resources should be granted.

As Senator O'Donovan mentioned, I have suggested that he raise this issue as an Adjournment debate matter.  Nevertheless, I will endeavour to have the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport come to the House for a debate.  In the meantime, I propose that an Adjournment debate would allow for the specific facts of the case to be addressed.  I appreciate Members' genuine concerns on this matter, which I have already raised with the Minister.The Irish Aviation Authority has responsibility for approving and overseeing flight training organisations in the State, of which the pilot training centre in Waterford is one.  The company operating that facility also has a training college in Florida.  The facility in Waterford is experiencing certain difficulties in regard to the fulfilment of its obligations to students.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has advised me that the Irish Aviation Authority, which comes under his remit, is treating the matter very seriously and is keeping him updated on developments as the situation evolves.  The Minister has reached agreement with the authority that it will fund the flight costs of those self-financing students in Florida who have an existing contract with the pilot training college and wish to leave the United States.  The authority has also assured the Minister that all flight and ground training carried out to date in Florida will be credited towards the students' final qualifications.  The aviation authority has had a representative in Florida for several days to offer assistance to students, approximately 80 of whom are Irish, on a one-to-one basis.  That representative has now returned to Ireland and the authority is sending a replacement to Florida.The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is in regular contact with the authority and is monitoring developments closely.  The authority has assured the Minister that it is making every effort to ensure the situation is resolved satisfactorily.  It is working with the pilot training college in Waterford and other training centres to explore how students might be facilitated in completing their training elsewhere, either in Florida or Ireland.  That is the most up-to-date information from the Department.  I do not know whether the Minister could add anything further if he were to come to the House.  However, I do not propose to——

I will raise that matter with the Minister for Finance.  I have a lengthy reply in respect of the EU deal on bank debt but perhaps we will discuss that on another day.  I take on board the Senator's point and I will raise it with the Minister.Senator Harte referred to the issue of the courts in Donegal.  As the Cathaoirleach correctly pointed out, that is a matter for the Courts Service rather than the Minister for Justice and Equality.Senator Quinn raised the seizure of 7 million illegal cigarettes at Dublin Port and pointed out that over 50 million such cigarettes have been seized to date this year.  The Senator is correct to observe that these cigarettes are sold at farmers markets, car boot sales and elsewhere.  However, I wish to praise the Garda and Customs and Excise which are both doing an excellent job in tracking down these cigarettes and other contraband goods that are being brought into the country.  We all appreciate the health problems associated with cigarettes.  Such problems are exacerbated for those who smoke the type of cigarettes to which the Senator refers as a result of certain substances the latter contain.  I agree with the Senator that there should be a minimum fine for people who are caught either in possession of or selling these cigarettes.  I will certainly raise the matter, as appropriate, with either the Minister for Justice or Equality or the Minister for Finance.Senator O'Sullivan requested a debate on law and order and raised the issue of the closure of Garda stations.  The Minister for Justice and Equality will be coming to the House before the end of the session in order to deal with certain matters.  I will try, however, to arrange a separate debate on the question of law and order and policing.Senator Keane requested a debate on the free dental scheme.  I will endeavour to have the relevant Minister come before the House for such a debate.Senator Sheahan referred to the situation at Ulster Bank.  I agree that no bank should profit from what has occurred in this regard.  Representatives from Ulster Bank came before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform last week.  In my opinion, those people have even more questions to answer now than was previously the case.I believe I have covered most of the items raised.  I apologise to Senators if I failed to provide answers in respect of any of the questions that were asked.

Two of the student pilots in question e-mailed me this morning and indicated that they are flying home tomorrow at their own expense.  There is something rotten going on here.  I am not blaming the Minister but there is no doubt that this problem must be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  These people's visas are expiring and they have received notices to quit.  In such circumstances, I must press the matter to a vote.  I will raise it again tomorrow and perhaps the Leader might be in a position to provide assistance in respect of it at that point.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14461	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I am pleased to present the Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2011 for the consideration of the House.The main purpose of the Bill is twofold.  First, it implements the commitment in the programme for Government to reform the joint labour committee, JLC, system.  Second, following the High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case of July 2011, the Government has undertaken to prepare and deliver a comprehensive reform package, as the implications of the High Court judgment are not confined to the JLC system.  What is required is a programme of reforms to deliver a robust legal framework for both registered employment agreements, REAs, and JLC sectoral wage-setting mechanisms under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004.The system of REAs has been in force since 1946.  REAs are collective agreements made between employers or their organisations and trade unions.  They are freely negotiated between the parties thereto.  Section 27 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 allows the parties to a collective agreement to register their agreement with the Labour Court.  If registered, the agreement is given legal effect and is binding not only on the parties to the agreement but on all workers and employers of a type or category to which the agreement is expressed to relate.  It has been estimated that there were between 62,000 and 79,000 workers in the sectors covered by REAs in 2009.JLCs are independent bodies composed of representatives of employers and workers in a particular sector, with a chairman who is appointed by the Minister.  The purpose of JLCs is to discuss and agree rates of pay and conditions of employment to apply to workers in a particular sector.  Prior to the 2011 High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case, JLC proposals were given effect in employment regulation orders, EROs.  The terms of an ERO were incorporated in the individual contract of employment of every worker to whom it related.  JLCs have their origins in bodies empowered to set minimum wages first established in Britain and Ireland under the Trade Boards Act 1909.  As part of a major reform of industrial relations in the Industrial Relations Act 1946, these bodies were given the new title of joint labour committees and their competence was expanded beyond the fixing of minimum wages to cover the regulation of conditions of employment as well.  JLCs have operated in areas in which collective bargaining is not well established and wages tend to be low — for example, in the hospitality, retail grocery and contract cleaning sectors.  It has been estimated that there were between 150,000 and 205,000 workers in sectors covered by JLCs in 2009.As the House is aware, the process of making EROs has been found by the High Court to be unconstitutional.  The High Court ruling underscores some of the main features of the recommendations for reform that were put forward by the independent review report on statutory wage setting mechanisms, the Duffy Walsh report, which was carried out prior to the High Court ruling.  The commissioning of an independent review of the ERO and REA systems was one of the undertakings given by the last Government in the context of the EU-IMF-supported financial assistance programme for Ireland.The High Court action in the John Grace Fried Chicken case was only one of a continuing series of legal challenges to the system of statutory wage-setting mechanisms.  A challenge to the electrical contracting REA was successfully defended in the High Court in 2010 by the State but is under appeal to the Supreme Court.  In addition, there are a number of pending High Court challenges to the current electrical and construction REAs, all of which challenge the constitutionality of the legislation underpinning the REA system.  Since publication of the Bill in December 2011 and during its passage in the Dáil, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, has taken the opportunity to bring forward a number of significant amendments to ensure additional constitutional safeguards for the legislation, strengthen its intent in certain aspects and provide greater legal certainty for all stakeholders affected by it.  The more significant amendments have dealt with the principles and policies applying to the framing of registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders, the timeframe for the variation of registered employment agreements, provisions to protect the position of employers not party to the original sector level collective agreement, provisions governing the conduct of a review of the JLCs and provisions regarding the granting of temporary exemptions from the obligation to pay the terms prescribed under employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements.  These amendments, and others, have advanced the Bill considerably in terms of setting out how the legislation will work in practice.  I will outline in detail the provisions of the Bill.The Bill is divided into three parts.  Part 1 deals with general and preliminary matters such as the Short Title of the Bill.  Section 1 is a standard provision in legislation providing for the Short Title, collective citation, construction and commencement provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 defines the two industrial relations Acts referred to frequently in the rest of the Bill.  Section 3 provides for the repeal of certain sections of the Industrial Relations Acts 1946-90 that are either anachronistic or being replaced in the Bill.Part 2 of the Bill makes the necessary amendments to four sections in the Industrial Relations Act 1946 to provide for new procedures for registering, varying and cancelling registered employment agreements.  Section 4 amends section 25 of the Act of 1946 by providing for a new definition of "registered employment agreement" so as to differentiate between those made before the commencement of the Bill — those registered by the Labour Court — and those made after its commencement — those confirmed by ministerial order.Section 5 sets out more detailed principles and policies than under the 1946 Act.  These are the principles and policies to which the Labour Court must have regard before registering an employment agreement.  The 2011 High Court judgment confirmed that the Oireachtas may devolve certain law-making powers to other bodies such as Ministers, the Government or the Labour Court.  However, it also made it clear that where the Oireachtas devolved a law-making power to some other body, it must give that body guidance on how the law-making power was to be used.  That guidance should be set out in primary legislation by way of clear principles and policies.A key element of the reforms provided for in the Bill is the introduction of provisions to ensure comprehensive Oireachtas and ministerial oversight of the REA and JLC systems.  Accordingly, new registered employment agreeements will not come into force until they have been confirmed by the Minister.  Sections 6 and 7 make necessary changes to the 1946 Act to ensure variations or cancellations of new or existing registered employment agreements must also be confirmed by the Minister before such variations or cancellations will have effect.  Henceforth, the confirmation, variation or cancellation of an registered employment agreement may be annulled by either House of the Oireachtas within a specified period.The 1946 Act does not provide a satisfactory definition of the phrase "substantially representative", nor does it provide any guidance on how it is to be measured.  The Labour Court has drawn attention to the limitations of the original statutory definition.  This issue was carefully considered in the Duffy-Walsh report.  In this context, the Government accepted the recommendations made in the report for changes to be made to the provisions of section 27 of the Act of 1946 to provide that, in the case of trade unions, the degree to which trade unions were representative of workers to whom an agreement related should be measured by reference to the unions' membership in the employment or sector concerned and, in the case of employers or employer organisations, the extent to which they could be regarded as representative should be weighted by size, measured by the number of employees normally employed.Accordingly, section 27 of the 1946 Act is being amended by section 5 of this Bill to provide guidance to the Labour Court on how the question of representativeness should be determined.  Moreover, amendments introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil have provided for a more explicit ordering of the priority ranking of the principles and policies to be taken into account by the Labour Court in considering an application for the registration of an employment agreement.  Particular considerations that have been identified in this regard are the representativeness of the parties and the "common good" or public interest objectives of establishing harmonious industrial relations between workers and employers and the avoidance of industrial unrest.Section 5 also amends the 1946 Act to provide that every application to register an employment agreement must be accompanied by confirmation provided by the parties to the agreement that they are substantially representative of the employers and workers to whom the agreement applies.  A consequential provision at section 7 amends the 1946 Act so that the Labour Court may cancel an REA if either the worker or employer parties have ceased to be substantially representative of the workers or employers concerned.Section 6 amends the 1946 Act to reflect the recommendation of the Duffy-Walsh report concerning the introduction of a time-bound process by which the terms of an REA may be varied by the Labour Court in exceptional circumstances without obtaining the consent of all parties to the agreement.  The amendment is intended to facilitate more rapid adjustment to changing economic circumstances and the imperative of maintaining employment.  Amendments were introduced to section 6 on Committee Stage to speed up the variation of REAs by setting specified time limits to each stage of the process, as agreed with the EU-IMF-ECB troika in the context of the memorandum of understanding.Under the Industrial Relations Acts there is a legal requirement that employers within the sector covered by an REA, who may not belong to the employers' organisations that signed the original collective agreement, must nonetheless apply the minimum standards prescribed by the REA.  In light of recent legal challenges to the statutory wage-fixing mechanisms, the Attorney General has advised that, in order to maintain their universal applicability, additional safeguards to those included in the published Bill should be introduced to protect the position of employers who were not party to the original sector-level collective agreement by enabling such parties to seek a variation of an REA in certain limited circumstances.  Accordingly, a further amendment to section 6 of the Bill was introduced on Committee Stage to enable those who were not party to the original agreement to seek a variation of an REA in certain limited circumstances.The new section 28(10), inserted by section 6 of the Bill, provides that an employer who is affected by an REA but who was not a party to the agreement may apply to the Labour Court to vary the agreement in certain circumstances.  The applicant will have to satisfy the court that there has been a substantial adverse change in the economic circumstances of the sector to which an REA relates since it was registered or last varied before the court can consider any application to vary it.  As a further protective measure, no such request may be made within 12 months of the initial registration or last variation of the REA or of the date on which a previous application for variation was refused.Section 7 makes the necessary changes to the 1946 Act to enable the Labour Court to conduct a review of the circumstances of an industry to which an REA applies to establish whether there has been a substantial change in the circumstances of the relevant industry and whether the continued registration of a particular REA is desirable.  Section 8 amends the Act of 1946 to provide a new straightforward enforcement mechanism to secure compliance with REAs instead of resorting to a criminal prosecution.  A complaint about non-compliance by an employer with an order of the Labour Court for compliance with a registered employment agreement may be brought before the Circuit Court by or on behalf of the worker concerned or the Minister if he or she considers it appropriate to do so.  The Circuit Court shall make an order directing the employer to comply with the terms of the Labour Court order.Section 9 amends the 1946 Act introducing new inability to pay provisions in respect of registered employment agreements.  These provisions are substantially the same as those proposed in regard to employment regulation orders which I will outline when we come to deal with such orders.  However, for registered employment agreements, the inability to pay mechanism would only apply where the registered employment agreement permitted it to apply.  Accordingly, where an registered employment agreement so provides, an employer in financial difficulty may apply to the Labour Court seeking a temporary exemption from the requirement to pay the rates of remuneration in the agreement.Part 3 of the Bill deals with the joint labour committee system and the making of employment regulation orders.  Section 10 provides for a new definition of "employment regulation order" to relate exclusively to those orders made after the commencement of this Part of the Bill when enacted, that is, by ministerial order.The Duffy-Walsh report had recommended that reviews of the establishment orders of existing JLCs be undertaken periodically to ensure the range of establishments to which they applied remained appropriate and that any necessary amendment might be made to the establishment orders by which they were created.  Accordingly, section 11 amends the Act of 1946 to provide that the Labour Court will, following commencement of the Bill and at regular five year intervals thereafter, conduct such reviews.  Following a review, the Labour Court may recommend that a JLC be abolished, amalgamated with another JLC or that the establishment order for a JLC be amended.  An amendment to the Bill, as published, provides that the procedures for the conduct of a review of the establishment order for an existing JLC should be analogous to the public inquiry procedure for an application for a new establishment order setting up a JLC as provided under section 38 of 1946 Act.Section 12 inserts new provisions in the Act of 1946 to provide for the regulation of the decision making procedures with regard to the formulation of proposals for employment regulation orders by a JLC, the reception of representations by a JLC and also a requirement that the committee's chairman shall have regard to a relevant Labour Court recommendation in the event of a casting vote being exercised.  The High Court, in the John Grace Fried Chicken case, declared section 42 of the 1946 Act to be unconstitutional because it was invalid having regard to the provisions of Article 15.2.1o of the Constitution which provides that the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State vests in the Oireachtas.  In this context, the High Court judgment found that section 42 of the Act of 1946 failed to prescribe sufficient principles and policies to govern the exercise of the powers conferred on JLCs under the Act.  Accordingly, section 12 introduces the necessary amendments to the Act of 1946 to establish the principles and policies to which a JLC must have regard from now on when formulating proposals for employment regulation orders.  The new provisions will guide the formulation by JLCs of proposals on the fixing of remuneration and conditions of employment and also provide for the regulation of the JLCs’ own decision-making process.As with registered employment agreements, REAs, amendments to the published Bill provide for a more explicit ordering of the priority ranking of the principles and policies to be taken into account by a JLC in considering proposals for the making or variation of an ERO in addition to more explicit ordering of the priority ranking of the principles and policies to be taken into account by the Labour Court in making a recommendation to a deadlocked JLC.  In this context, the public interest objectives of establishing harmonious industrial relations between workers and employers and the avoidance of industrial unrest are the key considerations.  The constitutionality of the restored JLC system should be strengthened as the Bill not only provides for a direct role by the Minister in making employment regulation orders in future, but also ensures that, with regard to all such orders, including orders for the establishment, variation or abolition of JLCs, the Minister may refuse to make any order that he or she considers inappropriate.  If the Minister is not satisfied that it is appropriate to make an order he or she may refuse to do so and notify the Labour Court of the reasons for the decision.  These measures are also complemented by the standard scrutiny procedure for the laying of orders before both Houses of the Oireachtas.Whereas previously an employment regulation order could provide for any number of different rates of pay for different categories of workers, the Bill provides that a JLC may make proposals for a basic rate and will have discretion to take account of recognised standards or skills in the relevant sector as well as length of service in fixing up to two higher hourly rates under employment regulation orders.Are the Senators still with me?

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14461	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	186	The adult wage rates that may be proposed by a JLC will also be linked to sub-minimum rates that will apply in the same proportions as were originally fixed under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000 in respect of employees aged under 18 years, first-time job entrants, and employees undergoing training.JLCs will no longer set certain conditions of employment that are already provided for in existing primary legislation.  In particular, provision for a Sunday premium will be removed from the scope of employment regulation orders.  However, it is important to bear in mind that the special position of Sunday working is still recognised and provided for under the Organisation of Working Time Act.  During the debate on Committee Stage in the Dáil on the issue of the Sunday premiums, there were some suggestions that these new provisions would mean a downward revision of pay or the removal of such premiums where these have been paid to workers previously covered by employment regulation orders.  This is not the case.  Under the new legislation, workers in sectors covered by JLCs will have the same statutory entitlement to compensation for Sunday working as all other workers in the country.Section 13 inserts a number of amendments to replace provisions struck down by the High Court judgment in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.  The High Court judgment highlighted how questions about the appropriateness of criminal sanctions exacerbated concerns about the delegation of broad regulatory powers to bodies such as JLCs and the Labour Court.  The Bill introduces an alternative enforcement mechanism to criminal prosecutions.  The new enforcement mechanism will offer an alternative to a criminal prosecution by enabling a complaint about non-enforcement to be brought before the Labour Court.Section 13 introduces a new procedure to enable an employee or an employee's trade union to make a complaint to a rights commissioner that an employer has contravened an employment regulation order in relation to the worker.  The Minister does not consider that this alternative to the original enforcement provision in section 45, which was struck down by the High Court, should be the only enforcement mechanism to ensure that wages are not paid at less than the statutory minimum rates set out in employment regulation orders.The Minister intends, by means of the proposed workplace relations reform programme, to develop a new and comprehensive system of supervision and sanctions within the framework of the workplace relations commission.  It will bring together the existing services of the Labour Relations Commission, the Rights Commissioner Service, the Equality Tribunal, the National Employment Rights Authority and the first-instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.As Senators will be aware, last week the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, announced his proposals for the workplace relations reform programme.  One of the features of the programme is to ensure a more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of all employment law, including the national minimum wage, registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders.  The Minister will present his proposals to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education this week.  He intends to seek approval for drafting the workplace relations (reform) Bill, which will give statutory effect to the reforms, including strengthening the enforcement of awards.  He intends to make provision in the Bill for a range of enhanced compliance measures, including the use of compliance notices, fixed charge notices and a new mechanism for enforcing awards of the workplace relations commission adjudicators and Labour Court determinations.  I am sure Senators will agree on the importance of ensuring there is a consistent approach to enforcement mechanisms across the range of employment rights legislation.Section 14 provides for a derogation from the scope of employment regulation orders, EROs, for companies in cases of financial difficulty.  As I have mentioned, these provisions mirror the mechanisms for claiming an exemption from the requirement to pay the rates of remuneration in a registered employment agreement, REA, at section 9.  The basis for claiming an exemption on grounds of inability to pay is less restrictive than the equivalent measure under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000, which has never been used to date.  The objective of the provision in the Act of 2000 was that the relief sought by an employer would be available in cases in which a majority of employees so agree.  The new provision covers situations in which a majority of employees may not necessarily agree but it can be proved to the satisfaction of the Labour Court that there is a genuine — albeit temporary — inability to pay and that appropriate safeguards can be assured.  The maximum period of an exemption will be 24 months, with a minimum of three months.  An amendment to the Bill as presented provides that two consecutive exemptions will be permitted within the overall two-year time limit rather than a single one under the Bill as introduced, where this is necessary to safeguard employment.  An amendment to the Bill as presented provides that an employer's application for an exemption on grounds of inability to pay should not rest solely on the declared support of the majority of workers.  The key criterion should hinge upon the survival of the employer and the preservation of the jobs of the individuals concerned.  The Labour Court must also have regard to whether granting an exemption might have an adverse effect on employment levels and cause a distortion of competition in the sector to the detriment of employers not party to the particular application.Section 15 provides that, in the context of the reconstitution of existing JLCs, all current independent members of the JLCs will cease to hold office and new appointments will be made.  In future, independent members will hold office for a period not exceeding five years.  Section 16 provides for consequential amendments to the Employment Permits Act 2006 and the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.Section 17 amends the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984.  It will ensure that payments due to a worker arising from a decision of a rights commissioner or a determination of the Labour Court made under the Bill, when enacted, will be treated as debts for the purposes of employees' rights on the insolvency of their employer.Section 18 strengthens the provisions for informing workers of their statutory entitlements by requiring the employer of any worker to whom an ERO or REA applies to include the terms of that ERO or REA in the written statement of terms of employment to be given to the worker under section 3 of the Terms of Employment (Information) Act 1994.  This section also provides for prompt rectification of incomplete or incorrectly stated terms by allowing a NERA inspector to give directions to the employer concerned.  The new approach will enable matters to be rectified earlier at workplace level, thereby avoiding unnecessary recourse to rights commissioners and on appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.To complement the provisions of the amending legislation, the Minister will proceed with the following additional reforms.  Steps will be taken to reduce significantly the number of JLCs in place through a process of abolition or amalgamation using the Minister's powers under section 40 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946.  Benefits in the nature of pay, including overtime and the conditions under which it becomes payable, will be standardised across sectors covered by JLCs, either by means of a nationally agreed social partnership protocol, a statutory code of practice or through a request to be made to the Labour Relations Commission to initiate social partner consultations to this end.  The Minister will arrange for the preparation of a new statutory code of practice on Sunday working to provide guidance to employers, employees and their representatives in sectors covered by employment regulation orders on arrangements that may be put in place to comply with the options specified at section 14 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997.  The rights commissioner or Labour Court will have regard to this code in making a decision, and implementation and enforcement will be as per the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997.  The Minister intends to request the Labour Relations Commission to prepare the code.  The code of practice will subsequently be given formal status by means of a ministerial order.The legislation represents an appropriately balanced approach.  The reform of the statutory wage setting machinery operating at sector level and placing the JLC and REA systems on a more secure legal and constitutional footing represents a significant commitment by the Government to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers.  The overall effect of these reforms will be to help reduce the cost burden of record keeping and compliance and will make the long-established minimum wage setting mechanisms fairer and more responsive to changing economic circumstances.  These measures, in turn will enhance competitiveness and preserve jobs in the affected sectors.I commend the Bill to the House.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I thank the Minister of State for a thorough explanation of the Bill.  Much work certainly has been done by the Department's officials.I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  Under previous Governments it is likely a Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs would have steered the Bill through the House.  However, such a distinctive and necessary portfolio no longer exists since March 2011, just as the Department of Labour ceased to exist in 1993.  Both events occurred at a time when the Labour Party was entering government after a period in opposition.  Is this connected or is it a coincidence?  It appears the cause of labour has lost out at ministerial level.  It is fair to say it also lost out in the Bill.Before dealing with the substance of the Bill, I register my great dissatisfaction at the speed with which it is going through the House.  There is only one full sitting day between Second and Committee Stages in the House.  In the other House there was five months between Second and Committee Stages, the Bill being introduced in January and Committee Stage taking place in June.  While I do not want the Bill bogged down in this House for five months, more time would have been in order.  On Committee Stage the Minister said the Bill would be brought to the Seanad on 18 July.  Furthermore, the sponsoring Department, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, is introducing a Bill on Thursday.  The Government needs to schedule the taking of legislation more efficiently.  The issue of JLCs and registered employment agreements has generated much controversy and debate in the past two years, including between the partners in government.  There was a remarkable campaign against the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation by Labour Party Members which was so sustained that it must have been organised rather than spontaneous.  It was clear that the Minister's partners in government had no difficulty with there being an unprecedented campaign against him.It is more than one year since the High Court made its judgment and rendered unconstitutional laws that had stood for 60 years.  In the immediate aftermath of the decision Fianna Fáil published legislation to correct the situation.  It would have provided for the amendment of the Industrial Relations Acts of 1946 and 1990 in order that the statutory mechanism for the fixing of remuneration by an employment regulation order would be consistent with the requirements of the Constitution.  The Fianna Fáil proposals would also have decriminalised a failure on the part of an employer to comply with an employment regulation order, as recommended in the Duffy-Walsh report, and replaced the provision with a civil enforcement mechanism.  If the Fianna Fáil Bill had been enacted, it would have enabled the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to make new employment regulation orders for all such workers under a new statutory mechanism that would take into account and rectify the failings of the 1946 and 1990 Acts.The Fianna Fáil Party accepts the need for a Bill to deal with the High Court ruling last year that the JLC system was unconstitutional.  However, the legislation introduced by the Government is seriously deficient and could undermine JLCs and employment regulation orders and leave workers in a vulnerable position.  The concerns we expressed have not been addressed and there has been a failure on the part of the Government to maximise protection for workers.We are having this debate at a time when the unemployment rate is 14.9%, the highest since the economic crisis began.  Almost 20,000 more people signed on the live register in June alone.  What is deeply worrying is that the number long-term unemployed continues to rise.  There has been a 7% increase in the number of such claimants in the past 12 months.  The latest quarterly household survey figures show that the long-term unemployed account for 60% of the total and the level of youth unemployment stands at 30%.  I speak about tackling the scourge of unemployment, having started a business in 1986 for the sole purpose of creating employment.  I experienced the recession in the 1980s and the ravages of unemployment and know what it does to human beings.  In the article entitled, Lunch with the FT: Jean-Claude Trichet, in Saturday's edition of the Financial Times, Jean-Claude Trichet considered the question of how the European would get its economy straightened out and said it was all about competitiveness.  I concur.  We need a discussion about competitiveness and the people.

#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The JLCs were established by Mr. Seán Lemass in 1946.  His intention was to protect people who did not have access to the traditional system of collective bargaining based on trade union representation.  JLCs are independent bodies for determining minimum rates of pay and conditions of work for workers in certain sectors.  Each JLC includes a representative of workers or employees in the sector concerned.  It was far reaching and progressive legislation for its time.  The pay and conditions agreed to by representatives on JLCs were given the force of law in employment regulation orders and employers were liable to be prosecuted in the civil courts for further breaches of the orders.  This provision was found to be unconstitutional by the High Court last year.  CSO figures indicate that the average earnings of workers in the JLC structure are approximately €300 per week.  The JLC system applies to those employed in the catering and hotel industries.Tomorrow at the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will announce his proposals on the workplace relations reform programme.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, said:One of the features of the programme is to ensure a more proportionate, efficient and effective enforcement of all employment law, including the national minimum wage, registered employment agreements and employment regulation orders.  The Minister will present his proposals to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation this week.  He intends to seek approval for drafting the workplace relations (reform) Bill, which will give statutory effect to the reforms, including strengthening the enforcement of awards.In the 1970s I was a member of the national women's committee of the Federation Workers Union of Ireland and started a business with the sole purpose of creating employment.  There is a very serious issue in this sector.  As we said, there are vulnerable workers.  Many of those employed in the catering and hotel industries are the so-called "new Irish" and they need to be supported and given a voice.  There is a fear that these workers do not have the confidence to speak up for themselves.There has been an over-reaction on the issue of Sunday trading, as I said to Senator Deirdre Clune.  It is a fact that hotels and restaurants are open on a Sunday.  I agree that there should be some form of compensation for working on a Sunday, perhaps time off in lieu, but premium payments went overboard in recent years.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The reforms in the Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill which I welcome are far reaching.  The complete overhaul of the JLC and registered employment agreement structure is appropriate at a time of economic difficulties.  If the Bill had been introduced ten years ago, it would not have received the same reception.  We must ensure we are competitive, that employers can survive and that employers and employees can thrash out the issues involved and move forward.  That was the idea behind the JLCs originally.  Senator Mary White referred to Mr. Seán Lemass.  I had not realised that the committees had dated from his time.Senator Mary White also mentioned that Deputy Willie O'Dea had brought forward a Bill in the name of Fianna Fáil following the High Court's recommendations of July 2011 which I think was a rehash of the lapsed Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill 2009 that had been introduced in the 30th Dail by the then Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, under the direction of the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, former Deputy Mary Coughlan, but had not reached Committee Stage.  That Bill introduced just one of the 19 recommendations made in the Duffy-Walsh report.  The Bill introduced by Deputy Willie O'Dea also failed to reflect the High Court's recommendations.The Duffy-Walsh report recommended a complete overhaul of the system and the Bill before the House implements its recommendations.We have heard a good deal about it in recent years, especially in the hospitality sector, to which Senator Mary White alluded.  There was a ludicrous situation where in some cases employers were obliged to pay three times the rate to those working in the hospitality sector outside Dublin.  As a result one could not have a meal in Cork city on a given Saturday and restaurants and bars in hotels and stand-alone restaurants simply did not open because they could not afford to do so.  This legislation will rectify this ludicrous situation and allow it to be changed.  The High Court recommendation of last year in the case of John Grace Fried Chicken Limited challenged the catering sector, especially outside Dublin.  The High Court stated the catering arrangement was unlawful and represented a disproportionate interference with the property rights of the plaintiff.  It also stated the joint labour committees, JLCs, gave powers to the Labour Court with no policy guidelines.  As a result of that judgment, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, was no longer investigating or implementing the provisions of registered employment agreements or JLCs.  As a result of the High Court case, too many employees were left in a vulnerable position.  We are introducing this legislation to ensure this situation can be rectified and in order that employers will be given protection and an opportunity to negotiate rates and conditions of pay and develop an agreement that can then be registered with the Labour Relations Commission or the Labour Court.There have been issues with registered employment agreements.  There was an outrageous situation where electricians and electrical contractors could not afford to take on jobs because they had to pay electricians between €15 and €18 per hour in some cases.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The Senator is right.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	192	The individuals in question were willing to work for a lower rate, but because of the agreement they were precluded from doing so.  I hope some sense and balance will be brought to the issue with a recognition that there are two sides to the story.  The Labour Court can now take into consideration the economic environment in which the employment is based.  It can recognise the particular enterprise and regulate competition in a given sector and how it is affected.  The example that comes to mind immediately is the construction sector, but it may also apply to the hospitality and catering sectors which may be competing with the sectors in other jurisdictions.  All of these items can now be taken into consideration to ensure a fair and balanced approach is taken.As the Minister of State noted, the issue of Sunday pay is addressed under the Organisation Of Working Time Act.  This is a pragmatic approach.  A code of practice should be developed to which all sides could contribute.  Anyone employed in the catering and hospitality sectors will recognise that Sunday is the same as Monday.  However, if one was employed as a private secretary in a solicitor's office, generally speaking, one would work from Monday to Friday.  If such a person was asked to work on Sunday or do overtime, it would be a different matter.  We should let this come into play and let the code of practice reflect such scenarios.  There are regional variations.  There are historical reasons for all these arrangements, but the reasons are not very evident in today's climate.  Some regional variations cannot be provided for, but there should be uniformity throughout the country.I welcome certain provisions and the fact that the Bill will provide clarity for the Labour Court in certain areas.  It will recognise changes in certain industries and types of enterprise, which is most important.  The amendments introduced on Committee Stage in the Dáil are welcome especially for registered employment agreements.  The Minister of State has covered this area.  Civil penalties, as opposed to criminal proceedings, will be part of the Bill, which is a significant consideration given the High Court judgment.  The rights commissioner will also come into play.  Perhaps the Minister of State might expand on this point.  What is the timescale involved and how does he envisage this operating?I welcome the Bill.  It is refreshing, reflects the economic climate of today and gives balance for employees and employers.  It allows for a situation where if an employer is in difficulty, it is not a simple case of there being no room for consultation.  There are provisions whereby in difficult economic circumstances where an industry is experiencing particular difficulties, all of this can be taken into consideration.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I welcome the Minister of State.  There are several aspects to this legislation.  When the industrial relations machinery was overturned in the High Court and sections 42, 43 and 45 of the Industrial Relations Act 1946 and section 48 of the 1990 Act were all found to violate Article 15.2 of the Constitution, we should have accepted it.  The economy was far better off afterwards.  Most of what is included in the Bill is unnecessary.  We still have minimum wage legislation and I support the Government's defence of it against the IMF.  As IBEC pointed out, there are still 40 tranches of legislation designed to protect employment.  What are we at?  The real winners were those in the industrial relations industry which comprises an immense number of gurus, committees and so on.  The Minister of State referred to JLCs, registered employment agreements, rights commissioners, the LRC, the social partnership protocol, codes of practice, the Labour Court, the workplace relations reform programme and a public inquiry procedure.  We are running around on mountains of jargon and paper.  In one case not referred to by the Minister of State Ryanair defeated the whole lot in the Supreme Court.  Are we protecting the egos of those involved in the industrial relations sector, with its incredibly complex procedure and use of jargon, or are we considering how the economy works?  If it is about how the economy works, I support the Government which defended the minimum wage legislation.  There is also other legislation to protect workers adequately.I am not aware that the sky has fallen down in the years since the decision was made.  That was one fear expressed, but the economy has continued to work.  The real economy has been at its most valiant, trying to protect jobs against the recession in the economy.  The objective in industrial relations should be to deal with the unemployment rate of 14.9%.  Those of us in employment should take second place for the moment.  The excesses of social partnership, undoubtedly, did serious damage to the country, especially in employments such as the ESB and so on, and this should be recognised.  I recall the Taoiseach speaking at the ICTU conference when he distanced himself from social partnership because it had become excessive.  It was part of the reason the whole place had imploded.Let us consider what people who provide work say.  The Construction Industry Federation has expressed its disappointment.  The Irish Hotels Federation has stated the JLCs provide an outdated and regressive employment framework.  The Restaurants Association of Ireland has stated it was outraged.  It took a case which it won.  It seems that much of the legislation represents our trying to unpick a decision against those who work.  This reduces investor confidence in the country and undermines the status of the courts as the institutions to adjudicate on these matters.  If one entity wins a case in court, we change the law and get it some other way.  Even the most mild of the employers' organisations, IBEC, has stated we should avail of the opportunity to walk away because there is plenty of protection for employer rights.  We should have shrunk the IR sector and relied on those basic provisions which IBEC set.  IBEC is not the most radical of the business organisations — ISME is — and does not much like what we are doing either.Looking through the provisions, I mentioned all the quangos and committees referred to in the Minister of State's speech.  He stated: "It has been estimated that there were between 62,000 and 79,000 workers in the sectors covered by REAs in 2009."  There is a difference of 28%.  Is the Department so imprecise that it does not know what the Bill is supposed to protect?  He later stated that the JLCs cover between 150,000 and 205,000 workers.  There is a 36% difference between those two numbers.  Why does the Department not know?  Is this Bill not merely the IR sector trying to expand in an economy where the emphasis should be on employment creation and where the protection against exploitation, on which we all will support the Minister of State, is through the minimum wage laws and the established employment laws?It seems that what we have is an unsatisfactory compromise between the two parties in Government.  They have produced a mishmash.  Had the Government gone for straightforward employment growth, as Senator Clune stated, Sundays and Saturdays would be working days.  We all are plugged into the international system and one should do away with all of the quangos.  In parts of the Minister of State's speech, the quangos become more powerful.  One can be compelled to be part of them rather than go the Ryanair route and state one does not want to be part of them.  If a person is paying good wages and has working conditions which might not satisfy the IR sector but satisfy those working in them, that is good news as far as I would be concerned, particularly in the difficulties in which we find ourselves.I shall take a look through other parts of the Minister of State's speech for when we go on to further Stages.  Unusually, in my view, IBEC got it right in this regard, and so did the organisations which have come out even stronger against the Bill.  There was a decision made in a court of law.  We had other protections for workers.  Apart from a face-saving measure on behalf of the industrial relations sector, which has been far too strong and big in this country, this is an unnecessary overhead being imposed on the shoulders of the sectors on which we rely for the goal we all share to reduce unemployment in this country.
#JimmyHarte	unknown-#JimmyHarte-party	unknown-#JimmyHarte-dob	unknown-#JimmyHarte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, to the House.  I listened to his speech which was detailed and fairly jaw-dropping.  It explains everything well.The last three paragraphs of his speech encompasses the Bill.  He stated? "The reform of the statutory wage setting machinery operating at sector level and placing the JLC and REA systems on a more secure legal and constitutional footing represents a significant commitment by the Government to protect the lowest paid and most vulnerable workers."  Industrial relations has moved on in the past 20 years with the advent of foreign nationals who have come here to work, generally at the lower end of the employment scale.  Those workers must be protected, as must citizens who work Saturdays and Sundays.Perhaps the debate on Saturday and Sunday working is one we should hold separately.  I have been to France on occasion.  One year, on a Sunday, I went looking for a litre of milk in a town on the south coast of France and it was not available.  All the shops and filling stations were closed.  We were looking for milk only with which to feed the baby, but it ended up that we had to go into a bar to ask for a litre of milk.  For the French, not because of any religious reason or any other reason, Sunday is the day where they do not work generally.The catering and hospitality sectors here are the sectors which are under pressure on Saturdays and Sundays.  In the retail sector, people shop on Saturdays and maybe even Sundays at times because the shops are open, whereas as far as the hospitality and the catering sectors are concerned, people are on their leisure time and go for a meal and a drink at the weekend.  It is necessary that the hospitality and catering sectors are focused on this but it is not in the case of retail.  One can only shop so many days in the week but one eats every day of the week.  The weekends are important for the tourism sector.We have a system where Sunday wages will match what workers expect.  Any Member of the House who, as part of public life, must spend a Sunday at a function knows it is time out of one's leisure.  It is time one's family misses one and one misses one's family.  Many are forced into working on Sundays out of economic necessity or because an employer states that if the person does not work a Sunday, he or she will remember that.  It is a broader debate for another day.  I read a book some years ago called No More Sundays in Belgium, which described how, before the First World War, the Sunday was the Belgian day on which one drank coffee, but that when the war started, Sunday disappeared into Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.  The European model of a Sunday, where we go back to a more basic day of shopping and leisure, has been raised again in these economic times.The Bill is important for someone like me who set up their own business.  Unlike Senator White, I set it up not to provide employment for others but to provide employment for myself and my family.  That is how small businesses function.  One does not set up a business to provide employment for others.  Perhaps Chuck Feeney could do it because he had $10 billion in the bank.  All small businesses are set up to give the person an income.  It is fair enough if one gets to a stage where one has so much money one can set up businesses for philanthropic purposes.I understand the sensitivities of dealing with staff.  Asking staff to work days on which they are not generally expected to work is quite difficult and is something every small business must deal with differently.  There are different sectors, such as retail, hospitality and financial services.  The issue of trading on a Sunday does not arise for a solicitor or an insurance office.  Employers in the hospitality sector have a difficulty.  In the Minister of State's view, to get the unemployed back to work, to achieve competitiveness in the economy and for the economy to grow again, we must deal with setting wages that will be competitive for the employer but also will look after the vulnerable workers who must work on a Saturday night or Sunday morning.The Minister of State said the overall effect of these reforms will be to help reduce the cost burden of record-keeping, which I am aware has got out of hand for small businesses.  I refer to the cost of compliance, form-filling and keeping records.  It is not that proprietors do not want to keep records; it is the duplication of records that is the issue.  When I started my insurance business in the early 1980s, everything was photocopied and kept manually.  With the advent of technology, we were told we would have less paperwork.  Anyone in business will be aware their paperwork has trebled or quadrupled in that time because the compliance offices state one must keep a paper record of every e-mail one sends and every application made.  It has ended up that technology has generated more paperwork than existed previously.  Record-keeping and compliance is still a problem for small companies.  It is an extra cost they sometimes cannot bear.I welcome and commend the Bill.  As someone in small business who talks to those in small businesses all the time, it is welcome legislation that must enhance competitiveness, preserve jobs and create more.
#KathrynReilly	unknown-#KathrynReilly-party	unknown-#KathrynReilly-dob	unknown-#KathrynReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I welcome the Minister of State.  In considering this legislation Senators would do well to examine the reasons the joint labour committee system was introduced in the 1940s.  Employment regulation orders and registered employment agreements remain necessary as they play a vital role in protecting the most basic and essential rights of workers in the regulated sectors, including basic wage levels and conditions relating to overtime, anti-social hours and sick pay entitlements.  The purpose of the JLCs is to provide legal protection for workers in sectors which are prone to exploitation.  Workers in the hospitality and retail trades, for example, tend to be non-unionised and low-paid and are frequently part-time, female or migrant workers.  Without the JLC system, unscrupulous employers could, in the current climate, reduce pay to the bare minimum legal limits.  For the benefit of the House and in case anyone is labouring under any delusions that workers who come within the terms of EROs and REAs are on the pig's back, under the previous dispensation the top rate of pay for workers covered by the retail JLC was €9.66 per hour.  An employee working a 35-hour week on this rate would have an annual income of €17,500.I note that the European Union labour costs survey for 2008 shows that Irish labour costs in the retail sector and in hotels and restaurants were below the European Union average, while the operating costs to labour costs ratio was on a par with the EU average.  According to a National Employment Rights Agency report from last year, more than 7% of employers in the largest three sectors covered by JLC agreements were in breach of their obligations.  It found that 53% of workers in these areas were earning less than the minimum wage, 51% were not in receipt of wage slips, 83% did not receive a contract or terms of employment, 85% were not paid premiums for Sunday work or overtime and many others did not have rest breaks.  These issues affect large swathes of the workforce.  Forfás estimates that between 170,000 and 300,000 people are covered by JLC agreements, while the Irish Congress of Trade Unions puts the figure at 550,000.It should be noted that it was not the Government but Sinn Féin which was first to react to the case taken by the Quick Service Food Alliance that resulted in the current system being struck down as being in part unconstitutional.  The Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, which was introduced by my party many months ago, remains stalled on Committee Stage.  The lack of urgency shown by the Government when we discussed the Bill was disappointing.  Since then, Sinn Féin has worked with the trade unions to ensure watertight legislation is introduced on this issue.  While the Bill before us has many positive attributes, we will not support the negation of the Sunday premium because it will reduce the wages of the working poor.I have some concerns that an agenda other than the protection of workers is at work in this Bill.  Even before the court case on the JLC system was heard, the Minister indicated that he was seeking reform of this area and spoke in stark terms.  His initial proposals included the abolition of half the JLCs, a review of the remaining committees, the drafting of criteria for JLCs, the submission of new EROs for all areas covered by the remaining JLCs, the introduction of provisions enabling amendment of REAs without the consent of both parties, and easier cancellation of REAs.  Thankfully, he stepped back from the position he adopted initially, on which I commend him and all those involved in persuading him to change his mind.Significant problems remain with the Bill.  When it was first published the Minister stated: "I have been determined to strike a balance between protecting vulnerable workers and providing reforms that will make the systems more competitive and more flexible so as to allow the creation of jobs in these sectors."  I highlight a false dichotomy in the Minister's words.  Workers' rights and job creation are not in conflict.  The Government's own review, the Duffy-Walsh report, found no evidence of a connection between employment levels and the protections and pay rates afforded by JLCs.  I ask Senators to bear in mind this important point during the debate.While I do not deny some of the positive aspects of the Bill, it is also something of a Trojan horse to the extent that it seeks to remove Sunday premiums from the lowest-paid workers.  Sinn Féin will not support this provision and will table amendments to it on Committee Stage.

I am pleased to support this common-sense Bill.  Times have changed since I started as a trainee chef in 1974, when I was fortunate to enjoy the protection of a JLC agreement.  At that time, we did not have a minimum wage, whereas nowadays the minimum wage provides a baseline from which to operate.  This is the key to many of the issues arising in this regard.I have listened to some of the points made about employees.  There is also an employer dimension to this debate.  To ensure the domestic economy survives and grows again we must correct some of the anomalies in the system.  I do not disagree with any of the points Senator Barrett made on the industrial relations sector.  A fine club is being developed in that area and it may need to be addressed.Many Irish businesses operate across international borders 24 hours per day, 365 days of the year.  The tourism and hospitality sector operate to similar times.  We must enable companies to grow.  A well known Wexford hotelier who is the patron of a hotel in Shannon to which my company supplies catering services has stated his hotel pays glass collectors €18 per hour on Sundays.  We must call this issue as it is because we are employing young lads to do a bit of handy part-time work and nothing more.I congratulate the Minister and Minister of State.  The nationally agreed social partnership protocols provide a means of resolving any difficulties that may arise.  Differences between the coalition partners are continually raised.  When I go home on Friday or Saturday night, I am often told Fine Gael and the Labour Party are not getting on.  I have been a Senator for 16 months and it appears to me that we are getting on well.  While we have differences, these will be sorted out responsibly.  It is fine if this is done in public but we will get on with our job and do a heck of a lot better than those who were in office for ten or 12 years before us.

Senator Barrett, who has a right-wing agenda, stated social partnership had not worked.  I remind him that everybody, not only workers, got fat during the Celtic tiger.  From 1913 onwards, when Mr. Murphy locked out his workers because they went on strike for a proper rate of pay, workers have always been viewed as being wrong by one side of society.  I presume this view will prevail long after we have gone.The legislation before us protects workers and those who are required to work on Saturday and Sunday.  Senator Barrett argued that every day is the same.  I do not see solicitors, accountants or major banks opening their practices or doors on Sundays.  The lowest-paid workers are employed in the retail and service industries where they are required to work on Sundays as part of their employment contracts.  They should be adequately recompensed for this work.  I thank the Acting Chairman and wish Kilkenny the best for the rest of the year.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14461	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	203	As a Corkman, I am looking forward to the game against Wexford.  No one should pre-empt the outcome of that match.While I accept the points Senators have made, the bottom line is that the Bills introduced by Sinn Féin and the Fianna Fáil Party were not sufficiently comprehensive to address the issues being addressed in this legislation.  They were too weak to provide the robust and comprehensive response required by the High Court ruling.  Provisions are needed that will withstand a future challenge.  That addresses two of the points.I do not believe we should forget the fact that Sinn Féin voted against the reversal of the reduction in the minimum wage when we sought to restore it to €8.65 from €7.65.  While I say this respectfully, I do not think any of us, particularly a Labour Party Minister, will take lectures in regard to the rights of low-paid workers.  I know there was no lecture, but we should give the lie to the impression there is only one party in this House that has concern — a new-found, affected concern — for the rights of low-paid workers.  Sinn Féin is being a little disingenuous in that regard.With regard to Senator Barrett's point, if we roll back the machinery that has existed for a considerable period, I contend we are then in danger of effecting a regressive regime vis-à-vis the relationship between worker and employee.  I believe the State has a role to play in industrial relations.  I take the point that one can have a minimum wage and leave it at that, and the market can determine anything thereafter.  What we have in this country, which Senator Landy has espoused, is a system in which there is a balance between the two sides.  For certain types of work, there is a market and one can command a certain price but, also, the State has a machinery through the Labour Relations Commission to allow for robust protection of workers where they feel they have been maligned in any way.  That is the system that exists, arguably, Europe-wide.  We should be looking towards countries such as Germany in terms of the models that exist.There is a wider philosophical debate in the point made by Senator Barrett.  There was a specific question in regard to the workplace relations Bill, and I can ask the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to speak on that point when he comes to the House on Report Stage.  What we are trying to do here is to respond responsibly to the result of the High Court.  We want to ensure we do not throw the baby out with the bath water, so that we still have a system that ensures the rights of low-paid workers, in which there is redress and recourse for workers where there is a slight or perceived slight.  We also want to ensure there is sufficient flexibility in the system and a statutory code in place to ensure both sides can at least come to the table to hammer out some sort of agreement, and do so through a process of consensus.  There is nothing wrong with this.  I believe it is a sensible solution, which is what we are trying to achieve in the Bill.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I am pleased to introduce the Bill to the House.  Its main objective is to apply the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 to states other than EU member states.  It also makes procedural and technical amendments to the 2003 Act and the Extradition Acts 1965 to 2001, and gives effect to an EU framework decision on the mutual recognition of judgments rendered in the absence of the defendant.Before dealing with the detail of the Bill, I have some general comments on the European Arrest Warrant Act which I would like to share with Senators.  I am keenly aware that this is the third Bill to amend the Act since being passed in 2003.  It is useful to recall the circumstances in which the EU framework decision on surrender, to which the Act gives effect, was negotiated.  While negotiations on a simplified system of surrender between EU member states had been ongoing since 1999, they were given added impetus following the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001.  The terrorist attacks not only highlighted the importance of effective EU measures on internal security, but also put enormous pressure on the European Union to produce substantial legislative action in a very short period of time.  Thus the European arrest warrant framework decision was agreed to with unprecedented speed.  The speed of negotiation and the compromises involved resulted in a somewhat less than perfect final text.In transposing this instrument into Irish law, Ireland, like other member states, was faced with legislating for a totally new concept of an inter-court surrender process.  The Bill was, because of the deadline for entry into force, drafted with some haste and rushed through the Oireachtas.  In these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that practical experience of the operation of the European arrest warrant, combined with court interpretations of the Act, meant that from an early stage the need for amendment became clear.  The Act was amended in 2005 and 2009 and is once again being amended.  I consider this piecemeal approach to be most unsatisfactory.  It is unfair to the courts, legal practitioners, our fellow member states and the subjects of European arrest warrants.  I have already announced that I am initiating a fundamental review of the legislation which will thoroughly examine our European arrest warrant procedures to see how they can be simplified and streamlined.  It is likely that the review will take some time and, in the interim, I am anxious to ensure Ireland is in a position to discharge its international obligations on extradition and surrender.  For that reason, I am proceeding with the Bill to make amendments that cannot await the outcome of the review.The Bill has three main parts.  Part 2 allows the European arrest warrant system to be extended to non-EU member states.  Part 3 makes a series of amendments to the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003.  Part 4 makes a series of amendments to the Extradition Act 1965.  I will now deal with Parts 2, 3 and 4 in turn.Part 2 enables the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, referred to as the European Arrest Warrant Act, to be extended to non-EU countries.  The European Arrest Warrant Act gave effect to the EU framework decision on the European arrest warrant.  It replaced extradition arrangements between EU member states which were, by and large, conducted on a Government to Government basis with a system of surrender based on arrest warrants issued and executed by judicial authorities.  The key element of Part 2 is section 2(1).  It provides that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, following consultation with me as Minister for Justice and Equality, may, by order, apply all or any of the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act to a non-EU country where there is an agreement between the European Union and that country on surrender.  Any extension of the European Arrest Warrant Act to non-EU countries is subject to some important limitations.  Under section 2(3), an order applying the European arrest warrant arrangements to a third country may only be made where there is an EU agreement on surrender in force with that third country.  I emphasise that the agreement must be one for surrender as opposed to extradition.  I have explained that the European arrest warrant replaced extradition arrangements between EU member states with a system of surrender based on arrest warrants issued and executed by judicial authorities of member states.For an order to be made under Part 2, the agreement with the third country must be one for a judicial system of surrender.  I labour this point because, since the Bill was introduced, there has been much ill-informed comment on this provision, within the Oireachtas and beyond, including, I regret to say, by some members of the legal profession.  Members of the House are unlikely to labour under the misapprehensions that have affected others on this provision.  Nonetheless, I stress that this provision does not enable the European arrest warrant to be extended by ministerial order to, for example, the United States.  There is an EU-US agreement on extradition which is very clearly entitled and worded as such and operates on a Government to Government basis.  It is not a surrender agreement and, therefore, does not fulfil the requirement of this section.  Similarly, the European arrest warrant cannot be applied under this provision to Albania, Zimbabwe or Thailand — to mention but a few of the countries it has been, somewhat fancifully and completely inaccurately, suggested might qualify.A surrender agreement requires a high degree of mutual trust between the European Union and the country concerned.  There is only one agreement that falls within this provision — the 2006 agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Iceland and the Kingdom of Norway on surrender procedures.  Ireland will be in a position to give effect to the agreement when the Bill is enacted.  The terms of the agreement are almost identical to those of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant.  Rather than repeat these provisions in detail in a separate statute, I have opted for the approach of enabling the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act to be extended by order to third countries.  One advantage of this approach is that the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act are familiar to the courts and practitioners and have been clarified in numerous judgments during the years.  Also, I understand agreements similar to the Norway and Iceland agreement are likely to be concluded by the European Union with other countries in the future.The current approach will allow the terms of the European Arrest Warrant Act to be applied to such countries in the future without further primary legislation.A further limitation on the operation of this Part is that, under section 2(4), an order applying the European Arrest Warrant Act to a third country must reflect the terms of the agreement to which it gives effect.  Part 3 contains a number of amendments to the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003.  Since the European arrest warrant system came into force in 2004, the number of European arrest warrants received in and issued by Ireland has increased year on year.  I laid the annual report on the operation of the European arrest warrant for 2011 before the Houses recently.  It shows that Ireland issued 71 warrants in 2011, up from 51 in 2010, and 36 persons were surrendered to Ireland during the year, up from 26 the previous year.  Of these, 31 were surrendered by the UK, with the balance being surrendered by five other member states.It also shows that Ireland received 384 warrants in 2011, up from 373 in 2010, and that 177 persons were surrendered to other member states in 2011, up from 161 in 2010.  Of those surrendered, 113 were sent to Poland and 19 were sent to the UK, the balance being sent to 13 other member states.  The offences cited in the warrants included murder, sexual offences, drugs offences, trafficking, assault, robbery and fraud.As the volume of warrants increases, officials and practitioners gain greater practical experience of the operation of the European arrest warrant system.  Also, the courts have had the opportunity to provide important interpretations of the law in their judgments.  My Department monitors these developments continually and, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, identifies where amendments to the Act could be made to improve the operation of the European arrest warrant.The amendments in this Part arise from that process.  Many of the amendments are of a purely technical or linguistic nature and, rather than detailing all the changes, I will comment on the more substantive provisions.Section 5 deletes a reference to the EU framework decision from the Act, the reason being to clarify that the framework decision does not have direct effect in Irish law.  There are similar deletions in sections 9, 10, 15 and 16.Section 6 amends the form of the European arrest warrant as part of the transposition into Irish law of the 2009 EU framework decision on judgments in absentia.  The framework decision requires that, where the requested person was not present at his or her trial, the European arrest warrant must contain certain information concerning the proceedings.  The amendment provides for this.Sections 9 and 10 contain the most important changes made by this Bill to the European Arrest Warrant Act.  These sections amend sections 15 and 16, respectively, of the Act.  These sections are the heart of the Act and are critical to the operation of the surrender procedure.  They set out the procedure the High Court is to follow in ordering the surrender of a requested person.  Section 15 applies to cases where the requested person consents to surrender on foot of the European arrest warrant, and section 16 applies where the person has contested the European arrest warrant.  The main purpose of the amendments is to provide a procedure which ensures at all stages in the surrender process the requested person is subject to the supervision of the High Court.Within the new section 15, subsection (3) allows for the fast-track surrender, with the consent of the person sought, where this fast-tracking does not create operational difficulties.  Under this subsection, the central authority, which deals with the administrative and logistical aspects of surrender, may request the court to order that an order for surrender take effect at a date earlier than normal where the requested person consents.  The authority will only make such an application where it is satisfied that surrender can be carried out by the earlier date.  This replaces an existing provision which allowed the person sought to request that the order for surrender take effect earlier than the ten day period specified.  This had created operational difficulties in meeting the time limits specified for the carrying out of the surrender order.The amended section 15(4)(c) will, I believe, bring greater clarity to the position of a person who is placed in custody on foot of an order for surrender.  It provides that where the court orders the surrender of a person, it must also order that the person be detained for a period not exceeding 20 days, by the end of which period the person must normally be surrendered.  The current text merely provides that the person be committed to prison pending the carrying out of the order.  The amended section 15(4)(d) is important.  It provides that if a person is not surrendered by the end of the 20 day period I have just mentioned, the person must be brought before the High Court again as soon as practicable after the deadline passes.  Alternatively, if it appears to the central authority that it will not be possible to surrender the person by the deadline, the person must be brought before the High Court before the deadline expires.The amended section 15(5) sets out the powers of the court in dealing with a person brought before it under the previous subsection.  If the court is satisfied the person was not, or will not be, surrendered by the deadline due to circumstances beyond the control of Ireland or the issuing state, the court will, with the agreement of the issuing judicial authority, fix a new surrender date and order the detention of the person for up to ten days after the new date.  The new provision will bring the Act closer to the relevant provisions of the framework decision.A new section 15(5A) is inserted which provides that if the person is not surrendered within ten days of the new date fixed, he or she must be discharged.  The new section 15(5B) provides that where the period for surrender has expired and the person has not been surrendered, the person will be deemed to be in lawful custody from the expiry of the period up to the appearance before the court.  There will, therefore, be no period in the process in which the person's detention will be other than lawful.Section 15(7) is new, and it clarifies that it is within the jurisdiction of the High Court to grant bail to a person where an appeal has been lodged to the Supreme Court against an order for surrender.  This had been the subject of some doubt and I think it is best to bring legal certainty to the matter.Section 10 makes a number of amendments to section 16 of the 2003 Act.  This section deals with procedures where the person has contested the European arrest warrant.  Most of the amended provisions are identical to those in the amended section 15 and I do not propose to take up the time of the House by repeating my comments on the previous section which apply equally to this section.Sections 11 to 24, inclusive, make a range of changes to the 2003 Act, some which are technical in nature or consequential on changes referred to earlier.  I will confine my comments to the more important changes.Section 11 substitutes the text of section 18 of the European Arrest Warrant Act, which sets out the circumstances and procedure whereby the High Court may postpone the surrender of a person on humanitarian grounds or where the person is being prosecuted for an offence here or is serving a sentence in the State.  In the substituted text these grounds are unchanged.  However, the new text provides that, where the court has ordered postponement, it shall subsequently make an order ending the postponement when, in effect, it is satisfied the grounds on which it was ordered no longer exist.  When postponement ends, the provisions of sections 15 or 16, as appropriate, will apply.  Thus, from the making of the order ending postponement, the person is treated as if their surrender had been ordered on the date that postponement ended.  I believe this is a simpler procedure than the present system.  Most important, it ensures there is judicial supervision of the requested person at all stages of the process which I have highlighted as a key feature of my reform of the surrender process generally.Section 18 substitutes the text of section 30 of the European Arrest Warrant Act, which deals with cases where both an extradition request and a European arrest warrant are received in respect of a person.  The substituted text sets out more clearly my role, as Minister, and that of the High Court, as executing judicial authority for the purposes of the European arrest warrant, in cases where both a European arrest warrant and an extradition request are received for a person.  The text more accurately reflects the provisions of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant relating to such situations.Section 19 amends section 33 of the European Arrest Warrant Act which deals with the issue of European arrest warrants by an Irish court.  It simplifies the procedure considerably.  The current provisions require that the court be satisfied the person in respect of whom a warrant is sought is not in the State.  In practice, this can be difficult to state with absolute certainty and thus the revised provision omits this requirement.  As applications for a European arrest warrant can only be made by, or on behalf of, the Director of Public Prosecutions, I believe the DPP should be in a position to request the issue of a European arrest warrant subject only to there being a domestic warrant in existence.Section 22 amends section 42(b) of the European Arrest Warrant Act which deals with the position where there are proceedings in the State against a requested person.  It is a linguistic change recommended to me by the Attorney General in the light of judicial comments on the current wording.  The section now provides that a person shall not be surrendered if “proceedings are pending” against the person in the State rather than “proceedings have been brought”.  I believe the substituted language is more accurate and precise.Section 23 amends section 45 of the European Arrest Warrant Act, which sets out the grounds on which the State may refuse surrender if the person to whom the European arrest warrant refers was not present at the trial which led to the sentence being imposed.  Again, the amendment is part of the transposition of the European arrest warrant decision on judgments  in absentia to which I have referred.  The new text provides that in an in absentia case a person will not be surrendered unless the European arrest warrant states the matters set out in the European arrest warrant form as amended by the framework decision.  To be absolutely clear as to what is required, the substituted text sets out that part of the European arrest warrant form as a table to the section.Section 24 substitutes the text of section 45C of the 2003 Act which provides that surrender shall not be refused on the grounds of a technical flaw in an application provided this would not cause an injustice to the requested person.  In the substituted text I am further strengthening the protection for the requested person where the provision is applied.  The revised text of subsection (b) now provides that where there is a variance between any document grounding an application, and the evidence adduced on the part of the applicant at the hearing of the application, the court cannot apply the provision unless it is satisfied that such variance is explained by the evidence.I now turn to Part 4 which amends the Extradition Act 1965.  The Act provides the statutory basis for our extradition arrangements with countries other than member states of the European Union.  As with the amendments to the European Arrest Warrant Act, these arise from operational experience and court interpretations.  The most important changes are in section 27, which substitutes sections 15 to 17, inclusive, of the 1965 Act.  The existing section 15, which prohibits extradition where the offence is regarded as having been committed in the State, is not being re-enacted.  I believe the transnational nature of crime nowadays means that a provision such as this is no longer appropriate.  The revised text of section 15 clarifies the position regarding extradition where there are proceedings in contemplation or pending in the State for the same offence as that for which extradition is sought.  The revised text of section 16 deals with persons who are convicted in their absence.  I believe it is appropriate that we should have such a provision in our legislation.  The revised text of section 17 clarifies the position on the refusal of extradition where the principle of ne bis in idem, or double jeopardy as it is commonly referred to, applies.  It provides that the question of whether a judgment is final is to be determined by the law of the state where the judgment was handed down.The other changes in Part 4 are mainly procedural or technical, including changes that should lead to more efficient handling of extradition applications.  Section 26, for example, repeals a provision in the 1965 Act on evidence by affidavit and will thus address difficulties in practice in dealing with states whose legal systems do not embrace the concept of affidavits.  A further change with a focus on efficiency is section 28, which deals with the documents to support a request for extradition.  It provides that a reproduction or copy of the relevant documents will suffice and allows for the inclusion of identification material with a request for extradition, where it is available.  In similar vein, section 33 extends the range of documents that can be received in evidence without further proof to include any evidence in writing received from a requesting country.  It also enables documents to be authenticated by being signed or sealed by the appropriate authority.Section 30 inserts a new provision in the 1965 Act which provides the High Court with a general power to adjourn proceedings under the Act and to remand the person sought in custody or on bail in the course of such proceedings.  Section 31 inserts a new provision in section 29 of the Extradition Act which provides that a court may make an order for extradition even if there is a technical flaw in an application provided this would not cause an injustice to the requested person.  This mirrors a provision in similar terms in the European Arrest Warrant Act.Section 32 inserts a new section 36A in the 1965 Act which deals with identification material.  It authorises the Garda Síochána to fingerprint, palm print or photograph persons arrested under the Act for the sole purpose of verifying the person's identity.  Identification material of this type is often sent with extradition requests, and up to now the Garda Síochána had no power to take similar identification material for comparison purposes.  The new section sets out the procedure for taking the identification material, including the use of reasonable force where necessary and authorised.Before I conclude, I would like to say something about the Tobin case which was recently decided by the Supreme Court.  As the House will be aware, the tragic case related to the death of two young children aged just two and five years in Hungary.  It was an appalling case and I know that all Members will feel great sympathy for the children's parents who have suffered such immeasurable loss.I will address the practicalities of the case.  Ultimately, decisions in relation to surrender under the European arrest warrant system are a matter for the courts.  This particular case has been before the Supreme Court twice.  The Hungarian authorities issued a European arrest warrant in respect of Mr. Tobin in 2005.  Surrender was refused in the High Court on the basis that Mr. Tobin had not fled the jurisdiction which was a requirement of the Act at that time.  The State appealed the decision to the Supreme Court which affirmed the High Court decision.As a consequence of the Supreme Court decision, the legislation was amended to remove the fled requirement in respect of persons sought to serve a sentence in the issuing state.  The fled requirement was removed on legal advice as it was an elaboration in Irish law that was not mandated by the framework decision on the European arrest warrant.  Once the Act was amended, it was open to the Hungarian authorities to issue another European arrest warrant in respect of Mr. Tobin.  The High Court ordered the surrender of Mr. Tobin to Hungary based on the new warrant, but this was appealed to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court reversed the findings of the High Court and refused to surrender Mr. Tobin, holding that to do so, following the previous proceedings in which he was successful, would amount to an abuse of process and that, under the Interpretation Act 2005, which limits the retrospective application of amended legislation, the amendment to the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 did not apply to Mr. Tobin.  The House will appreciate that in those circumstances, no further action is open to me in relation to securing the surrender of the person concerned.In recent days the Hungarian Minister for Justice has written to me reiterating his concerns, and there has been some contact with the European Commission about the matter.  There will be ongoing contacts in this regard but I would be doing a disservice to a family which has suffered so much if I were to hold out any hope that their wishes can be met.  I greatly regret there is no further appropriate action that can be taken under Irish law.That concludes my narrative on the Bill and I commend it to the House.  I appreciate the Bill and its contents are matters of some complexity, particularly in the context of the trilogy of legislation that exists in this area.  I hope Members of the House will support the principles behind the Bill and I look forward to hearing what they have to say.

I shall not say a lot about the legislation.The Minister referred, in his concluding remarks, to the tragic Tobin case which has some important legal and jurisprudential implications as far as this country is concerned.  I ask the Minister, perhaps not in his response today but at the next Stage, to consider the implications, if any, of the legislation for the extradition warrant applied for in the case of the unfortunate and unsolved murder in west Cork of Ms Sophie Toscan du Plantier.  The High Court envisaged the extradition of Mr. Bailey but it was reversed in the Supreme Court.  I am not quite sure how it fits into this legislation or if the case has implications for it.  If there are implications or concerns, perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to address them at some stage during the passage of the Bill.  I know extradition is a complex area of legislation and of law.  On behalf of the Fianna Fáil group in the Seanad, I support the legislation and wish it a speedy passage.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I welcome the Minister to the House.  He is becoming the most frequent ministerial visitor and is bringing forward a substantial amount of legislation.  I expected a ten to 15 minute contribution from Senator Denis O'Donovan and would have had time to pause, think and, perhaps, write but I have been left in the lurch by the Senator.The Minister concluded his contribution with a reference to the Tobin case.  I appreciate the sensitivity of the case and that it is on the road from a legal perspective.  If the case was in reverse and we were seeking to pursue a case about a Hungarian citizen in Dublin we would be disappointed if no further action was necessary.  While we must respect the decision of the Supreme Court it would be appropriate to extend our sympathy to the family in Hungary.The Minister has provided a thorough trawl of the intricacies of the various pieces of legislation.  Perhaps his most interesting comment, arising from his general unhappiness with the complexities and workings of the European arrest warrant system, is that he will bring forward a more substantial Bill and in a sense the Bill is an interim measure.  Presumably, in this term of government we will hear his more substantial response.  We are dealing with important legislation.  We must recognise, in so far as the Minister and the House are concerned, this is a work in progress and not the finished work.Any legislation dealing with extradition can be emotive.  The issue has always been emotive in this and the other House.  It is also complicated and detailed.  In his contribution the Minister mentioned the rush to action which occurred after 11 September 2001.  That is not only in respect of extradition law but societies and governments all over the western world were pressed into action and various laws, judicial and financial, were put in place as part of what became known as the war on terrorism.  Much of it was necessary but some of it may have been over the top.  A decade later we must begin to examine some of the legislation which, of necessity, was introduced in haste and rushed legislation is not always perfect.European arrest warrants have served their purpose.  We are debating the legislation with its European flavour while simultaneously other Ministers are liaising with the EU in respect of financial and banking matters. With the broader coming together of the EU as a political entity there is also the judicial side.   Obviously the final version of the legislation will show where we stand in our relationship from a judicial point of view with our fellow EU governments and the additional opportunities which the Bill offers.In examining extradition cases, we must ensure citizens are treated fairly and in a transparent fashion, that there is significant evidence and no rush to judgment.  On the other side of the equation, notwithstanding that September 2001 is more than a decade ago, we must recognise that with each passing year and decade, new and more vicious forms of criminality, terrorism and threats not only to citizens but to states are occurring and there must be a robust response.  The European arrest warrant is part of the necessary response and we must be supportive of it.  In that regard, the Minister has given an indication that he has issues with the legislation put in place ten years ago and will reflect on it and present a more comprehensive Bill.  I support the Minister's intention to progress the issue and to move on.  I am sure it will be the majority view of the House that the legislation be approved.
#JillianVanTurnhout	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-party	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-dob	unknown-#JillianVanTurnhout-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I welcome the Minister.The purpose of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant is to create a common area of security, freedom and justice within the European Union.  One of the corollaries of the free movement of persons within the EU is that there should also be free movement of judicial decisions whether they are in the form of sentences, convictions or decisions to institute criminal proceedings.  It is important to avoid the creation of places within the EU where there is a perception that the country in question is a safe haven for fugitives from justice.  I recognise that by enabling the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 to apply to states other than EU member states, we are reducing to some extent the chance of that happening.  I also recognise that there are a number of criticisms and shortcomings around the legislative framework governing the European arrest warrant procedure.  I welcome the Minister's acknowledgment in his opening remarks that the piecemeal approach to amending the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 is unsatisfactory and I further welcome his commitment to initiate a fundamental review of the legislation and to thoroughly examine European arrest warrant procedures to determine how they can be streamlined and simplified.I have received a lengthy submission in respect of the extraterritorial exception under section 44 of the 2003 Act.  A concern has been raised about the manner in which section 44 is drafted — this may be what Senator O'Donovan mentioned — and its application to future cases, particularly in light of the recent Supreme Court decision in the Minister for Justice Equality and Law Reform v. Bailey, which was delivered on 1 March 2012.  I do not purport to make any comment on the rightness or wrongness of the decision in the Bailey case nor do I purport to be an expert in international extradition law.However, I am interested to explore the contention made in the submission that the very strict interpretation of extraterritoriality, based on the principle of reciprocity, whereby it is not open to the State to surrender a person for an extraterritorial offence unless the offence can also be prosecuted in Ireland on an extraterritorial basis, gives rise to the possibility of Ireland being a safe haven from prosecution or sentence in certain circumstances.  I intend to give the submission further consideration in advance of Committee Stage and I considered it appropriate to mention it today.  I will provide the Minister with a copy of the proposed amendment for his consideration because I trust his wisdom to ensure the Bill will strike the appropriate and right balance.  This is my only concern.
#IvanaBacik	unknown-#IvanaBacik-party	unknown-#IvanaBacik-dob	unknown-#IvanaBacik-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I welcome the Minister and as Senator Bradford said he is a regular visitor.  I also welcome the Bill.  The only note of non-welcome is that the Bill commenced in the Dáil rather than in this House.  It is much appreciated that the Minister has commenced many justice Bills in this House and we hope he will continue to do that.Like Senator van Turnhout, I appreciate the Minister's comments on the piecemeal nature of legislation in the area of extradition and European arrest warrant procedures.  It is a matter of concern that already there have been Bills on this issue.   In that regard, I very much welcome the Minister's indication that a comprehensive legislative review is ongoing.  I understand he was asked in the Dáil about a timeframe for that review.  Is he in a position today to indicate when it is likely to be produced?  I accept his point that he did not wish to await its completion before bringing forward this Bill.The Minister has acknowledged criticism by interested parties, including lawyers, of certain provisions in the Bill.  It is important to note that those critiques come out of a genuine concern to ensure the legislation includes adequate safeguards.  This is particularly important given that the extension of the 2003 Act on foot of this Bill will be done by ministerial order rather than primary legislation.  However, as the Minister observed, there is High Court supervision throughout the process and section 37 of the 2003 Act is not amended by the Bill.I appreciate the Minister's reassurance as to the countries to which the 2003 Act will not be applicable, including Thailand and Zimbabwe.  Will he indicate which countries are likely to be included?  It is envisaged that similar agreements to that in place with Norway and Iceland are likely to be concluded by the European Union.  I am conscious here of the important proviso that the European arrest warrant procedures will apply only to those countries where an agreement has been made with the Union.  I understand that the Bill, once it comes into force, will apply only in respect of Iceland and Norway at this stage.  In other words, it will initially allow for surrender procedures to take place only between EU states and Iceland or Norway.I am also grateful for the Minister's clarification regarding the Tobin judgment, which, as he observed, is a deeply tragic case.  We all feel great sympathy for the parents in Hungary who lost their two small children.  It is an unbearable thought.  However, the decision on 19 June 2012 was the second Supreme Court judgment in the case and it seems there is no further legal process available in this matter.Like Senator Jillian van Turnhout, I wish to address the other recent decision in this area, namely, the Bailey decision by the Supreme Court on 1 March 2012.  Was any consideration given to addressing aspects of that judgment in this Bill?  Senator van Turnhout and I have copies of a submission which very usefully points to certain aspects of the judgment which might well be addressed by amending legislation, whether in this Bill or in the comprehensive review to which the Minister referred.  On foot of the Bailey decision, the principle of reciprocity was found to preclude surrender where the executing state was in a position to or would have been in a position to arrest and prosecute for the offence but on a different jurisdictional basis.  The reference to "different jurisdictional basis" was set out in the judgment as being, under Irish law, the existence of extraterritorial jurisdiction to prosecute an Irish citizen who commits a murder abroad.  In contrast, French law was found to allow for the prosecution of a person who murdered an Irish citizen abroad.  That difference essentially led to the outcome of the case.The critique of the judgment suggests that the principle of reciprocity should have been bypassed on foot of the EU framework decision.  It is not expressly included in the 2003 Act despite having heretofore been a general principle of diplomatic relations.  Has the Supreme Court decision in the Bailey case effectively brought us back to a reciprocity position and, if so, should we now legislate to deal with the outcome?  I accept this may not be the appropriate Bill in which to deal with that question, particularly as it is concerned with a much narrower issue.  Will the Minister indicate whether it will be dealt with in more detail in the comprehensive review?On the concept of the European arrest warrant more generally, we have had some very useful academic commentary on developments at EU level in criminal law.  Professor Dermot Walsh, for example, has spoken about the origins and development of a European criminal process and the movement towards a more transnational approach to criminal processes.  Much of this is to be welcomed given the transnational nature of criminality.  As the Minister observed, it is very important that we recognise that just as people are seeking surrender from Ireland, we are equally seeking surrender to Ireland in order to pursue criminal proceedings in this State.  There is a mutuality within the European arrest warrant procedure that is sometimes overlooked by its critics.  Nevertheless, as Professor Walsh and others have set out, there always must be a concern to ensure adequate safeguards are in place where there is a move towards transnational criminal processes and transnational criminal jurisdiction.  We must all remain conscious of that in debating legislation dealing with European-level arrest warrant procedures or procedures more generally.  The developments in regard to Europol and Eurojust, for instance, demonstrate the huge changes in recent years at European level in what was always seen in the past as very much a domestic matter of jurisdiction.  I welcome the developments at transnational level.  They are inevitable given the increasingly transnational nature of crime, but we must always ensure there are adequate safeguards in place.I welcome the Bill and look forward to supporting it through the House.
#TrevorOClochartaigh	unknown-#TrevorOClochartaigh-party	unknown-#TrevorOClochartaigh-dob	unknown-#TrevorOClochartaigh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	210	Cuirim céad fáilte roimh an Aire.  Maraon le daoine eile, ba cheart dom é a mholadh as chomh flaithiúil is atá sé lena chuid ama ag teacht go dtí an Teach.  B'fhéidir go gcuirfeadh sé focal isteach i gcluas an Taoisigh agus an bealach anall a thaispeáint dó ceann des na laethanta.The purpose of this legislation, as I understand it, is to extend the provisions of the European Arrest Warrant Act 2003 to states other than designated EU member states.  While the Minister claims this is a mere technical provision, he is aware of our concerns regarding the 2003 Act.  Put simply, our position is that while that legislation is necessary, the safeguards in place in terms of human rights and the right to due process are not adequate.  Therefore, in the absence of reform of the arrest warrant legislation generally, we cannot support this Bill.We are far from alone in having such concerns, with reservations also being expressed by the Human Rights Commission, which provided a submission on the original legislation; Fair Trials International; the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights; and by Irish MEPs at a recent plenary session of the European Parliament on the subject.  The cause of concern in all cases is the view that the original Act diminished some of the protections for individuals regarding extradition or surrender and, in some cases, could violate their human rights.  As the Human Rights Commission has noted, the EU framework decision which gave rise to the European arrest warrant was based on a flawed presumption of effective and equivalent protections of accused persons' rights between EU member states.  For the system to be effective, we must place full trust in the standards and procedures of other EU states and, if this Bill is passed, in third-party states.We are in favour of working with other states.  As things stand, however, the European arrest warrant system is neither robust enough nor human rights centred.  It is worth noting the comments of Mr. Thomas Hammarberg, the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, when he discussed the application of European arrest warrants last year. He stated:There has, however, been repeated criticism of the manner in which the EAW has functioned in a number of concrete cases.  This criticism must be taken seriously.  Human rights organisations have expressed concerns about the imprisonment of innocent persons, disproportionate arrests, violations of procedural rights and the impossibility in some countries for an innocent person to appeal against a decision to be surrendered . . .The EAW has been used in some cases for which it was not intended, sometimes with harsh consequences on the lives of the person concerned.  It is thus high time to reform a system that affects thousands of persons every year.I entirely concur with his assessment, particularly when one considers that some 50,000 arrest warrants have been issued.Closer to home, and more recently, we had observations on this issue by one of our most senior judges, Mr. Justice Hardiman.  In the case of the Minister for Justice and Equality v. Tobin, which judgment was delivered on 19 June, Mr. Justice Hardiman noted that the origins of the European arrest warrant are a long way from what we now have.  He stated:This confusion is not surprising because when the European Arrest Warrant "Framework Document" was first drawn up in 2001 it related exclusively to Terrorist offences.  It was subsequently, in the ten day period immediately after the 9/11 outrage in New York, extended to a great number of other offences many of which are not offences of specific intent at all.  Again, I do not think that this aspect of the European Arrest Warrant arrangements are widely known, or were widely or clearly explained at the time.I would also note his comments on the application of the European arrest warrant in Irish courts generally.  Of the authorities, he said:I cannot acquit them of a desire to be seen to be almost slavish in conforming with the obligations of a subscriber to the Framework Document, and a member of the European Union, as they conceive them to be.  It is this attitude, it appears to me, that has rendered them willing to extradite or deliver Irish people, or people who happen to be in Ireland, to other countries who would not deliver their own citizens if the positions were reversed.  It has also rendered them gravely insensitive to the human rights of a person in the position of Mr. Tobin and his family.I believe this should give us pause before we contemplate extending this legislation.  The reforms that are needed are clear.  We need to allow states to refuse a surrender when it is felt that the fundamental rights of the individual are not guaranteed.  The surrender of a person subject to a European arrest warrant can be deferred until the state seeking extradition is trial-ready.  Lengthy periods of pre-trial detention are not satisfactory.  The misuse of European arrest warrants for minor offences needs to be curbed and there must be a proportionality test for assessing the warrants to prevent the possibility of an infringement of the human rights of the individual being sought.  Proportionality is rightly recognised as a fundamental principle of EU law and it must be applied to the European arrest warrant system.As I stated at the outset, a system such as this is needed to provide for extradition or surrender from one country to another, particularly with regard to serious crime.  However, such a system must be robust and human-rights compliant.  In the absence of such safeguards for the European arrest warrant, we cannot possibly support the extension of the 2003 Act.
#ColmBurke	unknown-#ColmBurke-party	unknown-#ColmBurke-dob	unknown-#ColmBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	211	I welcome the Minister to the House.  I also welcome this legislation because it is important that we provide support to the system, not only in our own jurisdiction but in other jurisdictions where offences have been committed and where there is clear evidence of same.  The Minister gave a very comprehensive overview of the Bill this evening.  We received 284 warrant requests last year and sought 71 warrants ourselves.  At a time when people can travel so freely, it is important that where someone has committed an offence, procedures are in place to ensure that he or she cannot escape by crossing the border into another country, particularly as borders have virtually been abolished within the European Union.  One can now travel from the Dingle Peninsula to the border with Russia without any restrictions.  Therefore, if we have that freedom, there must also be checks and balances to ensure co-operation among member states, which is what this legislation is about.  The legislation provides those checks and balances and ensures that proper procedures are followed by the country seeking the transfer of an individual as well as the country that is asked to execute the warrant and see that the individual is brought to account for any offence he or she may have committed.While the High Court has primary responsibility for dealing with European arrest warrant cases, there is a right of appeal to the Supreme Court.  This concerns me, given the volume of work that is required in these cases.  The Court of Criminal Appeal deals with criminal appeals but the Supreme Court currently deals with appeals in civil, commercial and family law cases.  The volume of appeals going to the Supreme Court is already enormous.  Under the legislation before us, the Supreme Court is the ultimate court of appeal in these matters.  This issue must be dealt with.  Recently, a colleague told me about a person who was waiting quite a while for a family law matter to come up for hearing in the Supreme Court.  The court eventually dealt with the matter but reserved judgment on costs, and 12 months later, the issue of costs has still not been decided.  This gives us an idea of the extent of the delays.  It is not that the Supreme Court wants to avoid dealing with the matter but rather that it has not done so because of the volume of work it is dealing with. The Minister made reference in his speech to the number of European arrest warrant cases being dealt with at present and it is clear that quite a number of such cases will end up before the Supreme Court, which is a cause for concern.  However, on a general level, I believe the legislation is the correct way forward.The Minister stated that this is just one step in the process of bringing forward more comprehensive legislation.  This legislation is important in assisting us when we seek co-operation from other countries in bringing people to trial for offences committed here and also when other countries seek our assistance.  The Minister has incorporated the necessary checks and balances into the Bill.I disagree with the last speaker, as we have seen clear evidence that where our courts are not satisfied that all proper procedures have been followed, they will not issue the appropriate order.  The Minister referred to a case in which amending legislation was enacted but the court decided it would not follow through because the matter had already been dealt with.  All of the necessary checks and balances are in this legislation and it is correct that we go forward with it.  However, we must deal with the issue of European arrest warrant appeals from the High Court to the Supreme Court to determine whether they can be dealt with in a different manner from other appeals.  I note that the current Chief Justice has raised the possibility of establishing a court of appeal before cases are sent to the Supreme Court so that only matters of real importance end up in the highest court.  I am not sure whether that could be done in this case.  It probably cannot, but the issue must be examined because of the volume of work the Supreme Court is required to do.  I ask that this matter be taken into account in the drafting of legislation in future.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate and thank those in particular who are supportive of the Bill.  I will come shortly to Senator Ó Clochartaigh's contribution, as he is the only member of the Seanad who is opposed to this measure.  Senators raised a number of issues which I will address in no particular order.  Mention was made of the Tobin case, to which I made reference in my speech.  This case was a great tragedy for the family concerned in Hungary.  I can absolutely understand how they are very distressed at the manner in which matters turned out within this jurisdiction.  There are no words of consolation or sympathy that can be expressed that could relieve the pain and heartache they have experienced as a consequence of what happened.  Tragically and sadly, nothing further can be done within this State to address the matter.  As I said in my speech, I am happy to engage with my colleague, the Hungarian Minister of Administration and Justice, in any discussions he wishes to have with me, but we operate under the rule of law and under a constitutional system in which our courts make final decisions in these areas.  It is my judgment and understanding that now that the matter has been dealt with in the Supreme Court it cannot be reopened.  However, I very much share and understand the concerns and the pain that must be felt by the family who were so tragically and appallingly bereaved.The issue of the Bailey case — or the du Plantier case, as it was also referred to — was also raised.  A number of issues arise out of the Supreme Court judgment in that case.  This legislation was at an advanced stage when the more recent judgment was delivered.  The implications of that judgment on the European arrest warrant legislation will be considered in the context of the overall review that is being conducted.  It is urgent that this legislation be enacted in its current form so that we can meet our international obligations.  I was anxious to ensure, as far as possible, that the legislation be enacted before the summer recess.  More complex issues arise out of that case in respect of which consideration is required.  We will return to those issues when we have completed our deliberations on the review.Senator van Turnhout provided me with an analysis of some aspects of the legislation.  I have engaged in a preliminary examination of that and, again, some of the matters to which it refers relate to the review.  I will certainly examine her analysis further prior to Committee Stage.There is an ultimate issue of concern here which most Senators understand.  It is clear, however, that it is beyond Senator Ó Clochartaigh's comprehension.  The essence of that issue is that those who engage in criminality can travel freely from one part of Europe to another and from one side of the world to the other.  It is very important that the State should ensure those who commit criminal offences in this country and then flee to other jurisdictions should be capable of being returned here and brought before the courts.  Freedom of movement is guaranteed within the European Union but there is a co-operative architecture in place among member states which ensures those who flee from one jurisdiction to another to avoid criminal prosecution can — through a proper system — be surrendered and returned to the jurisdictions from which they came.I listened to the contribution of Senator Ó Clochartaigh and to those of his colleagues in the Dáil.  It appears Sinn Féin believes the legislation to purely be about our surrendering individuals who have committed crimes in other states.  Some very serious crimes have been committed in this State.  Without this legislation working properly, those who engage in serious crime would not be brought to justice.  In circumstances where we expect our European Union colleagues to return to this jurisdiction those individuals who have engaged in criminality here and then fled abroad, we must reciprocate and return to their jurisdictions people who have engaged in criminality there.I wish to revert to my speech to note the fact that the offences cited in warrants issued under the existing legislation included "murder, sexual offences, drugs offences, trafficking, assault, robbery and fraud".  It is not possible to state that one is in favour of ensuring those who engage in criminality are brought to justice while also claiming that one is opposed to them being surrendered and returned to this State from another European Union member state or vice versa.  The approach in that regard seems to be that we will have a little bit of law and order but not too much.  Based on Sinn Féin’s philosophy, safe havens would be created in every other European Union member state for individuals who engage in criminality in this country.  In essence, this would facilitate such people in avoiding being brought to justice.  It is time Sinn Féin got its act together, moved away from ideological and anachronistic perceptions and understood the reality that exists.In the context of Sinn Féin's historical past, there has always been visceral dislike of anything to do with surrender or, to use the phrase which used to apply in all of these areas, extradition.  Sinn Féin sees what is proposed here as a threatening concept.  However, it does not relate to threatening anybody.  Rather, it is about protecting the victims of crime, bringing to justice those who engage in serious criminality and doing this on the basis of partnership and co-operation — under the rule of law — with supervision by our courts in a European Union context.Sinn Féin cannot have it both ways.  Its representatives cannot stand up in this House or the Lower House and shout about giving the Garda more resources and getting the criminals off our streets and then on other occasions state that the latter should be allowed to run free around Europe and should not be surrendered and returned to this jurisdiction.

It states:(1) A person shall not be surrendered under this Act if—(a) his or her surrender would be incompatible with the State’s obligations under—(i) the Convention [namely, the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms], or(ii) the Protocols to the Convention,(b) his or her surrender would constitute a contravention of any provision of the Constitution (other than for the reason that the offence specified in the European arrest warrant is an offence to which section 38(1)(b) applies) [this is a technical issue on which I will not comment],(c) there are reasonable grounds for believing that—(i) the European arrest warrant was issued in respect of the person for the purposes of facilitating his or her prosecution or punishment in the issuing state for reasons connected with his or her sex, race, religion, ethnic origin, nationality, language, political opinion or sexual orientation, or(ii) in the prosecution or punishment of the person in the issuing state, he or she will be treated less favourably than a person who—(I) is not of his or her sex, race, religion, nationality or ethnic origin,(II) does not hold the same political opinions as him or her,(III) speaks a different language than he or she does, or(IV) does not have the same sexual orientation as he or she does,or(iii) were the person to be surrendered to the issuing state—(I) he or she would be sentenced to death, or a death sentence imposed on him or her would be carried out, or(II) he or she would be tortured or subjected to other inhuman or degrading treatment.There is, therefore, an express provision in the 2003 Act of which the Senator appears to have absolutely no knowledge.  In the context of the case he cited — the Tobin case — and the very tragic consequences for a family in Hungary following the death of their two children, it was the oversight of our courts which resulted in the individual concerned not being surrendered to the Hungarian authorities.  Whatever one's view of that matter, it confirms the importance of court oversight based on constitutional provisions, the rule of law and human rights.  Effectively, the section of the 2003 Act to which I refer clearly sets out where matters stand.Senator Bacik raised the very interesting question of the other countries with which the European Union may conclude agreements and to which, consequently, the European arrest warrant may apply in the way it already applies to Norway and Iceland.  As I understand it, discussions are taking place on this matter at European level.  The countries to which it may very well be extended include Andorra, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.  It is not possible to be conclusive in respect of this matter because I cannot predict how matters might develop or what agreements may be entered into in the future.  However, a double-lock protection exists in that there must be a European Union agreement based on certain principles to which the European Convention on Human Rights would apply.  Subsequent to the making of such an agreement, the arrest warrant provisions would apply through the making of ministerial orders.  There is no major issue or difficulty with regard to that aspect of the matter.This is very important legislation. It is important that we ensure we can meet our international obligations in the manner in which we apply the measure in the context of the issue raised by Senator Colm Burke.  There are concerns about the extent of the backlog of cases in the Supreme Court and there is enormous pressure on the court as a result of the proliferation of litigation and the number of appeals coming from the High Court.  In recent years there has been a substantial increase in numbers within the High Court, but there has not been a proportionate increase in numbers within the Supreme Court.  It is part of the programme for Government that legislation will be enacted to provide for a civil court of appeal and constitutional issues will have to be addressed in that context, with, possibly, a unified and separate system of family courts.  Work is being done on that issue, on which, ultimately, a referendum will be required.   The intention is that work will be completed to facilitate the holding of a referendum in 2013.  It is more likely to take place in the second half of 2013 because of the burden and privilege that will arise from our holding the Presidency of the European Union for the first six months of the year.  Clearly, it would not be a good idea to hold a referendum in the middle of the Presidency.  My intention is to address the issue in the autumn of 2013 and that a substantial amount of work will be done in advance.  Serious work has commenced and it may be that some issues arising from it may be the subject of a conference later in the year to ensure maximum consultation on the referendum that may need to be held and the structure of the new courts system.I thank  Members for their interesting, constructive and supportive contributions.  I look forward to taking Committee and Report Stages and would appreciate the co-operation of the House in that regard.  I hope to achieve the objective of enacting the Bill before the summer vacation commences.

Tá an cheist atá ardaithe agam, a bhaineann le cúrsaí eitinne, ag déanamh an-imní d'fheirmeoirí ar fud na tíre.  Go deimhin, is cúis imníé ar fud an oileáin os rud é nach dtuigeann sé aon teorainn.I raise an issue which is of great concern to farmers across the Thirty-two Counties and knows no boundaries, that is, TB eradication.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, to clarify the levels of TB on a county by county basis, the reason levels are high in County Clare, west Cork and east Wicklow and how active is the Department's wildlife programme in removing TB infected badgers in these areas.  It is of huge importance to the farming community that bovine TB be eradicated.  I note that the Sinn Féin Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in the North, Ms Michelle O'Neill, appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 3 July and outlined that the eradication of bovine TB was a top priority for her in her ministry.  I am aware that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine is of the same mind.  The approach adodpted in the North is to test live badgers, vaccinate and release those which test negative for TB and remove those that prove positive.  Therefore, the focus is on removing diseased badgers and protecting those which are not infected.The reason I raise the issue is that I have been speaking to people in farming circles who are concerned about a possible upsurge in the level of bovine TB across the island.  They are concerned at the high levels of TB in County Clare, west Cork and east Wicklow.  If the Minister is in a position to provide the figures on a county by county basis, as requested, it will be clear whether their fears are well founded.  Perhaps he might outline the Department's wildlife programme to remove infected badgers from these and other areas across the island and if the necessary resources are in place.  There is a fear that there may be a shortage of personnel in the areas mentioned and that this is leading to infected badgers not being removed.  Is í sin an cheist atá mé ag cur ar an Aire Stáit.  Tá mé ag súil go mór leis an bhfreagra atá aige dom.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I thank the Senator for raising the important issue of the bovine TB eradication programme operated by the Department.  I am responding on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney.The bovine TB eradication programme operated by the Department includes a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing of all cattle in the national herd, the early removal of reactors, the payment of compensation for cattle removed as reactors, implementation of a range of supplementary tests such as post-derestriction and contiguous tests, a wildlife programme and the depopulation of infected herds in some cases.  These measures which are implemented uniformly across the country have proved to be relatively effective in recent years as evidenced by the significant reduction in disease levels in the past decade.  For example, the herd incidence fell from 7.53% in 2000 to 4.18% last year, while reactor numbers in 2011 were, at 18,500, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950s.  Reactor numbers and the herd incidence have continued to fall in 2012.The herd incidence in each county in 2011 is set out in the table circulated with the reply.  The incidence ranges from a low of 1.88% in County Mayo to a high of 11.10% in east Wicklow.  The incidence of the disease is relatively high in west and east Wicklow, where it is significantly higher than the national average.  The incidence in counties Clare and Cork is also above the national average but not significantly so.  TB is a complex disease and it is often very difficult to explain precisely why its incidence is higher in one part of the country than another.  There are several factors at play, including environmental factors, residual infection and, of course, wildlife.  It should be noted that the incidence of TB in these counties has been traditionally higher than the national average and the difficulty in eradicating TB from an area in which it has become entrenched may help to explain the continuing high incidence of the disease in these counties.There has been, however, a substantial improvement in the position in some of the counties referred to by the Senator in the current year compared to 2011.  For example, the incidence in east Wicklow has fallen by 35% from 11.10% last year to 7.15% this year.  In fact, all of the counties referred to by the Senator have seen a reduction in the incidence of TB this year compared to 2011, although the reduction has not been as significant as in east Wicklow.  The Department has devoted additional resources to Wicklow in the past year and is working very closely with the farming organisations and farming community in that county with a view to bringing about a further improvement in the situation there.The TB eradication programme is scientifically based and the Department continues to monitor and review its effectiveness and efficiency on an ongoing basis in light of experience and research.  In this context and having regard to the very significant improvement in the overall TB situation nationally, the Department reviewed the programme last year and concluded that eradication would require us to address all other potential sources of infection, including from neighbouring herds and the movement of high-risk animals, in addition to the emphasis which has been placed on badgers as a source of infection in recent years.  There was also a recognition of the necessity that testing be conducted in a timely manner.  In light of this, the Department introduced a number of changes to the TB programme earlier this year to prevent the spread of disease from infected herds to clear herds and to tighten up on overdue testing.  These changes were made following a series of consultation meetings with farming organisations.It is important to note that the changes are, first, based on research which points to the increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals and, second, designed to protect clear herds from buying in high-risk animals.  For example, the restrictions imposed on the movement of inconclusive reactors is based on research which showed that standard inconclusive reactors which passed the retest and moved out of the herd, subsequent to passing the test, were 12 times more likely to be TB positive at the subsequent test or at slaughter compared with all other animals in the herd.  Furthermore, the new controls on the movement of animals out of herds which are identified as contiguous to a herd experiencing an active high-risk TB breakdown are based on research which showed that the risk of such herds disclosing TB is almost three times greater than the risk in the case of herds tested on a round test.Following representations from the farming sector, the Department has reviewed and made changes to the new arrangements.  Herd owners will be contacted prior to restricting their herds under the contiguous testing programme.  Herd owners who, for genuine reasons, negotiate a delay of up to one month with the district veterinary office prior to the overdue date will not have any penalties applied.  In addition, herd owners who postpone their tests with the permission of the district veterinary office or are contiguous to a high-risk breakdown and are waiting for a test will be permitted to buy in animals for a limited period.While we are very pleased with the overall improvement in the incidence of TB nationally, the Minister is aware that the position is less satisfactory in some areas.  The Department's objective is to eradicate this disease and the measures introduced this year are designed to achieve that objective.  The fact that TB is also endemic in the badger population has made matters extremely difficult, but I am satisfied that the Department is dealing with the issue in a very effective manner.  That effort is largely responsible for the reduction we have seen in recent years.  I am hopeful that we will see further progress in the coming years both nationally and in the counties referred to by the Senator.

It is interesting to note that the Border counties have a lower average incidence of TB.  Perhaps that is the effect of policy in the Six Counties, or it might be due to entirely different causes.  Does the Minister of State accept that TB levels in counties Kilkenny, Meath, Wexford, Wicklow, Waterford, Westmeath and even Dublin are unacceptably high?  Will he clarify whether the necessary resources are being put in place to reduce those levels, particularly in Wicklow east and Wicklow west, where the rate is 11.10% and 7.6%, respectively, and to bring the national average down?
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Recent changes to the TB eradication scheme recognise that in addition to efforts to control the control the badger population, we must move to address some of the other constraints such as the movement of high-risk animals and animals from high-risk herds.  In particular, the changes are designed to ensure herds are tested on time and to reduce the movement opportunities for potentially infected cattle in order to protect clear herds from infection.  For these reasons, the enhancement to the TB programme includes tighter controls on overdue tests, restriction of movement of animals from contiguous herds pending tests and restrictions on inconclusive reactors.  As I said, the changes were made following a series of consultation meetings at which we took on board the concerns of the farming community.  The measures are based on research which demonstrates that there are increased risks attached to the movement of certain animals.As a result of these changes, there has been a significant reduction in both herd and animal instances of TB.  Reactor numbers have fallen from 40,000 ten years ago to 18,500 last year, the lowest incidence since the commencement of the programme in the 1950s.  The Department is committed to maintaining its efforts to eradicate TB.  There has been a great improvement in Wicklow east and west, but it is a work in progress.
#BrianODomhnaill	unknown-#BrianODomhnaill-party	unknown-#BrianODomhnaill-dob	unknown-#BrianODomhnaill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	237	There has been much discussion in recent months regarding the distribution of herring quota, which has been subject to review by the Department.  Both the north-west herring fishery and the Celtic Sea herring fishery provide much needed employment to fishermen and factory workers, particularly in areas like Killybegs, Kincasslagh and west Donegal.  The difficulty is that the criteria used by the Department to determine eligibility seem to be extremely selective.  The new policy is ultimately intended to ring-fence the fishery and divide the distribution of quota north and south of the country.  The proposals would effectively preclude all but two of the local pelagic vessels from the Celtic Sea fishery, fishing out of Killybegs, to avail of any level of quota.  They also discriminate very negatively against the smaller vessels — less than 10 m in length —  which have been fishing for herring as far back as the 1920s in Donegal and along the west coast.The fishing opportunity in Killybegs and Kincasslagh will inevitably suffer as a consequence of these provisions.  There are processing factories in both those location which provide employment to large numbers of local people.  If I understand it correctly, the new policy means that vessels which participated in a fishery in 2009 or 2010 or in three of the five years between 2006 and 2010 will be allowed to enter into the new fishery in future.  A large number of the boats from the west and north-west coasts participated in a fishery in 2011, bringing much needed employment to their communities.  However, some of these fishermen were only returning to the Celtic Sea fishery after a number of years.  These fishermen are now to be excluded completely from fishing under the new policy.  The knock-on effect will be the haemorrhaging of jobs in ports such as Killybegs, which is one of the harbours under the control of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  It will also have a knock-on effect on the shipbuilding, repair and fuel industries and other local enterprises that work out of Killybegs.My initial reaction to this is one of shock because there has been little or no consultation within the industry, particularly in the northern end of the country, on this new policy.  The Department and the Minister appear to have undergone a process of scrutiny and if the policies as I have read out and the criteria as I have outlined are to be implemented, then it is a blatant attack on the fisheries of the north-west coast.  It is a blatant attack on the larger vessels, the pelagic fleet and the smaller vessels — that is, boats under 10 m — many of which are operating from the offshore islands.  It comes in the aftermath of new bore fishing regulations, which I will not go into now.  The distribution of quota, for example, under the bore regulations, resulted in one vessel in Killybegs receiving 15% of the catch of the previous year while a vessel in Cork received 857% of the catch of the previous year.  Questions must be raised here about fairness and transparency in the allocation of quota.I hope the response tonight will be transparent and will show that decisions have not been taken without adequate consultation.  The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am a member, had requested that before any decision was taken by the Minister he and his officials would appear before the committee.  That did not happen.  Last week our Chairman invited Department officials to come before the committee either this week or next but the response was that they did not have time and the committee would have to wait until the autumn.  That sort of response is simply not good enough, which is why I am raising the matter tonight.  I hope some clarity can be brought to the issue.  While I appreciate that Deputy Perry does not have ministerial responsibility for this matter, as a former spokesperson in this area, I know he will understand what I am talking about.  I hope the Department has provided him with a reasonable response.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I thank the Senator for raising a very important issue.  I have visited Killybegs on many occasions, and I know of the huge investment made there and the opportunities provided by the coastal waters.There are three herring stocks of importance to the Irish fleet: the Celtic Sea herring stock, the stock found off the north west of Ireland, and the west of Scotland stock.  Ireland has an 86% share of the Celtic Sea stock, 91% of the north west stock and 15% of the west of Scotland stock.  Accordingly, these stocks are very important for the Irish fleet and support the fishing industry in local areas.  Each year many seasonal jobs are created in the local fish processing companies.  Indeed, when I was spokesperson on this issue under the last administration, the lack of support for processing was obvious.  This problem has not arisen just in the last 12 months, but has been ongoing for ten years or more.  Change cannot happen overnight.In the Celtic Sea herring fishery, there was a significant collapse of stock in the 1990s.  The Celtic Sea herring management advisory committee, comprising representatives of the industry and processors, with the support of the Marine Institute, developed a rebuilding plan for the stock in 2008, which has since been implemented.  This plan has led to a reversal of the downward trend in the stock, and it is now being fished sustainably.  The Celtic Sea herring management advisory committee has now prepared a management plan which has been submitted for evaluation to the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, to support the sustainable management of this stock into the future, which is in everyone's interest.  However, the success of the rebuilding plan resulted in greater pressure on the fishery from vessels that had not regularly participated in the fishery in recent years.  In general, between 2006 and 2010 the number of vessels in the fishery was relatively constant.  However, in 2011 the numbers doubled, which reduced the allocation for each vessel and posed a challenge to the sustainability of the fishery.  Therefore, the commencement of the herring review in 2011 came at a pivotal time for the stock.  In order to go forward, one must look back, and the Senator will agree that the doubling of the number of vessels participating was problematic.The north west of Ireland herring stock faces a similar challenge.  The stock has had significant cuts in the total allowable catch, TAC, in recent years, and the ICES is recommending a zero TAC unless a rebuilding plan is put in place.  The Irish industry, with the support of the Marine Institute, has now introduced a rebuilding plan which is being considered by the EU pelagic regional advisory council.  It is intended that this plan will be submitted to the European Commission and evaluated by the scientific, technical and economic committee.  The plan may also be brought before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It is hoped that the adoption and implementation of this plan will provide a roadmap for recovery of the stock.  The west of Scotland herring stock is subject to a separate EU management plan and is being fished sustainably.In 2011, the Minister asked the fishing industry and other interested parties to make proposals on the future management arrangements for all Irish herring fisheries, namely the Celtic Sea stock, the stocks off the north west coast and the Atlanto-Scandian stock.  The objective of the review was to deliver a policy which would ensure economically and biologically sustainable fisheries.  The Minister received more than 20 proposals and comments relating to herring stock management.  It was clear from these documents that there was no agreement within the industry as to how future herring fishing opportunities should be managed.  The Minister then asked the Department to examine the proposals received and prepare a number of options which, as far as practically possible, took the views of stakeholders into account while delivering proper and effective management.On 22 December 2011, the Minister published a draft policy document on the matter which he believed met the objectives to the greatest extent possible.  He consulted and met industry representatives regarding the draft policy and listened carefully to the views expressed.  Having considered all views and bearing in mind the sustainability of the fisheries, he came to a decision which he believes provides for the proper and effective management and conservation and rational exploitation of herring stocks.  The policy is based on giving access to each of the fisheries to those with a recent track record in that particular fishery.  The track record provision allows access to vessels that landed a minimum of five tonnes of herring in 2009 or 2010 or in three of the five years during the period 2006 to 2010.  In addition, there are some limited specified circumstances in which an earlier track record may be taken into account.  The only exception to the track record provision relates to small vessels in the Dunmore area of the Celtic Sea fishery, where a small-scale local fishery is permitted in line with the rebuilding and management plan for the fishery.  A modest restricted quota for smaller vessels without a track record in the Celtic Sea and Area VIa south is also permitted.The decision was based on a clear, detailed and objective assessment of the fisheries in recent years.  This policy is intended to ensure the long-term sustainability of the herring fisheries by limiting participation in the main fisheries to those vessels that have participated in the fishery in the five years prior to the commencement of the review, even at a low level.  The Minister totally rejects the claim that the policy was in any way influenced by the geographical location of operators.  The qualifying criteria for ring-fencing are independent of location and based on transparent, objective participation data.  If an operator did not qualify, it was simply because that operator did not participate significantly in the fishery during the five years from 2006 to 2010.

I thank the Minister of State for providing the response, but, to be honest, I do not buy it.  I referred to boarfish.  Some 95% of all boarfish were caught in Killybegs.  Track record was not taken into consideration in the distribution of quota for boarfish.  Boats which had not participated previously were given a quota greatly in excess, in percentage terms, of that available to boats in Killybegs with a track record.  That was one only criterion.  There is a totally different criterion for herring fishing.  Why is that the case?  If the quota was distributed using the same criterion as that used for boarfish, at least there would be a fair distribution in Killybegs.  This will impact on jobs, which will be lost.  Some people working in fish factories in Donegal do not realise the implications of this decision.  We can refer to the decisions of the past and what occurred five or ten years ago, but this decision was taken on the Minister's watch in the past two months.  The decision, taken with the stroke of a pen, will mean families in Killybegs and people working in factories will lose their jobs.  It was not taken on scientific grounds.  If it had been, the Minister would have used the same template as that used for the distribution of boarfish quotas.  However, it was not done on that basis and, therefore, cannot be fair.  It is regrettable.

This is not a victimless crime.  A good deal of revenue is being lost and people's jobs are at risk.  Some legitimate dealers have had to close down because of this activity.  A meeting was held with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and the Department.  We brought along councillors from County Louth, including councillors Jim Lennon and Martin Murnaghan, as well as council officials and received a great response.  I know that the Government is determined to stamp out this activity.  Has any progress been made in enforcement, the preparation or issuing of licenses and the development of a new marker?  What is happening with the co-operation of the UK authorities?  If these things were done, it would help a good deal.  I realise that lately there has been a reduction in the amount of waste quantities recovered by Louth County Council, from 76 tonnes per month in 2011 to an average of 50 tonnes per month in 2012, but it is still high and up from 6 tonnes per month in 2009.

#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I thank the Senator for raising this important issue.  I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan.I welcome the opportunity to inform the House of the latest position on the ongoing work to combat the problem of fuel laundering and smuggling which has a significant impact.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners which has responsibility for the collection of mineral oil tax and tackling the illicit trade in mineral oil products has informed me that it is acutely aware of the threat posed by the illegal activity and tax evasion in this area.  The most serious risk comes from the large-scale laundering of markers from diesel that is subject to a reduced rate of mineral oil tax on condition that it is not used in road vehicles.Revenue collects €1.1 billion annually in excise duty from road diesel and consequently the potential for loss of tax revenue from this fraud is significant.  Naturally, this is not the only cost associated with this form of criminality.  It also undermines the competitiveness of legitimate businesses, damages the environment, can damage consumers' vehicles and sustains organised criminal gangs which are the prime movers in this illegality.  For all of these reasons, Revenue has made action against illegal fuel-related activities one of its top corporate priorities.  It is addressing the problem in the framework of a comprehensive mineral oil strategy and an action plan for 2011-12.  Its key areas of activity include robust and sustained enforcement action, implementing more effective controls for oil distribution and pursuing a more effective marker.  This last point was referred to by the Senator.  This work is being done in conjunction with the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the United Kingdom.Enforcement action is taken at all stages of the fuel supply chain, taking on those involved in laundering and who sell laundered fuel.  Revenue is supported in this work by well established structures to ensure close co-operation between all relevant agencies north and south of the Border.  The cross-Border fuel fraud group brings together representatives from several agencies, including An Garda Síochána and the PSNI, as well as the United Kingdom and Irish Revenue authorities.  There has been excellent and welcome co-operation between all agencies in sharing intelligence and identifying and investigating criminals involved in this fraud.The Senator will be pleased to note that there have been notable successes in the fight against the launderers.  Between 2010 and yesterday, Revenue officers detected and closed 18 oil laundries and seized 650,000 litres of oil, together with ten oil tankers and 38 vehicles.  Additionally, more than 1 million litres of fuel, held for commercial purposes, was seized during that period.  I compliment everyone involved.  Only this morning, Revenue enforcement officers, supported by the Garda regional support unit, uncovered an oil laundering plant near Castleblayney, County Monaghan.  The laundry was in operation when Revenue officials carried out a search of the premises.  It was concealed in a curtain-sided lorry situated in a commercial yard.  The lorry, two 40 ft. containers, two tankers, one van and 40,000 litres of laundered product were seized.  A significant quantity of toxic waste was also uncovered at the site.  Three men were arrested and inquires are ongoing.  The operation was the result of surveillance activity carried out by Revenue officers.  I congratulate everyone involved in this major seizure.Stringent penalties are prescribed for offences relating to mineral oil smuggling and laundering.  A person convicted on indictment of an offence of evading or attempting to evade excise duty can be sentenced to imprisonment for up to five years or given a fine, or both.  Following a substantial increase in the penalties introduced by the Finance Act 2010, the maximum fine is of an amount not exceeding €126,970 or, where the value of the goods is more than €250,000, an amount not exceeding three times the value of the goods.  These penalty provisions permit the courts to impose sentences reflecting the seriousness of the criminal activity and serve as a deterrent from involvement in this type of crime.  Notwithstanding these achievements, it is recognised that the detection and closure of all laundries will not solve the problem.  Oil launderers need to be denied access to marked oil for the purposes of laundering, and they need to be denied access to the market for their laundered product.Since this time last year, the licensing regime for road fuels has been tightened up to make it more difficult for launderers to get their product onto the market.  Revenue is engaged in a vigorous campaign targeting specific locations nationwide, with the intention of immediate closure of unlicensed outlets and challenging instances of non-compliance with licence requirements.  As a result, 32 filling stations were shut down by Revenue in 2011 either because they did not have a licence or were in breach of licensing conditions and a further 20 outlets have been closed to date this year.  This represents real progress and this important work is continuing.Legislative action taken in this year's Finance Act will provide improved underpinning and support for action to control and supervise the fuel supply chain and restrict the scope for illegal activity.The previous licence for persons dealing in road fuels has been replaced by a new auto-fuel trader's licence, as and from 1 July.  In addition, anyone dealing in marked diesel or marked kerosene will now, for the first time, have to be licensed for the purpose.  The requirement to have a marked fuel trader's licence comes into operation with effect from 1 October.The Revenue Commissioners are the licensing authority and will have power to refuse a licence where the applicant does not show to their satisfaction that any conditions that they may attach to the licence can be satisfied.  Revenue is empowered also to revoke a licence, if the holder contravenes or fails to comply with any of its terms, or any provision of excise law relating to fuel.  That is a good tightening up as well.In parallel with the introduction of the new licensing system, the regulations that lay down the detailed rules and requirements on mineral oil matters have been reviewed by the Revenue Commissioners and new regulations, containing additional and reinforced provisions, were made last week.  The requirements for record keeping have been strengthened, and a new requirement for persons dealing in fuel to make periodic returns to Revenue have been introduced.  All traders, including traders in marked fuels, will have to make monthly returns, electronically, detailing their fuel transactions, including purchases.  This system of returns, which will come into operation from the start of next year, will be an important new source of information on the supply chain for Revenue.  It will, for example, assist in the identification of unusual or anomalous patterns of activity.In addition, Revenue and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs in the UK have been working in partnership to identify a new, more effective marker.  A memorandum of understanding has been signed between the two authorities.  A joint invitation to make submissions, IMS, seeking proposals was published in June.  Both authorities are committed to seeking the widest possible range of proposals so that the most effective marker, the point Senator Jim D'Arcy made, for the future can be identified.  The closing date for receipt of submissions is 30 November.The problem of illegal activity in the fuel market is unquestionably a serious one, and the extensive enforcement action that is being carried out on an ongoing basis highlights the Government's commitment to combating it.  The legislative steps that have been taken, together with the work on development of a more effective fuel marker, will provide important new support for this action and serve to enhance its effectiveness.  Senators can be assured that all possible steps, with the full determination of the Minister on major cross-Border co-operation, will continue to be taken against those who involve themselves in this damaging form of criminality.

I have not seen such as comprehensive or determined report in a long time.  It reflects the Minister's attitude to the matter.I wish to acknowledge here the presence of Councillor Oliver Tully, who has just finished his term as chairman of Louth County Council, and his wife, Eileen.  Councillor Tully is very interested in this matter as well.That is great news about Castleblayney.  Like the Minister, I congratulate all those involved in that seizure.  If I were faced with those penalties, I would think twice about being involved in that type of activity.Everything promised is being delivered.  One can ask for no more than that.  I spoke to some legitimate oilmen who stated that activity rates have dropped a little.  However, we cannot be complacent.  Rust never sleeps.  We must follow through fully on all of these matters.I hope the Minister of State will come back here, perhaps in three or four months, to give us a further report.  Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire Stáit.  He deserves an A plus.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I acknowledge the presence of Councillor Tully and his wife, Eileen, as well and compliment him on his outstanding service.Senator Jim D'Arcy has a deep interest in this, representing small business which is the backbone of the economy.  For every action of criminality, there is a serious reaction and consequences in the closure of small companies, whether they be suppliers, retailers or others.  There is a solid determination that we must ensure that criminality is stamped out.A comprehensive reply is what Seanad Éireann is entitled to get.  There was a major seizure and this was a timely debate.  Senator Jim D'Arcy has been concerned about this over some time since he was elected to Seanad Éireann.  His concern has brought this to the House and the Minister is determined to ensure that the actions taken by Revenue and the Garda Síochána, in co-operation with Her Majesty's service in the UK, will be continued.  By 30 November, they will have a unified marker that will go a long way towards minimising the problem even further.  I am delighted Senator Jim D'Arcy raised this topical issue today.
