We are considering the Public Sector Standards Bill 2015, which was referred to the select committee by an order of the Dáil of 5 July 2016. I welcome the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and his officials. There are 89 amendments for consideration but, by arrangement with the committee, we must finish at 1 p.m. I refer members to the circulated list of amendments that have been grouped for the purpose of debate.

Given everything else that happens in the Oireachtas on Wednesdays, we have not had much time to consider them properly. I wish to signal that we may submit further amendments on a number of issues on Report Stage. The e-mail containing these amendments arrived just after 5 p.m. on Tuesday.

We shared all of our amendments with the Bills Office last Thursday in advance of the deadline for this session. However, I apologise if members feel that they have not had enough time to consider them. If any Deputy wishes to amend the Bill on Report Stage, we will consider anything put forward, particularly as this Bill is reasonably central to how public life could be perceived in future. We will take any issue that colleagues wish to raise now on board. If we can devise ideas to improve the Bill on Report Stage, we will do so. If we cannot, I will engage with Deputies on any change that they propose to make.

It lays out how the Bill is to be referred to and the period within which the Bill will be enacted.It states that it will come into operation within six months from the passing of the Bill or on an earlier day which the Minister may appoint by order. Section 2 is a defining section. It sets out the various definitions in place regarding phrases, concepts and terminology that apply throughout the Bill. The key point is that it refers to the definition of "actual knowledge", "benefit", "commercial price" and "gift". It also sets out all the officials and bodies to which the Bill is subject.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	14	I am sorry for intervening at this stage but there are more than 80 amendments and I am conscious of the time. My understanding of the Chairman's earlier intervention is that sections 26 and 27 may be pertinent with regard to Members of the Oireachtas. Rather than explaining all of the sections at this stage, could we move to deal with the amendments, extrapolate their meaning and dispense with them as we go along? Obviously, I will be guided by the Chairman.

Opposition members did not submit amendments to the Bill and in the course of this discussion with the Minister and his officials we may well find areas of agreement but also areas of disagreement that might need to be addressed by way of amendments. I suggest we do that. I understand we have to go through each of the sections.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	19	I move amendment No. 1:In page 9, line 26, after “1997” to insert the following:“or, as the case may be, section 2(1) of the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999”.Amendment No. 1, which I have tabled at the request of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, is to ensure that the definition of "donation" in section 2 of the Bill is fully comprehensive. In terms of where it originated, we have many different items of legislation - electoral Acts and local authority Acts - in this area and we are looking to come up with a single definition of "donation" in this Bill. Section 2(1) currently provides that donations shall be construed in accordance with section 22 of the Act of 1997. Section 22 of the Electoral Act of 1997 provides that "donation" means any contribution given for political purposes to a political party, a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a representative in the European Parliament or a third party or a candidate at a Dáil, Seanad or European election. However, this does not cover a donation to a member of a local authority. This amendment is being proposed to ensure that if one is a member of a local authority, one is subject to the force of this Bill in the same way as if one is a Member of the Dáil or any other parliamentary body. I am proposing amendment No. 2 to explain that the requirement for the existence of a public service pension scheme relates to both a subsidiary and a company in section 6(1)(k). This is a technical amendment to ensure clarity around this provision. Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are technical amendments to sections 6(3) and 6(6) to ensure consistency regarding the reference to committee of the Oireachtas throughout the Bill. Amendment No. 5 relates to section 7 of the Bill. It is a technical amendment I am proposing for clarification purposes. This amendment reiterates the source of income concept, which is provided for in the first line of section 7(2). Amendment No. 6 is a technical amendment. I am proposing it on the advice of the Attorney General's office to ensure clarity and because the existing text is somewhat colloquial.  Amendment No. 7 is a minor clarification provided to section 7 to ensure a new subsection in order that a political group of the European Parliament and a political party are defined for the purposes of section 7(11). Amendment No. 8 is a minor text amendment to close the bracket after "1997" in section 9(2). Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are being proposed on the advice of the Attorney General to ensure, as is appropriate, that the saver in section 11(2) should cover not just section 11(1) but the other provisions of that section as well. I am proposing amendment No. 12 to ensure that the prohibition on the use of confidential information in section 14 is comprehensive in its application. This amendment has been included at the request of the Standards in Public Office Commission and will ensure that confidential information is not used improperly to further the interests of any person and not just a connected person. The insertion of the word "than" in amendment No. 13 gives section 16(4) its proper meaning. This is correcting a typographical error. Amendment No. 16 refers to closing a bracket. I am proposing a technical amendment to ensure the words "in which" in amendment No. 17 to section 23(4) are inserted for clarification purposes. I am proposing the minor amendment No. 18 as there is no definition of "officeholder" in the Bill. To be consistent with section 25(1), therefore, the reference in subsection (1)(b) should be to the Minister of the Government rather than the officeholder. A similar approach is taken in amendment No. 19. Amendment No. 23 in section 27(1) is a minor textual change that inserts the word "the". The text now refers to the "Office of the Commissioner". Amendment No. 24 is a technical change so that the Deputy Public Sector Standards Commissioner is referred to in the Bill as the Deputy Commissioner. I am proposing amendment No. 31 at the request of the Standards in Public Office Commission in order that the new standards commissioner will be allowed to directly lay his or her annual report before the Oireachtas. Amendment No. 34 in section 32 provides for the deletion of lines 31 and 32. That was determined by the Office of the Attorney General as this piece of legal text did not seem to serve any purpose. Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 in section 33 are minor text and technical changes to fully reflect the terms "complainant" and "respondent". Amendments Nos. 42 and 43 in section 39 change the word "finds" to "find". Amendment No. 86 in section 62 is a minor text change in order to give the text a proper meaning. Amendment No. 87 in section 64 is a minor change to provide the correct title as the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government on foot of a change in the Department's name in 2016.

The Bill provides that if any public official believes he or she has received a donation, for example, or performed an act of some kind that is inconsistent with the implementation of this legislation, he or she must make what is called an ad hoc declaration. He or she has to inform the relevant body within a reasonable period of that happening. At the moment, it is done on a retrospective basis. That is an important change in this Bill.

In essence, this Bill is looking to ensure that we have a standards commissioner with a higher level of power and oversight than is currently the case.

It is fine for Members of the Oireachtas. We are generally full-time public representatives. Members of local authorities are not. They are trying to keep down a job in many cases. They do not have the kind of backup we have. Has there been engagement about this provision with local authority members or their representative bodies?

This legislation went through the drafting process of a policy paper and has been available in the Oireachtas and in the public domain for almost a year. Up to this point, short of Deputy Calleary raising the issue, we have not received any communication from anybody who is looking to change it in respect of its application to local authority members.

Let us be practical about legislation as well. We are leaving it vague with the phrase "reasonable period" and we are putting a more detailed reporting requirement on people who may not have the backup to do that and certainly are not aware that this is coming at them. I want to signal my concerns over "reasonable" and allowing a non-elected body to come up with definitions around that.

We are going to have a single person within the standards in public office body, who will be a standards commissioner. That office is unelected for good reason, which the Deputy is accepting. I accept that. We will ask that person to put together a code of practice. It is required in a different section of the Bill that he or she consult with stakeholders on what that code of practice is going to be. In many cases, we are not changing any particular definition. We are looking to have a single framework within which all of this can be dealt with. That is the purpose of the Bill. There is a section of the Bill that requires the standards commissioner to go through a period of consultation with relevant stakeholders. Maybe that is a way in which this matter could be dealt with. If the Deputy can identify a way in which we can improve the Bill in this area, I am very open to considering it. In light of what the Deputy has said, I am willing to consider this on Report Stage if I can. There is a specific section in the Bill that requires the standards commissioner to consult with stakeholders. Those stakeholders could of course include local authority bodies.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	40	The standards commissioner, as I understand it, will be able to appoint - a board will be appointed, if I am not mistaken. May I seek a clarification on that? It would be necessary in my view to ensure that there is a representative on that board who is either a former Oireachtas Member or former councillor, somebody within that new arrangement who would speak to the dynamic that exists for public representatives.

I can offer some explanation as to why the Deputy is saying that. At the moment, we have a board within the Standards in Public Office Commission. If a particular matter needs to be considered or action taken, the board has to be assembled. We are now vesting the power in this area in a single individual who is referred to in this Bill as the standards commissioner, and who can also have a deputy. We are looking to move it in the other direction. Where the Deputy might be getting that idea from, though, is that we have an outside appointments board through which that person can give consideration to whether somebody should be taking up a role. Maybe in respect of that board the Deputy's point could be considered. In terms of this Bill, we are looking to move it in the opposite direction in that we would have a single person and a deputy whose role it would be to oversee the implementation of this legislation.

There will be a person there known as the standards commissioner, who will be responsible for the implementation of the legislation. Is that right?

The commission itself will be dissolved to deal with this issue of having to assemble a meeting to deal with a particular matter. Then the latter part of what the Chairman said is correct. We would then have a single individual, who will have a deputy, and they will be vested with the powers to implement this Bill.

He or she would have to be extremely well briefed on the role of councillors, for example, to take up Deputy Calleary's point, who are not familiar with completing all of these forms or the consequences of signing off on them, as we are here in this House. One is presented with all sorts of forms to complete and sign and sometimes, in my opinion, Members do not understand the consequences of those signatures - not that they are doing anything wrong. It is a pretty onerous task to go through all of that paperwork. We have not consulted with the councillors to get their view on it. I think that consultation is also necessary in respect of what Members of the Parliament think about all of those forms. My understanding of the Standards in Public Office Commission, and I engage with it, is that some Members do not fully understand its purpose. It is not there to catch us out but to help us. I would be very concerned about the forms, and the lack of consultation in respect of all of that.

I did not engage with this Bill properly but why are we replacing a commission with one individual? Where did that come out of? Is there international best practice? In fairness to the Standards in Public Office Commission, it comprises a group of people with expertise and practical knowledge. Surely a commission, comprising a group of people with expertise and experience, would not be less effective than one person.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	46	On the first question, the reason for that is that we are more compliant with what we believe to be international best practice the area. We have looked at work that has been done elsewhere, in particular work has been done by the OECD and the World Bank and they have looked at what best practice is in other jurisdictions. We have based our thinking in this area on what they have said that best practice is. That is why we are looking to vest it in a single individual. To help the committee, I can supply some of the information regarding what best practice looks like in other jurisdictions in advance of Report Stage. On the Chairman's point about the role of councillors, we have consulted with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. It is very supportive of what we are doing in seeking to implement a report which includes many of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal. To deal directly with the Chairman's point about the number of forms that can be generated, most of the time our colleagues in the Standards in Public Office Commission try to help colleagues to make sure forms are filled in and all their duties are discharged accurately. There is a section later on in this Bill that requires a period of consultation with key stakeholders on the development of a code of practice. That is the way an issue like that could be dealt with.

We are struggling to get people to serve in local government and this is another requirement on people they need to be aware of. I would not wait for them to talk to the Minister. He should talk to them.

In many cases, what we are looking to do is to align with legislation that is already there but that being said, we are vesting new powers in the standards commissioner, as we have discussed. There will be a change in how we expect public officials and elected members to perform. In that spirit, I will take up Deputy Calleary's suggestion and write to the local authority representative bodies to notify them of this. If they have any further concerns, we will take them on board.

It is just that we are all aware how long it takes to complete all these forms, maintain all the paperwork and then have it ready for the Houses of the Oireachtas should it be inspected. Many councillors are sent from pillar to post with all of these strategic policy committees, district meetings and so on. The Minister is putting a huge burden on them. That is my only concern.

In that spirit, the Chairman and the members are looking to make sure that we end up with a Bill which can be properly implemented. My Department will write to the local authority representative bodies and ask them for any further input on the Bill. We will complete that before we move to Report Stage and I will notify the committee of any input that I receive from local authority members. I take the Chairman's point.

I know they have to do this already for their own local authority but now they are being required to provide a lot more information here. In advance of Report Stage, we all need to engage with the Bill. I am happy to support the amendment.

As I have said, I am happy to help with any concerns that colleagues might have and notify the local authority representative bodies of the Bill and what we are doing. If they have any concerns about it, we will come back to the committee.

The Bill was introduced in January 2016 when our minds may have been elsewhere. There is probably a lot more work to be done in terms of informing members. As we go through it, I have many queries about section 7 and I now have queries about declarable interests. It places a whole new sheaf of reporting requirements to which I do not object but in terms of the day-to-day practicalities, let us make this Bill effective. I am happy to support the amendment but ahead of Report Stage, there needs to be engagement not just with local authority members but Members of the House around provisions of the Bill.

I take the Deputy's point that a hell of a lot has been happening in the intervening period but this is a Bill that has been in the public domain for quite a while. On Report Stage, if colleagues wish to change or notify me of changes they would like to make, we can engage in such changes then.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	70	Okay, but I am trying to assist the Chairman, because the substantive issues contained within the Bill in regard to declarable interests are in section 7. If a further process is necessary to examine the content of section 7, one must be mindful of what the Chairman said if section 7 is passed today.

That is the question. If the amendments are to be agreed as we go along, then those amendments will be presented to the House. If the Deputy is unhappy with the amendments, now is the time to state it so that the Minister can be asked to withdraw them. We cannot have it two ways. That is my concern.

However, that still does not deal with the questions that have been posed by Deputy Dara Calleary and the Chairman on section 7. I am happy to agree to the amendments to section 7, but if there are content issues in section 7, the question is, do we pass section 7? If section 7 is passed, can one still submit amendments on Report Stage?

It lays out the different bodies of which a public official is a member. It also lists the Attorney General and Comptroller and Auditor General.

It splits it into two different categories. A "Category A" official is broadly an individual who holds a very senior post.

This is actually the heart of the Bill with regard to new requirements. I would like the Minister to talk us through it.

I am thinking of the county councillor, for example, who may be a solicitor, a commissioner for oaths or an auctioneer. Where a local development plan is being made, and if that person has a declarable interest in selling or ownership of that land, is there anything in this new section that strengthens the declaration or the necessity to declare an interest? Is it as is? I am trying to understand the ad hoc declaration which the Minister has described. I am not fully au fait with it yet. I think it is pertinent to section 7. If it is not, the Minister can inform me.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	104	I will kick off by broadly answering the question put to me by Deputy Calleary about the role of section 7. Section 7 details all the interests that the Bill sees as being declarable interests. The purpose of this is to communicate to any public official who would be subject to this Bill what interests he or she needs to declare. I will deal with it subsection by subsection. Subsection (1) defines the seven forms of interest that are declarable interests for the purposes of this legislation. They are laid out in subsection (1)(a) through to subsection (1)(g). They are an income, a contract, an office, an asset, gifts and travel accommodation, property that could be supplied or lent and interests of a residual nature. Subsection (2) gets into sources of income. It lays out sources of income that must be seen as declarable interests.It lays out where they exceed €2,600 per year in an income that is separate to the income that the individual could be claiming through his or her public job. It lays out the source of any income regarding dealing in or developing lands, including if it is a connected person or company or a body corporate involved in dealing in or developing land. That probably answers Deputy Sherlock's question. It then deals with the source of any income from a position as a consultant, adviser or lobbyist. Subsection (3)-----

The Bill states: "Each of the interests specified in this section is a declarable interest for the purposes of this Act, and the following forms of interest are dealt with by the following subsections-----". I seek guidance on this issue. Does any part of the Bill explicitly say that one has to declare the source of the income as opposed to "the income"?
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	143	Section 7(1)(a) mentions income. That would give the impression that one has to give the level of that income.

That deals with the matter. I was speaking at cross-purposes to Deputy Calleary earlier. I apologise for that. I thought he was referring to the source of income.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	145	Section 7(2)(b) deals with the source of any income related to dealing in or developing land. The phrase "developing land" is quite vague. If one is a Member of this House or a local authority and one has a farm from which one reclaims land, is that developing land? There is a vagueness of language which can be used to hide from the provisions of the legislation. Where is the definition of "developing"? Is it part of the Bill? I know where this wants to get to but there is a vagueness which is hindering it.

I believe the phrase "developing land" is sufficiently specific. If we try to get too granular in terms of what a particular word might mean, we might end up excluding forms of activity that it is the intention of the House to capture. I earlier mentioned the concept of a code of conduct. We must allow a little latitude to the Standards in Public Office Commission to put together a code of conduct which will fulfil the intention of the Bill. I am happy to take on board the views of Members.

The Minister is establishing a commissioner in this regard. That gives these people authority and power that we will not have a second bite at. If it is not granular, there could be an error. The Minister is correct that the Bill has been available to be read for 15 months but I would say that fewer than five people in either House are aware of this and there are five or six of us here.

If such a definition is available, I will put that forward on Report Stage. If colleagues have any suggestions, I am happy to consider them. We need to be careful that the language does not become so specific that it narrows the ability of the Standards in Public Office Commission to do its work.As long as that is clear, of course I am happy to do it.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	154	I seek clarification on periodic and ad hoc disclosures. Under section 7 and its attendant subsections, the ad hoc disclosure applies. My understanding is that the ad hoc disclosure is made if and when a conflict of interest arises. It is generally more effective than periodic disclosure in identifying interests likely to give rise to a conflict as the nature of the private interests to be disclosed can be defined in more general terms. Consequently, it is also better at bringing such interests into the public arena. There is an obligation on any persons or entities subject to section 7 to make the declaration. Where is the composite investigative function? Is there a composite or opposing investigative function on the part of the Standards in Public Office Commission?

Section 12 lays out what an ad hoc declaration is and when it is required. With regard to Deputy Sherlock's point, the legislation defines a relevant matter as a resolution, motion or question. It lays out the fact that, for example, this could arise in the Oireachtas, a local authority or a committee. That is laid out in section 12.

I am not dictating but the Minister should be frank in stating this legislation has substantial provisions and requirements and that before Report Stage, all Members should engage on those requirements. Perhaps there is something to be said for the Minister's officials holding a briefing on the Bill in the AV room at some stage in the next couple of weeks to outline the practicalities for people. It is only as we tease things out that we see what is involved.

If a Member, representing either his party or a committee of the House, or the Chairman of any committee is sent on a parliamentary trip, does he not have to make a declaration if the sum is over €600? Section 7(11) states:The reference ... to travel, accommodation, refreshment or ancillary facilities ... shall be construed as a reference to the thing concerned being provided—... by the public official's employer, ... by an international organisation of states ... by an institution or body of the European Union, ... by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (or other such similar bodies ... ) ... to a member of either House of the Oireachtas and paid for wholly by the member's political party or by a political group of the European Parliament.That seems to cover all the bases in terms of-----

It refers to an exemption in respect of a relative, except a spouse or child of the official, where the interest of that relative could be perceived to be inconsistent with the public official discharging his or her duties.

It is also dealt with in section 8(10), which states: "The reference in subsection (9) to an interest of a public official’s spouse or of a child of a public official shall be construed (in a case where the spouse or child is not himself or herself a public official) as a reference to an interest of the spouse or the child that, if the spouse or child, as the case may be, were a public official, would be a declarable interest." There is a double check in place there.

I have already spoken about the amendments. Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 propose an amendment on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General to ensure, as is appropriate, that the provision in section 11(2) should cover not just section 11(1) but other provisions of that section. What we are looking to do with these amendments is make clear that they cover everything in section 11.

Legislation establishing new bodies in the past has included provisions relating to the applications of the Ethics Act. As some of these provisions related to ad hoc disclosures at meetings more onerous than those set out in section 12, I am proposing an amendment on the advice of the Office of the Attorney General which will ensure that public officials concerned would be required to comply with the provisions in section 12 as well as the ad hoc disclosure provisions at meetings in the legislation referring to their own public body. This amendment will also allow the new standards commissioner to investigate a complaint made regarding a contravention of the ethics provisions contained in the existing Acts relating to public bodies as well as under the Bill. Much of this refers to the questions put to me by Deputy Sherlock earlier.SECTION 13

This may be the space in which we deal with Deputy Calleary's concerns regarding how we define dealing or developing. Section 15 prohibits members of local authorities from acquiring or disposing of land or an interest in it or dealing in any professional capacity with land during their term of office and for two years afterwards in certain circumstances. The Bill lays out those particular circumstances. For example, these include if the land related to any function that was discharged in respect of the Planning and Development Act 2000 or if it refers to land that was subject to the passing of a resolution. Section 15(2) refers to the development plan, for example, if they own a piece of land that may have been impacted by the development plan. Section 15(3) introduces the concept of not being able to do that when they hold the office for a period of two years after the expiry of that term of office.

This is essentially a technical amendment. I am proposing amendment No. 15 to allow the new standards commissioner to determine the format and means by which tax clearance certificates are furnished to him or her. If a person is currently a public official, he or she is required to furnish a tax compliance certificate. If he or she is no longer a public official, this is not required but he or she may still be subject to other parts of the Bill, such as in respect of land. Amendment No. 15 gives the standards commissioner the power to determine the format in which that information can be shared. There are two ways in which this could be developed. First, it could be shared electronically, as opposed to by the exchange of the piece of paper, which is what happens at present. Second, we could allow the standards commissioner to get the information directly from the Revenue Commissioners. I am in favour of doing this but it would be a matter for the standards commissioner. At the moment, a person receives a tax clearance certificate and sends directly back to the standards commissioner. However, it may be more efficient to allow the commissioner to request the information directly from the Revenue Commissioners.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	212	There may be times when a person needs to discreetly deal with the Revenue Commissioners to put his or her house in order and to ensure that he or she is tax compliant, so that he or she can then furnish a tax clearance certificate. I would have a problem with SIPO or the commissioner going direct to Revenue because a person may not be compliant at a given time, but not for nefarious reasons.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	213	The amendment refers to both the format and means. The term "format" relates to doing it electronically, while that of "means" refers to the method of access. I can certainly consider that point. As the law is currently drafted, one has to either provide a tax clearance certificate or indicate to the Revenue Commissioners that one is getting one's affairs in order and is likely to be able to produce a certificate of tax compliance within a certain period. I am not proposing any amendment that might get in the way of the latter but I can reflect on the word "means" and on whether it might get in the way in the future. That is not my intention. It is particularly not my intention for people who are newly elected to the Oireachtas. It is entirely possible that a person could have a professional business outside public life and have a matter they are in the process of resolving with the Revenue Commissioners. If they then get elected to public life, we have to recognise their right to get their affairs in order, particularly if they transition to becoming a public official.

If we were to go any further in this Bill in extending to judges the requirements to which a Member of the Oireachtas is subject it could be inconsistent with their status within the Constitution. We are looking to deal with this separately through the establishment of a judicial council. It is proposed that the legislation providing for the establishment of the council will also provide for the establishment of a judicial conduct committee, both to facilitate the investigation of allegations of judicial misconduct and to prepare guidelines concerning judicial conduct and ethics. Separate legislation is being drawn up for that purpose, which I believe is at an advanced stage of drafting.

At present, SIPO recommends that an online system be developed to facilitate compliance with the tax clearance provisions of the Bill. As I stated earlier, this is by means of a hard copy. An online system would allow a category A public official to make his or her declaration to the commissioner using an electronic signature. In addition, such a system would allow for the tax clearance certificate to be provided by the Collector General directly to the commissioner rather than having it sent to the applicant who is then required to furnish it to the commissioner. This appears to the commission to be an unnecessary administrative procedure. That is how it is currently drafted. I will reflect on the committee's concern about the means of sharing and perhaps tighten that provision regarding the format.

In terms of legal services, that is quite clear where it is, for example, legal advice that might have a monetary value. It is important that it would be declarable or available to be declared. In relation to medical services, currently the 1995 Act brings medical services into this ambit. I will reflect on what is included in relation to psychiatric or psychological services. It is unclear to me why if somebody receives a psychological service it would be covered by the Bill. It is a fair point.

It fits in with the fuller description of the office which is now included in the Long Title of the Bill. Amendment No. 21 is a technical-type amendment. Section 26 deals with the establishment and functions of the new standards commissioner. I am proposing this amendment to subsection (12) to ensure that all current functions of the Standards in Public Office Commission are comprehensively transferred to the new commissioner. Subsections (1) and (2) of amendment No. 22 provide clarification, as the role of public sector standards commissioner cannot be held under certain circumstances. These amendments are supplementary provisions in relation to section 26. A similar provision was included in the Standards in Public Office Act 2001. Subsections (3) to (6) of this amendment are proposed for inclusion, on the advice of the Attorney General's office, to deal with instances where complaints are received against the new commissioner or deputy commissioner. The new section will allow the Minister to appoint another person to perform the functions of the commissioner or deputy commissioner in these situations. It will also allow the Minister to appoint another person to perform the functions where the commissioner or deputy commissioner is either unable to perform the functions or the office is vacant. In these proposals, I am seeking to deal with an issue that was touched on by Deputies earlier. We will now have a standards commissioner who will have a significant amount of power. We lay out procedures where, if an individual has a concern in relation to how those powers have been discharged, it is open to the Minister to make an appointment for somebody else to discharge those duties for a period of time.

Subsection (1) provides for the issuing of advice by the commissioner to a person to whom the Act applies regarding steps that could be taken by the person to comply with the Act. Subsection (2) provides that when a request for advice is made, the relevant provision of this Act will not apply between the time the request is made and the time the commissioner gives or declines to give that advice. Subsection (3) provides that the commissioner may issue confidential advice and guidance where he or she considers it appropriate to do so. Subsection (4) provides that in any proceeding or investigation of a breach, regard will be had to whether a person complied with the advice furnished, but regard will only be had to the compliance with advice in respect of determining the sentence of the individual concerned. Subsection (5) provides that subsection (4) applies to advice or guidance confidentially under subsection (3), despite its confidential nature. I will restate this in plain language. This answers some of the questions put to me earlier regarding the application of the Act. If a public official has a question on how a provision of the Act is being implemented, the official can go to the commission and ask for advice if he or she has a concern. During the period when the official is receiving advice, the relevant provision of the Act will not apply to the official. This is to respect the fact that the official is receiving advice. Then, when the official gets that advice and an issue arises, the official will be required to bring his or her affairs into line with the Act.

I strongly hold the view that the Standards in Public Office Commission has discharged and continues to discharge all the powers it has in the way that we would expect. However, the Bill provides that if a Member has a question, he or she can engage with the Commission and support and help will be provided in so far as it can be. In light of the change that is under way, we are seeking to put this on a statutory footing. Crucially, the idea is to make clear that for the period when a person is seeking advice on a particular section, that section will not apply.

If anything, I hope it will be strengthened because we are putting it on a statutory footing. Moreover, I hope that officials subject to the Bill will then feel more able and willing to seek such advice. The hope is that it will be clear to them that if they are seeking particular advice and it turns out that an issue arises, they are not subject to the Act during the period they were looking for the advice.

Representatives from the Standards in Public Office Commission come directly to Members. They have spoken in the audiovisual room and given advice generally on the Act and how people can be properly guided through the paperwork. This should be extended to everyone named in the Bill, including councillors. If others are to be included in the Bill, they should receive all appropriate supports initially while they are coming to understand the Act, the extent of the paperwork and their obligations. That is important. I know representatives from the Commission do it now. It is a question of reinforcing it.

I am proposing amendment No. 25 to ensure that the new standards commissioner will be required to consult relevant stakeholders before drafting the model code of conduct for the guidance of public officials with regard to compliance with the provisions of the Bill, as required under this section. Questions were put to me earlier in respect of ensuring that people who could be affected by the implementation of this code would be aware of it and would have an opportunity to input or to have their views known. We are going to put that on a statutory footing. Amendment No. 26 relates to section 30(2). The purpose is to allow public bodies the flexibility to draw up and issue codes of conduct which, while taking into account the model code that will be issued by the new standards commissioner, are specifically relevant to the particular public body concerned. Officials will be covered by this Act. Certain officials might have a particular role that requires a particular code of conduct. The purpose of the Act is not to provide a code of conduct for every job in the public service. It is to provide a relevant robust footing to issues raised by the Mahon tribunal. It is then up to other bodies to make the necessary provisions. If other bodies need to draw up a code of conduct that takes account of the requirements, they will be able to do so. Amendment No. 27 is next. It would not be practical for each Department to draw up its own separate code. It is sensible that there is an appointed body to draft such a code for Members and for members of the Government. The purpose of the amendment is to include a new subsection in section 30 that would make it explicit that sectoral codes would be drawn up based on the model code. Moreover, any public body not covered by these sectoral codes will draw up its own code. For example, we propose that my Department would draw up a code for civil servants, including special advisers. The Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government would draw up the relevant code for local authorities and elected members of local authorities. Amendment No. 28 provides for a technical change to the Bill to take account of the nature and status of Oireachtas committees. This is because it would not be appropriate for the new standards commissioner to give a direction to an Oireachtas committee. The relevant power has been removed by this amendment. Among other things, Article 15.10 of the Constitution provides that each House shall make its own rules and Standing Orders with the power to attach penalties for the infringements. Amendment No. 29 deals with a technical issue. The provision is to ensure that a procedure is in place for the new standards commissioner and for public bodies to amend or revoke codes of conduct and to issue replacement codes of conduct. Amendment No. 30 is another technical change to section 30 to ensure that the obligation to consult stakeholders also relates to where a new replacement code is drawn up by the new standards commissioner.

I think it might be helpful to see this section in light of section 11, which lays out values and guidance in relation to a gift. It says a public official shall not accept a gift which exceeds the value of €600, except, I hasten to add, where the gift is unconnected with the performance of his or her functions. It lays out that a public official "shall not accept gifts from the same person, the value of which, in aggregate, exceed €600 over the period of a year". Section 11 (4) states, "Where a gift the value of which exceeds €600 is given to a public official, then, unless the gift is unconnected with the performance of the official’s functions, he or she shall, within 14 days [do the following]." I would see all of this in the light of the fact that we are talking about something that has to exceed €600 in value. I will examine the matter in order to discover if it is anchored in other legislation elsewhere and whether a difficulty would arise if we were to change the period from 14 to 21 days.

It is worth being aware of the countervailing view that public officials should not accept gifts at all. Where this can become challenging is in the case of a person who is abroad performing Government business. Even though it is not a cultural norm or an expectation that if one is abroad representing the Government or the Oireachtas that one would give a gift to someone else, it is the case in many countries that a gift is given to the visitor. If someone is performing an official duty in Asia, for example, he or she will be given a gift by the person he or she is meeting. It is in recognition of this that the section is included.

As a result, I have tabled these amendments, which are all related, in order to deal with the issue. These revisions operate on the basis that there will be no hearing or interviews under oath in the course of an investigation but that there will still be the possibility of an oral hearing before the commissioner. The distinction is that where a breach is such that a prosecution for an offence is anticipated, the breach can be processed, through the investigation procedure provided for in Chapter 3, to a prosecution without any hearing taking place. As no hearing would take place, there is no possibility of prejudicing a subsequent prosecution. If a breach is such that an administrative sanction only - rather than a prosecution - is anticipated, the commissioner can hold an oral hearing without the fear of any subsequent prosecution being tainted. To express this in a different way, a fundamental rule in criminal law is that which relates to self-incrimination. This rule stipulates that an accused cannot be compelled to provide evidence of information against himself or herself which could then be used against him or her in a criminal prosecution. The only circumstances in which that could happen would be in respect of a criminal trial.Let us say a suspicion is formed about a criminal offence being committed. The purpose of this change is to make sure that in the process of the commissioner investigating it, he or she does not ask for evidence to be published, particularly in public or on oath, which would then cause a difficulty in the subsequent criminal trial.

As explained earlier, the intention is that the amendment will also allow the new standards commissioner to investigate a complaint made regarding a contravention of the ethical provisions contained in the existing Acts related to the public bodies, as well as under the Bill. With regard to the new subsections (3) and (7), I am advised by the Attorney General that it is necessary to include the provision in existing legislation relating to a specified act being included by way of amendment in this Bill. A specified act in the existing legislation means conduct that is inconsistent with the proper performance of an official's functions. It is subject to investigation and publication of a report by the commission. As there is nothing in the current Bill to mirror this provision, this amendment has been drafted to include a similar provision in the Bill. This will allow investigations which can be currently carried out to continue to be carried out.

This provides that where there has been a complaint made alleging that a contravention of the Act has occurred, and the complaint has not been dismissed or otherwise dealt with, the commissioner will refer the matter to the deputy commissioner for investigation. Subsection (2) provides that the commissioner will also refer a matter to the deputy commissioner for investigation where the commissioner is of the opinion there may have been a contravention of this Act and no complaint has been made, or if, in the commissioner’s opinion, it is in the public interest to have the matter investigated in order for the Act to be complied with and to identify any contravention and the person who committed the act or default concerned. Subsection (3) provides that a reference in this section to a contravention of this Act does not include a reference to a contravention of section 10. The key part of the section is subsection (2) where we are making a major change in the Bill. At present much of the law in this area is reactive, so an investigation can only be made if a complaint is actually made. This subsection means that if the commissioner believes that something has occurred that in his or her judgment is not compliant with the legislation, he or she can delegate to the deputy commissioner that this matter should be investigated.

There would be information shared with the standards commissioners that is not in the public arena and because it is not in the public arena, it will not prompt a complaint.

There are the submissions and also the opportunity of complaint. It is not that I want to curtail the commissioner, but as Deputy Calleary has said, somebody could act because of a vendetta or a wish to harm. The powers are a little too sweeping in my view.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	341	I have a comment also.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	343	Presumably we must follow the paper trail, go back to first principles again on section 36(2)(a), which states, "the matter concerned is one in respect of which no complaint has been made to the Commissioner". The commissioner acts on the basis of a suspected contravention-----
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	344	Yes.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	345	-----but that is on the basis of submissions that have been made where the public official has been through an informal process in engaging with the officials within the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO. It is only after a long period and informal engagement, and a lack of satisfaction on the part of the commissioner, that the commissioner can suggest - not make a finding - that an investigation be opened up. The commissioner's reason would be that he or she believes that the engagement with the public official has been insufficient and that the official has not furnished the commissioner with all the details required. The commissioner would believe that there was potential for material contravention and could then trigger an investigation. As Deputy Calleary has said, there are sufficient checks and balances built in to the process.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	346	I suggest the Deputy goes back to section 35 in this regard. Section 35 lays out the circumstances in which a preliminary inquiry would take place. In the circumstances that the commissioner felt that he or she needed to initiate that step it is extremely likely that a preliminary inquiry would need to take place first. I draw the Deputy's attention to section 35(2). The breadth of what is required would mean that the person who is the subject of the inquiry would have to be informed of what is underway at the preliminary stage. This would allow the person to respond to the commissioner's concerns. I would argue that the preliminary inquiry stage would take care of the concern raised by Deputy D'Arcy. I wish to tease out an additional point with the committee. I gave the example of where something might be in a public official's return that is not in the public arena but which could lead the commissioner to conduct a preliminary investigation or inquiry. What if, however, there is an issue that is not contained in the statement made by the public official to the commissioner? It should be entirely open to the commissioner to say that he or she has received a statement - that for example lays out an asset - and the commissioner has reason to believe that the statement is not accurate. This section provides that the commissioner would have the power to initiate an inquiry in that area.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	347	Is the preliminary inquiry held before it hits the fan, so to speak?

There may be a perfectly reasonable explanation for an omission.

In my experience of dealing with the Standards in Public Office Commission in the past, its first step frequently is to ensure that the statements are accurate and that the officials realise the consequences of what they may have said. I am certain this attitude would not change. The preliminary inquiry could be a meeting to clarify a particular matter or to make sure the public official is aware of his or her requirements. I would not, however, want to understate the significance of what we are discussing. It is a big change. While I may disagree with Deputy D'Arcy, he is pointing to a big departure from where we were in the past. This measure has been called for. At the moment the vast majority of work the Standards in Public Office Commission can initiate is reactive but the proposed legislation provides that if SIPO has reason to believe there is an infringement, it can initiate the inquiry. The checks and balances as addressed in the proposed legislation are covered in section 35. There is scope for the preliminary inquiry to take place first. This would require that the person be notified and at the very least require the person to come in for a discussion.

When it is related to local government and local councillors there is a large range of opportunities for the measures to cause trouble for public representatives who may be caught up innocently in some complaint. This is my difficulty with the proposed legislation.

The Bill has been in circulation for a year. I accept the point made by Deputy Calleary that he believes the amendments could have been circulated earlier. We will ensure that if there are further changes on Report Stage everyone will have them. There have been calls for quite a while for the measures. The Bill has been available for a period of time. I have referred Deputies to section 35 in respect of the preliminary inquiry. I also point to section 34 which gives the commissioner the power to dismiss a complaint. We are being pretty clear about this. If the commissioner believes that a complaint is frivolous, vexatious or repetitious then the commissioner can dismiss it.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	354	The one point here is that the Minister is empowering the deputy commissioner to appoint an investigation officer that shall be appointed for such period as the deputy commissioner may determine, shall be paid such fees and expenses as the deputy commissioner may, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time determine, may resign at any time, shall hold office on such other terms and conditions as the deputy commissioner may from time to time determine, including such terms and conditions as are likely, in the opinion of the deputy commissioner, to secure the officer's independence and impartiality. The Minister is potentially going outside the fold of the Standards in Public Office Commissioner. If I were to be subjective, I would say he is conferring on the deputy commissioner powers to appoint, hire, fire and pay at will. It would be better - the Minister will correct me if I am wrong - to have an in-house investigation staffed and properly resourced rather than putting it out to tender. I assume there would have to be a tender process. If it is not open to a tender process, what other process would it be open to? I fear that the person who could be appointed, although appointed by the sheriff, so to speak, could be a bit of a lone wolf. We cannot speak to the bona fides of that person and, without prescribing this in legislation, we are relying on the discretion of the deputy commissioner. That is a little worry that I have.

I presume this gives the power to the deputy commissioner to appoint a member of staff as opposed to going out on the street.

Let me clarify what we are referring to. It gives the deputy commissioner the power to appoint a member of staff.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	358	I apologise.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	359	I would expect that the overwhelming number of such officers would be members of staff. We are providing for the possibility that something could be the subject of an investigation that the commissioner might feel requires expertise that his or her organisation does not have. As I sit in front of the Deputies, I cannot think of such a circumstance. Something could happen in regard to a matter of accounting, for example, and the commissioner might determine that a forensic accountant is required but such a person might not be available within the organisation. In this case, it would go out to tender. That is what is provided for in this Bill. Again, we have to trust that the commissioner would make a wise decision in appointing such a person to carry out his or her work, as I and, I am sure, colleagues do. I expect that a member of staff will carry out the work most of the time.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	360	The wording is clear. I apologise to the Minister. Section 37(1) states, "one or more members of staff of the Office of the Commissioner may be the subject of such an appointment".
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	361	I accept the explanation on that. Let me outline what concerns me about all this investigation and so on. An investigation will happen because there is a disagreement, misunderstanding or complaint of one kind or another. As one reads down through all this, one notes it is stacked against the member because the member, be he or she a local politician or national politician, is up against it. The first thing is reputational damage. One could be completely innocent. Again, it is a question of striking the balance we are talking about. We are arming an agency of the State with significant powers and money to carry out an investigation. With regard to the preliminary part of this and the opening of the formal investigation, it is very important that there be a completely level playing field in order that, if another investigation is undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it will at least know it found something wrong. A suspected contravention has to be based on the submissions that have been made or the papers that have been returned by the member.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	362	If we do that, we limit the latitude of the commissioner to investigate a matter if he or she deems it needs to be investigated. On reputational damage, such investigations would have to take place privately. Of course the commission would have to talk to people, and other people do talk. That will happen. We have just dealt with a section that made clear that oral hearings will not be the norm. If they were, they might infringe later criminal proceedings. What I am now reflecting on is that if we go back to the earlier section we referred to in regard to preliminary inquiries, we should realise it is the preliminary inquiry stage where these matters can be dealt with. If a matter is raised that turns out to be unwarranted, it will be eliminated in the preliminary inquiry and will not lead to a further inquiry.

I spoke to a person who had an issue – I will not go so far as to say "disagreement" – and the term "come clean" was used on multiple occasions. I am concerned that we will have a Government agency doing good work that is required being pitted against an individual. The agency has the opportunity to go outside its own office for services.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	364	The investigation officer can enter and "search any premises in or at which the officer has reasonable grounds for believing there may be found any document or thing relevant to an investigation being conducted under this Chapter and may seize and remove any document or thing so relevant that he or she finds in or at the premises."

Is this just being practical or is there something else?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	371	The point does not concern the deputy commissioner per se but the principle that the office of the commissioner can now initiate an investigation if it believes there are grounds. Under subsection 37(1), it is made clear that "The Deputy Commissioner shall appoint one or more suitable persons ... to perform the functions expressed by this Chapter ... one or more members of staff of the Office of the Commissioner may be the subject of such an appointment".
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	372	Yes, but what is inherent in the legislation is that the commissioner has the power to appoint a deputy commissioner. Whether or not the investigation officer proceeds by virtue of an appointment internally by the deputy commissioner or the commissioner, the commissioner can still do what is outlined anyway. What is pertinent here is that the legislation provides for entering and searching a premises.For the purposes of the current legislation, we have gone from a position where I, as a public official, will interact with a professional person to ensure that my house is in order and I am compliant with the legislation to one where, if there are sufficient grounds, subject to all the criteria proposed and if all else fails, this power is conferred on them. I am not against those powers being given. I am just trying to get a sense of where the Minister is coming from on that. Deputy Calleary asked if these are new sweeping powers and the motivation for them. Is it to say that we are taking a belt and braces approach to this standards in public office legislation and to have powers that are so sweeping, someone will have no other choice but to be absolutely compliant because failure to be compliant means they will literally have people knocking on their door, which is not necessarily the case at the moment? I am trying to get an understanding of the motivation.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	373	The motivation is that our current legislation in this area is deficient by international best practice standards in terms of the weight of power for the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, being mostly reactive. If we compare where we are currently versus the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal, for example, which called for more powers to be available to these bodies, we are different from other jurisdictions in this regard. I do not see any inconsistency between what the Deputy said, which is the continuation of the work SIPO does in terms of meeting members, explaining their requirements to them and, on occasion, helping them to be compliant while impartially implementing the law, and, as a last resort, giving it the power to initiate an investigation if it has reasonable grounds to believe that a public official is not compliant with the law. I might look at the section before Report Stage with regard to a preliminary investigation because I believe many of Deputy D'Arcy's concerns could be dealt with at the preliminary inquiry stage. For example, if the commissioner forms a view on a matter as a result of a misunderstanding, a misapprehension or a concern that was ultimately found out not to be true, that can be dealt with at the preliminary stage as opposed to it being dealt with by a full inquiry. I want to be clear with colleagues. This is a change in terms of where we are at the moment. I will not understate it. It is a change, but I believe it is a change that is needed.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	374	I accept the changes and the motivation. Would it be possible for a report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, perhaps annually? I do not want to anonymise the efforts but I am referring to a report stating publicly the number of cases that have been investigated or where these powers have been used. In that way we would have a sense of how this new legislation will take shape. Is that a reasonable request?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	375	We have submitted an amendment, which I think we dealt with, requiring that the commissioner lay a report in the Oireachtas Library. We dealt with that earlier this morning. It is section 31. I will consider what the Deputy has said about the detail it would contain but I believe it will end up being a matter for the commissioner. I will give an example of one circumstance I believe we should consider carefully, namely, that the commissioner takes account of the fact that they may have initiated four investigations, for the sake of argument. I would not want Members of the Oireachtas to be in a position where four investigations have been carried and there is a major debate to try to identify the four Members into whom that investigation was carried out.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	376	Okay.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	377	We have laid out the requirement that the commissioner should update the Houses of the Oireachtas Library. Section 31(1) states, "The Commissioner shall, in each year, prepare a report on his or her activities in the previous year, and may prepare such other reports for the Minister (i) as the Minister requests ... or (ii) as, on the Commissioner's own initiative, from time to time as the Commissioner considers appropriate." If we were to go beyond that, I would be concerned that we might lay out information which might, over time, undermine the reputation of people who are subject to the Act.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	16192	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-06 00:00:00	Public Sector Standards Bill 2015: Committee Stage	378	I said "anonymise". I did not say we should publicly name people.

However, something I believe we should reflect on is if we lay down in statute the number of investigations that have taken place, for example, it could have unintended consequences. That is all I am saying. We have changed the Bill to make it clear that the commissioner has to lay a report in the Oireachtas Library or, if he or she believes there is an issue that requires a report, that he or she is able to do it.

He said he believes this is required. The Mahon tribunal has made assertions that there is more to be done on the side of SIPO, but the Mahon tribunal is historical at this stage. In the number of years since SIPO has been in place, and while I do not want to go over the analysis in terms of what was inadequate in 2012, 2013 and 2014, I am questioning the extent to which it is currently inadequate. This is a fairly big change and I believe nobody knows about it.

In response to Deputy Calleary earlier, I committed to writing to local authority representative bodies, for example, to notify them of what is currently before the Oireachtas, which we will do. However, we are debating a point of principle, namely, whether this body should have the ability to initiate an investigation if it believes it is warranted. If the commissioner believes that a matter has been declared, or not declared, he or she has a concern about it, and he or she alone is in possession of that information, should the commissioner have the ability to do something about it? I believe the answer to that question has to be "yes" because if not, we will be back to all of this being driven by the kind of impulse we have currently, much of which is reactive. We can consider before Report Stage Deputy D'Arcy's concern to make sure we do not get to a point where there is the potential for a wave of unnecessary investigations being carried out. I understand his concern. What we might do is look at section 35 on the preliminary inquiry to see if that section could be strengthened to ensure we do not get to the point where investigations or inquiries are carried out on matters that are evidently not required.

I do not believe any of us are against this legislation but we want to make sure that sufficient checks and balances are built into the investigatory powers provisions to ensure that nobody acts in a nefarious fashion to bring somebody down, so to speak, in a malevolent way. We want to make sure that the person who puts his or her name on the ballot paper or the person who is deemed to be a public official has a fair crack of the whip in terms of the way the legislation is crafted. Those are my concerns and, to be frank, I think the Minister has addressed them.

My contention, at present, is that a fair crack of the whip is given, to use the Deputy's own phrase. In the legislation, even when I provide to the committee a table that explains the differences, we are addressing a separate point. The separate point is a point of principle which Deputy D'Arcy is raising legitimately. I accept Deputy D'Arcy's need to raise it. Even if the requirements in many cases for elected members do not change massively, a notable change is the ability of the commissioner to initiate something if he or she feels it is warranted. To address the debate that the committee is having with me, I and my officials will have a look at section 35 to see if there are any potential changes that could be made on Report Stage to ensure the right step is in place to maintain the level playing field that I am anxious to ensure is in place.

On the step from the preliminary report, the emphasis in the legislation is on the ultimate investigation. I am expressing my concern about the suspected contravention. Section 38, in reference to the powers of the deputy commissioner, states, "the purpose of the proceedings concerned that appear to him or her to be reasonable". If we are going in this direction, it must be fairly clear, in the interest of the public official, that he or she is given some chance of explanation. We have that with SIPO at present.

I draw the Chairman's attention to the preliminary inquiry stage, specifically section 35(5) and (6). Subsection (5) states, "Following the completion of a preliminary inquiry ... the authorised official shall prepare a report of the inquiry, outlining his or her opinion in relation to the complaint concerned and the reasons for that opinion and shall furnish the report to the commissioner, the complainant (if any) and the respondent." It lays out, in subsection (6), the ability of the commissioner to dismiss the issue at preliminary inquiry stage. I will have a look at section 35 to see if there is any way in which we could amend this to deal with the concern that is being raised. I will be standing by, and asking for the support of the committee and the Oireachtas on, ensuring the ability of the commissioner to investigate an inquiry and to appoint somebody to do it. I believe there are adequate checks and balances in place, but given the sensitivity of this matter, I will have a look at section 35 and revert back on Report Stage.

Given the discussion we have just had, I have a duty to explain to the committee how the investigative procedure moves forward. Section 39 sets out the requirements of the deputy commissioner in preparing a report of the investigation and furnishing that to the commissioner. Subsection (1) provides that after the completion of an investigation, the deputy commissioner will consider the evidence for the purposes of making a recommendation and prepare a report on the investigation and furnish it to the commissioner. Subsection (2) provides that, within the report, the deputy commissioner shall provide a recommendation to the commissioner as to whether or not a contravention has occurred. Subsection (3) lays out how the commissioner will respond to that. Deputy Sherlock asked earlier about the modality and how it will work. The way it will work is that after the investigation is complete, a report is furnished. The report includes a recommendation and it is then up to the commissioner to decide whether that recommendation requires further action. What I am open to considering is whether the preliminary section of all of this could be changed a little to deal with the concerns that have been raised.

Subsection (1) provides for what is referred to as an "oral hearing procedure" by the commissioner. If, in relation to a recommendation in the investigation report of the deputy commissioner, the commissioner's decision is not to accept the recommendation of the deputy commissioner and he or she does not refer the matter back to the deputy commissioner for further investigation, the commissioner will hold one or more sittings for investigating the matter, at which he or she may receive submissions and evidence. Subsection (2) provides for oral hearings to be held in public or private at the discretion of the commissioner. Subsection (3) provides that a request by the person being investigated for a sitting to be held in public may be accepted or refused by the commissioner. Subsection (4) provides that the commissioner may end or postpone any proceedings by way of the oral hearing procedure. Subsection (5) provides that the commissioner may receive evidence given orally, or by the means specified in subsection (9), or as otherwise directed, including by live video link, a video recording, a sound recording or any other mode of transmission. Subsection (6) provides that a witness who attends before the commissioner to give evidence may be required to give evidence on oath. Subsection (7) provides that the commissioner may administer any oaths necessary for the purposes of the oral hearing procedure. Subsection (8) provides that the commissioner may arrange for the examination of a person anywhere in or outside the State and may receive the evidence of the person taken at the examination in a form determined by the commissioner, and the relevant rules of the court relating to evidence in proceedings of the High Court will apply with any required modifications. Subsection (9) provides that a witness who gives evidence other than by attending in person or by means of a live video link will provide the commissioner with a sworn statement that the evidence was given by him or her voluntarily and is true and accurate. Subsection (10) provides that where the commissioner has received evidence from a witness who is required to provide a sworn statement under subsection (9), the commissioner may request additional information relating to that evidence. Subsection (11) provides that a witness must comply with a request under subsection (10) within the specified period. Subsection (12) provides that the requirements of subsection (9) relating to the provision of a sworn statement also apply to any additional information given under subsection (10). Subsection (13) provides that the steps taken in the conduct of the oral hearing will be determined by the commissioner and will include notifying the complainant and the person who is the subject of the investigation of the date, time and place of a sitting; giving the person being investigated the names of the witnesses who it is intended will give evidence; enabling the person being investigated and the complainant to be present at the relevant sitting and enabling the first-mentioned person to present his or her case; enabling written statements to be admissible; enabling any signature on a document to be taken to be that of the person whose signature it appears to be; the examination and cross-examination of witnesses; and the making of a sufficient record of the proceedings.This will ensure that fair proceedings are afforded to the person being investigated. Subsection (14) provides that on conclusion of the oral hearing, and having considered the evidence given or presented, and any submissions made, the commissioner shall make such findings of fact in respect of the matter the subject of the investigation, as he or she considers appropriate.

The commissioner can make the call on whether a hearing will be held in public or private but if the person whom the hearing is about wishes to have it in public, he or she will have to apply to the commissioner in this regard. The commissioner can decide on that. Is there an appeals process? What is the backup process if the commissioner decides to have a public hearing where the applicant wants a private hearing?

The relevant rules of the court relating to evidence and proceedings of the High Court will apply, with any required modifications.

There is a hearing where people are under oath, documents are privileged, the commissioner decides on costs and then this quasi-judicial hearing will maybe dictate whether there could be a criminal investigation. A criminal investigation does not normally presume guilt but in this circumstance guilt would have been determined before a criminal investigation gets under way.

I did not say one would start. For example, there is a provision later in the Bill about fines being applied in this area, they are referred to as fixed charge notices, but the possibility of that happening is laid out in the Bill. There is also a more likely mechanism where, for example, the standards commissioner would write to the relevant Oireachtas committee and say that in his or her opinion the law has been infringed. It is then up to the relevant Oireachtas committee to make an adjudication on the matter if the member is a Member of the Oireachtas.

Subsection (1) provides for the absolute privilege of documents and reports of the commissioner, deputy commissioner, an authorised official or an investigation officer, wherever published. Statements made at meetings or sittings for inquiries or investigations by the commissioner, deputy commissioner and an authorised official or an investigation officer or an adviser or agent of any of the foregoing will also be absolutely privileged.

That might apply for example in respect of dealing with a matter that does not concern a Member of the Oireachtas, it could be a public official or a member of the Civil Service.
