          <p eId="para_22">These two items are to be taken without debate. However, there is particular interest in them, especially No. 11<i>d</i>, and, given that the protection of literary and artistic works is referred to, many people would think this matter requires further debate. I ask that it be debated under this motion given that the Tara-Skryne valley has been an inspiration for many literary and artistic works. The Government does not seem to appreciate inspiration in the context of art and certainly not in the context of heritage. A debate on this matter is warranted.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_25">While I will not object to it, the original proposal by the Government was for a one hour debate, which meant it expected the House to approve €715 million for every minute of the debate. It is an expression of just how little is contained in all this that the Government wants to conclude it today. Given that we cannot get answers to any questions on the Estimates, we might as well get on with it and wait for the budget to have a real debate on this.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I am opposed to this. I have already made it clear that as a principle we do not want Bills guillotined through the House. However, the Health Bill 2004 deals with one of the most fundamental issues that affects the people and I do not agree it should be guillotined in this way. Every Member of the House from all parties and none should have the opportunity to have his or her say on Second Stage. I oppose the proposal to guillotine Second Stage tomorrow at 3 p.m. If the Dáil is to meet, there should be an Order of Business, which there will not be. The Government proposes to close down this debate which is of critical importance for hundreds of thousands of people. I am opposed to it on that basis.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_32">My party is similarly opposed to the manner of handling a Bill that we are informed is the most significant revamp of the health system in the history of the State. The Government took 18 months to consider it, published it for Members, who received it on Monday last, then went straight into debate on Tuesday. It seems good enough for the Opposition that they are expected to deal with the Bill within 24 hours when the Government took 18 months to address it. We had one hour of debate yesterday and approximately three hours the previous day, yet the Tánaiste proposes that it be guillotined tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">It is one of a number of measures with which the Government has demonstrated contempt for this House. Some Ministers, if the Constitution permitted, would be happy to retire to their offices and make law from there because they know best. They resent coming before the House. Inadequate provision has been provided time out of number by the Government. I greatly regret that the Tánaiste seeks to guillotine tomorrow's debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">Ar dtús báire, tá an Rialtas ag iarraidh dallamullóg a chur ar dhaoine de bharr nach mbeidh aon Riar na hOibre ann amárach. Tá cuma ar an scéal go bhfuil an Dáil ag feidhmiú ach, i ndáiríre, níl sé mar níl ann ach cúpla uair an chloig chun cúrsaí a phlé gan vóta agus gan Riar na hOibre. In effect, it is an excuse for a Dáil day because there is not the normal requirement for an Order of Business. To add insult to injury, the proposal is for the guillotining of the Health Bill which the Tánaiste described as historic and significant, something which is clearly felt by other Members because the second round of speakers has not yet finished and many more Members will offer to speak. If it is seriously thought of as being significant and historic, it should be given more time. The fact that it will result in less accountability than before is all the more reason that time should be provided to debate it to ensure it is not pushed through, accountability removed and a bad situation made worse. If the Bill is guillotined, there will be good grounds for that fear.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">I join with my colleagues in the House in appealing to the Tánaiste to lift the guillotine on the Second Stage debate on the Health Bill. I have no objection to utilising tomorrow as an opportunity to discuss it further on Second Stage but we should allow the debate to be open-ended so that if further Members are offering, it can be resumed next week. That is not beyond the gift of the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">The Bill is important. As I have stated, it is the wrong remedy for the wrong problem at this time. Nevertheless, it is one the Tánaiste has presented to the House and we must deal with it. By guillotining it tomorrow, we are doing neither the Bill nor the wider health service any justice. I appeal to the Tánaiste to remove the guillotine and allow Members to continue to participate in the debate in the coming week. This is not beyond the ability of the Chief Whip and the Whips of the other parties to provide for properly. I hope the Tánaiste will respond positively.</p>

        <heading>Estimates for Public Services 2005:</heading>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_191">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
          <p class="indent_1" title="motionProposal" eId="para_313">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_314">That Dáil Éireann commends the 2005 Estimates for Public Services (Abridged) published by the Minister for Finance on 18 November, 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The Estimates are an important instrument of Government economic and social policy. They set out, on a pre-budget basis, planned spending of €43.5 billion in key social areas such as health and education and in key economic areas such as infrastructure and enterprise promotion. The budget, which I will present next week, will detail the full picture of the Government's economic strategy for 2005 and will contain important provisions in the areas of taxation and spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">Nonetheless the vast bulk of 2005 spending is already provided for in the Estimates before the House today. As such, they are a statement of the public expenditure priorities of the Government. I will elaborate on these priorities and resultant allocations later in my address.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I am acutely conscious that what we are talking about today is the expenditure of €43.5 billion of taxpayers' money. The individuals and businesses that pay the taxes to make this level of expenditure possible require that the Government takes account of their priorities in deciding on how the resources are allocated.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">People look to the Government to invest in areas of real concern to themselves and their families — health, education, social welfare payments and infrastructure are particularly important. It is through the implementation of the correct economic policies and the creation of an efficient and enterprise friendly taxation system that we can provide the funds that help advance these priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Taxpayers also rightly expect that they will get value for money for the expenditure of their taxes. As I will outline later, there has been impressive improvement in public services in recent years and the 2005 Estimates will build on this development. I am, however, determined that Departments and offices will intensify their efforts to ensure the best possible value for money from the very significant funds being provided in the Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The Estimates must also contribute to our general economic and social development. It is the objective of the Government by making the correct decisions in the Estimates to promote sustainable economic growth. In this context we must keep expenditure increases at sustainable levels. Put simply, there must be a close correlation between the growth in revenue and expenditure if we are to avoid excessive borrowing.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">As a result of the international downturn that began in 2001, the Government had to keep a tight rein on public spending in recent years. We have reduced the gap between revenue and public spending growth and managed to consolidate our fiscal position. Managing public spending growth in line with the growth in resources and in a manner sustainable in the medium term remains essential. The Government intends continuing with this general approach so as not to undermine the hard work of recent years, which ensured that we are now better placed than most to take advantage of the current international economic upturn.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">An expenditure spree in buoyant economic circumstances would simply overheat the economy, lead to inflationary pressures and excessive wage demands and cause serious damage to our international competitiveness. Throwing money at problems will not resolve problems either in the short term or on a sustainable basis. Targeted resources and reform in service delivery with everyone working for shared objectives and placing a quality service to our citizens at the centre of our concerns is the best guarantee of an improvement for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">While the world economic outlook is now improving and we are experiencing an economic upturn, our economy will not return to the very high growth rates we saw in the period up to 2001. The consensus among most commentators is that economic growth in 2004 will be about 5%. This is a continuation of last year's positive trend. There are, however. a number of risks to our economic performance next year. These include oil prices, the dollar and a possible weakening of the US economy. A combination of these events could lead to a slowdown in domestic economic activity. However, despite these risks I would say that the economic prospects for 2005 and beyond facing into my first budget as Minister for Finance are fairly positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">The Government's successful management of the public finances and the economy has resulted in a major reduction in the debt burden, with the general Government debt falling from a level close to 100% of GDP in the early 1990s to its current level around 31% of GDP. Similarly the cost of servicing debt has reduced very significantly in terms of the resources available to us. The cost of servicing the national debt in 1990 took up 29% of tax revenue; it is expected to take up in the region of 7% of tax revenue this year. Reducing debt has turned what were debt interest payments into money which is available on an ongoing annual basis for funding real improvements in public service provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">While making significant progress in managing the public finances and reducing the national debt the Government has more than doubled total spending on public services to more than €41 billion between 1997 and 2004. We have managed to do this without recourse to large-scale borrowing and increased taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">Large surpluses enjoyed until 2000 are now replaced with a position much closer to balance. When the downturn came, the general Government surplus of €4.5 billion for 2000 turned into a deficit of €300 million in 2002. This indicates how important it is to prudently manage public services at the top of an economic cycle so that services are not totally disrupted and set back when the downturn sees tax revenues ebb away.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">In 2004, because of higher than expected economic growth and consequent higher tax revenue buoyancy, the budget position is turning out about €2 billion better than had been targeted. However, a significant element —€670 million — of this improvement is due to Revenue special investigation receipts which are once-off in nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">This year, public expenditure is expected to grow by 7.5%. This compares with a projected economic growth rate of 5% and an annual inflation rate of 2.2%. Overall, there is a forecast saving of €150 million on gross spending for 2004. Higher receipts of €100 million across a few Departments will result in a net total forecast saving of €250 million between current and capital. This equates to about 0.4% of the total gross provision in the 2004 Revised Estimates Volume. Of the €150 million saving on gross spending, a saving of €70 million is forecast on current spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">The Exchequer provision for capital expenditure in 2004 was €5.6 billion. When account is taken of €248 million capital carry-over from 2004 to 2005 under the multi-annual capital envelopes announced in budget 2004, there is a small saving on capital of €80 million, €46 million of which will be used to fund current spending on justice and transport. I will return to the subject of capital carry-over later when I deal with investment for 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">We are providing for an increase of €2.5 billion in gross spending on public services in 2005, bringing the total 2005 provision to €43.6 billion. This represents a 6% increase on a pre-budget basis. The Government's approach to formulating the 2005 Estimates has been to allocate resources to priority needs while being consistent with an overall public finance position that promotes sustainable economic and employment growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">We have allocated particular priority to spending on health and education in the pre-budget Estimates. Accordingly we have provided nearly €11 billion for health, an increase of £915 million or 9%, and €7.1 billion for education, an increase of €530 million or 8% on day-to-day spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The Estimates provide an additional €915 million for health. These additional resources will fund improvements in services in all areas, notably 230,000 more people will now have access to free GP services, with new medical cards and a new doctor visit medical card — in total, 1.38 million people will now have access to free GP care; ten wide-ranging actions to improve accident and emergency services, including fully staffed acute medical units in major hospitals; new services for people with disabilities delivered by more than 1,000 new front line professionals to begin implementation of the Disability Bill; all new units in hospitals will be opened with current funding of €50 million; waiting times for patients will be reduced further by €20 million additional funding for the national treatment purchase fund and; and cancer services will continue to be expanded.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">These significant service improvements in 2005 and later years build on the significant improvements already recorded since 1997. The cumulative increase in gross expenditure on health over the period 1997 to 2005 will amount to 205%, representing an extra €7.4 billion. Staffing levels have increased by almost 50% from a base of 66,000 in 1997 to almost 98,000 this year. This has included a significant increase in front line service staff. There is an additional 6,500 nurses, representing 21% of the increase in staff numbers, with further additional staffing increases in the provisions of therapists, dentistry and orthodontic services, medical professionals and social care professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">There has been a concomitant improvement in service delivery with an increase of 30% since 1997 in the number of patients treated in hospitals as inpatient and day care patients. There has also been a reduction in waiting lists with 80% of patients now waiting less than one year, which we will improve upon further, and an increase in the elective surgery rate in public hospitals of 85% between 1995 and 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">The gross education and science allocation will increase by €530 million or 8% to €7.1 billion in 2005. This additional spend will be targeted in particular at the following priorities: promoting the inclusion, participation and achievement in education of people from socio-economically disadvantaged areas and those with special needs; supporting our schools and teachers to ensure that we provide the best learning environment for all children and; building the knowledge society by maximising the social and economic potential of our higher education sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">More specifically, an additional €47.6 million is being provided for measures to alleviate educational disadvantage, bringing to €462 million the total amount being spent on such measures in 2005. This increase in expenditure will facilitate measures to tackle educational disadvantage at all life stages from pre-school through the school system to access to third level education and participation in adult education and adult literacy initiatives. The area of literacy receives a particular focus, with a 40% increase in provision for early literacy programmes and a 35% increase in funding for the schools library service.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">There is an increase of €67 million in the level of provision for those with special needs and disabilities. This brings the 2005 allocation for special needs to €628 million, an increase of 12% over this year. These increased amounts will fund the provision for teachers and special needs assistants, special grants and the funding of dedicated units.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The Estimates also make provision for increases in the school capitation grants at primary and secondary levels. The teachers' pay provision will fund the full year cost of the 700 additional teachers and 700 additional special needs assistants who have been assigned to primary and post-primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">In addition to the promotion of the knowledge society the Estimates provide significant additional funding for research at third level. In this context, the roll-out of broadband ICT facilities in our schools is also a key component of the Government's strategy. A total of €145 million, current and capital funding, has been invested in the schools ICT programme since 1998. Next year will see an increase of 28% in current funding for this programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">Again, the 2005 allocation builds on service expansion in education in recent years. Since 1997 there has been a very significant increase in the numbers of teachers employed in our primary and secondary schools. The provision of educational services for our children with special educational needs has been transformed since 1997. From a base of 400 in 1999 we now have more than 4,000 resource and learning support teachers. In addition, there are almost 6,000 special needs assistants employed in our schools as against a base of fewer than 300 in 1998.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The gross allocation for social and family affairs is €11.4 billion on a pre-budget basis. On budget day I will announce the provision for increases in social welfare payment rates next year. Evidence of the Government's commitment to the needy in society is that we have doubled spending on social welfare since 1997 even though, over the same period, the unemployment rate has fallen from over 10% to less than 5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">The provision of child benefit expenditure, which has been identified as a key mechanism for reducing consistent poverty in Ireland has been supported hugely by the Government. Expenditure on child benefit has increased from under €500 million in 1996 to a pre-budget allocation of €1.8 billion this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">A particular priority for the Government is services for people with disabilities. The 2005 Estimates provide over €2.8 billion for disability specific services. This represents an increase of €290 million or 11% on the 2004 provision, nearly twice the general overall increase in expenditure, on a pre-budget basis, of 6%. Over the period 1997 to 2004, €230 million in additional funding has been provided for the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Furthermore, an additional 1,700 residential places for people with an intellectual disability and almost 3,000 new day places have been provided since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">When the Disability Bill was published, the Government committed itself to the introduction of a multi-annual investment programme for high priority disability support services which would involve both capital and current spending. In budget 2005, I will announce details of the additional current expenditure which the Government will provide in 2006-09 for high priority disability support services and I will include an additional capital allocation for disability services as part of a revised multi-annual capital envelope for 2005-09.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Overseas development aid has been accorded a very high priority by the Government. We are providing an additional €60 million, a 15% increase on the current year's allocation, for ODA. This will bring our contribution to €535 million next year. That represents an increase of 240% since 1997 and is a remarkable achievement when one considers that the equivalent provision in 1997, when we came into office, was only €158 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The gross provision for Exchequer-funded public service pay and pensions is €15.3 billion, an increase of €1 billion or 7% on 2004. The increase makes full provision for the carryover of the first phase of Sustaining Progress, the payment of the final tranche of benchmarking and the increases due in 2005 under the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">In budget 2003, in order to control public service numbers, the Government decided to cap numbers at the existing authorised level and to reduce numbers by 5,000 by the end of 2005. As part of our commitment to address priority areas of service we subsequently agreed some adjustments to the figures for health, education and the Garda Síochána in respect of front-line staff. Outside the health and education sectors, the numbers serving in 2004 indicate that the 2004 targets for a reduction in public service numbers will be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">The Government remains committed to the control of public service numbers given the size of the public service pay and pensions bill as a component of overall Government expenditure. The Government is determined that the full effect of the reduction in numbers will materialise in 2005 and 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">In budget 2004, my predecessor announced the introduction of five-year rolling, multi-annual capital envelopes designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the planning, management and implementation of capital programmes and projects by providing a relatively secure medium-term financial framework. As part of this initiative, Departments were permitted to carry forward to the next year capital savings up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital. This is a highly important innovation because under the old annualised system Departments were faced with a "lose it or use it" situation towards year end. If they took the former option, funds were surrendered to the Exchequer and lost to the investment programme. The latter option had the potential to encourage non-priority investment. The carryover facility will enable much better management of capital programmes and projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">The total amount of capital carryover from 2004 to 2005 is estimated at close to €250 million or 4.5% of the 2004 voted capital allocation. The 2005 pre-budget Exchequer capital allocation in the Abridged Estimates volume is €5.7 billion. When account is taken of the carryover of €250 million, Departments will have on a pre-budget basis some €730 million additional cash for capital spend in 2005, which is 14% higher than this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The 2004 budget five-year envelope provided for total capital investment in 2005 of €6.3 billion, comprising €5.715 billion Exchequer and €585 million PPP funded by annual Exchequer payments. The Exchequer figure included an unallocated reserve of €120 million. On budget day I will announce a revised multi-annual capital envelope for the period 2005-09 and in the process will allocate the €120 million reserve in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">It is now clear that there will be a major shortfall on the 2005 PPP component of the existing envelope. The new five-year envelope for 2005-09 will take into account the cash already available to Departments in 2005, the PPP situation and the overall budgetary situation. It will also include a multi-annual provision for high-priority disability services.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The 2005 Estimates provide an extra €2.5 billion bringing total planned expenditure on services to over €43.5 billion. They allocate significant provision for the key areas of health, education and infrastructure provision while retaining a prudent approach to overall expenditure policy. In conjunction with the measures I will be announcing on budget day, the Estimates focus on areas of concern to the people and will promote economic and social development.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I commend the motion to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_192">
          <from>Mr. R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_355">I congratulate the Minster, Deputy Cowen, on his first presentation of Estimates at the start of a budgetary cycle. While the Minister brings a great deal of political skill to his portfolio, he is continuing to operate failed approaches to the formation of Estimates and budgets. This year's Estimates follow the same pattern that we have become used to, namely a long list of numbers presented without any indicator of the targets that extra spending is supposed to achieve. It has resulted in a crude approach whereby Ministers are judged by the amount of money they succeed in screwing out of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">It is an annual horse-trading exercise that is well past its sell-by date. The focus in the Estimates and the charade of budget day that follows is on incremental change rather than root and branch reform. Yet we need such reform if we want seriously to transform society.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">We constantly hear Ministers referring to how much more they are spending on X, Y or Z, but we never hear about what they are achieving. That is the major shortfall that must be tackled by the Minister if he wants to transform the way we address public spending through budgetary planning. This year's Estimates follow the very same pattern — they are big on talk but low on delivery. The budget will be another disappointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">I cannot let this debate pass without commenting on last year's big budgetary initiative, namely the decentralisation programme. It was nothing more than a crude smash and grab raid on the public service. It was introduced under the budget's veil of secrecy, which meant that no Government memorandum was required, no consultation took place with the bodies or Departments affected, there was no strategic plan to underpin it and no attempt to present a business case for the proposed changes. Not surprisingly, the plan has totally unravelled. Yesterday, we saw that 29 of the 53 locations earmarked for decentralisation have been relegated or, as all the political commentators are saying, effectively abandoned. The Government has backed off, realising that the decentralisation programme was ineffective and not politically popular. The knock-on damage will survive, however, and we will have continuous difficulties in the public service, even in managing the change that is occurring. This is particularly the case with the ceiling on recruitment and promotions. In all previous decentralisation programmes, 50% of staff posts in the new locations were filled either by fresh recruitment or promotion. If that is not done in this case we will see, as was indicated yesterday, unfilled vacancies in Dublin caused by people having left their posts. We will also see shadow workers in Dublin when the organisation to which they are attached has moved, yet they may wish to continue working in the capital. It is a voluntary scheme so they must continue to have the option of remaining in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Decentralisation has been a bitter disappointment. Fewer than half the staff who were supposed to move in the first phase will be relocating from Dublin. In addition, even those who are living in Dublin will predominantly be commuting to Drogheda, Trim and other towns within commuting distance from the capital. The plan has been totally disappointing and, not to put a tooth in it, the decision to introduce a programme in that way, without proper scrutiny or forethought, amounts to an abuse of power.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The Minister is proud that the Government has doubled public spending over the past seven years. I accept that progress has been made in some areas and there is no doubt about that, but the public has a right to expect much more. Take the example of the health sector, where public spending has been trebled. Looking at what any ordinary person would regard as the critical performance indicators of success, we find that fewer people now have access to free primary care. That is not just because some people are wealthier. We are talking about a single person on half the minimum wage who does not qualify for a medical card. That is the threshold that has been set, yet these are not wealthy people who are being denied primary medical care.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Fewer people are attending accident and emergency services than was the case seven years ago but they are doing so amid increasing chaos. If the Minister visits the Mater or Beaumont hospitals any night of the week he will see the situation for himself. Only a tiny increase in hospital capacity was secured. Having trebled the budget, hospital capacity only increased by approximately 6%. While the Minister adverts to the total number of patients in hospitals, he should consider inpatients. The number of inpatients has only increased by 6%. I accept day-care has been a success; it is low cost and has a rapid turnover. However, within the core programme covering the accident and emergency load, people with chronic conditions and people who need inpatient care and long-term care, the performance has been very poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">It is a measure of how low people's expectations have sunk regarding the massive health spending that an announcement by the Tánaiste that she will give access to a GP for free to a married couple surviving on the minimum wage attracts so much attention. Its cost is less than €30 million out of a budget of €10,500 million. This cost will be paid for by additional charges to the users of other health services. This has become the focus of attention in the Estimates and we are supposed to regard this as a wonderful breakthrough. While I agree it is a good idea, it is a very modest improvement.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">Why are we content to see such a tiny impact on the front line from massive health budgets? The Minister boasted about 32,000 extra staff, including 6,500 additional nurses. While he is correct, we should consider what the Comptroller and Auditor General pointed out. He discovered that while the front-line staffing increased by 20%, the administrative staffing increased by 90%, which is lopsided by any measure. Three new health boards were created in the eastern region, which make it more difficult to get service. New layers of management have been introduced, which are not delivering to people at the front end. This is not made up by an Opposition green with envy because we are not in Government; this is the truth. The sooner Ministers face up to this truth, the better our chances of effecting changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I was amazed at the truculent response from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He has little to boast about. Despite the impression given that the main political priority was for additional gardaí on the streets, garda numbers increased by just 8% whereas the numbers in other sections of the justice system increased by 36%, four times the growth in garda numbers. Since the promise of 2,000 additional gardaí, which was a key plank in the 2002 general election campaign, only 81 new gardaí per year have made it on to the streets. Today the Minister has confirmed that no derogation has been given to the Garda in public service numbers and based on the Minister's figures we will see only 92 additional gardaí in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Despite considerably more being spent on the criminal justice system, the detection rate for serious crime has dropped from 44% to 39%; the volume of drugs seizures — one of the SMI priorities — dropped by 43% in real terms; and we have seen an alarming explosion in violent assault and public disorder. While a successful Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform focusing on front end objectives should look to improvements in these matters, instead they are deteriorating.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">The Minister chose to characterise attempts in our document to focus on results and efficiency, and put systems in place to deliver, as a thicket of meddlesome proposals. I remind him of a person of whom I am sure he thinks highly and of whom I also think highly, namely, Professor Niamh Brennan. She described the commitments we should have in respect of accountability for public money. She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_367">It can be argued that the level of accountability Irish taxpayers are entitled to expect is to the same standard as a publicly quoted company (plc)... If plc shareholders do not like the standards of accountability, they can sell their shares and buy into another plc. Irish taxpayers have no such option. One can therefore argue that the standards of accountability owed by the State to its taxpayers are of an even higher standard than a plc's. The money is taxpayers' money, and does not belong to the State or to the public servants who spend the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">One public servant very close to her, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, does not understand or accept the implications of that statement. This is a bitter disappointment from a Minister who should know considerably better and who over the years has showered advice on everyone else as to how they should better do their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">I agree with the Minister in stating that the national infrastructure plan is a crucial element of his budgetary strategy. The National Development Plan 2003-2006 was supposed to mark the start of a sustained and effective assault on our infrastructural deficit. Once again a lack of effective management of this process has resulted in bitter disappointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Again the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General is a good source of information. The roads programme was the central spine of this plan. However, three years into the programme, when the Comptroller and Auditor General assessed its implementation, he discovered that the projected cost was not €7 billion, but had risen by €8.8 billion. It had more than doubled to €15.8 billion and at the last count had gone up to €16.4 billion, which represents a huge overrun against its original estimate. He discovered that only half of the projects would be delivered on time. Even with an additional two years, 30% of the projects would not be delivered on time.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">He considered flagship projects like the Dublin Port tunnel and the south-eastern route, which were likely to come in at more than three times the original estimates. These overruns were not accounted for by inflation, but by serious underestimation of basic cost elements in the programme, which were totally wrong. When the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, was asked about this matter, he said this was the way it was done and regarded it as acceptable to make an estimate and get approval at which time the Government is committed and it does not matter afterwards. That is not good enough for a small open economy depending on such infrastructure. We cannot afford that sort of cavalier attitude to the spending of public money.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">It is clear the delivery of the programme is not being managed in a coherent way around the national spatial strategy, which was to be the core framework to ensure it was a coherent PCP. The Department of Finance has abrogated its responsibility to the overall delivery of a coherent public capital programme that meets the needs of the economy and society. It has failed to ensure that proper and accurate assessments of the costs were carried out at the time of the selection of projects. It has been willing to entirely delegate responsibility to the Departments. While this might be right, we need someone to ride shotgun on the quality of those assessments and the Department of Finance has decided not to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">The Government's own advisory council on competitiveness has put the matter more effectively than I could. While I do not have time to quote it, in essence it stated that the quality of analysis is often seriously defective and it is not the practice to even publish many of the project analyses. Even where analysis is done, it is not clear that the ultimate selection of projects is based on this analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">An unacceptable political "divvying out" of the PCP has evolved and it looks as if that will get worse this year, with big budget day announcements in the area of the public capital programme. This approach results in crass consequences, as we saw with the former Minister for Health and Children, who had more than €450 million worth of health assets lying idle because he had not anticipated the need to have staff to run these facilities, which is not good enough. Before the Department of Finance allows such projects to be approved, it must get a Minister to sign a compliance statement outlining that he or she has made provision that staff will be available to operate such facilities when they become available. This is not a high standard of accountability to demand of Ministers promoting such projects. The Government promised it would maintain its investment in the infrastructural programme at 5% of GNP. Even this element has not been honoured and the target has not been reached since 2002. Last year it fell far short at only 4.4% of GNP, a 20% fall from the figure of 5.4% in 2002. On the basis of the Estimates for capital spending published so far, the shortfall in 2005 in this target will be €750 million, although there will be an envelop to top that up.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">A further element of the infrastructural investment plan, which is in free fall is the public private partnership programme. In 2004 it was to contribute €300 million, rising to €885 million in 2005, with €585 million on ordinary projects and €300 million based on tolls. The Government has admitted this will not be delivered. It stated that private sector participation is crucial but in a way that yields good value for the taxpayer. I support those objectives but it is not happening, something has gone seriously wrong. There was a high level meeting on this subject recently and I hope it was worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The Government has also failed to deliver on its promised strategic national infrastructure Bill, which was to make the planning and delivery process more effective and efficient. Perhaps the same Minister who derides accountability is also holding this up. It now appears that the taxpayer will have to fill in the PPP gap. The public capital programme is springing leaks in many different areas in terms of quality, quantity, project selection and the ability of private capital to come in. It is not good enough to ask the taxpayer to shore them up. There is clearly a need for an urgent review of the quantity, quality and project selection role of private capital. This review must not last for months, like the review of the remaining 29 decentralisation locations, which we will not see this side of an election and may never see.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Let us not underestimate the importance of this challenge. Ireland is a small open economy dependent on foreign investment and international trade. A recent assessment of our public capital infrastructure ranked us second last of 12 countries studied. In critical areas vital to competitiveness we lag behind. We are 15th of 15 in respect of ports; 11th of 12 in respect of motorways; eighth of eight in respect of speed of delivery in the capital city; 14th of 15 in respect of broadband access; 15th of 16 in respect of energy infrastructure and 11th of 15 in respect of investment in telecommunications. We expect that we will continue to attract strong foreign direct investment and build a strong indigenous sector but such infrastructure cannot support that.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">We must get the finger out. There has been far too much latitude with capital spending. If the Minister wants to make his mark and do something worthwhile he should take the ESRI studies seriously. His predecessor regarded the ESRI as eggheads who should not be listened to and thought there was no need for economists in the Department of Finance. The Minister should dust down some of the work the ESRI has done and look at what it has to offer. If he does that for the next year, by the time of next year's Estimates, he will have a proper handle on a public capital programme that is accountable to this House for its delivery and that makes people responsible for delivery on time and within budget, where questions are asked if they fail and there is not just a shrug of the shoulders. If the Minister does that, he will do a good job.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The past eight years were unique. No Government has ever had the flexibility, depth of resources and opportunity to deliver real change in our society. If we look at the people we ought to serve, however, we can see the number of children leaving school early is up, with more not even getting beyond primary school than was the case seven years ago. The numbers on the housing waiting lists are up. People on the average industrial wage now find it impossible to buy a house but they are deemed too wealthy to take part in the shared ownership scheme. Elderly patients looking for long-term care when they can no longer cope at home have to sell their homes to finance that care at the end of their lives, having contributed to the State's success for decades. It is not good enough and we must re-establish a commitment to reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Benchmarking was an opportunity to use the €1.3 billion for public service reform so that performance, reward and accountability were locked in at the heart of the public service but that opportunity was let trickle away. No union was pushed beyond any established position, no package of reform was put on the table but the money was paid. That is not acceptable when we look at public service delivery.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">I congratulate the Minister on his appointment. He has much to deliver. Sadly, however, this year's Estimates are a disappointment because they are a repeat of what we have seen every other year, with no commitment to the root and branch reform needed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_193">
          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_382">I also wish the Minister good luck in his first budget on 1 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">When this Government took office first in 1997 the Book of Estimates provided for a total spend of €20 billion. This year the public budget Estimate is for more than twice that amount. Whatever else it does, this Government knows how to spend. It knows how to tax too, since for the first time in the history of the State, it has obliged a majority of ordinary wage earners to pay tax at the higher rate. This Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government taxes unfairly and spends unwisely. The Minister is well aware of the happy situation for some millionaires who do not have to pay any tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">Rarely in history has so much been spent with so shabby a record of delivery to show for it. What a sad and pathetic sight it is to see the Minister for Education and Science go to the plinth and admit that she will not be able to meet an election promise to reduce class sizes in primary schools. At a time when 584 pupils are sitting in the classes of more than 40 pupils, this represents a shameful and shocking broken promise. In 2004, the Government had a special windfall of close to an extra €1 billion from the Revenue crackdown on offshore accounts but the Minister could not get her act together to use these resources to reduce class sizes.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The Minister for Health and Children is no less pathetic. There is an unexpected €1 billion in the coffers but she turns her back on families who were cut off from medical card eligibility in recent years and can only offer them a half way house, a yellow pack medical card with no right to assistance in the cost of prescribed medicine or outpatient services in hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">Yesterday, we had the collapse of last year's political masterstroke, decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">No amount of spin can hide the fact that the programme, as promised, is now reduced by two thirds and long-fingered into the distant future. Perhaps because it failed to deliver votes in the local and European elections, it is now discarded as another broken promise. I feel sorry for communities in towns such as Nenagh, Mitchelstown, Waterford, Cavan and Monaghan who have been spurned by the Government's failure to have a real programme of regional development and genuine decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">Deputy Cowen, the Minister for Finance, enters the pre-budget week with a Book of Estimates that cannot even set out a proper public capital programme for scrutiny in the House. The Minister acknowledged this in his analysis of the capital situation. Last year we had all the fanfare asserting that the capital programme would be better planned with multi-annual budgets allowing longer-term preparation. In reality, the so-called capital envelopes, as used by this Government have become no more than a petty camouflage to hide the sheer incompetence of different Ministers who could not get their act together to fully use the capital allocated to them in both 2003 and 2004. The composite result of these past two years, as the Minister can see, is a level of capital spend that in real terms is no less than 16% below the 2002 outturn. That is a shocking indictment of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The Minister cannot pretend there is a lesser demand for the investment. The opposite is quite obviously the case from even a cursory analysis of our infrastructure gap and the rising costs of congestion. The inevitable result will be further loss of competitiveness. I am sure the Minister has read the recent World Economic Forum report, which downgrades Ireland's rating for growth competitiveness to 30th place. That is a catastrophic decline in only two years, from the higher place we held in this international league. The stated reasons are all to do with the slow pace of investment under so many headings, all directly due to ministerial incompetence and blunders. This complacency in the management of the capital programme is shortsighted in the extreme. It undermines future capacity to attract inward investment and retain the involvement of companies already located here. It destroys confidence by resuming the wretched approach of "stop and go, boom and bust".</p>
          <p eId="para_390">International investors now looking to Ireland will get these two negative signals. They see a country that has prospered, but whose Government appears incapable of formulating plans to lay down sustainable future prosperity. They see a National Pensions Reserve Fund with close to €11 billion in its coffers, including cash reserves at 30 September of €1. 4 billion, but they do not see plans to invest any of these funds in projects at home, delivering the rate of return a pension programme requires.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">Another year has passed, nearly the fourth since the fund was established, and a further billion or more will be allocated to it, yet the Minister for Finance is still unable to offer the trustees a route to have some of this money invested here in roads and communications networks that can secure a return and cash flow as good as anything that Philip Morris or any other international share can offer. We as a country, have invested from Hong Kong to New York, from Haliburton to Philip Morris, but we cannot invest in public transport in Ireland, such as the inter-connector from Heuston to Connolly stations, and do what every other capital city does, serve the central business districts either by metro or fast train.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">One would be forgiven for believing that the capital needs of the country had diminished. Ministers showed such indifference to meeting their targets and projects which they had set out with such mock heroic flourish when the national development plan was launched, not so long ago. All through 2003 and 2004 the monthly Exchequer returns have shown mounting evidence of problems in the delivery of these projects through the declared under spend in the capital budget column. Month after month Ministers strenuously denied this and insisted that by the year end all would be different and the full allocation used.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I recall being on a radio debate with the then Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, a self-confident person, in the late summer, when he offered categorical assurance that every cent of the capital budget would be spent. I have some knowledge of this area. The PPP process is in tatters. Like the tribunals this complex process is a goldmine for lawyers and accountants, but it slows down delivery to unacceptable levels. I do not know whether the Minister has been shown the diagram on the PPP by his Department since he assumed his present portfolio. Instead of a PPP it looks more like the type of diagram of a WMD that Colin Powell presented to the UN. Ministers are simply not sufficiently competent to be able to get around that.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Just a few weeks are left before the end of the financial year. This Minister, standing like the ancient mariner, in terror of the albatross, can survey the wreck of the national development programme, a grand disarray in the PPP framework and a domestic capital spending programme that is woefully underspent. Money, money everywhere, but not a cent to spend. That is the dilemma the Minister faces next Wednesday. It is a sadder but, hopefully, wiser Minister who must now take stock and see what he may recover from the wreckage by this time next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">This is a dark blot on the record of a Government after seven years in office. However, this record is showing an unconscionable number of dark blots as excuses run out. The Book of Estimates is littered with these dark blots, and it is incomplete and shortsighted. This is a further betrayal of the Fianna Fáil-PD election promises. Obviously, no breach of faith with the electorate is too brazen to contemplate in a Book of Estimates that incorporates the formal abandonment of so many targets from class sizes to medical card eligibility, to ODA funding. It is a further assault on the least well off in our society and in the wider world. It provides for further unfair taxation by stealth on the Irish people through increased cost of health insurance, local charges, higher thresholds for drug refunds and every other heading through which the Minister can covertly dictate charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">All in all it is a recipe for stagnation in the supply of basic public services. Everyone will pay the price of this Book of Estimates. Once again, the Minister has adopted the covert route and chosen taxation by stealth. He has added, yet again, to the long list of charges and fees this Government has ruthlessly increased at every turn. Perhaps Deputy Cowen does not know about Duncan and Mary, who were so beloved of his predecessor as Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, in his many budgets. They featured in the McCreevy era as a typical couple with two children who would benefit from budgetary policies. I hope in this year's budget the Minister will find time to catalogue the other charges he has added to their family budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The cost of inpatient accommodation in hospitals, for example, is up by €10 again to €55. That represents a 35% increase in the two years since the general election. The cost of a visit to an accident and emergency department is up again by €10 to €55. This represents a massive 42% increase since 2002. The drugs payment scheme threshold is up for a fourth time since the Government came to office in 2002. Individuals now have to pay €85 per month for prescription drugs. It means the cost of drugs for those on low incomes is €384 more per year than in 2002. For a person who has a weekly income of €400 after tax and has to pay the drug refund of 5%, that is a good deal of money.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_399">VHI and BUPA bills will inevitably increase following the decision of the Government to increase the cost of private beds by 25%. VHI bills have already risen by 100% since 1997, increases which have received the approval of the Government. The sick and the vulnerable are being made to pay for the increase in the budget for health. Rather than reduce the financial burden on working low income families who are just above the income threshold for the medical card, the Government piles on the increased charges and stealth taxes in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The list goes on with bus and rail fares, gas and ESB bills and TV licences. The myth of a low tax economy is shattered by these massive increases in utility bills. ESB first-time connection charges increased by €200 to €1,128, ESB bills increased by 14% in 2002, 8% in 2003, 6% in 2004 and will rise by a further 9% in the new year. Eircom line rental charges have increased by 6.3%, VAT on fuel increased by 1% in 2003, TV licences have increased by €45 since 2002 to €152, and gas bills are up 9.1% since February 2003 and will rise again by 11%. The point is that these indirect taxes and charges are regressive and take no account of a person's income and how much is required to be paid, instead some are targeted at working families on low incomes and reflect the underlying philosophy of the Government that taxes are only for the little people.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The announcement by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, that the Government has binned the Taoiseach's 2000 promise on overseas development aid at the UN has come as a genuine shock to the Irish people who are rightly renowned for their charity towards the Third World. It must have been evident to everyone in Iveagh House at that time that the rate of growth of the economy would mean that the funds allocated for ODA would be very large when the time came for the Taoiseach's promise to be implemented. Iveagh House has had ten years' experience of dealing with the problem of the expanding gross national product so that it knows how to calculate the figures. There has been adequate time to prepare for the careful spending of the money and to make sensible judgments on some large projects in target countries to spend the funds well with an eye to long-term social and economic development.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">We know the target set for 2015 to guarantee primary education to every child on the planet. In the 20 years since I worked in east Africa, the numbers of children, particularly girls, completing education has fallen in many countries. There are gaps where large-scale investment could be made in teacher training, primary school construction, training for nurses and midwives, primary health care, treatment and eradication of malaria, water supply, road construction, food security and good governance. Therefore, the argument being made in the spin by Iveagh House and by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, that we cannot spend the money is wrong. God knows the list is endless where we could make a difference both through our own programmes and those we could fund with non-governmental organisations and other countries. I am not surprised Deputy O'Donnell is furious at the decision. She was Minister of State when the promise was made and she put much effort into establishing a framework to use the new funds effectively when they became available. I hope the Minister and Taoiseach will recognise the anger this decision has caused. It undermines the strength of a very good aid programme that commands significant resources but which must endure a serious dent in its credibility both at home and in the countries where we sought support in the UN on false pretences.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan, attacks Trócaire and other aid agencies for advocacy. I am proud that Trócaire advocated for an end to apartheid. I am proud that the aid agencies advocated for an end to landmines. That was supported by me and continued by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy David Andrews. I am proud the aid agencies advocate for an end to child labour and I salute them for their advocacy for human rights throughout the world and for seeking to educate three generations of Irish people on global solidarity. They, and other agencies, such as Concern and Oxfam, represent much of the best about modern Ireland. It is cheap of the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, to seek to undermine the work they have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">It is a shocking indictment of the present and former Ministers for Education and Science that the budget allocated to repair school buildings could not be fully used this year. It is just one of many targets that will not be reached in education. I am not surprised that the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, has had to admit failure in the target to reduce class sizes in primary schools. The preparation work had not been done to achieve this, not just in the numbers of qualified teachers that would be needed but also the additional classrooms that would be required in all parts of the country. Throughout the education sector, target dates are slipping or are being quietly abandoned. We had been moving slowly but surely to the goal of more than 90% of children completing the senior cycle in post-primary schools. This has fallen way behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">On the one hand the Government remains committed to free third-level education and insists the issue is off the agenda for now. Through a steady diet of under-resourcing there is a hidden agenda at work to prepare public opinion for a return to fees through a steady drip feed of university heads seeking this source of income to make up for the shortfall imposed by Government policy.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">I accept that and I thank the Minister for remaining so long. Before I leave the education Estimate, I note that €170 million has been set aside for payment to victims of abuse in residential institutions. It is a very large sum and a heading we are likely to see at this magnitude or more for many years to come, thus confirming the fundamental flaws in the rotten deal negotiated in 2002. The total committed spend in this area is now heading for €828 million. This transfer of liability to the State education budget must mean that services for our current generation of schoolgoers will suffer. This sum would go a long way to get an Early Start initiative back on the road, to offer pre-school opportunities and to fund a meals in school service for disadvantaged areas. It was a shabby deal from the word go and this second instalment of the bill leaves a sour taste that does not diminish with time.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">In regard to the Estimates for the Garda and policing, there will be no significant extra Garda numbers next year and it will probably be fewer than 100 extra gardaí. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is wrong in refusing to acknowledge this and provide for community and neighbourhood policing to communities under siege from gangsters, drug traffickers and anti-social behaviour. It devalues us as a people to accept casually the death of criminals in gun feuds. Many of the young men now killing each other were children which a proper community policing system would have dealt with or put behind bars years ago. If the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, thinks that this is the dying sting of the wasp, I have news for him. His predecessor, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Donoghue, boasted that zero tolerance would close down the gangs. That became another broken promise.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Ireland is a rich country and fortunately its debt burden is low enough to allow us to borrow to meet the shortfall in the investment budget. It is beyond belief that the Government is unable to direct the resources of the national pensions reserve fund, particularly the €1.4 billion in cash and near cash assets, to enable the trustees to fulfil their mandate and include investments in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">There is plenty of scope to raise more revenue through a fairer tax system and effective tax collection. The Minister for Finance and his colleagues made the wrong call in choosing tax cuts for the well-off and tax shelters for the really well-off over investment in infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">The great surprise on budget day last year was decentralisation. One does not have to be a genius to realise that the most important part of the Minister for Finance's speech is his acknowledgement of the €1 billion underspend in capital investment, over €0.5 billion of which is attributable to the failure of the PPP process to get off the ground. I do not have to be working in Paddy Power's to know that it is a safe bet that the big story next Wednesday will be the unveiling of a super-capital budget, just as decentralisation was the highlight of last year's budget. Decentralisation fell apart because it bypassed the normal Cabinet process on foot of its being part of the budget process. I hope the Minster commits to significant capital spending next Wednesday, which is very important for everyone, but I hope he will not use the freedom afforded by the budget to bypass the normal Cabinet process to announce with a fanfare capital programmes that have not been costed properly and that will ultimately fall apart like decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">I note the Minister for Foreign Affairs has entered the Chamber. He will remember our sharing a studio with Rodney Rice on "Saturday View" at the end of the summer, at which time the Minister, with his normal confidence, promised that every cent of the capital budget would be spent. The Minister for Finance's script includes an apology for the tatters in the capital budget. The only thing that is saving his blushes is the capacity for the 10% roll-over.</p>

          <p eId="para_424">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_425">To delete all words after ‘‘Dáil Éireann'' and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_426">"notes that the 2005 Estimates for the Public Services (Abridged) published by the Minister for Finance on 18 November 2004:</p>
          <p eId="para_427">—fail to properly address the persistent inequalities in Irish society brought about directly by the policies of the Government;</p>
          <p eId="para_428">—fail to fulfil the Government's pre-election promise to extend medical cards, without qualification and including coverage for medicines, to a further 200,000 people;</p>
          <p eId="para_429">—will further entrench the inequitable two-tier system in our health services;</p>
          <p eId="para_430">—fail to address the need for a comprehensive system of child care;</p>
          <p eId="para_431">—contain totally inadequate provision for local authority housing and for local government funding in general;</p>
          <p eId="para_432">—renege on the commitment of the Taoiseach to the Irish people and to the international community to reach the target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid by 2007;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_433">and therefore calls on the Minister for Finance to withdraw and redraft his Book of Estimates."</p>
          <p eId="para_434">These Estimates cannot be understood without considering their political background. They come in the wake of the Taoiseach's statement that he is a true republican and a true socialist. It may come as a surprise to many people that I have always regarded Fianna Fáil as a Marxist party, but the Marx it follows is not Karl but Groucho, because it was Groucho Marx who once said: "Those are my principles, if you don't like them, I have others." One could not find a better description of Fianna Fáil's populism. It has clearly won the admiration of many in Ireland and overseas for its ability to retain political power and electoral support by being all things to all people. Its eye is constantly on the main chance, it always has to know what way the wind is blowing and, like the politician during the French Revolution, it is always likely to declare, "There go my people. I must find out where they are going so I can lead them."</p>
          <p eId="para_435">After the EU and local elections, we had the carefully choreographed parade to the plinth by the backbenchers to lament Fianna Fáil's worst electoral performance for decades and, of course, to blame the Progressive Democrats. One Fianna Fáil Deputy said the Progressive Democrats would be better called the "Oppressive Democrats". Another said that what was needed was less PD policy. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, said the Government was perceived as right wing.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">That was the first phase in Fianna Fáil's massive public relations exercise to try to regain support. Then we had the long drawn-out Cabinet reshuffle, in which some of those same backbenchers were promoted. The next phase was when the Taoiseach changed his anorak from light blue to light red. The latest phase is the Book of Estimates which the Minister is asking us to approve today. Taken in tandem with the populist statements by the Taoiseach, these Estimates signal the early start of the Fianna Fáil general election campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">I have stated on several occasions since last June that if the electoral success of Sinn Féin and its increased mandate at local government and EU Parliament levels prompted the Government to adopt some progressive measures, that is well and good, and is all the more reason for the people to support Sinn Féin in even greater numbers in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">I have welcomed the long-overdue widening of medical card qualification to a further 30,000 people. However, that is still 170,000 short of what was promised before the general election. There are more than 100,000 fewer people with medical cards than when this Government took office in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">It is very interesting to study the mindset behind the decision to create a GP-only card and to extend it to 200,000 people. That figure was not based on an assessment of needs but was picked for one reason only, so that the Government could approach the next general election claiming it had delivered on its promise to extend the medical card to 200,000 people. This Government loves rhyming off figures. The numbers trip off the Ministers' tongues. The priority was to reach the magic number in the hope that the people would forget that these are devalued medical cards. However, the people are not fools, they know that a medical card that does not cover the cost of medicines is debased coinage. The Government is raising the monthly limit beyond which people can claim back for medicines under the drugs payment scheme. One may get free GP visits but one will pay more for one's medicine.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">It is very significant that the greatest increase in the health Estimate is the 43% rise in spending on the national treatment purchase fund. While this fund has yielded some short-term improvements in waiting times, it is pouring millions of public funds into the already bloated private health business. This will receive an additional €20 million next year. In the meantime, the public system is struggling to cope due to a shortage of nurses and other staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The Government has re-enforced the two-tier nature of the health system and there is nothing in these Estimates or in the Health Bill 2004 to indicate any change in direction. The opposite is the case. Sinn Féin will continue to campaign for an end to health apartheid and for a public system with equal access for all based on need alone. I am also concerned that the allocation for carer's allowance has increased by just 2% and child benefit by 3%. These increases barely keep pace with inflation and offer little hope of the necessary improvements materialising in the budget package on 1 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">I commend the amendment in the name of the Sinn Féin Deputies. It states that these Estimates "fail to properly address the persistent inequalities in Irish society brought about directly by the policies of the Government". They fail to address the vital need for a comprehensive system of child care. They contain totally inadequate provision for local authority housing and for local government funding in general and they renege on the commitment of the Taoiseach to the Irish people and to the international community to reach the target of 0.7% of GNP for overseas development aid by 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">I quote a very interesting passage in the speech made by the Minister when he published these Estimates:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_444">If it is the case that we believe our relative prosperity can be sustained then the Estimates should reflect our ability to spend money on the less well off, the marginalised, the sick, the young, the elderly. This is an important by-product of our economic growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">In other words, the poor and those with special needs will always be with us but we can spend a bit of money on them when times are good. I totally refute that attitude and that approach. The object of the Government's economic management should be to ensure that no one is marginalised, that no one is so less well-off than his fellow citizens that he is below the poverty line. The object of Government policy should be to ensure that the elderly, the young and the disabled are equal citizens and are fully integrated in our society and our economy. That should not be a by-product of economic growth, it should be the purpose and the measure of economic growth and development.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_210">
          <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
          <p eId="para_446">While there may be some superficial improvement in the Estimates, they must be viewed in the context of the past seven budgets of this coalition of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. The past seven budgets left this country a deeply divided society, with inequality greater than in any other country in the developed world, next only to the United States. All seven budgets were driven by right-wing policies that favoured the rich and gave most benefits to the already affluent, while giving least to those most in need. That is not just my analysis of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats budgetary strategy, it is the analysis of the Conference of Religious in Ireland, which after each budget produced a detailed critique of the budgetary measures and their impact on the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">As they are creating greater inequality than anywhere else in the European Union, having been rejected by the majority of people in the local and European elections, and facing disaster in the forthcoming general election in the summer of 2007, there has been a panic move to reposition the Fianna Fáil wing of the Government to create the illusion of a dramatic transformation in Government social policy. It is just an illusion and a devious and cynical ploy to give the perception of a caring Government in a last ditch effort to stave off almost certain disaster at the next general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">That is the context within which we must view the Estimates for 2005. Having squandered the wealth of the Celtic tiger years and created a super rich class, many of whom do not pay tax, having perpetuated a two-tier health service with instant health care for those who can afford it and trolleys in corridors for those who cannot, having ignored the educational needs at pre-school and primary level of the most needy of our children and having demoralised and ignored people with disabilities and their families, the plan now is to give the impression that this new caring Government is prepared to undo the wrongs and injustices of our society. It is an effort to divert attention from the reality of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats alliance, led by the Taoiseach, who were the architects of these wrongs in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">In the context of the years of neglect and surpluses of billions of euro, what is being dished out in these Estimates represent a few extra crumbs from the table. This will not reverse the inequality produced by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, nor will it change our status from being the most unequal society in the European Union. Certainly it will do nothing to justify the assertion of the main individual, who during all that time presided over this inequality, as he farcically describes himself as a socialist. There is no evidence in the Estimates of any strategy, or even intention, to redistribute wealth and create a fairer and more equal society. There is no evidence of a genuine attempt to tackle the huge inequities of the two-tier health and education systems, or the concentrated urban alienation and deprivation that allows crime and drug problems to fester, causing so much public concern and misery. There is nothing here that will bring Ireland's standard of social provision in education and health care even close to average European levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Even the additional €205 million for services for people with disabilities, while no doubt welcome, will only scratch at the surface of the needs that have been built up over the years of humiliation and neglect. I do not think I ever experienced a greater sense of shame for any Government than when I walked with the protesting families on the Navan Road in Dublin, week after week, who, through hurt and frustration, brought their profoundly disabled children out in public protest at the appalling lack of services available to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">The latest gimmick in the Estimates to divert attention from Fianna Fáil, which reneged on so many election promises, is what has quickly been described as the yellow pack medical cards. This is a type of badge for the two-tier health service, further entrenching that two-tier system. There is no evidence of an attempt in the Estimates to produce real change. What is evident is a very crude effort to initiate a re-election strategy. In that context, the poor of the Third World and the Irish emigrant poor in Britain have no chance. Apparently they do not count in electoral terms, therefore, the solemn promise of the Taoiseach given at the United Nations is reneged on. The most that will be given by 2007 is 0.5% of GNP, while out of more than €40 billion in the Estimates, only €8 million will be provided for funding for overseas emigrants instead of the €34 million recommended by the Government's task force. However, we can be certain that, as one commentator said, money will be squandered on the stud farms, horse racing and greyhound fraternity once again while tax breaks available to the super rich are costing the Exchequer more than €8 billion a year. The Government continues to act only in the best interests of the rich.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_452">The exercise on which we are embarking today is verging on futility in the sense that no real assessment of a Book of Estimates that spends close to €50 billion a year can be done in the time allocated to us. Nevertheless, we must point out that the Government is engaging in acts of cynicism in reaction to its electoral difficulties. There is no doubt that the elections in June of this year made many in Government consider the type of society they helped to create since 1997. While the Government has a responsibility to correct the damage many of its policies caused in bringing about the most unequal society outside the United States, there is not a genuine and sincere attempt, apart from the usual knowing nods and winks, to point expenditure in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Lessons have been learned not just from the election results, but from ongoing opinion polls as to the extent of extra funding and the areas which should receive the extra funding. In trying to meet the many levels of demand on public expenditure, the Government continues to fall short. When it reneges on the sincere promises of a relatively wealthy nation to make a commitment to meet our target on overseas development aid, the excuse given is that we are somehow too rich to meet this target and there are other priorities. We heard the Tánaiste say, shamefully, in this House that to make this solemn promise and commitment would somehow affect money that would otherwise go to the disabled. When a Government resorts to that type of cynical argument it must be confronted. The reality is that we are failing to meet such commitments and promises because of other choices such as that the horse and greyhound industries are to receive €69 million this year. Given the degree of support not just in terms of expenditure, but in terms of the Government's priorities, there is a sense that the Government is losing its way despite this attempt at spin economics.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The most dishonest element of the Book of Estimates is the treatment of capital expenditure. The Government has decided to withhold until budget day certain capital funding commitments. It has done so by using capital expenditure to bring about real cuts in important areas of expenditure. There will be less capital expenditure on health and education. There is a treatment of environmental protectionism that verges on environmental vandalism. I note the presence of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. If he examines the funding available for environmental protection, he can take no solace from the Book of Estimates or the Government's priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The Office of Public Works, which has a role in maintaining and providing much of the important social infrastructure in the country, an area in which the Government continues to fail dismally, is seeing its capital allocation cut substantially. Some of the cuts are inexplicable. The budget for flood relief is frozen. Minuscule though it is, the budget for flood remedial works is cut and this was done a couple of weeks after parts of the country experienced historically high levels of flooding, itself the outcome of environmental consequences. These are the priorities of the Government and the direction in which it seems to be leading us.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">The Government can take it as read that when the Minister for Finance makes a number of announcements regarding additional capital expenditure on budget day, we will be adding the figures up. The allocations that have been cut, as announced in the Book of Estimates, are very unlikely to be returned to their 2004 levels or to be increased significantly above them. This is the type of confidence trick the Government has been perpetrating throughout its seven years in office, despite a Book of Estimates that in some areas seeks to ameliorate the effects, in terms of social inequality, of disastrous policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">This is a Government that continues to play catch-up. If the catching up the Government is doing in this Book of Estimates represents the type and timescale within which it is willing to repair the damage it has caused since 1997, it would need to be in office until 2017. We on this side of the House are not prepared to accept more damaging Government policies in that timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">This is a disappointing and, in many regards, modest Book of Estimates to which we should, if this Chamber behaved more democratically and more representative of the people who elected it, give proper and detailed consideration. This is a budgetary policy that, more than usually, does not represent even half the story. We are unlikely on budget day to obtain answers to many outstanding questions. I agree with Deputy Richard Bruton that the theatrics that accompany the publication of the Book of Estimates are farcical and that budget day is increasingly irrelevant at a time when we need more responsive and more all-embracing ways of accounting for this nation's expenditure, how it is done and how it can be done in a more socially equitable way. I have no confidence that this Government will bring that about.</p>

          <from>Mr. D. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_461">My silence in the face of some of the comments I have heard since I came into the House should not be interpreted as acquiescence. When the financial policies of Sinn Féin are examined one can see how off the wall they are in trying to spread resources around. I will take no lectures from Deputies Gregory and Boyle, given their economic policies, particularly those of the Green Party.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">This is the first Estimates debate I have participated in as Minister for Foreign Affairs. I had three key objectives for 2005. These were to achieve a very significant increase in the allocation to overseas development aid, to double the resources to our emigrants abroad and to continue to develop a state of the art passport service and to provide a visa service both of which would reach the highest international standards. I am happy that all three objectives are reflected in the 2005 Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The 2005 Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs consists of two Votes. The Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Conor Lenihan, who will speak later, will focus on the Vote for overseas development assistance. I do not want to anticipate what he will say. Nonetheless, I will say that the allocation in the Estimates is hugely significant. We have allocated €60 million extra this year in addition to €475 million spent last year. Our total ODA commitment in 2005 will reach €535 million when the contributions of other Departments are factored in. This is the highest amount ever allocated in the history of the aid programme and well above the EU average.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">We are committed to increasing Ireland's ODA contribution by an additional €65 million in 2006 and by another €65 million again in 2007. By any standards this is a massive amount. We have gone from a budget of €96 million to ODA in 1997 to €475 million this year and an estimated €665 million by 2007. We will be spending €1.8 billion in total over the next three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Furthermore, and this has been absent from the debate in recent times, Ireland can be very proud of its development aid record. We have a top class programme whose excellence is internationally recognised. We do not link aid to trade, as most of the other countries do. We have been increasing our assistance every year. Our programmes are focused on the poorest and most vulnerable. They are having a positive impact on countless individual lives, in Africa in particular. We will continue these efforts now and into the future, working closely with the NGO community and embracing new groups which are doing great work and deserve our support.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Regarding Vote 28, Deputies will note that the €166 million allocation for 2005 is down slightly on the 2004 allocation. This is due to a special once-off allocation in 2004 for the European Union Presidency. This special allocation is not required in 2005. I take this opportunity, nonetheless, to note that the resources allocated to my Department were well spent. The success of our Presidency has been recognised across the political spectrum in Ireland and we have received huge praise abroad for our achievements. Value for money is, and must remain, the main criterion for evaluating how the taxpayer's money is spent. It is well recognised that, in particular during the Presidency, very great value for money was achieved.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Looking at the allocations for 2005, I am delighted that we will more than double our funding for emigrant services. I cannot agree with any of the sentiments expressed by Deputy Gregory in this respect. We are increasing the allocation in 2005 by more than 100%. As a result of a decision made by the last Government when I was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, what was called the pre-1953 pension was introduced. The current spend on that is €65 million, and approximately 65% of this goes to old age pensioners resident in the UK to top up their British pensions. That is often forgotten when discussing the assistance this Government provides to emigrants resident not only in the UK but across the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The increase for specific emigrant programmes in 2005 is €8.2 million. In addition, my Department has already this year provided an extra €1 million from savings found elsewhere in the budget for these programmes. These substantial and increased allocations, which have been warmly welcomed by those providing emigrant services, reflect in the clearest possible way the strength of the Government's commitment to our emigrant communities. This commitment is both immediate and long term. The figures will be built on progressively over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Overall, funding to emigrant services has grown by 850% since 1997 when this Government came into office. This very substantial increase has been warmly welcomed by both the director of the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants, and the director of the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain. The latter described the increased figure as "an incredible boost for the Irish community in Britain." He went on to state how much of an impact this will make on those organisations working with and on behalf of Irish people living in Britain. I am delighted our increased support has been recognised in such a positive way by the key people on the front line.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">We remain committed to addressing the needs of the Irish abroad, particularly those who are marginalised or at greatest risk of exclusion. The bulk of the money will be allocated to organisations helping vulnerable and marginalised emigrants in Britain. I intend to significantly increase the funding available in the United States and the rest of the world. A dedicated Irish abroad unit was established this year in the Department of Foreign Affairs to co-ordinate the provision of assistance to emigrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">My third objective in 2005 will be to ensure the continued development of our passport and visa services. Before the end of this year we will produce a new machine-readable passport capable of incorporating biometric information. The allocation for next year —€19 million — is aimed at completing the project. The new passport will be produced using the latest technologies. It will be one of the most secure passports in the world and will enable us to meet the highest international standard for travel documentation and make travel easier for our citizens. I have also secured an additional €4 million to develop our visa system to the highest international standards. Underpinning the development of the new passport and visa systems will be the continued upgrading of our telecommunications links. We will continue to invest in new technology to ensure a state-of-the-art passport and visa service across the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">In addition to these three key priorities, there are a number of other priorities. The first is to ensure sufficient information is available on the European constitution. In this regard, a budget of €150,000 has been allocated for information material on the European constitution. While no decision has been made on when a referendum will be held, we expect to publish a White Paper and possibly other information materials in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">We have also focused additional allocations for ongoing administrative costs, which reflect the cost of maintaining 66 offices abroad. These offices co-ordinate our bilateral relations with other states and our relations with multilateral organisations such as the European Union and the United Nations. Due to the significant increase in the numbers of Irish people travelling abroad, the work of our missions has assumed increased importance. I hope to be in a position to announce a number of new missions in the coming months and I will go to Government in the near future in this respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">My Department will continue its work in critical areas, including implementation of the Good Friday Agreement; promoting and protecting Ireland's interests in the European Union and in the United Nations; promoting Ireland's trade, investment and culture; contributing to lasting poverty reduction in the developing world; and protecting the interests of Irish citizens abroad. I am glad to state that the Estimates allocation for my Department for the coming year will enhance the achievement of all these objectives.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. B. O’Keeffe)</from>
          <p eId="para_475">I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, on the publication of the pre-budget Estimates, which provide €2.5 billion of additional funding for public services, bringing gross public expenditure to almost €43.6 billion in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">As Minister of State at the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government, I was pleased with the record net estimate of almost €2.5 billion for my Department. It represents an increase of 6% over the provision for 2004 and is two and a half times the level of expenditure in 1994. It is the largest investment in the history of the State in local government services. Of this, €1.7 billion will be invested in capital funding alone. This capital investment will be focused on improving the quality of life of the nation, namely, the quality of the air we breathe, the purity of the water we drink, the cleanliness of the beaches we swim in, the standards of the houses we live in, the design of the built environment around us and the quality of the roads we drive on as well as our built and natural heritage.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Bringing our waste management costs into line with our European competitors requires that we develop modern integrated waste management systems to deal with our waste. Initiatives to support prevention recycling and the marketing of recyclable products are all supported by the environment fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">After a slow start, the fund, which is financed by the levies on plastic bags and the landfilling of waste, is now being fully spent. Besides generating finance of approximately €42 million per annum for environmental projects the levies have had a direct benefit. This win-win situation has resulted in the following: the slowdown in the generation of municipal waste, which grew by less than 1% in 2002; a 4.5% decrease in 2002 in the amount of waste going to landfill; the acceleration of recycling of municipal waste to almost 21% from 13% in 2001; a 94% decrease in litter arising from plastic bags; the provision of modern recycling centres by local authorities; the funding of the Office of Environmental Enforcement and the provision of local authority enforcement officers, a measure which has real impact on the ground; and the funding of the Race Against Waste campaign, which is about to embark on its next phase. We expect the income from these levies to remain steady in 2005. This will allow us to continue our commitment to assisting local authorities in the roll-out of recycling infrastructure and in developing more effective enforcement, litter initiatives and other worthwhile environmental initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The provision of €434 million for water and wastewater infrastructure will enable us to continue to meet EU and national requirements in regard to the wastewater discharges and water quality standards. Rural drinking water quality is now our key focus of attention, given the recent completion of many larger urban projects within the water services programme — the Cork main drainage scheme in my part of the world is one project I can instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The Department's action plan targets 500 private group schemes for major upgrading by 2006 and we are making good progress towards that target. Some 245 schemes, representing 85% of the target population, are being progressed within bundled design, build and operate projects. Most of the remaining schemes are being connected directly to local authority networks. Finance is fully available for this ambitious programme, which we aim to complete in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">The Department will continue its strong emphasis on the provision of housing. As a result of the policies of the Government and the response of the construction industry, housing is being supplied at an astounding rate. To put the scale of activity in perspective, almost one third of the country's homes will have been built in the period 1997-2004. Despite this, we will always need a well resourced and diverse social housing programme to assist low-income groups. The total Exchequer provision of €1.2 billion in 2005 for social and affordable housing represents an increase of 6% on the record 2004 provision. This will ensure that we will continue to deliver accommodation under the social and affordable housing schemes to in excess of 13,000 households next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">For the first time, a new programme subhead of current expenditure has been introduced to help meet the Department's obligations under the Disability Bill. This subhead will kick-start a multi-annual programme by the Department and local authorities on staff provision and training and the adaptation of information and equipment for special needs. A sum of €5 million has been provided for these purposes in 2005 and this is just one element of total planned Government expenditure of €2.7 billion on providing services for people with disabilities for 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I am pleased the Exchequer contribution to the local government fund has been increased from €453 million this year to €488.585 million in 2005. This funding, which is an increase of almost 8% over last year, together with income from motor tax, will enable realistic increases in general purpose grants to local authorities for next year. Local authorities will be notified shortly of these allocations. The reform of local government structures must now begin to show real improvements. I will expect such improvements in delivery, customer service and efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">I know that county managers and council members are committed to delivering better service. They were the key to the development of the newly introduced service indicators. Delivery on these indicators and on all major programme areas will now be put to the test. The indicators will be a public indication of who is doing well and who is doing badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">In co-operation with our EU colleagues, Ireland is also pressing ahead in implementing the Kyoto Protocol. The protocol has been given a new lease of life recently by Russia's decision to ratify it. Two new subheads are being established to facilitate our obligations. A sum of €1 million is being provided for the costs of Kyoto credits purchased on behalf of the Irish Government. A second new subhead will provide for the costs of Ireland's contribution to the climate change funding mechanism for developing countries. Ireland's total share will amount to €3.25 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">The Department has continued to designate lands for nature conservation in accordance with our obligations under EU directives and the UN convention on biological diversity. Such designations can be contentious, but I am happy that the Department and the farming organisations recently reached agreement on a number of key issues. We have a new scheme for purchase of raised bog plots for which additional funds are being earmarked. There is to be a reduction in the area of farmland designated along rivers, and information to local authorities and elected representatives will explain that designation is not seen as an inflexible constraint on any development.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I am satisfied that the published Estimates will allow my Department to address quality of life issues throughout the country, especially in those areas which are disadvantaged or suffer from deficiencies in infrastructure. The Estimates reflect the Government's commitment to use the wealth generated by a strong economy for the benefit of all the community. I am pleased to commend the Estimates to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_490">The Estimates for public expenditure for 2005 reconfirm that this Government cannot manage many of the building projects it sets out to complete, whether they be road schemes, school buildings or other projects. For 2005, children will continue to be taught in dilapidated and unsuitable classrooms, and there is nothing in these Estimates to change this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_491">We all know of schools in dreadfully poor condition. There are many instances of damp and dilapidated classrooms, ill-equipped toilets and absent physical education facilities. Schools like this exist in every county, but the Government is failing abjectly to replace these buildings with ones that are modern and safe and which meet the educational needs of children. Yet with all these schools, and with all the examples of poor school buildings that can be shown, the Minister for Education and Science did not spend the moneys allocated to her Department for capital purposes last year. Following on the massive underspend on capital projects in 2003, these Estimates show that once again a huge amount was unspent in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_492">In 2003, the Minister for Education and Science underspent on school buildings by over €60 million and this year the capital underspend to date is estimated at around €98 million, bearing in mind that some further money may be spent in November and December. In any event, €50 million has been allocated to be carried over into next year, representing a tenth of the capital budget for this year, and that is the maximum that may be carried over. The underspend is at least €50 million and is anticipated to reach a much higher figure.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Coupled with this huge underspend, cuts are indicated in all divisions of the school building programme. I am aware that a budget announcement is expected with regard to school buildings but, bearing in mind the envelope that seems to be available for capital projects, I do not hold out any hope of hearing great announcements. I hope I will be proved wrong on this matter. I presume that these school buildings cuts in the Estimates are there because the Minister for Finance has lost confidence that the Minister for Education and Science can deliver proper school buildings, even if she has the resources to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">At this stage, the Estimates indicate that for 2005 second level schools building grants are down 3%, institutes of technology and vocational education committees are also down 3% while building, equipment and furnishing of national schools and centres for young offenders are down 2%. If these cuts go ahead, they will further stall the schools building programme. The Minister has indicated that an adjustment to capital envelopes on budget day will throw further light on her allocation for 2005, but what are these Estimates for if not to give a reasonable estimate of expenditure for next year?</p>
          <p eId="para_495">I acknowledge that there is an overall increase for the Department of Education and Science, and the spending increases are welcome, in particular in the provision of assistants for children with special educational needs and in the increased allocation to the National Educational Welfare Board. However, the NEWB has estimated that it needs €6.1 million extra for 2005 so that it can realistically reduce absenteeism, provide a nationwide service and recruit a greater number of educational welfare officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">The NEWB needed a radical improvement in its resources to meet the current level of demand. Currently there is one education welfare officer for every 12,000 students entitled to receive a service from the board, but the international norm is one to three thousand. At the end of June, the board had 10,572 cases on hand, representing an impractical caseload of 167 per officer. Some 84,000 primary and post-primary students under 16 years of age missed 20 days or more during the previous school year. Nine counties do not have an educational welfare officer. I understand an announcement is expected on that matter later today and that the Government backbenchers are preparing their press statements. I do not know what the fuss is about because up to now there have been nine counties without an educational welfare officer, and those who think that a county getting what every other county already has is something to be celebrated should realise it is a basic necessity.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">I am also disappointed at the poor allocation to the national educational psychological service. The small increase indicated will not lead to a significant improvement in the NEPS. Such a significant improvement is badly needed. Research I undertook earlier this year showed that the average waiting time for a NEPS assessment is six and a half months, with a quarter of children waiting for more than nine months. NEPS is a vital service as an individual assessment can be critical. This small increase will not radically improve the waiting time. Access to psychological assessment is an integral part of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act. If children cannot get a NEPS assessment, how will they access assistance that is their right under the Act? It is all based on getting an assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">There are significant difficulties in education today. The number of children failing to make the transition from primary to secondary schooling is growing at an alarming rate, as is those dropping out at second level. No real system is in place to quantify whether the schemes in operation meet the needs of the disadvantaged and it is clear that the appalling rates of literacy difficulties in our schools are not being tackled. The Minister will have to set real targets to ensure that funding allocated in 2005 reaches those who need it most and delivers tangible results. Anyone can spend money but what matters is what one gets from the spend. Increases in spending are welcome, but the resources must be targeted to help the children who need them most as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">In September of this year the OECD review of third level education policy was launched with considerable fanfare but has been ignored in these Estimates. We know that our third level institutions face stiffer competition from abroad than ever before. Coupled with this, a lack of resources hampers the continued development and achievement of our higher education institutions. The Higher Education Authority has confirmed that universities are underfunded and have insufficient reserves. The results of the sharp cuts in funding to third level institutions in 2003 and 2004 cannot be reversed with the paltry increases this year. Core funding to universities in the past two years dropped by almost 15% and an increase of 6% for general current grants to universities and colleges will not reverse the earlier cuts.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">These Estimates show that the bad deal brokered by the Government with the religious orders is costing the taxpayer dearly. Following the increase of €115 million in funding to the Residential Institutions Redress Board for this year, 2005 sees a further of €50 million under this sub-heading. This is a tenth of the overall increase in the Department's budget for 2005 and is a huge sum of money that will not be directed towards any educational purpose.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_219">
          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_501">When one reads the Estimates in isolation, one would be inclined to say that this was not a bad document. However, one cannot read it without looking also at the excellent document, Who Cares, brought forward by Deputy Richard Bruton. It shows that this Government and the previous one have spent public money over many years like an exuberant Waterford hurling fan after a Munster final in Thurles. In many cases money has been wasted.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">Spending has increased by €21 billion since 1997, an increase of 125%. Many Government spokespersons consistently hark back to 1997. This was a different country then and a different time. We are now seven years on. One need only have listened to the report on radio this morning about the disposal of the site in Stillorgan to know how prices and charges have increased over the years. To keep reflecting back to 1997 is totally irrelevant as is putting forward the concept that more money has been spent, so things must have improved, which they clearly have not.</p>
          <p eId="para_503">There is a tremendous amount of waste. When the Comptroller and Auditor General examined the roads programme three years into its implementation, he discovered that the projected cost of completing the projects had risen by an astonishing €8.8 billion, an increase of 126% within three years. The Government is simply coming into the House, throwing out figures and saying it has spent so much and that it is wonderful. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, gave himself a pat on the back for the pre-1953 pension. Given the difference between the estimate the Government put on the cost of that at the time and the final cost, it is not something about which I would crow because it showed serious incompetence on the part of the Government. To a certain degree, its incompetence has been disguised behind the amount of funding available to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_504">Deputy Enright referred to capital funding for education. If memory serves me correctly, €98 million has been underspent and €50 million can be carried forward. The Minister spoke about the concept of use or lose it and that it is great to be able to roll over funding rather than spend it at the last minute on wasted projects. However, based on the above figure, we have reached a stage where many Departments are inefficient or there is a certain laziness and the money has not been spent. There is a gaelscoil in Wicklow town, one in Arklow and a secondary school in Rathdrum, the front of which has been damaged for the past number of years, which could do with this money. Will the Minister for Education and Science consider extending the scheme under which money is given directly to schools which was recommended by my colleague, Deputy English, a couple of years ago? The then Minister initiated a pilot scheme to consider whether to expand the scheme rather than have schools go through this Neolithic process which adds considerably to costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">In regard to decentralisation, I am sorry the agency which was to relocate to Arklow has not materialised. County Wicklow got the crumbs off the table with the relocation of approximately 140 jobs which was not a professional way to approach decentralisation. There are a couple of thousand civil servants living in north-east Wicklow, in particular. If the decentralisation of one of the agencies or Departments had been to Greystones or Wicklow town, it would have meant people would not have had to move house. Instead, Departments and agencies will move to Knock Airport and to Deputy Deenihan's constituency, the far end of County Kerry, which is meritorious in its own right. However, I hope moving the headquarters of Departments will never happen because it would give rise to total inefficiency and it is a crazy plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform received an allocation of €73 million for child care. This Vote was put through a few years ago to assist people to get back into the workforce. A difficulty I have encountered is the planning process. Some people, who have applied for grants and have received provisional approval, have not obtained planning permission because the facility is not in a town and might be in a rural area. People would not look to set up child care facilities in rural areas if there was no demand for them. There should be greater cohesion between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the local authorities and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to facilitate schemes so that this money can be spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">The Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, from Cork spoke about certain aspects of the environment, housing grants and subsidies and I note there has been a reduction from €74 million to €52 million. I understand this is on account of the reduction in the first-time buyer's grant. I assume this funding is aimed at affordable housing. In principle, the concept of affordable housing is fine but in reality, the person paying for his or her house is picking up the shortfall. To my knowledge, none of these houses, which people have acquired through the affordable housing scheme, has been sold. The house buyer buys the house at a reduced rate. In addition, he or she gets a subsidy from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. There is, however, a clawback system in place. Where does this money eventually go? Does it go back to the local authority? For example, somebody could get a grant of €30,000. In addition, there will be the built-in factor whereby he or she will have bought the house at a cheaper rate than those who purchased houses beside it. Who will be the beneficiary of this money? Will it be the local authority? I do not believe it should be because, in effect, the other householders in the estate have subsidised that house to some degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">In the area for which I am responsible, the full budget is less than the increase in health. I would like more to be spent on defence, particularly on aid to the civil power and on our emergency unit. To some degree, we are under threat from terrorists and we should have mechanisms in place to deal with it. Since 11 September 2001, we have done nothing radical and have not provided anywhere near the required funding.</p>

          <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I wish to reflect on the Estimate for arts, sport and tourism, my area of responsibility. I welcome the increase of 19% in grant-in-aid to the Arts Council for 2005. It was called for by the committee and by a number of other sectors. To put it in perspective, various organisations and individuals have applied for grants of over €100 million from the Arts Council which will still have a major difficulty satisfying all those people. This year overall grant aid will be approximately €61 million. A number of arts groups are still reeling from the €5 million reduction in funding in 2003 and have still not recovered from it, so it is really on catch-up time. The Arts Council sought €68 million so, to some extent, it will be disappointed with the funding because it will only help it to meet existing demands and it will be difficult for it to engage in any further creative and developmental work.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">The growth in the arts in this country has been phenomenal. The latent potential for development in Gaeltacht areas, in many rural areas and in several urban areas, especially disadvantaged ones, is not being realised because of a lack of funding. As a result of the CDIS, the ACCESS and the current tourism product development programmes, three major programmes, there has been a proliferation of centres around the country. Unfortunately, many of these centres will close because there is no funding to keep them going from a management and a programme point of view. There is not enough funding available to support these programmes, for example, funding for touring groups which travel around the country with productions, and to keep the centres going. Local people deserve them because they do not have the same opportunities for cultural experiences as those living in Dublin, Cork, Limerick or Galway. There are major issues in the arts area.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">I refer to tourism promotion. The tourism marketing fund grant has been increased by 14% this year, which is welcome. An area of concern is marketing in the United Kingdom, an issue which perhaps may be taken up by the officials. A worrying trend is developing in that there is a significant drop in the number of tourists coming from the United Kingdom. This is not unique to Ireland. France, Germany and other northern European countries are experiencing the same trend. British tourists are attracted to the new EU member states and countries further east. They are also taking the long-haul option. One can travel from Heathrow Airport to many parts of the world for €100. This is a significant concern for our tourism industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Competitiveness is an issue. Whether we like it or not, Ireland is an expensive country to visit. This is an issue which the Government must tackle in next week's budget. It may be too late at this stage but it should be brought to the attention of the officials. Ireland has the highest tax on wine among all the euro zone countries and the second highest tax on beer. We have the second highest VAT rate on hotel accommodation charges, after Germany. The Government is the godfather of what has been called "rip-off Ireland". There are some operators and service providers who overcharge but a significant number of those in the tourism industry are just hanging in there. Many are providing discount prices and will not survive if this trend continues. The Government has an opportunity in the budget to at least reduce the 13.5% VAT rate on hotel accommodation to 12%. There was an expectation two years ago that the rate would be reduced to 10% but that did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">Although it is not outlined in the Estimates, I understand a special allowance will be made to promote women in sport. I welcome this. It obviously comes on the back of the report I produced for the committee on the participation of women in sport.</p>

          <p eId="para_516">The extra €0.5 billion my Department will receive, as indicated in the Estimates, is to be welcomed. It will allow me to make significant advances in many key areas. The aim of my Ministry over the next few years is to focus on the child and ensure that all children can reach their potential. This involves targeting all children, supporting them in their needs, supporting teachers and schools, and involving parents and all other partners in education. The expenditure allocated to my Department for next year amounts to more than €7 billion. This allocation indicates the Government's commitment to education and to the children of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">The extra money will be targeted in four areas. The main area, educational disadvantage, is one which is of concern to everybody. I will allocate an additional €47.6 million to alleviate disadvantage among our children and to ensure children from disadvantaged areas get better opportunities than they may have had before, from pre-school, through primary level, second level, second-chance education, and on to adult literacy and third level. Some €462 million will be spent on such schemes over the coming year. These will involve targeting literacy to ensure that children get the basic education they require, their first chance in the education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Provision of educational services for children with special needs is an issue which concerns everybody in this House. This is an issue which was neglected for many years. In the past, children with special needs were not given the benefit of proper, targeted resources in schools. It is a wonderful development that these children are now recognised and will get their opportunity. Next year alone, my Department will spend €628 million in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">One of the most significant developments is that children with special educational needs are now incorporated into mainstream schools, a policy welcomed by many parents. Such an approach requires extra resources and facilities in schools so that children can reach their potential, teachers can do their jobs professionally and with care and other children can continue to benefit from their experience in the classroom. The Department's special education provision will provide a range of measures to meet those objectives, including extra teachers, extra special needs assistants, special school transport and an expanded provision for the National Council for Special Education.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">Members are aware of the number of special needs assistants employed in our schools. While there were only 300 such seven years ago, there are now 6,000. Special needs assistants work with children with special needs who require a carer with them during the day. This is another indication of the Government's level of commitment in this area. Some 6% of children availing of school transport have special needs and 30% of the budget for this service is used to take those children to their educational facilities. The needs of those with disabilities and children with special educational needs are a priority for the Government and will continue to be. Members of the National Council for Special Education are already working with schools and local communities and liaising with the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Health and Children. This service will be expanded next year and the council will be established on a statutory basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">Schools and teachers, who are of top quality, depend on our support. When the Estimates were published, there was some criticism that more than 50% of my Department's allocation will be used for teachers' pay. If good teachers are not attracted into and retained in the profession, we cannot provide the high-quality education we want for our children. The money we spend on the people who work in the system is money well spent. Equally, teachers require ongoing professional development. Some €22.8 million, a record amount which constitutes an increase of 15%, has been allocated for next year to ensure that teachers receive the in-service training they require to cope with the demands made of them and the changes with which they must cope. The Teaching Council is another way to give recognition to teachers. Voting is ongoing for the council and I encourage all teachers to participate in this process. The budget allocation for the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is increased by 38% for next year to ensure that the curriculum reflects the needs of society and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I recognise the demands faced by schools in terms of heating, insurance and maintenance costs. It is for this reason the Government has increased the capitation grant for all schools. This grant will increase by 10% for primary schools next year, constituting a €12 increase for each child. In post-primary schools, the grant will be increased to €16 per pupil for all schools. There has traditionally been a gap between the voluntary secondary schools and the other second level schools in the sector. It is important to attempt to narrow this gap. That is why this year, on top of the €16 provision which I am giving to all second level schools, I am giving an extra €10 provision for the voluntary secondary schools to recognise and narrow the gap that has existed there. This has been particularly welcomed by the voluntary second level. It is no secret that I come from that sector but that had nothing to do with my allocation of the funding. It was simply to recognise an inequity in the system. What this means in practical terms is that a primary school of 200 pupils will get €27,000 in capitation funding for next year. That will help such schools to meet their day-to-day running costs. On top of that allocation are the various grants that exist. An increase has also been given in the clerical assistance and caretaking grant. Real progress has been made in helping our schools not only with building work but, more importantly, with the people involved in the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">The fourth area targeted in my Estimate is promoting the knowledge society and economy. The allocation to the higher education and research sector will be increased by 8%. We have recognised in recent years the importance of research in the context of the economy to ensure we retain and attract researchers into this country, that we link in with industry and that we establish the best of research institutes here. The allocation for third level research for next year will be increased by 35% to €38.5 million. I recognise those universities which are striving to achieve in this area. I recognise in particular those universities which are reforming and changing to ensure they can meet the needs of society, the Government agenda, international education standards and the demands of the economy. The grants to the universities next year will €670 million. They will get an allocation of an extra €40 million. The institutes of technology grants will be increased to €478 million. On top of that, there is the youth work area, with which my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, deals and to which she will refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">In tackling educational disadvantage, special education provision, in supporting our teachers and schools and in promoting a knowledge society and economy, as a Government, and as Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta, we are targeting the needs of all children in all sectors. I look forward after the budget to being able to add to our current expenditure with significant investment in buildings.</p>

          <p eId="para_525">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the annual Estimates debate. In particular, I welcome the strong emphasis the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has put on spending in health and education, the two areas of major concern that emerged during the election and when canvassing voters in my constituency.

          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_527">It is noteworthy that this is the first time since the terrible events of 11 September 2001 that we have seen signs of recovery and serious increases can be made in public spending. It is noteworthy from the Minister for Finance's contribution, which I was fortunate to witness, that the overall rise in spending was of the order of 7.5%, which is well ahead of the 5% rate of economic growth most forecasters predicted for the economy. It is also ahead of the forecasted inflation figure of 2.2%. It is remarkable to be able to declare in this House that we are increasing spending and focusing such increases in spending on the two areas people have raised publicly in the local and European elections and for a long period before that, namely, health and education. The deficiencies in those services will be addressed in a serious and meaningful way.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">As pointed out by Minister for Finance in his contribution, a €4.5 billion surplus in 2000 turned into a €300 million deficit by 2002. That shows the sheer enormity of the downturn in Exchequer finances. I make that point advisedly because that had a direct impact on spending across Departments, not least in my area of responsibility for overseas aid. The downturn in the Exchequer finances meant that, in effect, we had lost two years of the necessary contributions we would have had to have made were we to have achieved the fabled target of 0.7% of gross national product, GNP. Two years were lost in that process because of the downturn in the Exchequer finances. The good news from the Estimates is that we are now back on track to achieve the target of 0.7% of GNP——</p>

          <p eId="para_530">——in a much more meaningful way than we were before the Estimates process. It is clear we were adrift before the allocations under these Estimates and we are now very much on track.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">There are a few key points about our overseas aid programme that need to be made that have been forgotten by some of the Members opposite and perhaps also by some of the commentators outside this House. Ireland now has the largest allocation to overseas aid in the history of State. This Estimates allocation, covering a three-year timeframe, is the largest single allocation to overseas aid in the history of the State. That is a remarkable achievement and, while I do not boast on my own behalf because I have to negotiate with the Minister, I must pay credit to the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, my Progressive Democrats coalition colleague, who also fought hard to achieve these significant increases that help our overseas aid programme and maintain its international reputation. We should be clear about Ireland's international reputation on overseas aid. Despite the dire warnings and the nonsense spoken by Members across the floor of the House, our reputation in this area is positive and strong. Only five of the 22 richest countries in the world have achieved the target of 0.7% of GNP. We are positioned as the seventh largest donor in the world when calculated on a <i>per capita </i>basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">I acknowledge the presence of Deputy Burton who in her own way as a former Minister of State contributed to this change of attitude in Ireland towards overseas aid. She has worked in the field and has a superb knowledge of this area. We need to acknowledge that this change has occurred and the working through of that has now been given concrete focus through this allocation which is the largest in the history of the State. We will maintain our position as the seventh largest donor. I look forward to the day within my period in politics and certainly within the lifetime of the next Government if not this one of achieving the 0.7% target. I want to make that point clearly.</p>

I made no such attack on Trócaire. I will clarify that in a moment when I finish this clear point I am making. We are making a major contribution to this area. A €1.8 billion package of funding will be allocated over the next three years, which will play out as an increase in allocation of €60 million this year, €65 million next year and €65 million the following year, making a total net increase of €190 million in the resources being allocated to overseas aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The key priority identified to me by all players in the sector, including some Opposition voices was the idea of restoring the multi-annual package. Deputy O'Donnell is not present but she has made huge play of the idea of having a multi-annual commitment over three years ring-fenced. That has now been restored in which I take particular pride. That gives certainty to everybody involved in this area including the non-governmental organisations and Trócaire, to which Deputy Burton referred, to plan the programmes they develop.</p>

When one makes a donation to a charity or an organisation, one should take care to note and carefully examine how much of its resources such a charity allocates to advocacy, administration or communications. That is an important issue about which members of the public are rightly concerned and raise with me on an almost daily basis about all charities, not to mention those involved in the worthy work of Third World relief.

          <p eId="para_560">UNICEF has given a huge welcome to these increases and I regard its response as laudable and responsible. It states, "This ever growing commitment by the Irish Government reflects the growing need for a greater response internationally to escalating humanitarian issues". The response says the commitment reflects Ireland's prosperity as a nation and our "unstinting commitment to supporting developing countries in greatest need". That is what UNICEF says about the allocations. The organisation is not moaning and is not disappointed. It welcomes the allocations.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">I hope everyone will welcome the increases. There is a natural disappointment among people who have become fixated on the 0.7% target and the timeframe. The target remains. The timeframe may have to change but we will get there. This is the first tangible sign of that. We should achieve 0.48% or 0.5% of GDP in 2007. We can increase on that and I am lobbying the Minister for Finance very closely to increase the budget allocation.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">I hope the target he has set can be met. Judging by the Government's record of hitting targets, I will not hold my breath. I am reminded of the decentralisation announcement in the last budget. That was a three card trick by the Minister to cloak over the fact that he did not index link bands and allowances for working people in the run-up to the local and European elections. The trick did not work then and no amount of three card trickery with figures will work now.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">There has been a lack of delivery on timescales which have been set and we have become immune to overruns in budget expenditure. There was an overrun of €8 billion in the infrastructural budget in the national development plan. The Government's manner of doing business is totally incompetent. I applaud the fact that all projects over €20 million must be scrutinised by the National Treasury Management Agency. However, projects are assessed by public benchmarking. What is this woolly notion and what does it mean? That appears to be a matter of opinion. Even though there is a great deal of money in the country we are a long way from getting proper value for the money at our disposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">The Minister for Education and Science referred to several issues dealt with in the Estimate for her Department for 2005. The special needs students in the School of the Holy Spirit were disappointed to learn, during her recent visit to Kilkenny, that the project which it was indicated would commence in 2005 will have to wait for another year. The Minister appeared not to be fully briefed on the band in which the project was. She agreed to put it in a band in which it was already. I hope she will look at that project again in the context of the multi-annual budget for 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">The Government should look again at the back to education and back to work allowances. Resource teachers are telling public representatives there is danger of pupils aged 14, 15 and 16 dropping out of school. We must target resources at those people. The school completion and home school liaison programmes have worked very well but have not received sufficient support.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">I welcome the small schools devolved programme announced in last year's Estimates. However, departmental grants for school extensions meet only 50% of the total cost of projects. Schools must fundraise to generate the other 50% from the local community. Clinstown national school, in my constituency has received a grant for a small extension costing approximately €100,000. The school must raise 50% of that amount from the small rural community. This is not how we should do business. It is another stealth tax on a community who must fund essential educational facilities for the children of the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">The cost of living and our competitiveness is a huge issue. Everyone acknowledges that the 27 stealth taxes imposed on business and consumers in the past two years were a mistake. The National Competitiveness Council has acknowledged that in the past four years there has been a 22% increase in costs in this country compared with our European partners. Unfortunately, rip-off Ireland has emanated from the huge increase in business and consumer costs that are putting pressure on small businesses. The Minister for Finance must ensure in the budget that there is a freeze on charges, fees and indirect taxes. He must avoid increases in VAT, motor tax and a range of other taxes that have fed into the consumer household budget in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Health care, cancer treatment in particular, is crucially important and we need to see much more being done in this area. The cancer strategy, which was parked for a number of years, is slowly beginning to be rolled out. We seek a radiotherapy service for people in the south-east region which was promised by the Taoiseach before the previous general election, yet there is no evidence of it being delivered. Early diagnosis of cancer is fundamental to successful treatment and recovery. If we could have a national screening service for male and female patients over a certain age, it would be a great day's work in identifying the problem and rectifying it early. It is a health prevention measure rather than anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The country's worst national primary road network is in County Kilkenny, and I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware of that. There have been recurring delays in expenditure on national primary and secondary routes and, arising from these Estimates, we do not seem to be advancing any further. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Transport should co-operate to ensure the proposals that have been in gestation for over ten years will come to pass. Compared with other parts of the country, the economic and social development of County Kilkenny will become run down if we do not get proper roads there.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is trying to give us the impression that something will be done about crime by deploying extra gardaí on the streets and in the traffic corps, but it will not happen until 2007 or 2008. That is not the way to police urban areas in particular. People who had no axe to grind about criminality are now becoming concerned about the problem. Resources should be re-deployed to put more gardaí on the beat in every community. Rural Garda stations should be reactivated in addition to urban ones to provide a deterrent so that citizens will be safe.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">As regards the Estimates, the slogan said that a lot had been done, but there is certainly an awful lot more to do. I hope my points will be taken on board by the relevant Ministers.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_587">I listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, discussing overseas aid but I am not surprised to see that the Government has reneged on another promise by cutting back on funding for those agencies. It is no wonder when one considers what the Government did to the poor. Last year, we had the savage 16 cutbacks that affected so many households. We are now told that a review is under way and one of the cuts concerning the widow's payment has been reversed. On budget day, next Wednesday, I hope the other 15 savage cutbacks will also be reversed.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Now that we have a real socialist Taoiseach, I expect to see great things happening next week for the less well-off in society. In recent years, more millionaires have been created in this country than anywhere else in Europe. We have certainly looked after the rich. In fairness to the Progressive Democrats, it does not have many seats but I compliment its members on the way they have delivered in Government. Along with Fianna Fáil, the Progressive Democrats has looked after the builders and the super rich, making them increasingly rich. On top of that, the Government has even been able to organise matters so that the very rich do not have to pay a penny in tax to the State. I compliment the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">Now that the Taoiseach has realised he wants to be a socialist, however, I hope the less well-off will be looked after in the budget. We can all talk about how wonderfully the economy is going but the Government will be judged on how people are treated. There are three categories of people in the country: the super rich who are getting richer; the middle class who are being squeezed by stealth taxes, are under pressure to pay their way and for whom the Government has done nothing; and the poor who have been let down by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The Minister for Finance should pay attention to special educational needs. Recently, I attended a meeting in Castlebar where I listened to the concerns of 70 or 80 parents about autism. I saw their frustration, anger, annoyance and hurt because nothing was being done for them. There is no support or help for them. The Government will be judged next week by those who have disabilities. The new Minister for Education and Science said she will deal with the issue of assistance for special needs, but I am fed up with spin. The Government is not much good when it comes to medical doctoring but it certainly is good at spin doctoring.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Next week's budget presents an opportunity to reintroduce some balance in society. Earlier this week I spoke to a representative of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in my town of Westport. This year I have seen many people coming to my constituency office complaining that they cannot survive on low incomes and have fallen into debt. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul has never had so many people seeking its assistance. Is this the sort of society we want? It is worse than some Third World countries. We are forgetting about our own, including the poor who have been let down by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">During last year's Budget Statement, I saw Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats backbenchers applauding the announcement on decentralisation. Some of the Independent Members also applauded, although they are not really independent and are worse than Fianna Fáil. They vote for Fianna Fáil on every occasion because they think they will shortly get the call to Government when Fianna Fáil gets rid of the Progressive Democrats. The people will make a serious judgment on them in a short time when they are asked to vote for the next Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">We saw what occurred with decentralisation. It was like what happened when Manchester United won the FA Cup final. Government Deputies were clapping for ten or 15 minutes when the former Minister for Finance, Mr. McCreevy, misled the people. Yesterday we saw a new decentralisation list on the Government's website. My county of Mayo was promised decentralisation, with the Office of Public Works relocating to Claremorris and the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to Knock, but nothing has happened. We have now gone into the second league and are in difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">I can predict what will happen in about a year's time, just before the general election. Ministers will arrive to be photographed for the local newspapers and will stand on a site which they will claim is being examined for decentralisation purposes. The spin doctors, photographers and press people will be on the road again before the general election with Ministers saying they will deliver. People have had enough of spin, however, and will not take it any longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">A factory in Ballinrobe has obtained the best value for money that anybody could get. Last year, over €115,000 was paid for the premises which has a 25-year lease, yet nobody has ever occupied it.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">The Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, has responsibility for education. Scoil Raifteirí in Castlebar was built six or seven years ago but, after four years, the Department of Education and Science had to replace the roof, even though it had already cost the taxpayer €1 million. Neither the Minister of State nor her officials have done anything about it. Somebody should have to answer for that and explain why a new school needed a new roof after only four years. The architects cannot take the blame, the Department will not take the blame and neither will the builders. There is something wrong when somebody can invest €1 million in a new school, yet after four years it needs a new roof. It is time for a change in the Department and a change of Government so that people have an opportunity to see some fairness in society.</p>

        <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_269">
          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_597">While I am delighted to have the chance to make a few points on the Estimates, we could do with considerably more time to debate this matter. The Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, said these Estimates were favourable because of the recovery in the Government's fortunes. These good fortunes and the extra money in the hands of the Government have come off the backs of the people, through stealth taxes and increasing costs of living in recent years. While this is not all the Government's fault it has happened and is a fact of life. While the Government claims to be giving back €2.6 billion this year, we saved €2 billion last year against what we had planned to spend. We are not doing anything great and are just balancing the books. People who were hurt last year might get a little bit extra this year, although I am not convinced they will.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">While the Estimates show a 6% increase overall, most areas such as salaries etc. are increasing by at least 5% and in some cases 8%, 13% or even 19%. The 6% increase will be swallowed up fairly quickly when increased salaries are factored in. Many young people are saying to me that it is a bit like "I'm a Celebrity, Get me Out of Here". While they may not be celebrities they want to get out of here and go to another country, to Australia or America where they believe they can get a better quality of life for considerably less money. We are letting them down. We must give people the chance to live here and have a quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">Some Deputies suggested we have done very well in providing housing. While we are providing housing, houses cost an absolute fortune. People are now getting 40-year mortgages, never mind 20-year mortgages, which will be a noose around their necks for the rest of their lives. We are not making great progress and need to make improvements in many areas. These Estimates attempt to make improvements in some important areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, Deputy Ardagh, might be able to help me with the next matter. An additional €55 million was announced to provide for the recruitment of new gardaí. From what I can make out this €55 million has been spread across the entire Garda budget and not just for new gardaí. While we may be wrong, the Fine Gael figures suggest we would be lucky to get an extra 100 gardaí this year. Allowing for pay increases of approximately 5%, we reckon we will see fewer than 100 additional gardaí. I do not like the spin that refers to 1,000 gardaí, which is not true.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The Garda has been given a 2% increase in funding for equipment, which is a shame. Gardaí are chasing criminals and so-called joyriders in family cars such as the Toyota Avensis. With the potential of being rammed, these cars do not represent the appropriate equipment for the Garda. Gardaí in my area have to beg and queue up to get protective gear, which is not good enough. The walkie-talkie equipment is 25 years out of date, yet we are spending €37 million on prisons. I would like to see more money spent on the prevention of crime, which could reduce what we spend on criminals. The linkage programme dealing with ex-offenders does great work. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently presented the programme's annual report and I hope that programme will be given additional funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">I compliment the Government on increasing the allocation of money to address the problem of drugs. I hope this will be spent wisely and the regional task forces are given the money they need. A very good plan has been prepared in the north-eastern area and I hope it is funded. While I welcome the increases in funding to youth services, we cannot be overjoyed. We have missed out for a few years and are coming from behind. I hope the money will be well spent on youth services, youth workers and youth facilities. We need to provide not just sports facilities like swimming pools, gyms etc. but also clubs, dance halls and non-alcoholic bars. We need either to fund such facilities or at least encourage their building on behalf of young people. We have considerable work to do in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">The new yellow-pack medical cards are a bit like a bath tub without a plug, which simply will not function. A person will not be cured by simply going to a doctor who diagnoses what is wrong. It represents a start but does not go the whole way. It is a shame we cannot go the rest of the way as was promised when the Government committed to giving an additional 200,000 medical cards. Since that promise almost 100,000 people have lost medical cards so there will be 270,000 fewer medical cards, which is a great shame.</p>

          <from>Mr. P. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_606">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Estimates at a time when a renewed debate is taking place on the most appropriate economic fiscal and budgetary strategy for the future of the country. I compliment the Minister on his first Abridged Estimates, in which he has shown a commendable balance and focus. I will start by talking about the context in which the Estimates have been produced. By any objective analysis or EU comparison, the increase in public spending in these Estimates is very significant, coming as it does on top of a very high level of existing expenditure. The challenge now is clearly to ensure the large increases translate into real and tangible results and improvements for people on the ground. The question in this debate is how best to do that. The best way to do this is to focus the additional financial resources in any given year into targeted and focused areas. For this reason I commend the way in which the Minister has given his attention, and diverted his resources, energy and money into the key areas of health and education with special emphasis on people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">These Estimates are predicated on a strong, vibrant and growing economy, something that has not yet been acknowledged in this debate. The first aim in framing the Estimates is to make sure they do not contain anything that would adversely affect growth in the economy. Too much spending simply stores up problems in the future by creating inflationary pressures in the economy affecting competitiveness. Too little spending results in not diverting funds to those in need. Getting the balance right is the job of the Minister for Finance, and I believe the Minister has struck the right balance on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">No matter how well the finances are managed and regardless of how well the economic downturn has been handled in recent years, a number of factors are outside our control. I echo what I said in the debate this time last year. The biggest threat to our economic growth and prosperity in coming years are the twin US deficits, which are burgeoning out of control. Recent US economic history has been fairly predictable in that it has seen huge growth on the current and capital side, usually to finance some foreign adventure, followed by a short and sharp correction, which has permeated throughout the world causing a serious economic downturn in subsequent years. We cannot ignore this threat of which the Minister is conscious.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The health, education and disability sectors are the big beneficiaries in these Estimates. Nobody should be left in doubt that the Minister has concentrated hugely on these areas as he did when he was Minister for Health and Children some years ago. Those working in the disability sector, the service providers, professionals, clients, parents and friends should be left in no doubt that in the Department of Finance they have a true supporter in office. If anything the significant additional resources in the disability sector illustrate that it is not possible to consider the Disability Bill in a vacuum as many critics have done. It can only be appreciated in the context of the huge additional resources in these Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Having the most liberal, far-reaching, catch-all and free-for-all disability legislation in the world would mean nothing without having the significant additional resources to match it. For that reason I welcome the additional €290 given to this sector in the Estimates, which will provide 270 additional residential places, 90 respite places, 400 new day places — the disability campaigners in Limerick will very much welcome the funding in that area — 60 new places for significant disabilities and 200,000 additional hours of home support and personal assistance. All this will provide real improvements for people.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">From the recent presentations made to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, Deputy Ardagh will be aware of criticisms of the Disability Bill, in particular section 7(5). Those who have criticised the Bill should reflect on the error of their position in the context of these Estimates. In an era of hugely increased resources in the disability sector in the context of these Estimates, section 7 of the Disability Bill, and the Bill as a whole, provides the most effective way to deliver services to people and no one should doubt the Minister's resolve in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">I commend the Estimates to the House.</p>

          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_613">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Estimates and congratulate the Minister for Finance on introducing his first Book of Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The increase in Government spending to almost €43.5 billion in 2005 is welcome. That this can be achieved with the historically low levels of taxation in place is a tribute to the policies of this Government. There are more people in work, very low levels of unemployment and a booming economy, all of which contributes to the record amounts of money available for the Estimates this year. There is no doubt that the State is thriving. Report after report shows that we are fast becoming one of the richest countries in the developed world.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">It is obvious that there are some people in Ireland who have not benefited to the same extent as others. Certain aspects of service delivery on behalf of the State must be improved. Health care is an area that springs to mind. Despite record levels of investment in health in the past seven years, there are still problems. I warmly welcome the announcement that an extra €1 billion will be spent on the health services this year, bringing the total spend on health close to €11 billion, a quarter of the amount that the State will spend in 2005, a clear indication of the priorities of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">The follow up announcement by the Tánaiste that she will increase the number of medical cards is welcome. An extra 230,000 new cards will be issued during 2005, with 200,000 of these being doctor only cards. Every Deputy has received representations in the past year from people looking for a medical card. In many cases, they were just over the financial limit and in some cases had to postpone bringing their children to see a doctor because of the cost involved. Many of these people are on a tight domestic budget. The idea that anyone in this State would be unable to seek medical help while ill because of financial constraints is wrong. I congratulate the Minister for her recognition of the plight of such people and these extra 200,000 medical cards will be most welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Some Members have referred to these cards in a most derogatory fashion. That is an insult to the members of the public who will get them and who will warmly welcome them. No longer will parents with young children have to worry about cost if a child becomes ill.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">There are also record increases in spending in education. There will be €500 million extra for the Department of Education and Science next year. The Minister for Education and Science has clearly indicated that this money will be spent on all sectors, primary, secondary and tertiary. She will target deprivation and disability as areas that need special attention, a welcome move.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">The mark of any country is how it treats those on the margins of society, the less well off, the sick, the old and other vulnerable groups who need special attention. The increases in the health and education budgets in 2005, show this Government is committed to looking after these groups. The label attached to this programme, be it left of centre or socialism, is immaterial, the fact that this is being done is the important thing. The Minister for Finance has managed the finances of the State in a prudent way. He has indicated that this Government will look after all citizens equally. That is the real story of these Estimates and I commend them to the House.</p>

I have no doubt the results of the next general election, as a result of the programme for Government and targeting of the Estimates, along with the adjustments that will be made in the budget, will be the re-election of a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government in 2007.</p>

Clearly it is not enough and that is what the disability sector was concerned about. One may have all the day places one likes, but if the other services are not in place to cater for people's needs in terms of the various types of therapies necessary, then one is going nowhere. Multi-annual funding is fine, but if it is not rights based, it can be withdrawn or stopped at any stage depending on the whim of the incumbent Minister or on how the Government views it. It is a joke to maintain that multi-annual funding is what it is about. That is not what it is about. Neither do I believe there is anyone on the Government side of the House who is convinced that is how it should be.

          <p eId="para_683">——and the other 40 being investigated. Let me say something about those in employment who are trying desperately hard. Recently I organised a social welfare appeal for a young woman who is on her own and has one son who is not a baby. She is one of those who decided the State should not provide for her all the time, that she should go out to work, which she did with great difficulty. If one is on one's own with a child, there is little support and less sympathy. Because her income exceeded €293 per week — I have seen people spend this amount on a night out — she lost her lone parent allowance of €35 per week. She mistook the limit for net instead of gross income. She kept her income below the net amount but it was the gross figure in which the Department was interested. She now owes in the region of €18,000 which she is expected to pay back out of a sum of €310 per week. She must keep a roof over her head and that of her son. Santa Claus will be coming at Christmas but only at great cost. That is the type of person at work about whom the Deputy is talking. There is no prosperity circle.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_700">There was devastating news yesterday for the Waterford constituency. Some 300 civil servants were to be decentralised from the Department of Finance — Ordnance Survey Ireland — to Dungarvan but that will not happen now. We know this following the statement by the Minister for Finance. While Dungarvan continues to develop, the 300 civil servants would have made a major contribution to the status and prosperity of the town. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has betrayed and misled the people of Dungarvan. While the effect on their morale will be huge, we in Waterford must continue to fight in order that this betrayal will not have a lasting effect. It will take more than the bad faith of the Government to break the spirit of the people of Dungarvan.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The effect on the city of Waterford will be equally damaging. The decentralisation of 200 civil servants from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government would have gone some way towards providing the city with its just share of decentralised civil servants. The correct decision would have been to decentralise what was left of the Land Registry to Waterford where the Land Registry already has an office. There were indications from Fianna Fáil that what was left of the Land Registry would be decentralised to Waterford and that part of the Office of Public Works would be decentralised to Dungarvan before the McCreevy package was announced.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">Today the constituency of Waterford is empty handed following the two thirds reduction in the number of civil servants to be decentralised under the McCreevy programme. The reality is that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, with its false promises, has betrayed and misled the people but Waterford is not the only location that has suffered this devastating blow. Other towns such as Cavan, Mitchelstown, Monaghan and Nenagh have suffered in a similar fashion. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has once again bitten off more than it can chew. Those it has betrayed are the victims of the cynical and bungling actions of a truly discredited Government but the fight goes on. Where is the national spatial strategy and the concept of balanced regional development in regard to decentralisation?</p>
          <p eId="para_703">I will address the Estimate pertaining to my brief — community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs — and particularly the issue of the Irish language and the Gaeltacht. This is the year in which the Official Languages Act 2003 began its journey towards full implementation. The office of the Official Languages Commissioner is to receive an additional €200,000 in 2005. While this represents a 40% increase over the €500,000 provided this year, I can find no additional provision in the Vote for the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs or that for any other Department. I find this baffling and it must be considered in the context of the Minister's failure to produce an estimate of the full cost of implementing the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, attended a covert meeting with the Irish language organisations in Spiddal, County Galway, last year. Neither the Irish language nor English language press were allowed to attend. The Minister who is a member of this Government of openness, accountability and transparency made comments at that meeting that were certainly of dubious commitment to the democratic process. He is reported as having told Irish language organisations that they were lucky nobody had shown interest in the Official Languages Act outside the Irish language media. He stated that the organisations were better off that the English speakers of Ireland had not heard about the Bill. Furthermore, he stated that, had they known about it, there would have been a good chance that it would not have passed through the Houses successfully. If these comments which I have translated from Irish accurately reflect his views on the democratic and legislative process, they seriously call into question his suitability to hold ministerial office. During my Second Stage speech on the Official Languages Bill, I expressed specific concerns that only a small minority knew about or were really interested in the Bill. I stated that unless and until the community at large took ownership of the Irish language, in a manner free of elitism and fanaticism, the prospect of halting the decline in the use of the language was scant.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">I have serious concerns regarding the cost of putting the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003 into effect. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs recently indicated that fewer than ten jobs would be created as a result of its implementation although he stated in July 2003 that a dividend of almost 2,000 posts for the Irish language community would be one of the main results of its implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The Book of Estimates gives us little or no indication of what it will cost in 2005 to implement the Official Languages Act 2003. I have tabled a series of parliamentary questions, for answer today, seeking this information. We do not have sufficient information to conclude whether the implications of the provisions of the Act represent value for money for the taxpayer or whether the money being spent on its implementation represents the best way to spend money on the Irish language. I call on the Minister for Finance to clarify his position and state whether he intends to make further announcements in this regard in his Budget Statement next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">A certain clause that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs added to the Irish Languages Bill during its consideration will have very significant implications for the cost of its implementation. The Bill originally provided that, if a person was not satisfied with a decision of the Official Languages Commissioner, that person could not go to court to contest that decision. However, the Minister buckled under pressure and included a clause that allows those who are not satisfied with a decision of the commissioner to contest that decision in court. This is at variance with the position regarding decisions of the Ombudsman. In many ways, the Official Languages Commissioner will be an ombudsman for the Irish language. I stated when considering the Bill that I recognised the danger of its becoming a crank's charter. I am still afraid this might happen and that money might be wasted.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">The Minister has been so unclear about the Act and the estimated cost of its implementation that I really worry about what is to happen. His failure to provide the necessary information and his being covert in his actions will only do damage to the Irish language.</p>

          <from>Miss de Valera</from>
          <p eId="para_711">I will concentrate on the two areas for which I have responsibility, namely, further and adult education and the youth sector. I am very glad to take part in this debate on the Estimates because the expenditure on further and adult education will rise to approximately €138 million in 2005, representing an increase of €10 million, or nearly 8%, over the provision for 2004. It will provide for an expansion of existing services in the sector in the coming year. An additional sum of more than €50 million will be paid on staff salaries and FETAC, Youthreach and senior Traveller training centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The increases provided in the 2005 Estimates include an additional €2.5 million for adult literacy. This will allow increased funding for the VECs in 2005 to support the development of adult literacy services. In addition to ensuring literacy services for up to 30,000 adults, I will provide funding for the VECs to implement a framework to assist learners and tutors in summarising and recording learners' progress regarding their literacy and numeracy skills in different areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The framework, developed by the National Adult Literacy Agency and piloted in a number of VEC literacy schemes, aims to allow participants to measure their improvement and give feedback on course content and enables the tutors to be flexible in adapting course content to the individual learners' needs. The framework provides for individual learning plans to be developed based on the requirements of the participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">During 2005, I will continue to place emphasis on new and innovative ways to promote literacy and numeracy. It is important that the adult literacy provision continues to be developed in a structured and consistent way. My Department continues to act on the recommendations of the White Paper regarding staffing structures and training and stresses the desirability of appropriate qualifications for paid literacy practitioners while providing enhanced training for the 5,000 volunteers whose contribution to adult literacy continues to be absolutely essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">While we are correct to highlight the additional numbers of clients that can access adult literacy provision, we need to develop mechanisms to show how these clients benefit from their participation. Methods of assessment that are productive and do not intimidate clients need to be developed. Clients want awards with the currency of FETAC qualifications and we must work towards this goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">There will be an increase of 7.2% in the funding for the expansion of the part-time options under the BTEI in 2005. Everyone in this House will greet this in a very positive way because it will give so many people an opportunity to avail of second-chance education. The number of BTEI part-time training places will increase by approximately 1,000 to 7,000, catering for access of 10,000 participants. Increases in this regard have been made since 1997. The initiative has been particularly successful in attracting a variety of adult participants and offering a great selection of FETAC courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">In 2005 an extra €2 million will be provided for services for trainees with special needs in Youthreach and senior Traveller training programmes. These services will enhance the existing guidance and counselling measures that have been in place since 1998. Provision will be made for extra tutor resources, educational assessments and plans and adaptive technology, depending on the particular needs involved. It is important to give this new provision to special needs, Youthreach and the senior Traveller training programmes. I am pleased to announce that new and extra provision. The provision for pooling resources to ensure shared access to professional, counselling and psychological services for each centre is important and practical.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">I am pleased to announce the allocation of an extra €800,000 for the roll-out of phase 4 of the adult education guidance initiative. Perhaps I will be forgiven for having a particular interest in guidance counselling, given that I trained as a guidance counsellor and recognise the importance of guidance and the need to let clients know of the likely progression they can follow. Some 24 projects are up and running successfully and, as a result of the 2005 Estimates, a further ten areas, currently without such a service, will be included.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Expenditure for child care services, Youthreach, travel and VTOS programmes will increase by 7.3% in 2005. Overall, it is estimated that 2,250 children participating in these programmes will be catered for in 2005. I have responsibility for the youth sector and I am pleased to announce that there has been an 18% increase in the allocation for youth services in 2005, bringing funding for the youth sector to almost €34 million. The commitment to an 18% increase indicates that the Government is putting emphasis on helping young people, particularly the disadvantaged. I look forward to a further roll-out of the provisions of the youth work grants in 2001, the expansion of special projects for the disadvantaged youth scheme, a review, upgrading and expansion of youth information centre networks, a funding review of youth work, an expansion of the national child protection training programme for those involved in the youth sector and increased grants for the major national and regional youth work organisations, funded under the youth service grant scheme and other schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">I could continue at length but suffice to say I wish to thank all those youth organisations who put on record their thanks and welcome for the 18% increase in funding for the youth sector. I thank all those who passed on congratulations to the Government through the Department of Education and Science for its commitment to youth, adult and further education.</p>

        <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_351">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_721">I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the Estimates debate, particularly as Minister of State at the Department of Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">There are many good things happening in our communities and Fianna Fáil is delivering on its promises, particularly in regard to infrastructural investment. The Government's commitment to transport cannot be denied. I am pleased to inform the House that I am determined to continue to develop services and that we cannot be complacent about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">In the restricted time available, I will concentrate on a few issues. I am working on and making progress with traffic management in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford. The promotion of public transport is central to easing congestion. A key element of this is the delivery of quality bus corridors and additional buses. It is vital that our nation's capital, Dublin, a city I am proud to represent, has in place an efficient public transport system that allows industry to prosper, tourism to develop and people to commute in the shortest possible time.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The Estimates published recently allocated €40 million for traffic management grant schemes in 2005. This funding will be used mainly to improve the traffic position in the greater Dublin area. A considerable amount of work is already taking place in the area of traffic management. The main focus of the scheme is on bus priority measures, as well as enhanced park and ride measures and improved interchange facilities between bus and rail. Funding is also provided for cycle routes, pedestrian routes, environmental traffic cells, facilities for people with disabilities, computerised traffic signal control systems and travel, and parking information, integrated land use and transport framework plans and regional transport projects and studies.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">The QBCs are making a significant contribution in terms of greater patronage and increased speeds. For example, bus patronage increased by more than 60% and bus speeds by 14% during peak hours. In short, QBCs have proved very successful in the past seven years, with fewer cars on roads, more buses and bus passengers on the QBC routes. A key element for easing congestion in the greater Dublin area is the delivery of quality bus corridors, further QBC roll-out and the development of super QBCs as a priority. The smart card is due for further roll-out and will prove highly beneficial. Park and ride policy measures will also be advanced with improved interchange facilities between bus and rail.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">There are those who suggest that Dublin's transport problems could be solved by a congestion charge such as those introduced in London. It is my view that such charges should only be considered when commuters have a choice of public transport systems and road networks that meet their demands and-or use of their private vehicles. We still have a long road to travel before we can have such an evaluation. In short, a congestion charge is not on at present. My aim is to provide commuters with choice which should include a Dublin metro system.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I also hold strong views on accessibility to public transport. I am engaged with service providers and representative groups on the wider issue of accessibility on all public service vehicles. I intend to make real and tangible progress in this area. I want to see transport for all. Equally, I am seeking investment of €3 billion over the next ten years for DART and rail development and an integrated network in order to expand capacity and increase frequency of service. I will require similar developments in the Dublin Bus network. As well as QBCs, new buses need to be ordered, not just to improve quality and reliability of the fleet but, more important, for increased services.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">On Operation Freeflow, I am pleased to inform the House that I will launch the scheme on 29 November. I am committed to ensuring a successful operation for Christmas 2004. This year's initiative is being planned under the auspices of the Garda Síochána and the Dublin Transportation Office in close co-operation with local authorities and transportation service providers. I will monitor closely the success of Operation Freeflow. Given the announcement of a dedicated Garda traffic corp, we should witness a 24-7, 365 day, improvement in traffic management and freeflow.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">Developments are also taking place in other cities and regions in terms of bus prioritisation and other traffic management measures. Cork is engaged in the development of a comprehensive programme of green routes, equivalent to a quality bus corridor, and also park and ride sites. Approximately €12 million has been invested in these projects. A number of bus lanes are being installed in Galway, with technology being introduced at a number of key city junctions. In Limerick, there is similar installation of technology to give buses priority at junctions as well as the development of an urban traffic control system. Similar work is taking place in Waterford, including the introduction of bus priority schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">My plan is for further roll-out of QBCs in the capital and all cities for which I am responsible, and beyond. We can improve transport systems through effective co-ordination and collaboration between all the stakeholders, as well as the appropriate and effective use of intelligent traffic management systems.</p>

I am sure he will not be embarrassed if I do so once more. I have a particular interest in what the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, does because she was a Deputy for Tallaght when times were rough.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">She currently holds a brief very dear to my heart given my background — before I became a Dáil Deputy I worked for the National Youth Federation — and my contact with the various youth groups in the Tallaght area, which has a huge youth population of 30,000 young people still at school. The Tallaght Youth Service does tremendous work in that regard. Echoing what the Minister of State said, there is great joy in the Tallaght Youth Service at the Minister's announcement. It is very positive.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">I am glad the Minister listened to the youth service lobby.

I will not make a party-political point on a Thursday afternoon except to say that as I listened to the lectures given by the Labour Party speakers earlier I wondered whether, if the Labour Party got into Government in the future, Proinsias De Rossa would be back as Minister with responsibility for social welfare. That is what the Labour Party speakers seem to be saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">I have great hope that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Séamus Brennan, will listen to what has been said. The Fianna Fáil backbenchers have been very vocal in the area of social and family affairs, and I hope and am confident that what is required in that area will be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">I strongly support dealing with the problems in the health service. I have often stated that there must be something wrong with the system if despite billions of euros being poured into it, elderly people and others cannot get a bed in acute hospitals. That must be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I welcome the Estimate for the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Last Thursday night I was delighted to accompany the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ó Cuív, who was brave enough to return to duty only a couple of days after his mishap in Kerry, when he came to Tallaght where he was warmly welcomed. I make the point to him and to the Minister in the House that it is important that we keep our eye on the ball regarding drug services and the delivery of the RAPID programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">I listened carefully to the contributions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Conor Lenihan. I strongly support what is being done in the Third World. I had the opportunity a year ago this week to go to Lesotho, and I support what we as a nation are doing in the area of development aid. It is something we would all support.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The Minister spoke today about the Irish abroad. That issue does not get the same amount of attention as the subject of development aid. However, it is important to realise there is problem in that regard. I come from a background where my grandfather was forced to emigrate, my father was forced to emigrate, and I was forced to emigrate for a while, but I am glad I came back and that I am here. It is important to take every opportunity to support what is being done for the Irish abroad and to continue to demand that more and more resources should be allocated to them. I do not want to compare emigrant services with Third World aid. However, perhaps more organisation is needed in terms of emigrant services to ensure programmes are resourced. I am delighted by the Minister's announcement. The setting up a special unit by the Department of Foreign Affairs is to be welcomed. Anybody who has been abroad — I lived in London for a while — will understand that there will always be difficulties. I went to Brent a while ago because South Dublin County Council, which is based in Tallaght, is twinned with Brent County Council. In that area one meets homeless people from Dublin, from Tallaght and other places. One also meets people with drug problems. It is therefore essential to continue to support them. It strikes me that despite all the progress made — there was a report two years ago and its recommendations are being implemented — we need to focus on policy. I hope the Minister will consider producing a White Paper in the new year so that we will know precisely what our national policy is regarding emigrants.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I look forward to the budget next Wednesday. It is one of the highlights of the political year. I am sorry Fine Gael wants to abolish budget day but I look forward to it. The Sinn Féin leader said last week there would be three more budgets. I am glad it realises that. I look forward to all of them.</p>

          <p eId="para_755">I thank Deputies Healy, Finian McGrath and Sargent, who have given up their time to allow me to speak for four minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">From an agricultural perspective, the most striking thing about the Estimates is the ongoing failure to adequately fund Teagasc. The cuts implemented last year have already had serious consequences for a number of research centres which have been closed down, and we can only assume there are more on the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Last week we witnessed another consequence of this with the moving of employees from the Teagasc dairy farm at Ballinamore to Ballyhaise. Ballinamore farm was fulfilling an important unique role in research into farming conditions in the north west. Its closure says much not only about this Government's penny pinching in an important area of agricultural research, but about its attitude to the future of farming in disadvantaged areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">The closure and downgrading of other centres will have a similarly detrimental effect on the ability of Irish farmers to adapt themselves to the future. It is vital in the new scenario created by the single farm payment that Irish agriculture is resourced with the most up-to-date research to take advantage of the opportunities they are told exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">One of those is biofuels and other renewable energy sources. There is currently a small grant available for farmers who grow energy crops and I would ask the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen to examine the overall taxation and incentive packages that might be implemented in order to encourage this, as we will need to do if we are to meet EU targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">There appear to be significant opportunities in the biofuels area but I note that experts in that area here are critical of the Government's slowness in making the necessary fiscal and other policy decisions to ensure this country can take advantage of what will become a massive area of growth over the next 20 years. Not the least of our advantages is that we have the means to grow energy crops here. From the point of view of farmers, there is the opportunity to produce energy crops with the cushion of the single farm payment and the end of the need to produce other crops or animals for which there is not the same demand. I specifically refer to the smaller farmer who will have the cushion over the next ten years of having an income from the single farm payment but would be able to diversify and improve his or her income, if allowed to do so. However, to do this we need input from the Minister to direct, encourage and provide incentives to farmers to move into that sphere.</p>

        <speech by="#DickRoche" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
          <p eId="para_761">I thank all Members who made contributions in what was a good debate. The Government's focus in framing the 2005 Estimates and the budget that will follow is to continue to support economic growth and employment while generating the resources that this nation needs to achieve social and economic progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">As a result of the Government's successful management of the public economy to date, we have fared well. We have lowered central Government debt from close to 100% of GDP in the early 1990s to the current level of 31%, which is remarkably good news for taxpayers. We have the most healthy public finances in the European Union. The Exchequer outturn for 2004 is predicted to be €2 billion better than the Exchequer deficit of €2.8 billion which was forecast at the outset of 2004. We have reached practical full employment with the unemployment rate at less than 5%. Long-term unemployment, which has been a feature of grinding poverty for so long in this nation, has at long last been addressed. However, my party does not claim sole credit as social partnership played a major role in this regard. The forecast inflation rate for this year is approximately 2.25%. We have provided resources to double public spending on vital public services. We prioritised spending in recent years on health, education, welfare and infrastructure. In 2005 we will provide an increase in spending of €1.4 billion on health and education, which are pre-budget figures. In the last four years, we invested an average of 5% of GNP, approximately twice the EU average, on addressing our infrastructure deficit.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">It is worth recalling what we have achieved, namely, a standard of infrastructure which will support future growth. Some 47 major road projects will be completed between 2000 and 2004. The total length of the national roads development will be over 291 kilometres by mid-2004. The M1 motorway to Dundalk is the longest stretch of motorway in the country and when issues on the M50 are resolved, we will effectively have dual carriageway from outside Arklow to Dundalk. The Luas system is in operation, the DART system has been dramatically restructured, the port tunnel will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2005 and more money than ever in the history of the State has been spent by the Government on the rail and bus systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">Deputy Burton and others were critical of the public capital programme but I cannot understand why this is so. While there is much selective economic amnesia at present, we should remind ourselves that since 1997 the capital programme has increased by 185% on a pre-budget basis, a significant increase by an objective standard. There have been massive increases from a very low level in 1997 in areas such as transport, housing, health, education and child care. The Government has moved to a multi-annual capital system which makes more sense than the way we previously handled capital budgets. The new envelopes for 2005-09 will be announced on budget day and will maintain the momentum of investment in infrastructure. Some of the critical points made by Deputy Richard Bruton on the issue of the structural nature of our budgetary system are being addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">In the case of education, an area vital to the well-being of the nation, the gross allocation for the Department of Education and Science will be increased by €530 million, or 8%, to €7.1 billion in 2005. I spent much of my professional career in education and never thought I would see the day when it would achieve such extraordinary levels of investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The figures on health have been well rehearsed but are worth restating. The Estimate provides an additional €915 million and these additional resources will fund improvements in services, notably, 230,000 more people will have access to free general practitioner services through the new doctor only medical card system, which is a good system and will make sense to many people. Ten wide-ranging actions will improve accident and emergency services, including fully staffed acute medical units in major hospitals. We all know of the major problems with inappropriate visits to accident and emergency over the years and, if we are truthful, we know that extraordinary problems in accident and emergency arise in some cases because of people inappropriately turning up, particularly at weekends.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">New services for people with disabilities will be delivered by over 1,000 new front-line professionals who will begin implementation of the Disability Bill. All new units in hospitals will be opened with the current funding of €50 million. Waiting times for patients will be reduced further due to funding of €20 million which will be invested in the national treatment purchase fund. Members will state that this is not enough and it is not — it is never enough. However, while there is no reason to be complacent, it is infinitely better than anything achieved before.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">In my area of local government, the Exchequer allocation for the local government fund will be €488 million this year, an increase of €38 million or 8%. By any standards, this is sufficient to allow local authorities to get on with the job we elect them to do. I have €1.206 billion to invest in local authority housing on a pre-budget basis and I intend, with the assistance of every Member of this House and every member of every local authority, to squeeze value out of that funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">Deputy English referred to the Garda Síochána. In that regard, the figure of 5% is somewhat misleading. The Garda Commissioner intends to recruit 1,096 members during 2005 and additional members during 2006 and 2007. These members will undertake a 62 week training course before being attested into the force and formally joining the Garda payroll. I make this point simply to correct the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">A number of references were made to disability, some of which were, to say the least, disingenuous. The funding provided to the disability sector is phenomenal, which is as it should be because we started from a position where, historically, the State did not invest sufficiently in these services. I remind the House that under the disability headline some €532 million will come from the education budget, an increase of 16% on last year. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will experience an increase of the order of €56 million while the increase at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment will be €63 million. The increase on health is €2.143 billion, on justice, €8 million, and on finance, €45 million. The total increase is €2.847 billion. I provide these figures not to be in any way complacent or to suggest that sufficient has been done. However, much has been done even though there is more to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">On the tax side, the Government has liberated workers from the yoke of excessive levels of taxation.</p>

          <p eId="para_777">One line only comes from Deputy Burton. I am glad she has taken the time and trouble to return to the House because I wish to remind her of several matters. Persons on the average industrial wage pay less income tax than they did in 1997 when Deputy Burton's party was in charge of the coffers. Although the real wage has increased by some €10,000 per year in the meantime, an average person will pay €268 less in tax, PRSI and levies in 2004, on an increased wage, in comparison with workers on much lower wages in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">It is also the case that since 1997 the average tax rates for all individuals in all income levels has dropped by an unprecedented amount. Whether Deputy Burton likes to admit this, it is a fact. For example, for a married family with one income on €50,000, the average tax rate has fallen from 33.5% in 1997 to just under 21% in 2004. For a married couple with two incomes in the same period, the average rate has gone from 33% in 1997 to 14% in 2004. The best thing the State can do for income earners is not to steal their money but let them spend it themselves.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">The Government's approach to spending is not just about providing. The Green Party is always confused on the tax issue. As a result of the Government's pre-budget plans, gross expenditure on public services will be more than €43.5 billion in 2005. This is an extra €2.5 billion on the 2004 spend and represents a real increase by the public sector in public services. We have prioritised spending on health, education and welfare. Budget day will produce further benefits for those people who count in this country. The Minister for Finance should be congratulated and complimented on what he has done. We look forward to what he will achieve this day week.</p>

        <speech by="#TomKitt" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Defence" eId="spk_378">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Kitt)</from>
          <p eId="para_1004">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1005">That Dáil Éireann approves the despatch, pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960, as applied by Defence (Amendment) Act 1993, of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with EUFOR, established under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution 1575 of 22 November 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">I thank the House and the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for the expeditious manner in which they have dealt with this matter. It is important that our national decision procedures with regard to these matters work efficiently and effectively. In an increasingly violent world where conflict can so quickly arise and get out of hand, it is important that we make the necessary decisions about providing troops in support of peacekeeping operations. The manner in which the House has dealt with this matter shows how these necessarily speedy decisions can be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">We had a very helpful and constructive debate in committee yesterday. I thank the committee members for their kind remarks with regard to the Defence Forces, which have made us so proud of the way in which they have approached their role as ambassadors for peace throughout the world. As a consequence of the manner in which they have conducted themselves, working in difficult and dangerous circumstances, they have brought great honour and goodwill to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">I witnessed this at first hand during my visit to Liberia in March of this year and Chairman Bryant of the national transitional Government of Liberia mentioned it when he called on me earlier this week to express his appreciation for Ireland's contribution to peace in Liberia. He specifically paid tribute to the professionalism, humanity and kindness of the Irish soldiers serving in the UN mission in Liberia, UNMIL. He remarked how the local people come out to greet the Irish soldiers when they see them on patrol, waving to the soldiers, cheering them and warmly welcoming their presence and the important work they do. Such are the reports we receive in respect of our Defence Forces, wherever they serve. They are not just professional international peacekeepers, but humanitarians and goodwill ambassadors, welcomed wherever they go. It is undoubtedly a tribute to our Defence Forces that we have come to expect no less.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">I will outline to the House the reason for the motion and the need for its speedy adoption, and provide some information on the EUFOR mission. Under the Defence Acts, the deployment of a contingent of the Defence Forces on an overseas mission requires prior UN authorisation, Government approval and the approval of Dáil Éireann. This is the triple lock system. The Government expected that the necessary Security Council resolution would be passed by the end of October. However, for various reasons, this did not happen. One reason was the need to finalise certain technical issues with regard to the continuing role of NATO on this mission <i>vis-à-vis</i> the role of the EU. In addition, NATO assets are being deployed in support of the EU operation and certain issues in this regard had to be finalised before the Security Council could finalise its formal resolution. These issues were resolved last Friday and the Security Council then moved expeditiously to formally adopt Resolution 1575, which was passed unanimously on Monday last, 22 November.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">The delay in finalising the resolution at the Security Council has imposed significant time constraints on Ireland in completing its national decision-making procedures. The EU is due to take over the mission on 2 December and our troops have to be deployed, in theatre, prior to the commencement date. Members will appreciate that it would have been inappropriate to bring a motion before the Dáil in the absence of the final Security Council resolution authorising the establishment of EUFOR.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">On 9 November 2004, the Government authorised the Minister for Defence to, <i>inter alia</i>, arrange for the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for a period of one year for service with EUFOR, the EU-led mission in Bosnia Herzegovina, to be established under the authority of the UN as the legal successor to the NATO-led stabilisation force, SFOR. The Minister was also authorised to move a resolution in Dáil Éireann approving the despatch of this contingent. Under the terms of the Security Council resolution, EUFOR is the legal successor to the SFOR mission in Bosnia Herzegovina, which was established in 1996 under a previous resolution. Members of the Defence Forces have served with SFOR since 1997 with the approval of the Government and Dáil Éireann. Since then, the Security Council has authorised the continuation of SFOR for successive periods and the Government has approved continued Irish participation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">At the Copenhagen European Council in December 2002, the Heads of State of the EU indicated a willingness to lead a military operation in Bosnia Herzegovina as a follow-on mission to SFOR. The Government subsequently agreed that, subject to completion of national decision-making procedures and the appropriate UN mandate, the Defence Forces would participate in a substantive manner in the planned EU-led follow-on mission. Similar to SFOR, EUFOR will be a chapter VII mission, that is, it is entitled to use force to implement its mandate and to protect itself and the international civil presence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">The role of EUFOR will be to assist the parties, to implement the Dayton peace accord and to contribute to the continued development of the secure environment necessary for the consolidation and stabilisation of peace in the region. In undertaking this important work, EUFOR will co-operate and work with the other agencies principally involved in the region. This co-operation covers a wide range of activities, including maintaining security and preventing a resumption of violence, supporting counter-terrorism and the fight against organised crime, facilitating freedom of movement for the local population and assisting the return of refugees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">The basis of Ireland's participation in international peacekeeping is firmly grounded in the UN. Ireland is, and always has been, a strong and committed supporter of co-operative multilateral arrangements for collective security through the development of international organisations, particularly the United Nations. In this regard, Ireland has recognised and defended the primary role of the Security Council in the maintenance of international peace and security, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. The UN has recognised the advantages presented by the existence of regional organisations to which it can assign a mission. This is one of the major developments in the changing environment of UN peacekeeping. This increasing reliance of the UN on regional action for crisis management has, in part, contributed to the impetus towards development of the European Security and Defence Policy which focuses on crisis management and humanitarian operations, the so-called Petersberg Tasks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">The EU and the UN are natural partners in the field of peacekeeping and crisis management. The EU now has the capacity to mount peacekeeping operations. It has engaged in two military operations so far, in Macedonia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in which the Defence Forces played an active part, is an example of the potential inherent in this development, where the EU provided a force, under a Security Council resolution, with France as the framework nation. Similar developments are occurring between the UN and other regional organisations. In the case of Liberia, the initial deployment of troops was from ECOWAS, a local regional organisation and in the case of Kosovo, it was NATO. As Deputies will be aware, when Kofi Annan visited Ireland recently, he welcomed the developments in ESDP and especially the development of EU rapid response elements which could be deployed at short notice in support of UN peacekeeping operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">Ireland is a strong supporter of a substantive involvement by the EU in crisis management missions within the framework of ESDP. Irish participation in ESDP operations is fully in keeping with Ireland's commitment to the UN and our policy of military neutrality. Our activities in the ESDP and the UN are complementary and mutually reinforcing, and all decisions on Irish participation in these missions are taken on a case by case basis and are subject to the triple lock approach. Against this background, the Government is fully supportive of the participation of the Defence Forces in a substantive manner in the EUFOR mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">Twelve members of the Permanent Defence Force currently serve in SFOR. These personnel will transfer to EUFOR upon the takeover of the mission by the EU. It is proposed to deploy an additional 42 personnel to EUFOR as part of a Finnish-led multinational task force. This will bring Ireland's total deployment in the mission to 54. As is the case in all missions, a small number of additional personnel may be deployed from time to time to fill other roles within the overall mission. Within the Finnish-led task force, Ireland will provide personnel for the headquarters, the military police unit, joint military affairs verification teams and a national support element. An officer will also serve at the operational headquarters in SHAPE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Ireland is the framework nation for the military police unit and for the joint military affairs verification teams, that is, it provides the central headquarters role in relation to these elements within the task force headquarters. Subject to Dáil approval, deployment to EUFOR will take place next week with a view to commencing operations on the takeover of the mission by the EU on 2 December. Initial deployment would be for one year, with the possible extension thereafter, subject to renewal of the UN mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">The Government attaches great importance to the overall health, welfare and security of all our troops who serve on overseas missions. While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions, it is my policy and that of the Government to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately trained and equipped to carry out this mission. All possible precautions are taken to ensure the safety of our troops. Standard operating procedures are reviewed as necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">Troops selected for overseas service undergo a rigorous programme of training designed to help them carry out their peacekeeping mission and to provide for their protection. Due to the equipment modernisation programmes that have taken place in the Defence Forces over the past few years, Defence Forces personnel serving on all overseas missions are equipped with the most modern and effective equipment. This equipment enables them to carry out the mission assigned, as well as providing the required protection specific to the mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">The security situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina is currently assessed as stable, primarily due to the strong international community presence in the country. The attitude of the political parties and of the general public in Bosnia and Herzegovina to an increased EU presence ranges from neutral to positive. The phase during the handover to EUFOR could be used by some elements, who are adept at using any opportunity to cause trouble, to increase their activities. Disaffected parts of the population may also use this period to express discontent with their socio-economic situation. Thus far, however, there have been no concrete indications that any such activities are planned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">Bosnia and Herzegovina has been relatively calm for some time now. It is a very different mission to that which we are undertaking, for example, in Liberia. The level of protection provided to the force is commensurate with its assignment. In this regard, personnel will be deployed with personal protection weapons and with the body protection kit, which is appropriate to the environment in which they are operating.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">Ongoing threat assessments are carried out in mission areas and we continually review both personal equipment and force assets to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their roles. The situation will be no different on this mission and any additional resources or force protection assets required will be deployed as needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">Similar to SFOR, all troop contributors to EUFOR are responsible for their own costs. It is estimated that the additional costs to the Defence Vote arising from participation in EUFOR will amount to €3,458,456.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">This is a very important mission for the EU and for Ireland. It is a mission undertaken under UN authorisation and is the largest EU mission yet deployed. Ireland's contribution to this mission is a clear manifestation of the importance the Government attaches to the development of EU capabilities in the area of crisis management and peacekeeping in support of the UN.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I commend the individual soldiers, who have served and continue to serve on overseas missions, together with their families and loved ones. Without their loyal and continuing support, Ireland's strong tradition of service overseas, under the auspices of the United Nations, would not be possible. This committed and dedicated service in overseas missions reflects well not only on the Defence Forces but on the nation as a whole and contributes to the excellent reputation which Ireland holds among peacekeepers throughout the world. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_1029">Fine Gael supports this resolution. However, one concern I have about it is that it has happened in such a rushed manner. When I inquired yesterday at a committee as to why Government approval was given to participation on 9 November yet the UN resolution was not passed until 22 November although it had been expected in October, one of the explanations put forward by the Minister was that there was a difficulty about the sharing of NATO assets. I note the Minister of Sate said that part of the delay had to do with the need to finalise certain technical issues in relation to the continuing role of NATO on this mission <i>vis-à-vis</i> the role of the EU. I will table a parliamentary question to ascertain exactly what those difficulties were because I would not like to think that wrangling between some permanent members of the Security Council had once again jeopardised what we believe to be correct foreign policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">From the time the stabilisation force was deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, its mandate was to implement the military aspects of the peace agreement, commonly known as the Dayton Agreement. SFOR's role was to contribute to a secure environment that would lead us to lasting peace in the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">I welcome the fact the European Union will shortly assume responsibility for this mission, which will now be called the EUFOR mission. It has been common practice for the UN since the publication of the Brahimi report in 2000 that it would subcontract many of its missions to regional forces, be it the African Union or the European Union. That is a welcome development and it has been done for practical and pragmatic reasons. It gives rise to a better trained force, one that can be more quickly deployed and one that can operate more effectively and efficiently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">This is the largest EU mission yet deployed. SFOR has stabilised the region and provided the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a safe and secure living environment. EUFOR will continue to undertake this vital role. Somewhere in the region of 80% of the troops currently participating there will continue to participate under the new mandate. There must be no return to the appalling violence and consequent loss of human life that was so widespread in the region in the 1990s when in a three year period somewhere in the region of 200,000 people were slaughtered under what is commonly known as ethnic cleansing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">We should not forget that when this force was deployed in 1995 more than 60,000 troops were sent to the region. Matters have stabilised so much that now the number of troops there are in the region of 7,000. Ireland has been involved in this force from 1997, when Irish troops were deployed to serve as part of the military police company in Sarajevo. In January 2003, the military police contingent withdrew from SFOR but the Defence Forces have continued to staff a number of posts in Sarajevo headquarters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">The SFOR mission was NATO-led, operating with the authorisation of the United Nations. The new security realities mean that we are starting to realise that European states should be doing more to address such crisis situations, such as those which arose in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Kosovo. However, the SFOR mission was thrown into crisis in 2002 when the United States vetoed a resolution at the United Nations to renew the mandate of the force. This was due to the refusal of the United States administration to accept the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court over its defence personnel. Although this matter had no material relevance to the situation in Bosnia, the United States took advantage of the vote at the United Nations to highlight its displeasure with the ICC.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">This US action threatened not only the Bosnian mission but all UN peacekeeping operations, and was deeply criticised by the Secretary General of the UN. The matter was subsequently resolved following the reaching of a compromise agreement at the Security Council. However, this scenario, as with the situation that has pertained regarding the peace force in Macedonia, brought into sharp relief the difficulties that can arise when UN resolutions are sought, even for the most straightforward and obviously deserving of cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">Ireland, under our triple lock system, is giving the countries of the UN Security Council a veto over the time and place that we can deploy members of our Defence Forces. If the US had vetoed the resolution on SFOR forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ireland would have had to leave the country immediately despite the fact that we are happy to participate and currently have troops on the ground there. Similarly, Ireland does not have a presence in Macedonia as China vetoed the renewal of the UN resolution, due to the fact that Macedonia had recognised Taiwan. Ireland was one of the 14 countries which had to leave. The remaining 13 countries were able to remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">Put simply, allowing other countries to exercise a veto over our Defence Forces is deeply unwise, grossly unsatisfactory and should not be the case for a sovereign nation. We should have a mature confidence in our foreign policy and be able to make a decision to participate based on the merits of each case. We should not be held to ransom by other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">I respect divergence of view. Nevertheless, there is an inherent contradiction in those sections of Irish society which, while quick to condemn American foreign policy on many issues are here allowing the United States to dictate our foreign policy by accepting the US veto at the United Nations. I do not say we should embrace every conflict and send troops left, right and centre. Fine Gael strongly believes that our decision to participate should be based on the merits of each case. The decision should be made in Ireland by our Government and Oireachtas, subject to the principles of the United Nations Charter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">These difficulties will arise again in the context of the development of EU battle groups. I welcome the Government's commitment to EU battle groups. Ireland should consider co-operating in such groups with all EU countries and should not limit our co-operation to countries such as Sweden and Finland. If a lack of human and financial resources prevents us from supplying a full battle group we should consider providing a technical element, such as signals or transport as back-up to one of the other contingents. We should not rule out supporting any contingent. Recent newspaper reports have referred to the trauma of co-operating with the British army. Irish troops have served with British troops in Cyprus in the UNFICYP mission. On at least two occasions, Irish officers commanded that force, which consisted of 300 or 400 soldiers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The Minister for Defence should take the opportunity to re-examine the triple-lock mechanism, which limits Irish involvement in overseas missions. I welcome the Tánaiste's comments in reply to Deputy Kenny yesterday. She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1041">There are clear inconsistencies, as I have said before, on the stance we have taken on some foreign policy issues. As time moves on, I hope we can debate these issues and come to a resolution that requires us to be able to act more independently on occasions where circumstances merit our participation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">I hope those comments will lead to a more open, frank and honest debate on this issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_382">
          <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_1043">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue. I spoke on the same issue last week in the European Parliament in Strasbourg when the Parliament approved the ALTHEA mission, as EUFOR is called there. The transition takes place on 2 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">There is confusion about the need to keep the triple-lock system if we are to be consistent with the UN and what it is trying to do. There is no stronger supporter than me of the UN as a means of dealing with multnational issues. Nevertheless, the Irish Government and people should decide where Irish troops go and what they do. We should not be reliant on approval by China, Russia, the United States, Britain or France to send our troops to parts of the world where they may be needed and when there may be a political conflict of interest. If, God forbid, civil war were to break out in the Ukraine following the disgraceful presidential election campaign in that country, we would not be able to send troops there because Russia would probably veto a peacekeeping mission at the UN Security Council. Ireland would not be able to participate in a decision that would be taken by Ireland and by the European Union in such a hypothetical situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">It is nonsense to suggest that to remain consistent with UN values we must keep the triple-lock system in place. We are mature enough to make that decision in our own right at this stage. The Government needs to take this debate forward. It will certainly get support from the largest Opposition party in the House in doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">I welcome the ALTHEA mission. It is the largest example so far of European Union willingness to take on responsibility for military peacekeeping operations in different parts of the world. We need to do more of this. We owe it to the world to do this because we are wealthy enough to be able to do it. Relying on US troops for international missions of complexity is no longer good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">This is why I welcome the fact that the Government, at a recent Council meeting, gave its support to the concept of battle groups. The triple-lock system and the concept of the European Union being able to debate where it should send battle groups will give rise to conflicts. Battle groups will consist of 1,500 troops. It is proposed to set up 13 battle groups in Europe by the year 2010 and I hope Ireland will participate in one of those. We cannot provide a battle group because we can send only 750 or 800 troops abroad at any time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">I encourage the Government to continue working with other countries towards increasing co-operation. This will improve Irish effectiveness from a peacekeeping point of view. It is unfortunate that battle groups are so called. It is a shame they are not called peacekeeping groups because battle groups suggest going to war, which is not their function. I hope the Minister will consider carefully what I have had to say.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_383">
          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_1049">Yesterday, the Labour Party expressed its concern at the speed with which this issue was being dealt with. We stated that a more thorough debate than originally scheduled was appropriate. In this respect, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the despatch of Irish troops for service with EUFOR in Bosnia Herzegovina.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">I am concerned about a number of issues, particularly the maintenance of the triple-lock procedure and the wording of the motion we are being asked to approve. Critics of the triple-lock mechanism often complain that its nature — the need for a UN mandate, a Government decision and Dáil approval — means that the process of deciding what missions Irish troops are involved in is cumbersome, unwieldy and time consuming. However, given that the Security Council only yesterday adopted the resolution on EUFOR taking over the stabilising role in Bosnia and Herzegovina and that Dáil approval is already being debated, the triple-lock procedure is justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">If there is a problem it is not with the triple-lock procedure but with the manner in which the United Nations Security Council functions. The Labour Party has long argued for Security Council reform. The council is now less representative than it has been at any stage in its history as its membership has not increased since 1965, even though total UN membership has grown by 60%. Only 15 out of 185 UN members have Security Council membership. If the Security Council is to continue to have legitimacy, its composition must be made more globally representative. The veto power of the big five permanent members should be eliminated and substituted with a blocking minority provision to protect the rights of smaller countries. There should be a rebalancing of the permanent membership on a regional basis, but with the intention of eliminating the right to permanent membership altogether.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">Meanwhile, however, we must accept the decisions arrived at by the Security Council as the ultimate decision-making body for global security.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">While I would prefer more time to debate the implications of the Security Council resolution mandating EUFOR, as well as the consequences for peacekeeping in the Balkans and our troops' involvement and activities in Bosnia, I recognise that a speedy decision is desirable. Therefore, the Labour Party is content to give its assent to the motion before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">This procedure proves that the triple lock mechanism works. It is not unwieldy and can be implemented quickly. Ireland is a neutral country but, as we all know, neutrality has many different guises. We therefore believe that our neutrality should be defined in the Constitution. Inserting the triple lock mechanism in the Constitution would ensure that Irish troops take part only in UN-mandated missions and that the triple lock procedure is guaranteed. This is a subject to which we will be returning in the context of the debate on the EU constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I have some concerns about the wording of the motion. My colleague, Deputy Sherlock, outlined these in committee yesterday and I would like to know if the Minister has had an opportunity to address them. The Defence Act explicitly states that Irish involvement in any international United Nations force, such as EUFOR, must be established "by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations". However, the motion states that EUFOR has been established "under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution No. 1574".</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">There is a subtle but important anomaly here. There is a distinction between activities "established under the authority of the UN Security Council" and those "established by the Security Council". Our Constitution recognises the distinction between both types of activity. For example, in Article 28.2 of the Constitution both terms are used to state: "The executive power of the State shall, subject to the provisions of this Constitution, be exercised by or on the authority of the Government." Put simply, the motion before us is at variance with the terms of the Defence Act. This situation has arisen because the section of the Defence Act referred to was drafted at a time when the United Nations did not sub-contract peacekeeping missions to other international bodies such as the EU or NATO. The previous Minister for Defence was aware of this situation but did not agree with our argument. I would like the new Minister, therefore, to give this issue his consideration as it could cause problems for him in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">I wish to be associated with the remarks of the Minister and other colleagues in thanking members of the Defence Forces for their wonderful work as ambassadors for Ireland on overseas missions. They have served the nation well in various parts of the world. They have undertaken important peacekeeping initiatives and the good name of Ireland has always benefited from their endeavours abroad. We all appreciate their work. Sadly, there have been fatalities during overseas service since 1960 when such foreign missions began. However, we also have wonderful memories of past missions undertaken by the Defence Forces. I wish all the members of the new task force a successful mission and a safe return home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">Will the Minister ensure that all necessary logistical means to link members of the mission with their families, especially approaching Christmas, will be made available by the Army? Our troops overseas have been our greatest ambassadors over the past 40 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_1059">EUFOR is the largest EU security and defence policy mission to date. Our participation will cost the State approximately €3.5 million a year, none of which will be refunded, in contrast to the partial refund we received for previous UN deployments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Sinn Féin agrees there is a need for the international community to play a positive and constructive role in ending the conflict in Bosnia Herzegovina and to assist the transition to a post-conflict society. We accept the ongoing need for a peacekeeping mission there and would show no reluctance towards the deployment of Irish Defence Forces on such a mission if it were UN-led. However, NATO should not have been the force leading IFOR and SFOR in the first place and the EU should not be leading the EU military force mission, EUFOR, now.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">I acknowledge that the involvement of these military alliances represents a failure of the UN system. However, by rights, the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia Herzegovina should be a UN force, with the full participation of EU member states, each in its own right, under UN leadership.</p>

          <p eId="para_1065">The shift from a NATO-led mission to an EU-led one is scarcely an improvement. Sinn Féin would prefer to see a situation where the UN is reformed, strengthened and given the support it deserves so that the so-called outsourcing of peacekeeping operations to regional military alliances, such as the EU rapid reaction force and NATO, will end. The UN was created to render such regional military alliances obsolete. The fact that the UN is now so often prevented from taking up its rightful role represents an unacceptable situation about which many in the international community, including the Government and others in the House, have grown complacent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The progressive marginalisation of the UN has surely fed the resurgent unilateralism in the case of Iraq. I want to take this opportunity to put on record Sinn Féin's opposition to the Government's commitment of Irish troops to EU battle groups. This EU proto-army will not require a UN mandate and would bring Irish troops under the command of another EU state. Not all EU countries are participating and the Government should not pledge Irish troops in this way. Sinn Féin is critical of this deployment but, in recognition of the genuine need for international involvement in Bosnia Herzegovina and the UN mandate for EUFOR, we have decided not to block the motion on this occasion.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1067">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on this important motion which seeks the approval by Dáil Éireann of the despatch of a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force for service with EUFOR in Bosnia Herzegovina. Before going into the details of the issue of sending our soldiers into a conflict zone and thereby risking their lives, this is an appropriate time to challenge those who seem to have a problem with our positive and constructive neutrality position and who want to undermine that position and move us into military alliances. We must be vigilant and on the ball as many of us have witnessed the constant undermining of our neutral position. We must also face the reality that there are people in this House who openly want us to join NATO and other military alliances. At least we know where they stand. There are more sinister elements that pretend otherwise but want to get us gradually sucked into assisting certain military powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">I welcome and support the triple lock mechanism which requires prior UN authorisation, Government approval and the approval of Dáil Éireann. However, I have concerns when I hear Ministers say on the one hand that the Government's position is fully in keeping with Ireland's commitment to the United Nations and our policy of military neutrality while at the same time stating that Ireland is a strong supporter of a substantive involvement in EU crisis management missions. I am concerned about the possible contradictions therein, as well as the Government's "blind eye" attitude to the United States use of Shannon to send its troops on their way to the killing fields of Iraq.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">As we debate this important overseas mission, let me set the record straight on my position on neutrality. I wish to clarify the issue for those who say we have no policy or that somehow we are sitting on the fence regarding international issues, including conflicts. That is rubbish. I want to show the House where I stand so that people can then judge. I have five core principles. It is within the OSCE and a reformed United Nations, not the EU, that Ireland should pursue its security concerns. Ireland should pursue a positive neutrality and an independent foreign policy and not join or form an association with any military alliance such as the WEU or NATO. Ireland should seek to promote European and international security through a policy of disarmament and demilitarisation and should, therefore, oppose the militarisation of the EU. Ireland should refuse to co-operate with or condone in any way policies or military groupings which maintain nuclear weapons or any weapons of mass destruction. Irish troops should only serve abroad as peacekeepers under the auspices of the United Nations. A red light goes on in my head when I hear people like the former President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, say, as he did on 13 February 2001: "Are we all clear that we want to build something that can aspire to be a world power?"</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">I use the opportunity of this debate to thank and commend our troops who have served the United Nations for many years. Many have given their lives in the cause of peace and conflict resolution and I pay tribute to them. The missions have always been for peace and humanitarian reasons, never offensive, imperial or abusive. I commend the motion to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_1071">The Green Party previously supported SFOR in Bosnia, which was NATO-led and had a UN mandate. The decision made at the NATO summit in June to replace SFOR with an EU force has been hailed by member states of both NATO and the EU. It is seen by many as an opportunity for the EU to bolster its credibility as a security actor in Europe and on the world stage. Of course it also suits the US, which can now declare that at least one of its long-term military deployments is successfully completed. Notwithstanding these obviously geopolitical motives, it is obvious that Bosnia requires a further period of stabilisation. Our preference of course would be for a UN force to carry out these duties. However, listening to Kofi Annan's recent speech in Dublin Castle, it is clear he is now at the beck and call of the most powerful regional blocs and an exclusively UN force would appear to be a thing of the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">For this mission to be successful it is vital that we listen carefully to the Government in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Last July the Foreign Minister, Mladen Ivanic, called for the country's international administrators to be withdrawn within two years. He said the time had come to close the office of the high representative, the international body that had supervised and run the Bosnian Government since 1995. He would like to see Bosnia and Herzegovina as a normal country with its own institutions, without a high representative, but with a special representative of the European Union. EUFOR now has an opportunity to make this happen. Obviously this would be with a view to EU membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina some time between 2009 and 2012. Before this can happen, wartime suspects such as Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic must be apprehended and handed over.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">This mission is not without risk, as the Government has acknowledged. The hand-over could be used by extreme elements to exploit discontent. I wish our Defence Forces the very best. They have performed outstandingly as part of other UN contingents and I have no doubt they will do the country proud once more. We enjoy an excellent and well-deserved reputation as peacekeepers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">I, like many of my colleagues on this side of the House, want to retain the triple lock mechanism. I agree with Deputy Wall who has stated we must reform the UN and not embark on a unilateral course as has been suggested by some of the Fine Gael speakers today, which would be ill advised. Ukraine has been used as an example. If we decided to go in and sort out Ukraine, we would embark on a war with Russia. That is why the triple lock mechanism is in place — it makes total sense. The UN is by no means a perfect organisation and it must be reformed. However, it forms the basis of international law. If we abandon international law we will behave like the US, which we do not want to do. Those of us speaking in favour of retention of the triple lock mechanism should be listened to. I agree it should be inserted in the Constitution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">I was glad to hear what Deputy Wall had to say. Last week in Dublin Castle some of his colleagues, particularly Tony Browne, suggested that we should abandon the triple lock mechanism.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1079">As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Finance on budget day 2003 introduced rolling five-year multi-annual envelopes for capital investment. At the publication of the Estimates for 2005 last week the Minister indicated that he intends to deal with adjustments to those envelopes in the context of the upcoming budget. Consequently, I am not in a position to define my detailed plans for capital expenditure across the sector in 2005 until after budget day. I can, however, give the Deputy a general indication of my approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1080">In the case of third level education, the agenda is set by the Kelly report, Review and Prioritisation of Capital Projects in the Higher Education Sector. The planned countrywide roll-out of broadband to schools during 2005 will continue to influence how funds are provided for schools ICT.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">The Deputy asked specifically about primary and post-primary schools. While I must await clarification of my final allocation on budget day, clearly in 2005 I will want to make further significant inroads on moving to tender and construction projects that are already in the final stages of the design process and are likely to be ready to go to tender during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">In advancing the school building programme, I will be anxious to further develop the focused schemes introduced to address historical under-investment in our schools, including initiatives such as the summer works scheme, which benefited more than 450 schools in 2004, and the initiative to allow small primary schools to undertake building and modernisation works on a devolved basis, which has already benefited more than 60 primary schools. These devolved initiatives with the permanent accommodation initiative have been welcomed by all the education partners in that they give funding directly to management authorities to manage their own building projects. I am convinced of the merit of using a devolved approach where appropriate and I see it as an important part of my strategy to improve school accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">In tandem with moving new projects forward, whether through traditional or devolved processes, I will of course maintain the asbestos, radon and dust extraction remediation programmes and will make the usual provision for emergency works.</p>

            <from>Ms Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_1084">I thank the Minister for her reply. In 2003 while certain projects were progressed and finished, only 12 primary and 14 post-primary school building projects were started from scratch. While I imagine we do not have the total figure for 2004 yet, does the Minister anticipate making greater progress in 2005? Her predecessor carried out a trawl through the school building programme and admitted that progress was slower than he would have liked. Does she feel she will be able to make greater progress? I share the Minister's support for devolved initiatives, particularly the summer works scheme and the primary schools initiative. Has the Minister received queries from schools where the cost of completing these works ends up considerably higher than originally anticipated and schools are being left with significant shortfalls, which they must fill?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1085">A sum of €388 million has been allocated to the schools building programme for 2004, which is the largest in history. This should deliver in excess of 260 significant new projects at or going to construction during the year and 450 smaller-scale projects under the €31 million summer works scheme as well as site purchases etc. Some projects have experienced delays in getting the correct number of tenders, delays in getting on site or delays with planning permissions or planning appeals. However, a huge number of projects are already on site and more will have substantial construction completed by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">The Deputy asked about the money allocated to devolved schemes. We have successfully allocated money under programmes like the summer works scheme, which work well. I am aware of cases particularly with the devolved scheme for extensions to smaller schools, where some of the tenders are coming in considerably higher than expected. This appears to be happening in some areas and not in others. Last week I met representatives from a school in Tipperary, which had been allocated €250,000 for two classrooms. While on the face of it one would have thought this was substantial enough — a two-classroom extension is little bigger than a bungalow — the tenders came in at €350,000. While the bidding contractors were all from Kilkenny, last Friday I visited a school in Kilkenny that had added three classrooms for €100,000. There are ways of negotiating at local level that would benefit local people and schools in the long term. We are very much in favour of progressing this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">I believe the Deputy had a third question.</p>

            <p eId="para_1088">Does the Minister intend to make any internal changes in her Department in light of the underspend that will facilitate the smoother running of projects in the building programme? The number of stages a project must go through slows the process down.</p>

            <p eId="para_1089">I am anxious to review the progress of expenditure, going to site and construction at various stages during the year. The number of projects unable to go ahead because of planning difficulties only came to light in the autumn. It then became difficult to allow other schools to go ahead because they were on-site. We must look carefully at the timing of allowing schools to go on site and free up money for others as the year progresses.</p>

        <b>Ms O’Sullivan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
        the amount of the capital budget for school buildings which has not been spent in 2004 on primary and secondary schools; the reason it has not been spent; if such moneys will carry over into 2005; if she will consider a substitute list for the schools building programme to ensure that money allocated to projects but not spent can be allocated to other projects; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_398" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1091">Under the multi-annual capital envelope framework, I can carry over 10% of my allocation for 2004-05 and I project a need to do so at present. I plan to carry over €50 million and I am not limited to a carryover of €39 million as recently reported in the media. This means that I can allocate the entire carryover to primary and post-primary buildings in 2005 to match any amount not spent from the 2004 allocations for primary and post-primary school buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1092">Any saving in 2004 on school buildings is not due to a reduction or cutback in planned activity. Ultimately, we are talking about some payments on existing projects that have already been approved to go to tender and construction that will not be due for payment in 2004 as originally envisaged. A record level of new school projects was commissioned in 2004 and payments expected to fall due before the end of this year are now more likely to be met in early 2005. However, the decision by the Government to put its entire capital programme, including the education capital programme, on a multi-annual basis means that it is easier to manage and cope with that type of variation in projected spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1093">The Deputy will appreciate that the 2004 school building programme is a multifaceted undertaking, involving many hundreds of individual projects ranging from new school buildings, extensions, refurbishments and other projects under the summer works scheme to temporary accommodation and permanent accommodation initiatives, remediation programmes and the contingency fund. In addition, my Department funds the purchase of sites for new schools building projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1094">There are many reasons which can cause unexpected delays in the pace at which some projects advance. These include an appeal of planning permission by third parties to An Bord Pleanála, contractors withdrawing tenders and design teams being slower than anticipated in getting projects tendered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">Through the carryover measure, however, and the overall management of my capital budget and Department spending until the end of the year, I will ensure that all funds remaining for 2004, together with whatever allocation I receive for 2005, will enable me to maintain the momentum in the capital building programme started by this year's record level of activity.</p>

          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_399">
            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_1096">We all understand that there can be delays but will all the money allocated for 2004 be spent? The Minister said that she could carry over €50 million but does she expect there will be an underspend of more than €50 million by the end of this year and, if so, what happens to that money? Can it be spent within the capital schools budget?</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">There was a presentation to the Joint Committee on Education and Science on speeding up the process by having standardised architectural designs for specific sizes of schools. Has any progress been made in that area? It has the capacity to save money and speed the process up.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_400" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1098">Whatever money is underspent in the primary and post-primary building programmes this year will be spent in those programmes next year. Bills are still coming in and we will pay them before the end of the year, but any underspend remaining which may be used in other capital expenditure will be refunded in 2005. The primary and post-primary schools will not be at a loss as a result of underspending this year. The €50 million is all that I envisage carrying forward to next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">Standard designs have been drawn up for eight and 16 teacher schools. They are not appropriate designs for every school. They are best on greenfield sites rather than for existing buildings, but we are identifying sites for next year that could go under the generic design because it is a success and cuts down on architectural and engineering fees.</p>

            <p eId="para_1105">Recently I announced an end to the freeze on spending on capital programmes in the third level sector and that I was proceeding to implement the Kelly report. In so doing, I indicated that certain high priority projects identified in the Kelly report would be proceeding immediately. These include building projects needed to support the significant expansion in recent years of teacher training places, as well as those associated with skills initiatives that have been aimed at addressing critical health skills shortages in the physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, pharmacy, radiography, social work and clinical psychology areas. Skills supply in those areas is critical to delivery on the Government's health strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">My recent announcements should be regarded as a critical first step in implementation that will deal with a number of projects delayed significantly since 2002. Many further priority projects are identified by the Kelly review group and a large proportion of these are in the institutes of technology area. These will now be considered in the context of the overall funding available to me when the multi-annual capital envelope for the education sector is determined in the budget next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">I have stated on a number of occasions that my intention as Minister is to address the priority needs that exist at and within each level of the education system. There has been considerable capital investment in the institutes of technology since 1997. The institutes received a majority of the capital available between 1997 and 2002. The Kelly report identifies further significant investment needed within the institutes and I look forward to addressing the priorities identified going forward.</p>

            <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
            <p eId="para_1108">In the Estimates in 2002, the Minister announced that there would be a pause in all capital projects and any new spending proposals would have to go through a review process. Recently, the Minister lifted this pause in spending to give the go-ahead to ten projects. While this was a positive step, it was regrettable that none of the projects approved were in the institute of technology sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">The Minister established a group under the chairmanship of Mr. Kevin Kelly and it called for €171 million of funding for the institute of technology sector. How much money will be allocated for structural development in that sector? Does the Minister intend to implement the Kelly report in full and, if so, is there a timeframe for its implementation? How soon will it be completed?</p>

            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1110">The Kelly report examined the prioritisation of capital projects within the higher education sector and it was on the basis of those priorities that I allocated the money to the teacher training colleges and the therapy courses. The Kelly report also examined the institutes of technology. Projects for the entire third level sector include 97 major projects that will cost €933 million. Out of those, the report identified €629 million for 54 projects in the institutes of technology, including the Dublin Institute of Technology, over a ten-year period. That is a substantial sum and we will have to look within the overall priorities of the Government in an effort to address the capital needs throughout the sector. I will not have my full budget until budget day but I aim to make as much progress as possible in meeting priority needs.</p>

            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1114">I do not intend to make any decisions with regard to introducing standardised testing in primary schools until after I have carried out a thorough exploration of all the issues relating to the announcement made by my predecessor last July. I am awaiting advice on the matter which the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is preparing, through its usual consultative and partnership processes. I expect this early in 2005. Then I will be in a position to engage in further consultations, as appropriate, with the relevant partners, including teachers and parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">Since decisions have yet to be made with regard to standardised testing in primary schools, it is too early to give details of the uses that will be made of test information. Furthermore, it would be inappropriate to pre-empt the advice that I have yet to receive. However, I give my assurances that it is not my Department's intention to use the results of standardised tests for the following purposes: to compile school league tables; as a stand-alone criterion to determine the allocation of resources to individual pupils and individual schools; or as a stand-alone criterion to measure the effectiveness of individual teachers and schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">The judicious use of standardised test results has high value as one of a range of modes of assessment in helping teachers make more informed decisions as regards the instruction of pupils, in informing parents of their child's progress and in providing information essential to the identification of pupils who may require additional support. At classroom level, information from standardised tests can be particularly useful in informing individual and group teaching. The fact that more than 95% of our primary schools use such tests in some way is testimony to the value that our teachers ascribe to them. Standardised test results also have an important role to play at the level of the whole school as they provide valuable information for teachers, principals and boards of management when engaging in self-evaluation, a vitally important stage in planning the development and improvement of the individual school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1117">At national level there is need for more regular information than is available on trends in pupil progress and on levels of achievement within our education system. We now have an opportunity to explore the potential of systematised standardised testing in this regard. I believe that a considered and balanced policy on standardised testing will benefit pupils, teachers, parents and policy makers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">I am pleased to hear the INTO statement that it supports the development of an agreed national assessment policy for primary schools and that it will work positively with me to introduce forms of assessment that are appropriate to the learning needs of pupils and the information needs of the system. I look forward to engaging with it as one of the partners in my consultations on standardised testing.</p>

          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_411">
            <from>Ms Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_1119">How long does the Minister expect her exploration of the issues to last? I am glad she is taking proper advice on this issue and is not just following on the announcement made by her predecessor, Deputy Noel Dempsey, as I am not too sure what advice was behind that. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, told us today, when speaking on the Estimates, the amount of money to be provided to tackle literacy. Obviously it cannot be tackled if we do not know the base line from which we start. While I am concerned at testing children too young, we must have some base line from which to start. I am aware that schools are testing at present. What use has the Department been making of the information being provided by schools? The information is there and better use could be made of it in the interim. Will the Minister consider that? My question, however, is when she expects to make a more formal and firm decision on this issue.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_412" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1120">I, too, am concerned about rushing into a system that might put pressure on students, parents and in particular very young children in the primary school system before we work out what type of tests to use, how they are to be implemented and to what use they are to be put. I accept what Deputy Enright is saying. Information is enormously valuable, particularly as regards literacy. That is why we all accept good use can be made of the tests. While I stated that 95% of teachers are using these tests, not all teachers in a school do the same testing, however, or even use the same test. That is why we need to work with all the partners involved to evaluate how the best use may be made of the information available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">This is very valuable in terms of reaching our targets under the national anti-poverty strategy and for targeting resources for literacy. However, under no circumstances will tests be a stand-alone criterion on that. I have asked the NCCA to come back to me early in the new year because I see it as a priority to achieve progress on this issue, in consultation with all the partners.</p>

            <p eId="para_1123">Physical education is one of the seven primary education curriculum areas and plans are in place to implement the new syllabus in physical education in September 2005, with a programme of in-service training for all primary school teachers taking place during the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">Second level schools should offer a physical education programme based on an approved syllabus with teaching hours registered on the school timetable. The focus of physical education in schools is on the young person's holistic development, stressing personal and social development, physical growth and motor development. Goal setting within the curriculum focuses on individual improvement and not on winning or being the best.</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">At post-primary level, a revised syllabus for physical education for junior cycle, as a non-examination subject, is being introduced on a phased basis. The revised junior cycle physical education syllabus, with its practical focus, provides for young people an opportunity to explore a range of intelligences and represents a balance in what has long been acknowledged as an academically dominated curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">The junior cycle physical education support service was established in September 2003 to support the introduction of the revised syllabus. The programme is being rolled out over three years. All schools were invited to avail of the support service with schools being invited to apply to the programme. Some 112 schools were involved in the programme in 2003 and further 130 have been invited to participate this year. Schools will have a further opportunity to apply for participation in the programme in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">In October 2000, my Department introduced a physical education grant for all primary schools. Since the introduction of the scheme, the Department provided in excess of €5.5 million in grant aid to primary schools under this scheme to enable schools provide coaching or mentoring in connection with physical education or to purchase resource materials associated with the provision of physical education. Materials and equipment purchased by schools in previous years will generally be available to them for subsequent years. In light of the budgetary constraints, it was decided to withdraw payment of the grant from 2003. However, schools may use their general capitation funding to support the implementation of curricula, including physical education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1128">Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from £45 or €57.14, per pupil to €121.58 with effect from 1 January 2004, an increase of almost 113% in the period. Provision has been made in the financial allocation announced in the recently published Book of Estimates for a further increase of €12 per pupil in the capitation grant, bringing it to €133.58 in the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1129">The question of reintroducing a specific grant in respect of physical education in the future will be considered in the context of available resources and priorities within the education sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1130">Will the Minister acknowledge, in terms of getting young people involved in sport, that one needs to start at the early stages, namely, primary school level? Is she aware of a survey carried out during the summer by the INTO, which showed that in Donegal 80%, in Clare 63% and in Dublin, with bigger and better equipped schools, 14% of schools did not have a proper sports area or physical education hall? Out of the 86% in Dublin which did have a physical education hall, 60% were inadequate or unsatisfactory. Will she acknowledge that in the new physical education curriculum, two of the six strands are dance and aquatics? In response to the INTO survey, teachers have said they are woefully unprepared for these two areas. Will the Minister acknowledge that most schools will not be able to install the new curriculum? This is a sad indictment of the Government's commitment to sport and to the personal development of young children. Given that the Taoiseach has indicated he is now a committed socialist, will the Minister acknowledge that even the most totalitarian and backward eastern European states of the 1970s and 1980s had a much more superior approach to sport for young people, as was shown by their Olympic results? Will she concede that physical education grants are but one small step? If even €600 a year cannot be given to schools, the Government is simply spitting in the face of our young children and laughing at teachers who are very committed.</p>

            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1131">I acknowledge that eastern European countries had greater sports facilities and large physical education halls, while their people starved. They had no democracy, no freedom and no flexibility about the development of the individual. It is a matter of priorities. The physical education curriculum in primary schools is dealt with under six headings, athletics, dance, gymnastics, games, outdoor and adventure activities and aquatics. Schools are encouraged to adopt a programme that is enjoyable, involving participation etc. From our inspection of the schools there is no indication of non-compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">Teachers are using the facilities they have, be they outdoor or indoor, or local sports facilities in conjunction with local clubs or swimming pools in towns. My colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, has done much work in that area. All the new schools being developed at second level include PE halls built to international standards. At that level of physical education involvement in many sports is encouraged and there are basketball and tennis courts, playing fields and so on. We have found that generally schools have at least one element of those facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">Some progress was made in the capital programme this year with particular reference to PE halls and there have been developments as part of a wider programme in the drugs task force areas. There is quite a deal of flexibility of choice in the physical education programme. Even those schools with very confined space do their best to ensure the children get physical activity. One of the best physical activities parents could do with their children is to walk.</p>

        <b>Mr. Hogan</b>
         asked the

        the amount to be spent on primary school buildings in 2005; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1135">The allocation of capital funding for each of the sectors within the Education Vote is governed by the Five-year Multi-Annual Framework for Capital Expenditure 2004 — 2008. This framework provides an allocation for each of the five years and allows a carry-over into the following year of unspent capital up to a limit of 10% of a current year's voted capital allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">It should be noted that the Minister for Finance has indicated that he will deal with adjustments to capital envelopes as part of his budget speech on 1 December and accordingly I am not in a position today to indicate the precise allocation for primary buildings in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">I assure the Deputy, however, that within the €50 million carry-over capacity available to me I will ensure that any saving in relation to primary buildings in the current year is fully compensated for in setting the 2005 allocation.</p>

          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_417">
            <from>Ms Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_1138">Will the Minister announce only the 2005 building programme in December or will she announce the five year programme? Given that public private partnerships have been used only for post-primary schools to date does she intend to use some public private partnerships for primary schools? How does she intend to prioritise? Priority was allowed for when the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, changed the way the building programme operated but schools are still unclear as to whether they are at stage 1, band 1 or whatever and what that means and how soon it is envisaged progress will be made? Does she intend to change anything in that area?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_418" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1139">I will certainly publish my five-year allocation of capital and within a framework the stages at which the different schools are. It is important to have flexibility to deal with emergencies and changing priorities over the next five years. In the initial stage I will announce those ready to go to tender and construction and then those that are ready to move up to the next stage. However, I do not want to be in a situation, where we find ourselves at the end of this year with an under-spend in the year and without flexibility to move over the next couple of years. We are aiming to ensure that schools know where they stand and how soon they will be able to move. However, because there are local considerations regarding planning permission, it may not be possible for me to say that a particular school will move in 2006 as an appeal to An Bord Pleanála could hold it up for quite some time. These are the issues we have to take into consideration. My aim is to ensure there is as much clarity as possible for schools all over the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">In regard to the PPP programme my intention is to build schools under PPP. It is not as easy to do it at primary level because of management issues, largely boards of management. If there are trustees it is not so easy to go into partnership with a builder or developer who will manage it over the next 20 years. I am trying to see if there is any flexibility but it is not as clear cut as for the post-primary level where we are aiming to do more.</p>

          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_419">
            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_1141">Is the Minister aware of the finding by the Comptroller and Auditor General that PPPs are more expensive that any other method? Last year a number of schools that urgently needed extra classrooms were told to use either their PE room or general purposes room as classrooms because they did not feature in the building programme. Can the Minister give a guarantee that will not happen next year? There is one such school in the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, and one in mine. Will the Minister ensure that those schools get back their PE room as a PE room and get a classroom?</p>

            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1142">In regard to the provision of accommodation we have to look at the amount of money available at any one time and where we can provide temporary accommodation or, perhaps a devolved grant, to a small school to build on a extension. That would be preferable but it would not be possible to give a blanket guarantee at this stage to say they cannot use the facilities available to them. I will certainly aim to ensure we are adding to rather than taking from school accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">On the issue of PPPs the reality is that the Comptroller and Auditor General said they were more expensive. However, the cost has to be ascertained over a 20 year period. The schools are built and the students are occupying them. If those schools were on a building programme they would still probably be waiting. By the time we would get to build them they would be much more expensive than when they were built last year or the year before. When one looks back in hindsight one will find they were good value for money. He is looking at the cost today whereas the cost has to be spread out over the whole period.</p>

            <p eId="para_1144">Given the issue of efficiency over a long period, and the fact that Jarvis has more or less gone bankrupt in a number of projects in the UK, will the Minister consider setting up a system of integrated public partnership where a school facility, incorporating community buildings and sports facilities as part of a partnership between the school, the local community and the local authority, could be set up in a parallel process to the public private partnership to gain efficiency in terms of opening hours and security? Perhaps it could be tried as a pilot scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1145">The issue of schools opening up their facilities is a matter for management. Where new schools are built they include PE halls but there are instances where local management are not making facilities available. Generally the facilities in PPP schools are available to the wider community.</p>

            <p eId="para_1148">In the case of third level, the agenda is set by the Kelly report on a "Review and Prioritisation of Capital Projects in the Higher Education Sector".

Will she continue the reliance of her predecessor on providing for prefabs and what he called, good quality temporary accommodation? I was amazed to have been invited to an opening of what I thought were classrooms in my constituency last year to discover they were prefabs. That is not an adequate way to proceed. They may be a slightly better quality than what was there before but they will still run into the same problems down the road.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">On the issue of public private partnerships, will the Minister clarify the position in regard to the use of those facilities after hours by sporting organisations? Who would have control of a public private partnership school? Is it the operator, be it Jarvis or whoever, and can they charge what they wish to community groups to use the facility? Does the Minister have an opinion on the fact that in the five public private partnerships schools there are coke machines and mars bar machines in the corridors? The principals and boards of management of the schools are unable to prevent the use of such machines to make money from children. This practice is obviously promoting poor dietary habits.</p>

            <p eId="para_1153">I understand that the management of the schools rests with the management bodies rather than the principals. I will provide the Deputy with details on after-school hours etc. I would be concerned if a principal were not able to control soft drinks and sweet machines. Most principals adopt a responsible and positive approach to these in their schools. I am sure that, by local arrangement with management and with health considerations and responsible teaching practices in mind, they should be able to address the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">On temporary accommodation, the reality is that new prefabs constitute good-quality temporary accommodation. Many of them last for 20 or 30 years. They are ideal in cases where there is a blip in demographic trends such that there is an increase in enrolment for a few years. One might need them while building is taking place or while a school is waiting for a building project to commence, thus relieving the pressure on numbers. Obviously, if a school needs a small extension that costs a few hundred thousand euro while a prefab costs €70,000, we must consider how to achieve the best value for money. In many such cases, prefabricated temporary accommodation is needed in the interim. We obviously seek to address all these issues.</p>

        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
        if she intends to allow for the release of a greater amount of information on the performance of schools to parents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
        [30475/04]
      </p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_426" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1156">The Deputy's question refers to the performance of schools and I want to begin by reflecting on what constitutes school performance. The true measure of a school's achievement is the extent to which it enables each student to realise his or her full potential as an individual and as a member of society. Each young person is unique. Each enters our education system with different skills and attributes and each comes from a different family background. The job of the school is to take that unique person and equip him or her to live a worthwhile and fulfilling life.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">When we talk about school performance, it is not good enough to apply a single superficial measure, be it examination results or levels of college entry, and to categorise a school as succeeding or failing on that basis. Unfortunately, there is a real tendency to do just that. I was appalled to see in <i>The Sunday Times</i> last week selective and misleading league tables under the headline “Rural schools a failure”. This conclusion is based solely on levels of entry to university. This is an elitist, misleading and outrageous evaluation of the essence of every school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">I favour the release of information that is fair and meaningful and can benefit the child. I do not, however, favour the release of information that allows for schools to be unfairly labelled as the worst in the country, as another headline indicated in reference to an area where, in the journalist's opinion, "the worst performing schools were located", or to be labelled the best in the country based on narrow criteria. For this reason, I will continue to refuse to release examination results on a case by case basis. I am, however, very much in favour of parents having access to meaningful information. I intend to consider, in consultation with the education partners, how we can improve in this area.</p>

            <from>Ms Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_1159">I support the concept of information being given to parents and I stress that information on individual teachers or students should never be made public. However, we are now allowing the very worst scenario to obtain in that newspapers are able to obtain such information and use very limited criteria to evaluate schools and, in some cases, students from particular areas. On the basis of what was stated in <i>The Sunday Times</i> and repeated in the media on Monday, the students from my constituency appear to be the worst in the country. This is not the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">What does the Minister intend to do about this issue? Unless clearer criteria are established regarding the information to be released to parents, such that they can make decisions on a school as a whole and what is available therein, parents will continue to make decisions based on insufficient criteria and on examination results alone, such as were published in the newspapers. The summaries provided in Monday's newspapers were particularly misleading because they dealt only with universities and made no mention of institutes of technology. This is of concern because many students from rural constituencies go to institutes of technology for geographical reasons rather than for any other reason.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">What are the Minister's intentions? Does she believe legislation needs to be introduced so that meaningful and useful information that is not limited to academic criteria can be provided?</p>
          </speech>

            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1162">The Deputy and I agree on many aspects of this issue. Obviously, it is difficult to state in tabular form all the work that is done in a school. One cannot account for the dedication to sport, music, cross-Border exchanges, social work and work experience, for example, or the fact that most schools derive as much pleasure from a very weak student receiving a pass in his leaving certificate as they do from a very bright student obtaining eight A grades. These phenomena are very difficult to put on paper. At the same time, there is a need for information for a range of people. Parents want information about their local schools to find the one that best suits their children. Boards of management and teachers obviously require information on the ways in which they need to change and adapt to suit their needs. Local authorities, State agencies, health boards and various services including the National Educational Psychological Service, the National Educational Welfare Board and the National Council for Special Education all require information. Information is required in the provision of support services and in terms of site acquisitions and the use of land in an area. The Department needs it for decision making and policy making.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">We need a process by which we can obtain information required by everybody but not allow it to be used in league table form or for comparative purposes. We need to work very closely with all the education partners to ascertain how we could provide information in a way that would ultimately benefit the child and not the sale of newspapers. I know the education partners are willing to do this</p>

            <p eId="para_1164">I concur with both the Minister and Deputy Enright on the narrowness of the information published in the newspapers and on the headline in particular. I felt that rural schools fared quite well if one took all the information, including that pertaining to ITs, into account. State schools, non-fee-paying schools, did quite well in the broader picture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1165">I urge the Minister to take proactive measures. What specifically does she intend to do in terms of drawing up a broad policy on the kind of information that needs to be circulated and on how we can counteract the use of inadequate information?</p>

            <p eId="para_1166">The Deputy will be aware that my predecessor conducted quite a large consultation process, the YES process, throughout the country. As part of this process, an attitudinal survey was carried out which indicated that parents want more information. There is considerable public support for this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1167">People find the whole-school evaluation to be very positive. Perhaps there are ways of using the information gleaned in this process in which inspectors visit schools and involve the teachers, principals, students and parents. Such information highlights the best aspects of a school rather than its academic achievements and identifies how it targets each child. It is time to strike a balance between providing the information required and ensuring it is not used inappropriately. I am genuinely trying to do this at present.</p>

            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1171">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 24 and 29 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents, guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers are being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally. The budget which has been allocated to the National Educational Welfare Board for 2005 is €7.8 million, an increase of €1.3 million, or 20%, on the 2004 allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">My Department has already conveyed approval to the board for the filling of a further ten educational welfare officer posts, bringing the authorised staffing for the board from 84 to 94. The additional posts will enable the board to further roll out its services at local level around the country. The percentage increase being allocated to the board for 2005 is more than double that for the education Vote as a whole. This provision will enable the board to continue to develop its services in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">I will keep the board's staffing under review in the light of the roll-out of services and any further proposals the board may put to me in regard to clearly identified priority needs.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_432">
            <from>Ms Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_1176">I welcome the additional funding but it is short of what the National Educational Welfare Board sought. I wish to draw the Minister's attention to comments made by Mr. Eddie Ward of the National Educational Welfare Board who said that the service is in danger of developing only as a reactive fire fighting agency. What we are asking for is very important in terms of tackling educational disadvantage, given the significant figure of 84,000 primary and post-primary students missing more than 20 days, the drop-out figures and the failure of transition from primary to post-primary education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1177">I welcome the fact that the Minister will examine the issue. Has she a timetable or plan to achieve the aim of reducing the ratio of educational welfare officer to student from 1:12,000 to 1:5,000? Is this an aim she would like to realise?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_433" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1178">The board is currently based in five locations, Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. Given the increase in staff, every county throughout the country will be covered, which is real progress. There will be designated staff in the RAPID towns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1179">I would like if members of the board became involved in the work we are doing in the schools where we are tackling attendance and disadvantage. I would like to see them working more closely with the home-school community liaison officers, of whom there are 370. I do not want to wait until a problem exists where children may have missed 20 days or more. I would like them to work with the people already in the schools to encourage children to remain in school. This is one of the real success stories.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">There are 82 co-ordinators involved in the school completion programme. These people link with the other services and primary schools to ensure pupils make the transition from first level to second level. There are 40 specialist teachers working with Travellers and we recognise that Traveller education is particularly difficult. Now that the educational welfare board is based in every county, it should be building on the work others will be doing. I intend ploughing money into these areas next year as part of the overall programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">It is interesting to note that when we talk about students missing over 20 days, we tend to focus on disadvantaged students who do not attend school. Many of these students go on two continental holidays a year and miss days. They are equally losing out on their education. We should not assume it is a welfare issue, but it is certainly an education issue.</p>

            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_1182">While I have problems with the amount of money allocated, I welcome the fact that the ten posts have been sanctioned and I understand the staff can now be appointed. This matter was raised recently by members of the National Educational Welfare Board in the education committee. Will the embargo on public service workers cause a difficulty in terms of the extra posts announced in the Estimates?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_435" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1183">I do not envisage a difficulty in this area. There were comments in the newspapers that I might have to cut back 430 posts. There have been no discussions on that issue. I have received sanction to create various new posts in regard to special needs.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_436">
            <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
            <p eId="para_1184">The Minister will be aware that last year the National Educational Welfare Board sought €25 million and this year it sought an extra €13 million. While the 20% increase to €7.8 million would be very welcome, obviously they are seeking that amount of money because they are aware of the problems that exist. It pointed out that 20 days or more are being missed by a considerable number of pupils and that one in seven children leave primary school with literacy problems. Does the Minister acknowledge that there is a need to sort out the problem during the lifetime of the Government? In that context, will she give a timeframe as to when the full roll-out of 300 educational welfare officers will be sanctioned and over what period?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_437" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1185">I hope we will never reach a stage where we will need 300 educational welfare officers, because this would be the stick approach rather than the carrot approach. The home-school liaison and school completion programmes, targeting disadvantage and targeting programmes at pre-school and early school level and working with the parents and families is where the real benefit can be gained. If we are successful in this area, we will not need 300 educational welfare officers. Obviously we will continue to expand the service, but now that every county is covered, I hope there will be progress with everyone working in consultation with each other.</p>

            <from>Ms Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_1186">The drop-out rates have been increasing over the years despite these schemes being in place.</p>

            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1187">What has been focused on is that people might not have achieved the leaving certificate or junior certificate. Those who work with the disadvantaged — I believe they are correct — believe we should be focusing on those people who leave school without certification as opposed to just dropping out. Many people obtain certification which is not the junior certificate or leaving certificate, to which we are not giving sufficient recognition.</p>

            <p eId="para_1189">Equally, the number assessed in the NES document was based on very raw data, most of which cannot be substantiated. I acknowledge there is a problem in regard to the transfer of information from first level to second level, which is why the school completion programme is very useful. This works in a cluster of second level schools and primary schools to ensure all the activities and links exist between the two to encourage children to continue their education.</p>

        <b>Mr. Quinn</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
        the number of properties transferred to the State by religious orders to date under the redress scheme; the value of this property; if there are properties to be transferred outstanding; the purpose intended for these properties; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_442" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1191">The indemnity agreement provided that the property contribution of the congregations was to be divided into two separate and distinct schedules of properties as follows. First, properties to be transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies and local authorities after the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002. The total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be €36.54 million. I can confirm that agreement in principle has been reached with the religious congregations on the transfer of 35 properties to the amount of €38.28 million. This figure of €38.28 million includes €4.98 million in cash that was provided by the congregations in lieu of property. Second, regarding properties transferred from the congregations to the State, State agencies, local authorities or voluntary organisations between 11 May 1999 and the date of the signing of the indemnity agreement on 5 June 2002, the total value of these property transfers for the purposes of the indemnity agreement was to be €40.32 million. I can confirm that, at this stage, transfers of 27 properties to the value of approximately €32.93 million have been agreed in principle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">One further property was under consideration by my Department but this has now been declined and the congregations have been informed of the decision. My Department has written to CORI suggesting they should now consider offering a cash sum in order to finalise the property aspect of the agreement. My Department is awaiting a response to this letter. Arrangements for the final valuation and legal transfer of these properties are the responsibility of the individual transferees. My Department will continue to liaise with the various transferees to ensure that all properties on which agreement in principle has been reached are legally transferred.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">The list of properties accepted to date will be circulated.</p>

            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_1194">I received a list previously which is probably the same list the Minister will circulate. Some of the properties are in my area, with which I am familiar. Others are in various parts of the country so I do not know much about them. This is in substitution for taxpayers' money which will be paid to victims of abuse, therefore, the public is entitled to know a little bit more about the properties and the use to which they will be put. One property in my constituency has been handed over to the Irish Wheelchair Association. Its perception was that it was getting this property from the nuns rather than from the State. More clarity is needed in the public interest. Will the Minister give detailed information on the uses of the different properties?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_444" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1195">The lists I am circulating today indicate more specifically where the property is to go. Of the first list — properties accepted under the terms of the redress scheme to be transferred, and alternative properties after 2002 after the date of signing — six properties go to the Department of Education and Science, one to Dublin City Council, three to the Eastern Regional Health Authority, two to the Mid-Western Health Board, one to the Office of Public Works and a number to the Southern Health Board. Of the second list, a substantial property in my constituency in Blackrock will go to the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, one will go to the Ballymote Childcare Association, a couple to housing projects and a number will go back to the Department. One will go to the Hospital Voluntary Housing Association, two to the Irish Wheelchair Association, one to PACE and one to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. There is a range of properties. I will circulate the information, which might be of use to the Deputy.</p>

        <b>Mr. Gormley</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
        the plans in place to roll out the additional funding in the areas of special education and educational disadvantage to ensure that this funding goes to those who need it most in the areas of early childhood education and literacy; if this will include a new commitment to reduce class sizes in primary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.
        [30631/04]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_445" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1197">Every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs receive an education appropriate to their needs. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each case are based on the professionally-assessed needs of the individual child. My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special needs and the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">At present, there are more than 5,700 teachers in primary schools supporting pupils with special educational and learning support needs. In addition, there are in excess of 5,000 special needs assistant posts allocated to meet the special care needs of such pupils. Those posts assist nearly 6,000 children. The enactment of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and the establishment of the National Council for Special Education will provide the key building blocks to underpin service delivery in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">My approach in addressing the issue of educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government's National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2003-2005 and the latest partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative focused on literacy, numeracy and early school leavers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">A key focus of education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups. A sum of €540 million is being provided by my Department in 2004 for programmes specifically designed to tackle educational disadvantage. This direct expenditure on educational disadvantage represents an increase of over €80 million on the 2003 provision and nearly 8.5% of the net education budget for 2004. The approach for education set out in the national action plan is based on a continuum of provision, from early childhood through adulthood, with the focus on preventive strategies, targeting and integrated community responses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">My Department is finalising an overall review of its educational disadvantage programmes, with a view to building on what has been achieved to date, adopting a more systematic, targeted and integrated approach and strengthening the capacity of the system to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged children and young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1202">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. Arising from these improvements, class sizes have reduced in the same period. The overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule has been reduced from 35 to 29.</p>
            <p eId="para_1203">In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. This, however, can be done only on a phased basis having regard to the available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. The timing and manner in which the target set out in the programme for Government can be met is being examined by my Department in consultation with the education partners. My priority as Minister for Education and Science will be to continue targeting resources at those areas and people most in need.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
            <p eId="para_1204">In terms of prioritising spending from this very welcome additional investment, will the Minister agree that the circulars stating the number of hours to be allocated to children with special educational needs, as opposed to what is recommended in private assessments, is very much resource driven and that if the needs of children were taken into consideration and further funding provided, such circulars would not be necessary? Will the Minister acknowledge that this is an area that could be examined with a view to providing additional hours of speech therapy to certain children? Another area that could be examined is that of early learning support and child care because children are helped if they are involved and given socialisation skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1205">Will the Minister also acknowledge that given that surveys show that there is high unemployment among graduates of a number of teacher training colleges, it would be preferable, rather than increasing the number of SNA's in some instances, to employ more teachers and reduce the pupil-teacher ratio?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_447" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1206">It is important to be clear as to functions of special needs assistants. The circular states that these are for children with significant physical and medical needs or whose behaviour is likely to be such as to cause them to be a danger to themselves or to others. That there are now 6,000 such children in our system is a tribute to the educational system, to the parents who were able to have them integrated and particularly to the teachers who welcome them into their classes with the other children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">I do not understand the Deputy's reference to circulars for individual children. If there is one area that is very much child focused it is special needs where individual assessments are examined and the level of need is determined.</p>

            <p eId="para_1209">That is why it has grown so substantially over recent years. The Deputy referred to early learning support. We are all agreed on the importance of early intervention for all children, whether they are early learners, children with special needs or children from disadvantaged areas. A cross-departmental high level group is examining the early childhood area to ensure we do not end up putting money into capital for child care and ignoring the developmental and educational aspects. I believe that is the way forward in that area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1210">The Minister indicated that this is child focused.

            <p eId="para_1211">Regarding special needs assistants, will the Minister review the situation where certain children who have been granted special needs assistants until lunch time are in class until 3 p.m. and have no special needs assistant during the afternoon?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_452" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1212">Two days after the last occasion on which I answered questions here, when I gave a commitment that I would deal with this issue speedily, I announced an extra 295 posts, which cater for nearly 500 children. For many of those children, the length of time during which assistants were available was extended and those hours were spread out. Children do not necessarily need somebody with them all the time while at school. Child psychologists indicate it is very important that children do not develop a total dependency on having somebody with them. That is why it is important to examine the needs of the child regarding special needs assistance and that is why the special needs organisers under the special education council are working with schools, services and parents locally to see what is in the best interests of the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1213">Regarding resource teaching hours, at the time I announced the 295 extra posts I also announced that I am reviewing that whole system. It is a very good principle that the resources should be in place before the child comes into the school. That is a valuable way to proceed. However, it came to my attention that small and rural schools in particular would lose out and that children who were in need of a service might not be able to get it. That is why I am reviewing the system previously announced.</p>

            <p eId="para_1217">The legislation for the establishment of the Grangegorman Development Agency is before the House with Committee Stage scheduled for the Dáil Select Committee on Education and Science on 2 December 2004. The purpose of this Bill is to establish an agency whose function in the first instance is to prepare a strategic planning scheme for the Grangegorman site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1218">The plan must provide for the needs of the Dublin Institute of Technology, the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Ministers for Education and Science and Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1219">The Bill provides for wide-ranging consultation with all the parties that may have an involvement in the site. This ranges from those who are directly concerned — local residents, DIT, ERHA and Dublin City Council — to those parties whose future involvement may have a bearing on the site reaching its full potential, such as IDA Ireland and Dublin Bus. The Department of Transport will also have a major input because of the public transport requirements of the developed site.</p>
            <p eId="para_1220">It is my intention, once the necessary legislative framework is in place, to establish the agency as soon as possible thereafter so that it can commence carrying out the functions given to it in the legislation.</p>

            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1222">I am aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has moved to tackle the issue on a number of fronts. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools on anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1223">SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools. The SPHE curriculum provides for the development of personal and social skills including self-awareness, respect for others, self-esteem and communications skills, all of which are important elements in addressing the issue of bullying. In primary education, the issue of bullying is addressed in the SPHE curriculum, in the strand called Myself and Others, from infant classes onwards. In second level education, the issue of bullying is addressed from first year onwards in the SPHE curriculum at junior cycle, in the module called Belonging and Integrating.</p>
            <p eId="para_1224">My Department, in its guidelines on countering bullying behaviour in schools, has provided a national framework within which individual school management authorities may meet their responsibilities for implementing effective, school-based policies to counter bullying. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1225">Each school is required to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour within the framework of an overall school code of behaviour and discipline. Such a code, properly devised and implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools.</p>

            <from>Ms Enright</from>
            <p eId="para_1226">Does the Minister accept the code may work better in some schools than in others? I would not raise this issue if I did not think there was a better way of tackling this. Will the Minister take the time to meet representatives from Trinity College who carried out a pilot programme in County Donegal which has proved extremely successful in that the instance of bullying there has been reduced dramatically.</p>
            <p eId="para_1227">These representatives came before the Joint Committee on Education and Science. Given their findings, which have been adopted nationally by the Norwegian Government without the carrying out of a pilot project, will the Minister consider implementing this type of policy? While I realise there must be changes in different areas for different reasons and that policy must suit each particular school, we could at least try to have best practice in this area, which we do not have at present. If we used this type of programme, we could achieve best practice. It is not an issue that is heavily resource dependent.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_458" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1228">From my personal experience, significant advances have been made in the tackling of bullying, especially with primary schoolchildren, because there is awareness among children of what bullying is and that they can complain about it and tackle it. The schools are the best place to deal with this because they know their school profile — the children, the parents and the support they can get from other bodies to develop a policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1229">Deputy Enright referred to the anti-bullying research and resource centre at the department of education in Trinity College, under the direction of Professor Mona O'Moore. Professor O'Moore is known to me as she was on the board of management of the school at which I taught. She recently took the opportunity to discuss her anti-bullying intervention programme with me at my constituency clinic, which, before the rest of the country turns up, is for my constituents only. The Department funded the replacement costs for the pilot study in County Donegal, which Professor O'Moore is anxious to extend to the entire country. For this year, she sought in-service training among other measures, but such issues must be set out well in advance so that parents and others know exactly what day schools will be closed, when the in-service days will take place, how that trainers will be organised etc. The teacher education centre in my Department will conduct ongoing work with the centre in Trinity College to find how we can develop this because bullying is an issue with which we are all concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_1233">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 36 and 39 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1234">The OECD review on the future of higher education in Ireland makes far-reaching recommendations for reform and development of the sector. The extensive consultation undertaken by the OECD team with all of the key stakeholders in the sector and their own undoubted expertise lend considerable weight to these recommendations. Obviously it is now incumbent on me to give serious consideration to possible implementation approaches and also to engage in consultation with my colleagues in Government and with the Higher Education Authority, the universities and the institutes of technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1235">From the outset, it is important to note that a number of the recommendations, such as the designation of the institutes of technology within the proposed new tertiary education authority, require legislative amendments while others, such as the structures required to maximise research output, require extensive consultation, not only with the agencies involved but also with my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Since my appointment, I have already met representatives from the universities and the institutes of technology and emphasised my commitment to progress the recommendations of the OECD. I hope to start an intensive round of formal consultation early in the new year with the appropriate parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1236">I have already signalled the Government's position on the re-introduction of fees for undergraduate programmes and, once again, I emphasise that this will not take place during the lifetime of this Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_1238">This clearly places pressure on funding in higher education and I was therefore pleased to be able to announce recently in the context of the 2005 Estimates that I had secured a 35% increase for research funding in the sector, in addition to increases of 6% and 7% respectively for recurrent funding in the universities and institutes of technology. These increases represent a step in the right direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1239">The OECD report also makes important recommendations on governance and leadership of higher education institutions and gives us a detailed analysis of required changes to the funding allocation model for the sector. The Higher Education Authority, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, is already working on a revised funding mechanism.</p>

            <p eId="para_1241">Does the Minister intend to bring institutes of technology under the Higher Education Authority, which is one of the recommendations? The institutes are concerned with the recommendation that they would no longer be allowed to have PhD programmes and there is validity in their argument, to which I have listened. Will the Minister consider these two areas in regard to the institutes of technology?</p>

I will only do this in consultation with all the relevant bodies, with which I intend to formally consult immediately.</p>

          <heading>Ukrainian Presidential Elections.</heading>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_466">
            <from>Mr. Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_1245">I thank the Ceann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this issue, which is of immense importance internationally for Europe, Ireland and, in particular, for the region of which Ukraine is part. I want to use this opportunity to establish the Government's response to what is a deepening crisis within one of the EU's largest neighbours, Ukraine, following the second round of voting in the presidential elections there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">It has become clear that the Ukrainian authorities did not conduct the presidential election according to democratic standards. They have discarded the right of the 48 million population of Ukraine to freely elect their President and seriously failed to honour fundamental commitments into which Ukraine entered within the framework of the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The OSCE-led international election observation mission, including MEPs, to some of whom I have spoken and who have reported to the European Parliament, concluded that the Ukrainian authorities failed to take remedial action after the first round of voteing to redress biased coverage in state media, misuse of state resources and pressure on certain categories of voters to support the Moscow-backed candidate, Mr. Yanukovich.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">Overall, the second round of voting appears to have been conducted in an even worse manner than the first. A pattern of intimidation of observers, polling commission members and individual voters is reported. Voter turnout, approaching 100% in certain regions, extensive use of absentee voting certificates and of mobile ballot boxes are also highly suspect. All balanced observers strongly maintain that if free and fair elections had taken place, the reformist candidate, Mr. Yushchenko, would have been the winner. This is also confirmed by exit polls taken during the first and second round of votes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">Some 200,000 supporters of Mr. Yushchenko are now on the streets of Kiev, in the freezing cold, and the country is poised in crisis, peacefully so far, thank God. This afternoon, the Ukrainian Supreme Court banned the publication of election results which officials say hand victory to Mr. Yanukovich. The EU as a promoter of human rights and democracy cannot stand idly by and indeed is not standing by. I am glad to say that Mr. Solana is using all diplomatic means available to him to find a peaceful resolution with which to move forward in the Ukraine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">An official Irish Government position should be unambiguous and clear and should state that we do not recognise or accept the result of the elections until all concerns about electoral fraud are addressed and we have either an acceptable recount or else a re-election.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">Has the Minister of State met the Ukrainian ambassador to Ireland, and if so, what discussions have taken place with him?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_467">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1251">I formally congratulate Deputy Coveney on his election to the European Parliament and I commend him on the work he is doing for human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1252">I welcome the opportunity to respond to this matter on the Adjournment. I do not wish to be facetious but the first and only time I met the Ukrainian ambassador was in the Dáil Chamber this evening on my way to deliver this report. That would not amount to very much in terms of a discussion about the issue before us.</p>
            <p eId="para_1253">I accept the basic analysis put forward by Deputy Coveney, in particular the reservations about the number of votes cast in certain areas which were greater than the number of voters there. That is clearly an unacceptable practice over which no one could stand, least of all the Irish Government or the EU. I also accept the criticisms advanced by Deputy Coveney with regard to the biased coverage in the state media networks in the Ukraine. That is an issue of great concern to us. While no one can predict what the result of the election might have been if some of these practices had not occurred, I fully acknowledge what the Deputy said with regard to the finely balanced nature of the result. The result was so close that the issue raised is brought into sharp relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">The Minister for Foreign Affairs has asked me to make a statement on his behalf on our position and that of the European Union on the situation in the Ukraine. It is the sincere hope of the Minister and the Government that the current political impasse in the Ukraine will be resolved without violence in a manner acceptable to its people and which reflects democratic values. Earlier today, the Minister urged the Ukrainian authorities and opposition leaders to seek a political solution which meets these conditions. On the Minister's behalf, I repeat this call before the House this evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">President Kuchma has assured the international community that force will not be used against peaceful demonstrators. We expect this pledge to be respected. Ireland and our European Union partners have viewed the presidential elections in the Ukraine as a litmus test of the democratic values we want the Ukraine to share with us. The Ukraine is a European country and we judge it by European standards. We would be immensely disappointed if this signal opportunity for the Ukraine to demonstrate its democratic credentials were to be lost.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said earlier today, Ireland with the European Union Presidency, does not believe that the official results announced by the central election commission yesterday evening reflect the will of the Ukrainian people. The OSCE monitoring mission to the Ukraine found that the two rounds of elections failed to meet international standards. We fully subscribe to these findings. Ireland sent three short-term observers to the first round of elections and four short-term observers to the second round.</p>
            <p eId="para_1257">Preliminary findings from the OSCE mission to the second round of elections on Sunday clearly pointed to serious deficiencies in the election campaign, principally unbalanced coverage by the state media and the misuse of state resources. With regard to the conduct of the voting, the mission found there were serious problems with voter lists, absentee ballots, the conduct of the count and a lack of legal redress for complaints.</p>
            <p eId="para_1258">I reiterate the call of the EU Presidency for the Ukrainian authorities to engage immediately with the OSCE monitoring mission in reviewing the electoral processes and results. I am referring here to the central election commission and the courts. The review must be conducted in full accordance with Ukrainian law. I understand that the Bulgarian chair of the OSCE has been in contact with the Ukrainian authorities to call for this review as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">We regret that the central election commission took the step yesterday of announcing the results of the second round of elections without first addressing the serious concerns identified by the OSCE monitoring mission and other reputable international observers. It now falls to the President and Parliament of the Ukraine to resolve this issue by exploring all legal and political options. Given the scale of the irregularities identified, a simple recount of the vote would not serve any purpose. Our position on that matter is very strong.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The European Union has been very exercised and concerned by the situation that has evolved over the past three days. A special representative of the Presidency of the Council, former Ambassador Niek Biegman, is in Kiev to present the views of the European Union and assist with the mediation process where possible. High Representative Javier Solana has been in close touch with US Secretary of State Colin Powell and with President Kwasniewski of Poland, whose country currently holds the presidency of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe. The President of Poland has dispatched a team of experts to Kiev to assist with the negotiation process. The High Representative is also in touch with the Bulgarian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Solomon Passy, who occupies the position of chairman in office of the OSCE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">In addition, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Jan Peter Balkenende, as President of the European Union, has had direct contact with President Kuchma and with the chairman of the Ukrainian Parliament on Tuesday. The Prime Minister expressed the serious concern of the European Union at the conduct of the election and emphasised the need for a peaceful resolution to the current situation. The Prime Minister also called on President Kuchma to show restraint and address the current protests in an orderly and non-violent way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1262">I provide these details to the House in order to underline the intensity of efforts on the part of the European Union to promote a peaceful outcome to the current impasse. As in the case of our European Union partners, the concerns of the Minister of Foreign Affairs regarding these elections were conveyed directly to the Ukrainian Ambassador to Ireland, His Excellency Yevhen Perelygin, yesterday when he was called to the Department of Foreign Affairs. As Deputy Coveney knows, that is a formal process which we undertake in diplomatic terms to underline our serious concerns. It does not happen every day and was done with a specific purpose.</p>

            <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_1263">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me this opportunity to raise in the House a disturbing incident. I am sure the country is aware of the vicious attack on an elderly man in my constituency, namely William Bartley, a 74-year-old pensioner living on his own outside Donegal town. A week before the attack he came out of hospital after a serious operation, was at home recuperating, and was doing very well. In the middle of the night he was attacked in his own home and beaten beyond recognition. I am sure the Minister saw the photographs in yesterday's national press. The photograph is in the Donegal press this evening. I have a copy of it with me but I am aware I may not show it in the House. I am not allowed to show the newspaper to the House and I always abide by the rulings of the Chair.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">It has scandalised the people of Donegal that an attack such as this should be perpetrated on an innocent man, one of the nicest neighbours one could have. He is a hard working farmer, an excellent neighbour and a highly respected member of his community. William Bartley is in Letterkenny Hospital this evening. Less than an hour ago, I was in touch with the hospital and I am glad to report that, according to the ward sister, he is comfortable. However, he will be in hospital for another while during his recuperation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident; it is one of a series of such incidents which have taken place in Donegal in recent months. At the beginning of September, a neighbour of Mr. Bartley, John Logue, was similarly attacked in his house during the hours of darkness. He was found by kind neighbours the following morning seriously injured on the floor of his house. The only difference between John Logue and William Bartley is that John Logue is 92 years of age. He was in Letterkenny Hospital for a number of weeks and was subsequently moved to Donegal Hospital where I visited him on a number of occasions. I am glad to say that in spite of the vicious attack he sustained, he is at home recuperating and doing very well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">It is no wonder people in Donegal are scandalised by these happenings and that elderly people living in isolated areas, and in many cases not so isolated areas, are afraid to go to sleep in their beds at night. I have been reliably told that some of them are staying up all night and are only going to bed during the day when they feel safer. What kind of society are we creating that people, who have contributed so much to this country through their hard labour — hard working people, small farmers who have lived in the area for many years — cannot rest safely in their own homes in their declining years? It says much for the society we are creating.</p>
            <p eId="para_1267">As a country, our priority should be to make these people feel safe in their houses. We should be there for them and should protect them. What is happening to these people could happen to us in years to come. I am not blaming the Garda Síochána. I did not come into the House to attach blame to anyone. The only people to whom I attach blame are the vicious criminals who perpetrated these acts. I agree with the headline in the <i>Donegal People’s Press </i>this week that only animals would do this, although animals would not to this to their own. These matters must be taken seriously.</p>
            <p eId="para_1268">The Garda are doing their level best. I do not expect them to be there 24 hours per day, seven days per week and 365 days per year. They must work and rest like the rest of us. However, they should at least be given any resources required to hunt down these inhumane criminals, bring them to justice and put them where they should be and where they are not a danger to elderly people, including septuagenarians and nonagenarians in my constituency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1269">Both gentlemen, William Bartley and John Logue, are known to me, as I am sure they are known to the Minister's colleagues, and they wrote to me regularly. I am very annoyed that this should happen to these good citizens who have given so much in the service of this country and who do not feel safe in their houses anymore. It is a very serious issue. The Garda are doing their best but they must be given the resources. I appeal to their neighbours, and to the neighbours of all such people, to be constantly on the look out, to look after them and to ensure such attacks do not recur. If that is happens, a good day's work will have been done. The people of Donegal expect some action and want to see these people apprehended as soon as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1270">I thank Deputy McGinley for raising a very serious issue. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law shares the concern, as would the public, about attacks on elderly members of our population. I saw the photograph in the newspaper of the poor man who was attacked. It was quite appalling, a barbaric attack on an elderly man. I, too, wish him a speedy recovery and hope he will have the courage to return to his normal life with the support of his neighbours and community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1271">Deputy McGinley put the case in a very responsible way and recognised the importance of community and of the Garda. Successful programmes include the neighbourhood watch and the community alert schemes. They are very tangible and practical ways of dealing with crime prevention at community level. They work well because they have the support and involvement of people who care for their local community, who are willing to give their time and make the effort. Neighbourhood watch has gone from strength to strength since 1985. Civic-minded people are working in co-operation with the Garda and are looking after neighbours in their community. That, too, has helped to foster positive relations between the Garda and the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">As Deputy McGinley said, we need to expand that type of involvement to areas not covered. The community alert programme has been in place since 1985. Approximately 1,110 local groups are involved in it and are trying to improve the quality of life for people in rural areas. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform contributes annually to funding that programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">The Deputy spoke about one particularly sad case, and I know it will be of no comfort to him for me to talk about the numbers of assaults, but it is important to put on record that 1,100 fewer people were the victims of serious assault — a reduction of 22% — and over 2,300 fewer people were the victims of minor assaults — reduction of 14% — in 2003 compared with 2002. It would appear from the provisional statistics for the first nine months of 2004 that there is a further reduction of 7%. It is important to put things in perspective while appreciating that it is of no comfort to an individual like this poor man who was so brutally attacked.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">As Deputy McGinley said, crime prevention is not only a matter for the Garda but is one which is of importance to the entire community. The development of a comprehensive strategy to prevent and reduce crime is imperative and requires community involvement. The Deputy will be aware that the national crime council recommended the establishment of a national crime prevention model and recommended that it commence with a pilot in three city and county development boards. The Garda Síochána Bill provides for the establishment of joint policing committees by local authorities and the Garda Commissioner and for the issuing of guidelines by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform with the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. These guidelines concern the establishment and maintenance of the committees and may also include provision for the establishment of the committees within the framework of city and county development boards and for their funding. There is great scope for those committees to serve as a forum for consultations, discussions and recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">The Garda Síochána Bill takes up a number of the recommendations made by the crime council. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform believes that implementation of the crime council's recommendations, including the commencement of pilots, should take place in the context of implementation of the Garda Síochána Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">Deputy McGinley rightly paid tribute to the Garda who do such work throughout the country. The Garda place great store on fostering community spirit and work hand in hand with communities. There is the youth diversion project in the Donegal division and the Leaf project situated in Raphoe. The Garda use diversion projects and work in consultation with local communities and youth service providers. The multi-agency approach can be very successful. The personnel strength in the Donegal division is 416, all ranks, as at 24 November. That will be kept under review as needs develop and in the context of the overall needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. I am not sure if the Deputy saw the advertisement campaign in today's newspapers for recruitment of the extra gardaí.</p>

            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1279">I was shocked at the disclosure by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his answer to a parliamentary question of mine on 8 November 2004 that the number of community gardaí in west Dublin has fallen to 17, as compared to 19 at 27 November 2003. In 1997, there were 18 community gardaí serving the west Dublin area. In the intervening eight years, the population has grown dramatically and is now in excess of 70,000. The failure of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to supply community gardaí to urban areas, particularly areas under siege from gangs with guns and drugs, is a shameful indictment of the Government's policy on policing. The Minister for Education and Science has told the house that 440 gardaí are deployed in the County Donegal division. Only 140 gardaí are assigned to the west Dublin area with a population of more than 70,000, including the 17 community gardaí to whom I referred.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_473" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1280">Some 640 gardaí are assigned to that area.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_474">
            <from>Ms Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_1281">Much was made in the 2002 general election of a promise to recruit 2,000 extra gardaí. The figures for community policing indicate the reality of falling Garda numbers to serve local communities. The outlook for 2005 is little better with only a 5% increase provided for in the Estimates. When pay rises under the benchmarking process are taken into account, the country as a whole will probably see fewer than 100 extra gardaí serving next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">Dublin 15 is one of the most prosperous areas of the country, home to Farmleigh House, with which the Government is familiar, IBM and the incredibly successful Blanchardstown town centre. Last weekend, this area was again in the news for all the wrong reasons. Assassins gunned down a young man as his infant child and partner lay sleeping. We have reached a state of callousness when we can accept gang warfare and the loss of human life on a scale that would make Al Capone blush.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">Wherever urban crime and disorder have been defeated and reduced in other parts of the world, in cities such as New York and Baltimore, and in rural areas, a key element in such success has been community and neighbourhood policing. Targeted intervention, such as the special operations by gardaí against gangs, is welcome but is not enough. We can take lessons from the Patten report for Northern Ireland and its recommendation on sustained community policing. In the Republic, the application of the Patten principles would see gardaí assigned to neighbourhoods for at least two to three years to allow the proper development of a good relationship with local residents. A continued Garda presence in certain areas can also act as a deterrent to crime and can ensure that known criminals do not subject residents to a rule of fear, as is happening in west Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">Time and again in west Dublin, the Minister for Justice, Equality, and Law Reform announces community and other Garda resources in response to crime waves and the commitment seems to vanish within a month or two. Despite the best efforts of residents and community organisations there are unfortunately areas in west Dublin that have become virtual no-go areas late at night, with parents terrified for the safety of their children. In a major survey of local authority estates that has just been published, 60% to 70% of residents said that crime and lack of policing are a significant concern.</p>
            <p eId="para_1285">This month alone, I have had to speak to many distressed parents whose sons have been randomly assaulted at local shopping centres, usually by youths in hoodies. Who rules the streets — the "hoodies" or the law-abiding citizens? For all the Minister's bluster, we will not win the war against young criminals until he acknowledges that his strategy has failed. The zero-tolerance approach of his predecessor was, in the end, all spin. Communities deserve a worked-out policy, adequate policing numbers and to be able to see gardaí on the beat.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">I took part in a debate on Monday night with the local superintendent, for whom I have much respect. He was able to boast that in a community of more than 70,000 and nearly 30,000 homes, he had two gardaí out on horseback, two on bicycles and six or seven in Garda cars. This equates to approximately ten gardaí on active duty for a community of 70,000. The system is not working and it is law-abiding citizens who suffer.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_475" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1287">I thank Deputy Burton for raising this matter to which I respond on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is against the background of recent serious shooting incidents that the Deputy has raised this matter. When such incidents occur, there can be a tendency in the media to use the terms "organised crime" and "gangland killings" to describe their nature. The Deputy will appreciate that I do not wish to say anything that would jeopardise the proper investigation of any incident by ascribing a particular motive to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">Whether these terms are appropriate or not, I assure the House that the Garda Síochána subjects all murders and violent crimes to detailed and thorough investigation. Ireland has a very low murder rate compared to other EU countries. There were eight fewer murders in 2003 compared to 2002 and there have been seven fewer murders for the first nine months of this year compared to the same period in 2003. However, I will not understate the difficulties faced by the Garda Síochána in successfully investigating such crimes. Organised crime, by its nature, creates a climate of fear, not only for the general public but for some of the criminals. There are potentially huge profits involved in organised crime, particularly the drugs trade. To these criminals, money is power and many are prepared to take whatever action is necessary to protect their position, including violence and murder in some cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has met a number of times with the Garda Commissioner and other senior Garda personnel to discuss serious crime and is satisfied the necessary resources, both operational and financial, are being directed towards the containment and detection of such crime. Local Garda management is satisfied the resources available to them in west Dublin are adequate to meet the policing needs of the area. The personnel strength of the Dublin metropolitan region west division as at 25 November 2004 was 641, all ranks. The equivalent strength as at 1 January 1999 was 542. This represents an increase of 99, or 18.27%, since 1 January 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">There is a total of 76 community policing personnel in the Dublin metropolitan region west division, comprising three inspectors, seven sergeant and 66 gardaí. An additional 22 probationer gardaí are due to be allocated to the division on 26 November 2004. The needs of the division are kept under constant review by the Garda authorities and, as additional personnel become available, those needs will be considered in the context of Garda resources nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The establishment of specialist Garda units, such as the national bureau of criminal investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the Garda national drug unit, operating under an assistant commissioner in charge of national support services, has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle serious crime effectively. These specialist units work closely with gardaí operating at district and divisional level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">On 12 October, the Government approved the proposal of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the agreed programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. Today, the Garda Commissioner launched the advertisement campaign for the recruitment of the additional gardaí. There will be an intake of 1,100 recruits in each of the next three years. Tomorrow, an additional 190 gardaí will be attested to the force. This will bring the strength of the Garda, already at a record high, to more than 12,200.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">The Opposition and some commentators have said it is not remotely possible, during the remaining lifetime of this Government, to recruit in sufficient numbers to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. They are wrong. As I stated, the recruitment campaign has already started. Each quarter for the next three years, around 274 recruits will be taken into the Garda College, amounting to almost 1,100 recruits each year. Taking into account projected retirements, this will lead to a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 as early as 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">This record recruitment drive will place at the disposal of the Garda Commissioner a significant increase in Garda resources. The commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences. The House can be assured that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_1295">The Garda Síochána was provided with a budget of €1.08 billion in 2004 and this has been increased to more than €1.1 billion for 2005. The Minister recently provided the Garda Commissioner with an additional €4 million to be used for high visibility policing between now and the end of the year. This has provided the force with an additional 140,000 hours of overtime and is contributing to the current intensified Garda operation in west Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1296">With regard to legislative matters, our legislative package for tackling organised crime is one of the toughest in Europe. There is a broad range of strong legislation available to the gardaí to enable serious and organised crime to be confronted effectively. The Criminal Assets Bureau Act and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, which have been successfully used to deprive those engaged in criminal activity of their assets, continue to be the most significant legislative tools. This legislation has been copied throughout Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">The Criminal Justice Bill 2004 provides a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the gardaí in the investigation and prosecution of offences and will generally provide for improvements to the operation of the criminal justice system. It will also provide for the creation of minimum mandatory sentences for certain firearms provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">I assure the Deputy that the Minister's commitment to tackling serious crime is unwavering and he is constantly evaluating our response to this problem. He will take whatever measures are necessary to deal with it.</p>

          <heading>School Car Parking Facilities.</heading>
          <speech by="#MarieHoctorFF" eId="spk_476">
            <from>Ms Hoctor</from>
            <p eId="para_1299">A Cheann Comhairle, go raibh maith agat as ucht an tseans a thabhairt dom labhairt os comhair an Tí um thráthnóna ar an gceist thábhachtach seo. I am grateful to the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, for being present to reply to this matter and to the Chair for the opportunity to air this important matter that relates to schools not only in north Tipperary but elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">With the increasing population in rural areas, including villages, parents bring children to school by car which has led to increased congestion outside rural primary schools. Such congestion endangers the lives of children and parents and tensions are high in the early morning and in the afternoon when parents collect their children. The question at issue is who is responsible for the set down and car parking facilities outside primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1301">I draw to the attention of the House Lissenhall national school, which the Minister is aware is awaiting the provision of an additional classroom for next year because of the growing population in this rural area that lies four miles outside Nenagh town. There are 51 pupils in the school and 13 additional pupils are expected next September as well as an additional teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_1302">The school is located on the Nenagh to Newport road, which is a busy and extremely narrow road. With no bus service to the school, 60 pupils are delivered to the school each morning. This means that 50 cars are parked outside the school. There are no parking facilities, as such, outside the school despite my efforts and the many efforts of county councillors representing the area to put money in place towards the provision of car parking facilities. At one stage north Tipperary County Council had put aside IR£6,000 to provide car parking facilities outside the school, but it withdrew that funding because it claimed the provision of such facilities is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">A landowner in the area of Lissenhall, a very generous man, is prepared to supply the land in question to provide car parking facilities for the school for which he is not seeking payment, and he is prepared to do that immediately. However, the county council will not take responsibility for this provision. Its officials have said such provision is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">I draw to the attention of the House Toomevara national school, Scoil Sheosaimh Náisiúnta, a green flag school which the Minister is due to visit in the coming week. The footpath outside the school is in poor repair. When I was a county councillor I tried to secure money, under tertiary funds available through north Tipperary County Council, to repair the footpath to serve the needs of pedestrians accessing the school. However, the engineer of the roads section of the council advised me that such funding could not be allocated for such work because the repair of this footpath is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science. I find that difficult to understand and, given that I am confused, I do not know how parents, teachers and pupils accessing that school can accept that response.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">I hope the Minister will clarify the position. An issue for all schools is who is responsible for the provision of car parking to ensure safety on roads outside schools. I imagine that is the responsibility of the local authority, but it claims it is not. As a local representative for the area and on behalf of the parents and teachers in these schools, it is my duty to raise this matter in the House to have it clarified. It is a question of who, ultimately, is responsible for this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">Tá mé an bhuíoch don Aire gur fhan sí sa Teach um thráthnóna chun éisteacht liom agus cuirim fáilte roimh a freagra. This is an issue for all schools. Will such provision be made under the summer works scheme? If so, will it be considered as a matter of priority or will it be lower down the list?</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_477" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
            <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
            <p eId="para_1307">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter because it is an issue that has been raised in respect of a number of schools. This reply gives me an opportunity to set out the policy of the Department of Education and Science on the provision of set-down and car parking facilities outside national schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">The Department's Planning Guidelines for Primary Schools recommend that when a new school of one to seven classrooms, inclusive, is being designed and built, one car parking space per teacher and two additional spaces should be provided. This parking allocation includes at least one space for persons with disability or mobility impairment. Designers should, wherever possible and with due regard for health and safety, consider hard play area as a potential overflow park for use in exceptional circumstances. Bus and car set-down and pick-up areas should be designed so that the relevant area may be ceded to the local authority upon completion. Pedestrian access should be kept separate from traffic movements in the interests of safety. In existing schools some compromise has to be made in regard to the provision of these facilities depending on the site size, location of the school building on the site, proximity to the road etc., bearing in mind that some schools were built well over 100 years ago when there were no cars.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">Deputy Hoctor asked a specific question about who is responsible for this matter. It is the responsiblity of individual boards of management of primary schools to ensure that adequate and safe set-down and parking facilities are provided. I hope that in individual cases the people concerned will be able to work with the local authority, particularly given that we are talking about public roads etc. Many schools reach agreement with local authorities in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">The Deputy also asked about schemes that might fund such programmes under the Department of Education and Science. There are a number of funds under which school building works can be addressed. Under the grant scheme for minor works to national school properties, which came into operation in January 1997, all national schools receive funding annually. Items such as the replacement of windows, roof repairs, resurfacing of school yard, upgrading or provision of car parking facilities and set-down areas, which we are discussing, and repainting and redecorating qualify as improvements to school buildings and grounds and come within the scope of the minor works covered by this grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">In addition, the summer works scheme, about which the Deputy inquired, provides capital grants for necessary small-scale works that can be planned and delivered during the summer months. Applications are considered under the terms and conditions of the scheme. The closing date for receipt of applications for the 2005 summer works scheme was 5 November 2004. All applications received under the scheme are being considered in the school planning section of my Department and we hope to publish the successful list in early 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">The management authority of one of the schools in question, Scoil Naomh Sheosamh, has submitted an application under the 2005 summer works scheme for a set-down area and a new vehicular entrance to the school. The application will be considered in light of available funding and competing priorities and needs of the school. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I hope I have brought some clarity to the issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1314">Under the multi-annual capital envelope framework I can carry over 10% of my allocation for 2004 to 2005. Currently, I am projecting a need to do so. I plan to carry over €50 million and I am not limited to just €39 million as recently reported in the media. This means that I can allocate the entire carryover to primary and post-primary buildings in 2005 to match any amount not spent from the 2004 allocations for primary and post-primary school buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">I want to make clear that any saving in 2004 on school buildings is not due to any reduction or cutback in planned activity. Ultimately, what we are talking about here is that some payments on existing projects, that is, projects that have already been approved to go to tender and construction, will not be due for payment in 2004 as originally envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">A record level of new school projects was commissioned in 2004 and, put simply, payments expected to fall due before the end of this year are now more likely to be met in early 2005. However, the decision by the Government to put its entire capital programme including the education capital programme on a multi-annual basis means that it is easier to manage and cope with that type of variation in projected spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">The Deputy will appreciate that the 2004 school building programme is a multi-faceted undertaking involving many hundreds of individual projects ranging from new school buildings, extensions, refurbishments and other projects under the summer works scheme, temporary accommodation, permanent accommodation initiatives, remediation programmes and the contingency fund. In addition, my Department funds the purchase of sites for new school building projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1318">In broad terms, there are many reasons which can cause unexpected delays in the pace at which some projects advance. These include an appeal of planning permission by third parties to An Bord Pleanála, contractors withdrawing tenders and design teams being slower than anticipated in getting projects tendered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1319">However, through the carryover measure, the overall management of my capital budget and Department spending to end of year I will be ensuring that all funds remaining for 2004, together with whatever allocation I receive for 2005, will enable me to maintain the momentum in the capital building programme started by this year's record level of activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1384">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The employment of an extra 4,500 teachers has contributed to a fall in the overall pupil-teacher ratio at primary level from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-004 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">The overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule has been reduced from 35 in the 1995-96 school year to 29 in the 2003-04 school year. The staffing schedule for the 2003-04 school year was structured to ensure that all primary schools would operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. The staffing of a primary school in a particular year is determined by the enrolment at 30 September of the previous year. This approach is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill vacancies in an individual primary school is a matter for the board of management of the school concerned. It is a matter for school authorities to ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">I am committed to reducing overall class sizes still further. This can only be done, however, on a phased basis having regard to available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">With regard to staffing provision for disadvantage at primary level, a range of existing additional supports, such as Breaking the Cycle and Giving Children an Even Break, will continue to be provided in 2004-05. These supports involve the provision of over 600 teaching posts enabling the implementation of significantly reduced PTRs in both junior and senior classes in more than 240 disadvantaged primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">In addition, the allocation of a further 350 teaching posts for special needs in primary schools has been recently approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">I am currently finalising a detailed review of all educational disadvantage schemes, with a view to ensuring that a fully integrated and cohesive strategy is adopted in this area for the future. Any decision to expand or extend any of the initiatives aimed at addressing educational disadvantage is being considered in the context of this review, the outcome of which I hope to announce shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1391">All of these measures serve to underline the particular importance which I have attached, both to tackling educational disadvantage and providing for children with special needs, since my appointment as Minister for Education and Science.</p>

            <p eId="para_1393">The National Economic and Social Forum report of 2002 on early school leaving cited, as a broad estimate, that around 1,000 children do not transfer from primary to post-primary on an annual basis. There is some doubt attaching to this estimated figure of 1,000, which may be an over-statement of the true position at this stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">My Department is currently completing analysis work on the development of a primary pupils database, which will facilitate the collation of much more accurate and comprehensive data on transfer rates in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">My Department operates a number of programmes at both primary and post-primary level to tackle the problem of early school leaving.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">The Giving Children an Even Break programme provides additional financial and teaching supports for children in primary schools from disadvantaged backgrounds who are most at risk of educational disadvantage and early school leaving.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">A key role in this regard is also played by the home-school-community liaison, HSCL, scheme, which was extended to each of the 312 designated disadvantaged primary schools in the country. This scheme helps parents to develop their skills as the primary educators of their children and also addresses issues in the community impinging on learning and educational participation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">The school completion programme has been implemented to directly target those in danger of dropping out of the education system and is a key component of my Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of early school leaving. The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling educational disadvantage, involving 82 projects — 300 primary and 112 post-primary schools — parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies. It entails targeting individual young people of school-going age, both in and out of school, and arranging supports to address inequalities in education access, participation and outcomes. A total of €23.5 million was allocated to the programme in 2004 and €24 million has been provided in the Estimates for 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1399">Both the HSCL scheme and all 82 school completion programme projects operate transfer programmes which are very important in assisting pupils in making the transition from primary to post-primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1400">The Education Welfare Act 2000, and the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board, provides a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service to provide welfare-focused services to children, families and schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">The additional funding being provided in the 2005 Estimates to alleviate disadvantage will support the further development of measures to address early school leaving.</p>

            <p eId="para_1403">I have already indicated that, in accordance with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, I propose to introduce a single unified scheme of maintenance grants for students in higher education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">It is my intention also to put in place at the earliest possible time a more coherent administration system to facilitate the introduction of a more sophisticated means-testing arrangement and ensure consistency of application and client accessibility. This is necessary if we are to ensure public confidence in the awards system and also ensure the timely delivery of grants to those who need them most. It is for this reason that I have asked my Department to expedite its consultations with other relevant Departments and stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">I share the Deputy's concern about the perceived unfairness of the existing schemes but the Deputy will no doubt be aware that this was an issue addressed by the de Buitleir report in the mid-1990s but not acted upon by the then Minister and Government. The Deputy will also be aware that the issues involved are complex ones, not unique to this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">Whatever new administration and assessment arrangements will be eventually decided upon will be provided for in new statutory arrangements through a new student support Bill. This Bill will have as its objective the promotion of equality of access. I envisage that the Bill will also provide for an independent appeals system. I cannot indicate yet when this Bill will be published.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">A key vehicle for the achievement of our objective of promoting and facilitating increased participation from hitherto under-represented socio-economic groups will be the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education, which we established last year in the Higher Education Authority. The national office, at my request, is finalising a national action plan with this priority objective. This plan, which has been developed in consultation with the stakeholders, will set out a road map for future action. It will seek to establish specific quantitative and qualitative targets linked to allocation of financial resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">In this connection, the national office has been asked to give particular attention to the setting of national and institutional targets for participation in higher education by the socio-economically disadvantaged, those from the Traveller community, students with disabilities and mature students. I can assure the Deputy that this Government accords the highest priority to addressing the obstacles to participation by these target groups at all stages of the education cycle — a fact testified to in the Estimates volume for 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_1410">I am aware of recent statistics to which the Deputy refers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">My Department's commitment to tackling early school leaving is reflected in the national anti-poverty strategy, the National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion, 2003-2005, and the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative on tackling educational disadvantage, Literacy, Numeracy and Early School Leavers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">My Department's approach to addressing the issue of early school leaving comprises legislative and curricular reforms as well as preventative interventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1413">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which was fully commenced on 5 July 2002, established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">With regard to curriculum reform, my Department's strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students. These strategies aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision for both boys and girls through such programmes as the junior certificate schools programme, JCSP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">The school completion programme aims to have a significant positive impact on levels of pupil retention in primary and post primary schools and on the numbers of pupils who successfully complete senior cycle. The focus of the programme is on young people between the ages of four and 18 years and aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling educational disadvantage, involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">A total of €23 million and €23.5 million was allocated to the school completion programme in 2003 and 2004, respectively. A total of €24 million is provided for the programme in the Estimates for 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">My Department is currently finalising a review of educational disadvantage schemes with a view to building on what has been achieved to date, adopting a more systematic, targeted and integrated approach and strengthening the capacity of the system to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged children and young people. The future position in relation to the expansion of retention schemes will be clarified in the context of this review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1419">The issue of the future of the college, which is the subject of the question posed by the Deputy, arose in the context of a decision by the trustees of the college that, due to personnel and financial considerations, they were no longer in a position to fulfil the role of trustees of the college.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">Following discussions between the trustees and my Department, it was agreed that a consultant would be appointed who would meet with relevant parties and prepare a report on the options for the college's future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">The consultant's report was thoroughly examined in my Department and the options for the future of the college were set out for my predecessor's consideration. Having carefully considered all of them and having taken into account other factors such as the national spatial strategy, relevant costs in a time of financial constraint, a Government decision to restrict public service numbers, the need to secure value for money and a better allocation of resources, the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, decided that these considerations are best served by the closure of the college and the designation of St. Angela's College, Sligo as the sole centre for the training of home economics teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">It was agreed that the closure of the college would be phased over three academic years to facilitate students currently enrolled in the college to fully complete their studies without moving location and to ensure that there was an adequate transition period for staff. On that basis there has been no intake of first-year students to the college for the 2004-05 year. The college is due to close following the 2006-07 academic year. Instead, these students are now enrolled in St. Angela's College. Officials from my Department have already met with the trustees and with management authorities of the college to discuss the necessary practical arrangements, including arrangements in relation to the position of the staff of the college.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">In addition, accompanied by a senior official from my Department, I recently met with the board of governors and students of St Catherine's to further discuss, among other things, the necessary practical arrangements regarding the closure. In addition, the concerns of the staff, and how these can be addressed were discussed. I have no plans to reconsider the decision to close the college.</p>

            <p eId="para_1425">Under the multi-annual capital envelope framework I can carryover 10% of my allocation for 2004 to 2005. I am projecting currently a need to do so. I plan to carryover €50 million and I am not limited to just €39 million as recently reported in the media. This means that I can allocate in 2005 the entire carryover to primary and post-primary buildings to match any amount not spent from the 2004 allocations for primary and post-primary school buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">I want to make clear that any saving in 2004 on school buildings is not due to any reduction or cutback in planned activity. Ultimately, what we are talking about here is that some payments on existing projects, that is, projects that have already been approved to go to tender and construction, will not be due for payment in 2004 as originally envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">A record level of new school projects was commissioned in 2004 and, put simply, payments expected to fall due before the end of this year are now more likely to be met in early 2005. However, the decision by the Government to put its entire capital programme including the education capital programme on a multi-annual basis means that it is easier to manage and cope with that type of variation in projected spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">The Deputy will appreciate that the 2004 school building programme is a multi-faceted undertaking involving many hundreds of individual projects ranging from new school buildings, extensions, refurbishments and other projects under the summer works scheme, temporary accommodation, permanent accommodation initiatives, remediation programmes and the contingency fund. In addition, my Department funds the purchase of sites for new school building projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">In broad terms there are many reasons which can cause unexpected delays in the pace at which some projects advance. These include an appeal of planning permission by third parties to An Bord Pleanála contractors withdrawing tenders and design teams being slower than anticipated in getting projects tendered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">However, through the carryover measure and the overall management of my capital budget and Department spending to end of year I will be ensuring that all funds remaining for 2004, together with whatever allocation I receive for 2005, will enable me to maintain the momentum in the capital building programme started by this year's record level of activity.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1432">The Deputy will be aware from responses to recent questions that a key focus of education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">As I have stated, the wide variety of measures in place in Tallaght and in other similar areas for tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion reflects these concerns. These measures range from pre-school interventions, supports for tackling children's literacy problems, reduced pupil teacher ratios, increased capitation grants and measures to tackle early school leaving and strengthen ties between the school, the family and the community. In addition, there are interventions in support of youth and in providing "second chance education" for young people and adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">The vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS, to which the Deputy refers, is one aspect of my Department's provision in the area of second chance education. This programme provides second chance education for unemployed adults and other welfare benefit recipients. Other further and adult education programmes funded by my Department and delivered by the vocational education committees include Youthreach, Traveller training programmes, adult literacy and community education, part-time options for priority target groups under the Back to Education initiative, and post leaving certificate courses to provide skills for school leavers and re-entrants to the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">In answer to the Deputy's query with specific reference to the VTOS programme, a participant on a VTOS programme receives free tuition and is paid a training allowance in lieu of an unemployment payment. VTOS students with other eligible social welfare entitlements, such as a disability allowance, continue to receive their payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">Grants are also paid by my Department to vocational education committees to assist towards the child care expenses of participants on VTOS, Youthreach and senior Traveller training programmes. The allocation of assistance to programme participants is a matter for individual VECs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">As I stated previously, I welcome the report of the Tallaght West childhood development initiative as a useful contribution to this complex area of policy and I have asked my officials to consider its wider policy implications in the context of finalising work on an overall review of educational disadvantage programmes at national level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">My priority will be to continue targeting resources at those areas and people most in need.</p>

            <p eId="para_1440">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">Arising from these improvements, class sizes have reduced in the same period. The overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule has been reduced from 35 to 29.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. This can only be done, however, on a phased basis having regard to the available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. The timing and manner in which the target set out in the programme for Government can be met is being examined by my Department in consultation with the education partners. Additional posts will continue to be provided. The deployment of these posts will be decided within the context of the overall policy that priority will be given to pupils with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas and junior classes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1444">I have no plans at present to revise the process to the allocation of special needs assistant support. This process will continue to be based on the special care needs of individual pupils in accordance with established criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">The proposed new system of teacher allocation involves a general allocation to all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, that is, pupils with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs, that is, those functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">I am conscious of difficulties that could arise in relation to this model, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, I am having the proposed model reviewed to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities, without the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensuring that pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive the level of service appropriate to their needs. The review will involve consultation with representative interests and the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1447">I should emphasise that individual applications may continue to be made for specific resource teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1452">The Educational Research Centre's report entitled, Reading Literacy in Disadvantaged Primary Schools, which I launched earlier this month, provides the first ever comprehensive analysis of the range of literacy achievement found in disadvantaged primary schools. Over 6,500 pupils in first, third and sixth classes participated in this large scale research which represents a major contribution to our knowledge base about literacy levels among disadvantaged pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">The findings and recommendations of the ERC report are being considered in the context of a comprehensive review of all of my Department's educational disadvantage programmes. This review, which is being finalised, has examined all aspects of existing provision, including literacy interventions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">I am pleased to inform the Deputy that in response to one of the key findings of the ERC report, namely, the strong correlation between reading levels and the number and use of books in the home, I have decided to allocate €500,000 for the purchase of books for pupils in key disadvantaged areas before Christmas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">It is my intention that these books will be used in conjunction with parents to promote a culture of reading in the home.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">In addition, my Department will continue to operate the following measures to prevent and ameliorate literacy difficulties at primary level: the provision of additional financial and teaching resources to disadvantaged schools to implement reduced class sizes, as well as financial support for interventions specifically designed to improve literacy levels among those from disadvantaged backgrounds; learning-support teaching is provided in all primary schools by over 1,500 teachers who give intensive support to children with literacy difficulties. An additional 350 teachers at primary level will be in place during the 2004-05 school year to cater for pupils with special educational and learning support needs; continuing assistance is being given to disadvantaged primary schools in implementing my Department's learning support guidelines, including adoption of a whole-school approach to supporting children with literacy difficulties and development and implementation of a literacy plan by each school; the reading recovery programme provides intensive, individual help for children who have not responded to the standard instructional programme in reading and writing after one year in school. There are currently 85 primary schools — 51 in the Monaghan area and 34 in Dublin — participating in the programme. My Department has recently recruited three teachers to train as reading recovery tutors, increasing the total number of tutors to five. Following completion of training, these new tutors will train teachers and facilitate the extension of the reading recovery programme, for the first time, to disadvantaged schools in Cork and Limerick; and the First Steps programme offers primary teachers an accurate means of assessing and monitoring children's competencies and progress in reading, writing, spelling and oral language. Training of teachers in selected disadvantaged schools in First Steps is ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">Early interventions, such as those I have outlined above, are crucial in addressing literacy problems among children and have a lasting impact on tackling educational disadvantage and social exclusion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1464">There are in the region of 3,000 vehicles in use each day providing school transport services on behalf of my Department under the school transport scheme. This fleet is made up of Bus Éireann school buses and contractors' vehicles. The bulk of this fleet comprises minibuses provided by contractors, while most large buses are provided by Bus Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">Large capacity buses have a longer operational lifespan. Bus Éireann has informed my Department that the average age of the Bus Éireann school bus fleet of large capacity buses is 15.5 years, while the average age of similar large capacity contractors' vehicles is now approximately 18 years. Other categories of contractors' vehicles such as cars and minibuses have a lower average age.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">Since 1999, Bus Éireann has spent over €4.5 million on purchasing vehicles as part of an ongoing school bus fleet replacement programme to continually improve the age profile and condition of their school bus fleet. In addition to this, the Bus Éireann school bus fleet has some 400 large capacity buses that were transferred from the general service fleet into the dedicated school transport bus fleet. Over 250 of these buses were transferred in the period 1999-2003, valued in the region of €5 million, and they represent another valuable source of replacement buses over this period. This investment has produced a perceptible improvement in the condition of the fleet generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">It must be pointed out that all vehicles operating under the school transport scheme, whether operated by Bus Éireann or by private contractors, comply fully with all relevant legislation and are covered by current certificates of roadworthiness. All the operating procedures of the scheme are similarly compliant with legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">Safe operation of buses is ensured by rigorous inspection and maintenance procedures allied to professional driving standards, as practised by the staff of Bus Éireann and its contractors.</p>

            <p eId="para_1470">A national curriculum in social personal and health education, SPHE, incorporating relationships and sexuality education, has been developed at junior cycle level, and this has been made mandatory for all schools with effect from September 2003. In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place for senior cycle pupils. Comprehensive guidelines for (a) junior cycle and (b) senior cycle have also been published and provided to schools by the NCCA to support the RSE aspects of the curriculum. An integrated SPHE programme at senior cycle incorporating RSE is being developed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">The overall aims of the SPHE curricula are to foster the personal development, health and well-being of students and help them to create supportive relationships and become responsible citizens; to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and skills that will inform their actions and decision making; and to establish and maintain healthy patterns of behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">The SPHE modules at junior cycle in post-primary schools deal specifically with belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, dealing with peer pressure, influences on decision-making, relationships and sexuality in terms of values, reproductive system, tackling myths about sex and pregnancy, personal safety, substance use and the impact of teenage pregnancy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">The RSE programme at senior cycle deals further with these issues and includes pregnancy, contraception, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual harassment, sexual assault, and accepting sexual orientation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">A national SPHE support service was established in September 2000, and provides a full-time support service in collaboration with the health boards to assist schools to deliver the programme. A national support officer for RSE is also provided in St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra to provide support and advice to schools in regard to RSE at senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">SPHE programmes are designed to enable children and young people to develop a framework of values, attitudes, understanding and life skills that will inform their decisions and actions both during their time in school and in their future lives. I do not consider that it would be appropriate for schools to provide contraception to pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The curriculum guidelines in RSE at senior cycle will be reviewed as part of emerging developments in relation to the review of senior cycle and the development of an integrated SPHE programme incorporating RSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">My Department is also undertaking research, in the context of the national strategy on crisis pregnancy, to examine how best the implementation of SPHE and RSE in schools can be further strengthened.</p>

            <p eId="para_1481">I consider that the recommendations of the task force on autism provide an invaluable basis for the development of educational services and supports for persons with autism. However, in responding to the recommendations, my Department has had to give priority to a number of key areas before detailed individual recommendations can be addressed. These key areas involve the implementation of the core legislative and structural measures required to underpin service development and delivery. This approach is critical to the implementation of many of the individual recommendations of the task force including those relating to assessment, parental involvement, service delivery, information dissemination, promotion of inclusion and co-ordination between health and education authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">With regard to legislation, the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Bill 2004 has now been enacted while, on the structural front, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established on a statutory basis. While these developments represent significant progress, a considerable amount of additional input is required before these measures can begin to have a positive impact on services for children with special educational needs, including those with autism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">Over the course of the coming months, I expect that significant progress will be made in this regard. Specifically, consideration will be given to the detailed measures required to enable the Act to be commenced. In addition, it is intended that the NCSE will assume operational status in the new year and a range of measures are in hand to ensure that this objective is realised. These measures include comprehensive supported training for the council's special educational needs organisers and the drawing up of detailed work protocols in relation to the various areas of work for which the council will assume responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">This work will be carefully planned and executed over the coming months. It will address many of the recommendations of the task force. Other recommendations will be addressed over time in consultation with the council and other interested parties.</p>

            <p eId="para_1486">There were some 39 recommendations in the report of the task force on the physical sciences, with costed proposals totalling €244 million extra, of which €66.3 million is a recurring annual cost. Funds are not available at present to progress the strategy on the scale recommended in the report. Of the 39 recommendations, four are not for the education sector. Of the remainder, progress has been made on 25 of the recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">In particular, important progress is being made in regard to: curricular reform and in-service support, with new syllabi already implemented in leaving certificate biology and physics and chemistry; revised syllabi in primary science and junior certificate science beginning in schools in 2003-04; and work is under way on a new leaving certificate physical sciences syllabus to replace the physics and chemistry combined syllabus. All of these developments are being or have been supported by national in-service programmes for teachers. For example, over the period 2002 to the end of 2003, 62,000 teacher training days have been provided at an estimated cost of €5.26 million at primary and post-primary level; resourcing, with substantial grants issued to schools at primary level in 1999, 2001 and 2002; an additional per capita grant for physics and chemistry at leaving certificate; a capital grants programme for senior cycle science ICT and science equipment; allied with the implementation of a once-off grant scheme to support the implementation of the new junior certificate science syllabus. Some 614 schools in the free education scheme have opted to provide the revised junior certificate science syllabus from 2003-04, and grants of €10.2 million were issued to these schools this year. The grant scheme will continue apply to new schools in the free education scheme implementing the revised junior certificate syllabus in 2004-05, and it is intended that all schools will be implementing the programme by 2005. The revised junior certificate science syllabus provides for a more investigative approach to science education with some 30 experiments and investigations which have to be carried out over the period of the programme. This hands-on approach is seen as critically important to enhance the attractiveness of the subject and encourage more students to choose the physical sciences at senior cycle; ICT integration projects in teaching and learning under the schools IT initiative, and the new TV Scope programme in partnership with RTE, NCCA and the National Centre for Technology in Education; provision of materials and publications to schools to promote the attractiveness and relevance of science for students as a subject option and career path; reviews on mathematics, grading of subjects in the leaving certificate, gender equity issues in science, and initial reports on teacher training undertaken; awareness measures supported by industry and third level colleges linking with schools; the launch of the new Discover Science and Engineering programme in October 2003 bringing together all the existing awareness activities in a unified strategy; and the announcement by the Tánaiste in December 2003 of plans for Ireland's first interactive learning centre for children and adults, designed to give visitors a hands-on experience and understanding of science and to be an education and outreach centre for teachers and pupils. The Exploration Station is due to open in 2006 and will be sited in the OPW Heuston Gate development in Kilmainham, Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">This work continues to be progressed and enhanced as resources permit in collaboration and consultation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Forfás and industry. My Department is fully committed to strengthening the quality of science teaching and learning, promoting increased scientific literacy and encouraging more students to choose science subjects at senior cycle and progress to third level options in this critical area as a vitally important part of the national strategy to support competitiveness and employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1495">Up to date figures on the number of schools with broadband Internet access are not currently available. A nationwide census of schools conducted by the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, in early 2003 indicated that 7% of post-primary schools and 1% of primary schools had broadband at that time. While these percentages have risen in the past year with the development of the market, most schools do not yet have a broadband connection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1496">Nevertheless, plans are well advanced by my Department for the delivery of a high speed broadband service to all schools nationwide. An initiative agreed earlier this year between the Government and the telecoms industry will see all schools connected to a national broadband network by the end of 2005. A competitive public tendering process is currently under way and I expect that my Department will be in a position to conclude contracts with service providers in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497">A joint industry-Government fund of €18 million has been established for the provision of broadband services to schools over a three year period, with the telecoms industry committing €5 million per annum and the Government committing €1 million per annum.

In the past few days, I announced a new €18 million funding package for schools which will enable them to upgrade and augment their computer network facilities in advance of broadband roll out next year. I should emphasise this €18 million funding for computer networks is additional to the €18 million being provided for broadband through the industry-Government fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_1499">Since its formal launch in December 2003, the aim of the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, has been to provide a service to the most disadvantaged areas and most at risk groups. Five regional teams have been established with bases in counties Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford and staff have been deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme. A total of 13 towns with significant school going populations, 12 of which are designated under the Government's RAPID programme, also now have an educational welfare officer allocated to them. In addition, the board will follow up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">I understand from the board that it had 10,572 cases on hand at the end of June 2004 distributed across its five operational regions. I am arranging for the board to provide the information on a county basis as requested by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">During the summer of 2004, the board undertook a survey on the levels of school attendance for the school year 2003-2004. This is the first time that data on school attendance at national level have been collected. The findings of the survey support the targeting policy followed by the board to date in appointing educational welfare officers to the areas of greatest disadvantage. However, the board has indicated to my Department that more staff are needed to work at a local level throughout the country and has sought an increase in its staffing complement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">My Department has already conveyed approval to the NEWB for the filling of a further ten educational welfare officer posts bringing the authorised staffing for the board from 84 to 94. Decisions relating to the assignment of the additional staff to specific areas are a matter for the board which is an independent statutory agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB's staffing under review in the light of the roll out of services and any further proposals that the board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_501">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1510">Following a review by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, of the three technological subjects at leaving certificate level four syllabi were submitted to my Department for consideration in 2003. These are: engineering technology, formerly engineering; architectural technology, formerly construction studies; design and communication graphics, formerly technical drawing; and technology, for which there is no equivalent leaving certificate subject currently in existence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">These syllabuses were followed by further advice and analysis on implementation issues relating to in-service provision and facilities at school level which was forwarded to my Department in June 2004. Separately, a revised syllabus in leaving certificate art was presented by the NCCA to the Department in June 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">My Department responded to the council on 22 September 2004 indicating that it was not in a position to initiate implementation of these syllabi at this stage given that a major investment in terms of infrastructure and staff development was needed and that this was particularly the case for the technology subjects; the existing professional development arrangements for teachers were being re-organised within the Department; and the system was also faced with major changes arising from the proposed reforms of senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">The letter explained that the Department did not consider itself to be in a position to take decisions on implementation until further discussions were held with the NCCA in the light of their deliberations on the next stage of advice on the senior cycle, and the evolving developments regarding in-career development and the budgetary provision for 2005. My Department is engaged in ongoing discussions in the matter with the NCCA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">There is nothing unusual in this position. New and revised syllabi must be supported by the appropriate investment in professional development and, where necessary, by investment in equipment and school facilities. The resources available from time to time do not always allow for automatic implementation of new or revised syllabi in schools immediately following finalisation by the NCCA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">The Department has invested heavily in professional development for teachers, and expenditure in this area is estimated at €24.2 million in the current year. A sustained programme of reform is being implemented with a revised syllabus in junior certificate science being implemented in schools from 2003-04, accompanied by expenditure of €10.2 million in resource grants for schools, the implementation of a revised junior cycle physical education programme which began in 2003 and revised syllabi in leaving certificate history and geography being implemented in 2004-05.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">This programme of reform will continue, but must be appropriately planned and resourced. In relation to the four technology subjects the advice from the NCCA recommends an investment of some €7 million over four years on in-service training for teachers, and an investment in additional equipment for schools which could range from €11,000 to €98,000 per classroom depending on the mix of subjects followed. Funds of this order are not available at present. I will keep the matter under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1526">In announcing an end to the freeze on Exchequer capital funding at third level I indicated that certain high national priority projects would now be proceeding. These key projects include a number of facilities to support the expansion of teacher training places and provision of additional health skills places. The announcement of Exchequer support for these 16 projects in nine institutions marks the commencement of implementation of the Kelly report on the capital needs of the higher education sector. The projects are as follows: the construction of a major new multi-purpose teaching hall and infrastructure works at Mary Immaculate College of Education in Limerick at a cost of €16 million; the first phase of the provision of extensive new accommodation and other works at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, at a cost of €6.2 million, two projects; refurbishment and new building at the National College of Art and Design, NCAD, Thomas Street, Dublin, costing €2.8 million; new buildings for the schools of pharmacy, health therapies and social work in University College Cork costing €15.9 million, three projects; new buildings for the schools of physiotherapy and radiography as part of phase 1 of the health sciences complex at University College Dublin at a cost of €15.2 million, two projects; a new integrated health sciences building for clinical psychology and health therapies, together with new accommodation for social work, in NUI Galway costing €9.5 million, three projects; a new building for the school of pharmacy at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland at cost of €2.8 million; the provision of radiography facilities at Trinity College Dublin costing €3.5 million; new building for health therapies at the University of Limerick at a cost of €6.8 million; and the development of the Clinton Centre for American Studies at UCD at a cost of €3.1 million.</p>

The six projects that are under construction should be completed in 2005. It is expected that one of the projects at tender stage will be completed by the end of 2005 and the other, which is a major project, is expected to be completed in 2006. In relation to the five projects at architectural planning, while it is anticipated that these should be ready to go to tender in 2005, it is not possible at this stage to indicate with accuracy when the projects will commence or be completed due to the variety of issues that may arise during the planning stage which can contribute to projects not advancing as quickly as hoped.</p>

            <p eId="para_1533">The process of assessing the need for new or additional educational facilities at primary or post-primary level in any given area entails consideration by my Department of all relevant factors, including enrolment and demographic trends, statistical information available from the most recent census, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of any existing schools to meet the demand for school places.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">As part of the process, the Minister for Education and Science is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans. My Department monitors these plans and meets with local authorities as required to establish the location, scale and pace of housing developments and their possible impact on school provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">In the event that the level of development and population growth in an area indicates a likely long-term need for primary or post-primary educational provision, a decision is made on the means by which that need should be met. Generally, this involves the provision of permanent accommodation in the form of a new school or an extension to existing facilities. High quality temporary prefabricated accommodation is normally provided to alleviate short-term accommodation needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">Where appropriate, the local authority may be requested to reserve a site for educational purposes. In this way, every effort is made to ensure that there is adequate existing provision, or that timely arrangements are made to extend school capacity where necessary. Consultation with the existing schools plays an important part of this process also, as the management authorities of schools would alert my Department where in their view the need for additional accommodation is anticipated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">In addition, arrangements are in place for officials from my Department's school planning section to meet with each local authority to discuss development proposals and site requirements for new schools.

This will allow for targeting measures from pre-school through the school system to third level, second chance education and adult literacy and numeracy; and special education provision: an increase of €67 million will raise the 2005 allocation to €628 million. The increased amount will fund provision of teachers and special needs assistants for special needs pupils, special school transport and the expanded provision for the national council for special education; support for schools and teachers: a capitation grant increase of 10% for primary level representing an increase of €12 per pupil. Post-primary will increase by €16 for all schools while the voluntary sector will get an additional €10 per child. Library grants have increased by 35%. Teachers' pay provision is also provided for in the Estimates. The in-career budget for professional development of teachers is up 15% to a record €22.8 million. A sum of €0.8 million is also provided for the start up of the teaching council, while the NCCA budget is up 38% for 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">Promoting the knowledge society and economy is also a feature of the Estimates. The higher education and research sector is up 8%.

The provision for youth services is up 18% to almost €34 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">This range of measures and level of financial provision demonstrates the Government's unequivocal commitment to education as a key priority service and I am satisfied that it will allow me to make significant advances in the key priority areas outlined, promoting inclusion, supporting our schools and teachers and building the knowledge society and economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1553">My colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, administers the school meals scheme, which aims to supplement the nutritional intake of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in order to allow them to fulfil their potential within the educational system and also to reduce the risk of early school leaving.</p>
            <p eId="para_1554">Under this scheme in 2003, school meals were provided in 729 primary and post-primary schools, encompassing approximately 76,000 pupils, at a cost of €3.3 million. Increased provision of €6 million is being made available to support the school meals scheme in 2004. Officials within my Department are co-operating with the Department of Social and Family Affairs, on an ongoing basis, with a view to further expanding the number of schools participating in the scheme, as well as ensuring that available resources are targeted at those pupils most in need.</p>

Approximately 15,000 pupils were targeted by the school completion programme in 2003-04. Provision for the programme in 2004 is €23.5 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_1557">The most recent published analysis by my Department of retention rates at second level was released in August 2003. This report indicates that of those pupils who commenced the junior cycle programme in September 1994 approximately 3,900, 5.7%, left school before completing the junior certificate three years later and approximately 12,500, 18.2%, left school without the leaving certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">Reports on the 1995 and 1996 cohorts are currently being prepared by my Department and it is expected these will be finalised in spring 2005. These reports will allow for further analysis and comparison of trends in retention at second level. There is no evidence however to suggest that drop out rates have increased significantly in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">The Government's commitment to tackling early school leaving is reflected in the national anti-poverty strategy, the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion 2003-2005, and the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative on tackling educational disadvantage: literacy, numeracy and early school leavers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">My Department's ongoing response to the issue of early school leaving comprises legislative measures such as the Education Welfare Act 2000, which established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance, curricular reforms such as the junior certificate support programme and the leaving certificate applied and preventative interventions such as the school completion programme and the home school community liaison scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_1562">The most recently published analysis by my Department of retention rates at second level was released in August 2003.

            <p eId="para_1564">My Department's approach to addressing the issue of early school leaving comprises legislative and curricular reforms as well as preventative interventions. The Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which was fully commenced on 5 July 2002 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">With regard to curriculum reform, my Department's strategies have included widening the educational experience available to students. These strategies aim to achieve a greater level of inclusiveness in curricular provision for both boys and girls through such programmes as the junior certificate schools programme, JCSP, the leaving certificate vocational programme, LCVP, and the leaving certificate applied, LCA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">The school completion programme aims to have a significant positive impact on levels of pupil retention in primary and post-primary schools and on the numbers of pupils who successfully complete senior cycle. The focus of the programme is on young people between the ages of four and 18 years and aims to develop local strategies to ensure maximum participation levels in the education process. The programme is based on an integrated cross-community approach to tackling educational disadvantage, involving primary and post-primary schools, parents, communities and relevant statutory and voluntary agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">Amounts of €23 million and €23.5 million were allocated to the school completion programme in 2003 and 2004 respectively. A total €24 million is provided for the programme in the Estimates for 2005. My Department is currently finalising a review of educational disadvantage schemes with a view to building on what has been achieved to date, adopting a more systematic, targeted and integrated approach and strengthening the capacity of the system to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged children and young people. The future position in relation to the expansion of retention schemes will be clarified in the context of this review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1608">Physical education is one of the seven curriculum areas within the primary school curriculum which was revised in 1999. The revised curriculum in PE will be implemented in full with effect from 2006-07 and extensive in-service training in this area is being provided by a full-time support service for all teachers over the 2004-05 and 2005-06 school years. A minimum of one hour of physical education per week is recommended for all primary school pupils. The curriculum has been structured so as to allow individual schools a high degree of flexibility and choice in the planning of a broad and balanced physical education programme for pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_1609">Second level schools should offer a physical education programme based on an approved syllabus with teaching hours registered on the school timetable. The focus of physical education in schools is on the young person's holistic development, stressing personal and social development, physical growth, and motor development. At second level, the phasing in of a revised syllabus at junior cycle level for physical education commenced in September 2003. The second level syllabuses in physical education have been developed on the basis of a time allocation of two hours per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1610">As regards resources, the physical education syllabuses both at primary and second level have been developed on the understanding that facilities available in schools vary. Consequently, they offer flexibility regarding the physical activities undertaken so that each individual school can design a programme that can be delivered using the resources and supports available to the school. The provision of new physical education facilities such as PE halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor play areas, along with the improvement of existing facilities, is normally considered within the design brief for building projects at schools. All projects, including those involving the provision of PE facilities, are planned and carried out in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising school building projects. In terms of resources, almost €2 billion has been invested in the period 1998 to 2004 in order to provide modern facilities, including those for PE, in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">A curriculum in social personal and health education, SPHE, is a mandatory part of all programmes for primary and junior cycle students, and its implementation is also being assisted by a full-time support service. The programme begins in the infant classes and specifically addresses the need for regular exercise, and examines food and nutrition issues and the need for a balanced diet. The objective is that by fifth and sixth class, students are equipped to take responsibility for making wise food choices and adopting a healthy balanced diet, and in that context, exploring and examining the food pyramid. These issues are continued in second level SPHE and also feature in the biology and home economics syllabuses. The development of an SPHE programme at senior cycle by the national council for curriculum and assessment is under way.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1657">The Government is firmly committed to promoting wider access to and use of information and communications technologies, ICT, as a key element of our strategy of building and sustaining a competitive, inclusive knowledge society. Within this context, it is the policy of my Department to advance ICT as a central teaching and learning resource at all levels of education and to ensure that the ICT skills of learners are developed to their full potential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">Since 1998, my Department has invested some €150 million in promoting ICT in teaching and learning at first and second level. Funding has included grants to schools for computer equipment, provision for ICT training for teachers and a range of support services for schools. A national survey of schools concluded last year by the National Centre for Technology in Education, NCTE, indicates that substantial progress has been made to date. Average pupil to computer ratios have been reduced to approximately 11:1 in primary schools and 9:1 in post-primary schools — down from 35:1 and 18:1 respectively in 1998.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">Every school has been provided with Internet access and more than 35,000 teachers have availed of ICT training programmes. In addition, many primary and post-primary schools are regularly using ICT in a range of subject areas. My Department has identified the provision of high-speed Internet access as a key enabler for the effective use of ICT in classroom teaching and learning. Earlier this year, the Government reached agreement with the telecoms industry on the establishment of an €18 million fund for the provision of broadband connectivity to schools over a three year period, with industry contributing €5 million per annum and the Government contributing €1 million per annum. This is a major initiative which will see all schools connected to a national broadband network by the end of 2005. Additional Exchequer funding is being provided by my Department for related equipment and services to support this initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">In the past few days, I announced a new €18 million funding package which will enable primary and post-primary schools to upgrade and augment their computer network facilities in advance of broadband roll-out to schools in the coming year. This new funding is additional to the €18 million being provided for broadband through the industry-Government fund. I should emphasise that bringing broadband to the classroom is one part of a wider strategy aimed at providing students with the necessary range of skills and dispositions for participation in today's knowledge society. Work is well advanced within my Department on a new strategic plan for further embedding ICT in the school learning environment. The new strategy will set out a range of actions in relation to: maintaining and enhancing ICT equipment in schools; connecting all schools to a high-speed national broadband network; promoting ICT as a central teaching and learning resource across the curriculum; integrating ICT with general and subject specific professional development for teachers; providing high quality, digital content for learning through Scoilnet and other initiatives; and promoting active engagement with e-learning at school level, and supporting innovation and disseminating good exemplars of ICT applications in teaching and learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">In so far as higher education is concerned, a range of initiatives has been introduced in recent years to ensure a sufficient supply of skilled personnel to meet emerging labour market needs. These initiatives have focused to a large extent on the needs associated with the strong growth of the information technology sector. Following a report of the expert group in future skills needs, an information technology investment fund aimed at developing ICT education and training has been established for the provision of new courses, including part-time flexible provision, post graduate conversion courses as well as equipment renewal. Since 2000, some €180 million has been allocated by my Department to meet undergraduate and post-graduate courses in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">I should add that implementation of information technology policy within my own Department focuses on the provision of cost effective, secure and reliable ICT services that support the achievement of the Department's business objectives and facilitate organisational change, development and the promotion of e-Government. With regard to e-Government, my Department is in the process of developing a technical framework and specific applications to facilitate on-line communication between the Department and, initially, schools. The first two applications to be delivered are an on-line claims system, to allow schools input claims on-line for the payment of part-time teachers and other employees and a primary pupils database to allow schools provide information about primary pupils on-line to meet the Department's information and policy development needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1664">The overall funding, capital and current, for the third level sector which I secured in the 2005 Estimates will stand at €1.58 billion. The additional funding being provided in 2005 marks a return to the significant upward trend in recurrent funding for the sector and will assist in meeting pay and other cost pressures. Taken with my announcement of the commencement of implementation of the Kelly report, I hope we can lay a basis for developing the capacity of our higher education institutions to assist the country in responding to the economic and social challenges we face.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">The 35% increase in funding for research activities in the sector, reflects the particular importance of the programme for research in third level institutions, PRTLI, and the role of the two research councils in providing the basic research infrastructure and in supporting the skilled researchers that are essential to our broad national strategic objectives. The recent OECD review of Irish higher education highlighted the key role of the sector for our future social and economic development. This echoes the recent report of the Government enterprise strategy group which states that Ireland's economic development, and the social dividends that flow from that, will depend to a large degree on knowledge and innovation. Supporting our higher education institutions in playing that central role is a major policy priority for the Government. The OECD report also identifies the need to align funding allocations with the achievement of national and sectoral objectives. I support that principle. A number of institutions are now embarking on far-reaching programmes of internal restructuring and reform. Some are further down that road than others. These efforts are crucial to ensuring that, collectively, we can develop the capacity to meet the wider challenges that we face.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">I am committed to supporting those efforts, recognising that this requires a close working partnership between the Government and the sector as we seek to progress implementation of the OECD report. I want to ensure that funding allocation decisions for the coming years will support and promote our wider strategic objectives.</p>

            <p eId="para_1678">I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 237 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at both primary and post-primary levels in recent years. The overall pupil teacher ratio at primary level has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">The overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule has been reduced from 35 in the 1995-96 school year to 29 in the 2003-04 school year. The staffing schedule for the 2003-04 school year was structured to ensure that all primary schools would operate to an average mainstream class size of 29 pupils. It is a matter for school authorities to ensure that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">The overall pupil-teacher ratio at second level has also improved significantly in recent years. The ratio fell from 16:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 13.6:1 in the 2003-04 school year. I am committed to reducing overall class sizes still further. This, however, can only be done on a phased basis having regard to available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. The proposed new system for resource teacher allocation involves a general allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, that is, pupils with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. The allocation is also intended to support those with learning support needs, that is, those functioning at or below the 10th percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">With regard to staffing provision for disadvantage at primary level, a range of existing additional supports will continue to be provided in 2004-05. These supports involve the provision of over 600 teaching posts enabling the implementation of significantly reduced PTRs in both junior and senior classes in more than 240 disadvantaged primary schools. At post-primary level, 203 disadvantaged schools will have over 220 concessionary teaching posts in 2004-05.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">My Department is currently finalising a review of educational disadvantage schemes with a view to building on what has been achieved to date, adopting a more systematic, targeted and integrated approach and strengthening the capacity of the system to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged children and young people. The future position on the provision for educational disadvantage will be clarified in the context of this review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1692">I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 274 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">The central vetting unit run by the Garda Síochána is responsible for vetting requests regarding prospective employees of designated agencies who would have substantial unsupervised access to children and vulnerable adults. The designated agencies comprise over 900 organisations. In the education sector, vetting is available in respect of prospective employees of children detention schools as well as special needs assistants and bus escorts to children with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">A cross-governmental working group was established to put forward proposals for reform of vetting by the central vetting unit run by the Garda Síochána. In particular, it was to consider the need to expand the number of agencies which could access the vetting process, to include, among others, schools and voluntary organisations. That group has now submitted its report to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who has appointed an implementation committee to give effect to the group's recommendations. Among its findings the working group recommended that legislation be brought forward to ensure the maintenance of a national criminal records system within the Garda Síochána, the disclosure of not just hard facts but also softer information, and access to information about — and proof of — criminal convictions for the purposes of litigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">The Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has announced a major increase in the resources to be provided to the Garda vetting unit to improve the level of vetting available to employers who employ people to work with children and vulnerable adults. The initiative includes the more than doubling of staff resources for the unit to enable the Garda Síochána's vetting services to be extended to all persons working with children and vulnerable adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">In the context of non-Garda vetting, relating to employment history rather than criminal records, the working group also recommended that the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children explore the possibility of developing an employment history register, similar to the PECS system in Northern Ireland. In fact, the North-South Ministerial Council made a similar recommendation following a report of a joint working group on child protection established by it and composed of officials from my Department and the Department of Education, Northern Ireland. Work on a discussion document is at an advanced stage and its finalisation and related legislation to establish a statutory register of employment history will involve continuing co-operation and co-ordination between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">The Teaching Council, whose establishment is now imminent, also has a role here. The council will provide the teaching profession, both primary and post-primary, with the means to self-regulate and its functions will include maintaining a register of teachers and if necessary removing the names of those shown to be unfit to teach, including those unfit to teach by reason of the fact that they pose a threat to children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1701">During summer 2004, the National Educational Welfare Board undertook a survey on the levels of school attendance for the school year 2003-04. This was the first time that data on school attendance at national level had been collected. The findings of the survey support the targeting policy followed by the board to date in appointing educational welfare officers to the areas of greatest disadvantage and will assist it in ensuring that all available resources are utilised to the full.</p>
            <p eId="para_1702">My Department recently conveyed approval to the board for the filling of a further ten educational welfare officer posts, bringing the authorised staffing for the NEWB from 84 to 94. These additional posts will enable the board to further roll-out its services at local level around the country. The budget which has been allocated to the board for 2005 is €7.8 million, an increase of €1.3 million or 20% on the 2004 allocation. The percentage increase being allocated to the board for 2005 is more than double that for the Education Vote as a whole and this provision will enable the board to continue to develop its services in 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_1704">As the Deputy will be aware, my predecessor, and the current Minister for Health and Children established a working group on undergraduate medical education and training to review the organisation and delivery of medical training and education in Ireland. The group has recently presented interim recommendations for significant reform of the entry mechanism to medical education. These recommendations include the introduction of a multi-streamed model of entry to medicine, comprising undergraduate and graduate entry methods, with leaving certificate performance no longer the sole selection method for entry at undergraduate level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">In this regard, it is proposed that selection for entry to undergraduate medicine would have two stages. Anyone opting for medicine who achieved 450 leaving certificate points would be eligible for consideration with places to be allocated on the basis of performance on a separate entry test. These recommendations are a very welcome attempt to address the tremendous pressures being placed on students in the second-level system as a result of the extremely high leaving certificate points required for entry to medicine and certain other disciplines. It is important that the significant implementation issues associated with this proposed change are carefully attended to.</p>

            <p eId="para_1708">There are 375 unqualified teachers in primary schools in the current school year. There are also 396 secondary trained teachers employed in primary schools. In addition, there are approximately 440 substitute teachers, who, because of the absence of acceptable qualifications, are being paid at the unqualified teacher rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">The recruitment and appointment of teachers to fill vacancies in an individual school is a matter for the board of management of the school concerned. Unqualified teachers should only be employed in exceptional circumstances and when all avenues for recruiting qualified personnel have been exhausted. In this context, my officials have recently written to all primary schools that, on 1 September of the current school year, were employing an unqualified teacher who had worked previously as an unqualified teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_1710">The primary sector has experienced a shortage of trained teachers in recent years, mainly as a result of the large number of posts created to reduce class sizes, to cater for pupils in disadvantaged areas and to provide for those with special educational needs. The difficulties being experienced are aggravated by the number of teachers availing of career breaks and job sharing schemes. My Department introduced a range of measures to address the shortage of qualified teachers and I am pleased to say that the number of unqualified teachers in our schools has significantly reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">It is important to acknowledge that the colleges of education have done much to increase the output of primary teachers to meet the needs of schools arising from significant additional teacher allocations in recent years. Since 1999, more than 1,000 students have been admitted annually to the B.Ed. programme in the colleges of education. Since the 1995-96 academic year an 18 month post-graduate course has been provided in the colleges of education. The total intake to the colleges of education in the current academic year is circa 1,280 students. This compares with an intake of 500 in 1996-97.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">There are currently some 3,500 students enrolled and pursuing various stages of primary teacher training programmes in the colleges of education. In addition, graduates of the new primary teacher training course, which is being accredited by HETAC and delivered by Hibernia College, an on-line third level educational company, will be recognised for the purposes of primary teaching. In addition to increasing the output of graduates, other initiatives have been introduced to increase the number of trained personnel. B.Ed. graduates of St. Mary's College, Belfast, who have studied Irish to honours level as an academic subject as part of their teaching qualifications, are now recognised as fully qualified. Montessori trained teachers who have successfully completed the full-time course of three years duration at St. Nicholas, Dún Laoghaire, which is recognised by HETAC, or the Montessori qualification which is awarded on completion of the three year full-time course in the AMI College, are recognised as being fully qualified substitute teachers and are recognised to teach in certain categories of special schools, special classes and as resource teachers in primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">The decision to recognise fully qualified teachers who trained outside the State to teach in certain categories of schools and classes without the necessity to hold an Irish language qualification is also contributing to an improvement in the supply of trained primary teachers. I am committed to ensuring that the shortage of qualified teachers will be eliminated as speedily as possible and in this context my Department will continue to consider new initiatives and keep existing initiatives under review.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_1723">I am aware of the figures referred to by the Deputy, which are extracted from the Trinity House school step down report for 2003. This report outlines the work of the step down unit which was established at the school in 2002 and also contains a summary of the results of the unit's tracking system which monitors all young people who pass through Trinity House school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">The tracking system was introduced in 2002 alongside the establishment of the step down unit and involves exit interviews with all young people leaving the school. Interviews are carried out one month after the young person leaves the school and are repeated at six months and one year intervals. The school has recently introduced interviews after two years also.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">Of the 57 young people who participated in the Trinity House school tracking system up to the end of 2003, it was found that within six months of being discharged from the school 24 young people, 42%, were reported to be in prison. Some five of these 24 cases, 21%, refer to young people remanded by the courts to Trinity House school for the most serious offences who on conviction for those offences were directly transferred to the prison system. A further 25 young people, 43%, were living at home, three young people were in residential care, two were homeless and one had returned to Trinity House school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">The figures highlight the high levels of recidivism that are associated with juvenile crime. This is an international phenomenon which reflects the difficulties to be overcome in breaking the cycle of criminality and integrating marginalised young people into responsible participation in society. All of the special schools for young offenders operate on a multi-disciplinary basis and offer individual care and education plans for the young people in their care. Young people are discharged in a planned manner in consultation with the relevant agencies and the schools have developed individual aftercare policies. The step down unit at the school was established in this context to provide ongoing support for all young people leaving the care of Trinity House school and it operates a work placement programme and an outreach programme for the young people. A similar step down unit has been established at Oberstown girls centre and my Department is currently examining a proposal for a similar unit at Oberstown boys centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">My Department is considering the introduction of a tracking system across the five special schools for young offenders in the context of introducing a management information system. As the Deputy will be aware, the Children Act 2001 provides a new legal framework for the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and their agencies in the delivery of support services for children with special care needs and those in conflict with the law. It provides for a major reform of the juvenile justice system and enshrines the principle of detention as a last resort. The Act provides for the Special Residential Services Board which has been established on a statutory basis and which is charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with advising on the remand and detention of children. My Department will work closely with the board in ensuring that our special schools operate to the highest standards in line with international best practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">Finally I would like to refer to the work of the project team, which was recently established by my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to examine the scope for rationalising and restructuring the State's services in the area of youth justice, with a view to improving the State's capacity to respond to juvenile offending.</p>

            <p eId="para_1730">I am currently awaiting the advice which the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is preparing, through its usual consultative and partnership processes, on issues relating to standardised testing for pupils during their compulsory schooling. I do not intend to make any decisions with regard to introducing standardised testing in primary school until after I have carefully considered this advice which I am expecting early in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1731">I believe standardised tests have high value as one of a range of modes of assessment in helping teachers make more informed decisions in relation to the instruction of pupils in informing parents of pupils' progress and in providing information essential to the identification of pupils that may require additional support. At classroom level, information from standardised tests can be particularly useful in informing individual and group teaching.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">The fact that more than 95% of our primary schools currently use such tests in some way is testimony to the value that our teachers ascribe to them. Standardised test results also have an important role to play at the level of the whole school as they provide valuable information for teachers, principals and boards of management when engaging in self-evaluation, a vitally important stage in planning the development and improvement of the individual school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">On a national level, my Department requires access to more regular information than is currently available on trends in pupil progress and on levels of achievement within our education system. I intend to explore the potential of systematised standardised testing in this regard. However, I can give my reassurance that it is not my Department's intention to use the results of standardised tests to compile school league tables. Neither will they be used as a stand-alone criterion in the allocation of resources to individual pupils or individual schools or in the measurement of the effectiveness of individual teachers and schools.</p>

            <p eId="para_1735">In accordance with the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, it is the responsibility of school management authorities to have a safety statement in place in their schools. Schools are obliged to identify possible hazards, assess the risks to health and safety and to put appropriate safeguards in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">Provision is built into the school building programme to enable schools address urgent health and safety problems. Primary schools are given an annual allocation, currently amounting to €3,809 plus €12.70 per pupil, under the grant scheme for minor works which can be used entirely at the discretion of school management to address basic health and safety issues relating to school infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">In addition, the summer works scheme was introduced during 2004 which provided capital grants for improvement works at primary and post-primary schools. A total of 457 schools were approved for funding under this scheme in 2004.

            <p eId="para_1740">No proposals have yet been made to me proposing a change in the position of Irish at senior cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has carried out a comprehensive public consultation process on the future direction of senior cycle education in Ireland. This concluded with the publication by the NCCA of Directions for Development — Developing Senior Cycle Education, which was presented at a national forum in Dublin Castle on 23 September 2003. The NCCA proposals set out a vision for the type of school system which might exist by 2010. The proposals envisage a restructured senior cycle curriculum consisting of transition units, short courses and subjects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">Publication of Directions for Development has been followed by further analyses and consultation by the NCCA in the lead-up to the council's presentation of advice and recommendations to me on the future of senior cycle. I understand that the next stage of this advice, due in early 2005, will include an elaboration of the possible configuration of subjects, short courses and transition units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">The position of Irish as the national language and the first official language is enshrined in the Constitution. In addition, the Education Act 1998 includes among its objectives to contribute to the realisation of national policy objectives in relation to the extension of bilingualisim in Irish society and the achievement of a greater use of Irish language at school and in the community. Under the rules and programme for secondary schools all students must follow an approved programme in Irish unless they are granted an exemption under rule 46.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">I am aware that the NCCA proposals for reform of senior cycle are underpinned by a comprehensive consultation process and international research. I await with interest the next stage of the council's advice. Should a change to the position of Irish at senior cycle be proposed I will consider the matter in the context of the issues which emerged in the consultation process, the obligations imposed by the Constitution and the Education Act to promote the Irish language and the need to ensure the right of citizens on an ongoing basis to access public services in either of the official languages.</p>

            <p eId="para_1746">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">To discharge its responsibilities, the board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents-guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. For this purpose, educational welfare officers, EWOs, are being appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the board's functions locally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">The budget which has been allocated to the National Educational Welfare Board for 2005 is €7.8 million, an increase of €1.3 million or 20% on the 2004 allocation. My Department has already conveyed approval to the NEWB for the filling of a further ten educational welfare officer posts bringing the authorised staffing for the NEWB from 84 to 94. These additional posts will enable the board to further roll-out its services at local level around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">The percentage increase being allocated to the board for 2005 is more than double that for the Education Vote as a whole and this provision will enable the board to continue to develop its services in 2005. I will be keeping the issue of the NEWB's staffing under review in the light of the roll-out of services and any further proposals that the board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1751">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. Arising from these improvements, class sizes have reduced in the same period. The overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule has been reduced from 35 to 29.</p>
            <p eId="para_1752">In line with the commitment in the programme for Government class sizes will be reduced still further. This, however, can only be done on a phased basis having regard to the available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector.

            <p eId="para_1769">The issue of the future of the college in question arose in the context of a decision by its trustees that due to personnel and financial considerations they were no longer in a position to fulfil their roles. Following discussions between the trustees and my Department, it was agreed that a consultant would be appointed to meet with relevant parties and prepare a report on the options for the college's future. The consultant's report was thoroughly examined in my Department and the options for the future of the college, including a merger with UCD, were set out for my predecessor's consideration. Having carefully considered the options and taken into account other factors such as the national spatial strategy, relevant costs in a time of financial constraint, a Government decision to restrict public service numbers, the need to secure value for money and a better allocation of resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey decided the considerations were best served by the closure of the college and the designation of St. Angela's College, Sligo as the sole centre for the training of home economics teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1770">It was agreed that the closure of the college would be phased over three academic years to facilitate currently enrolled students in fully completing their studies without moving location and to ensure that there was an adequate transition period for staff.

            <p eId="para_1773">Reading literacy achievement in primary schools is measured using standardised reading tests. Children's achievement scores on these tests are expressed in percentiles from 1 to 99. Those who score at or below the tenth percentile are generally regarded as having serious literacy difficulties and provided with additional supports in school, such as learning support teaching. This a rather arbitrary categorisation, as by definition, 10% of children must be at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">There are no reliable estimates or definitions of what constitutes a moderate literacy difficulty at primary level. At second level, the programme for international student achievement, PISA, survey of 15 year olds conducted in 2000 categorised achievement in five levels of proficiency. Those who had the lowest level of literacy achievement were categorised as below level 1. In Ireland, only 3.1% of children were in this category, well below the OECD average of 6%, while 7.9% of Irish students scored at level 1, compared to an OECD average of 11.9%. While one cannot extrapolate the findings of the PISA study to primary school children, the survey represents the best illustration available of the distribution of literacy achievement in the school system. Literacy achievement is fundamental to a sound education and I will continue to give very high priority to maintaining and improving literacy standards.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1782">I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 93 to 95, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">The health strategy commits to making improvements in the income guidelines to increase the number of persons on low incomes who are eligible for the medical card and to give priority to families with children. True to the commitment expressed in the health strategy, both the income guidelines and income allowances for children taken into account for the purposes of assessment of eligibility for the medical card will be increased from 1 January 2005. These increases were among the set of priorities for new health initiatives in 2005 which I announced on 18 November last. The higher rate of increase in respect of the allowances for children is specifically aimed at assisting low income families with children in accessing primary care services. The Government's policy remains as stated in the programme for Government to extend eligibility for medical cards, rather than to achieve coverage of a certain percentage of the population or to issue a specific number of medical cards. The sum of €60 million has been provided in the 2005  health Estimates to improve access to primary care by providing for additional persons to become eligible for a medical card and free access to general practitioners for those on low incomes. The medical card income guidelines will be increased with effect from 1 January 2005 by 7.5% generally. Specifically, the income allowance for each of the first two children in a family will be increased by 20% and for the third and subsequent children by 30%. It is estimated that this will increase the numbers eligible for medical cards by approximately 30,000. The estimated cost of an additional 30,000 standard medical cards would be in the order of €30 million in a full year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">Free access to general practitioner visits will be provided to individuals and families based on incomes of 25% over the new medical card income guidelines. However, it should be noted that discretion to allow eligibility for the doctor-visit medical card for those above the guidelines suffering hardship exists as for the existing medical card. It is estimated that approximately 200,000 persons will become eligible for free general practitioner services. Subject to clarifying legislative and administrative issues, the new doctor-visit card will be introduced as soon as possible in 2005. The estimated cost of 200,000 new doctor-visit cards is in the region of €50 million in a full year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">These initiatives will assist in overcoming barriers to accessing GP services in the case of those on low incomes. They will also help in removing poverty traps and disincentives to people taking up work or progressing to better paying work. Parents of children whose illnesses persist from year to year will no longer be required to re-apply each year for a medical card. Taking into account both of these initiatives, in the region of 230,000 additional people, including children, will be able to access their general practitioner free-of-charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">Currently, the setting of individual income limits is a matter for health board chief executive officers and will be the responsibility of the Health Service Executive in 2005. However, based on the percentage increases outlined, the relevant income guidelines are likely to be as follows:</p>

The practice of ensuring that no one is disadvantaged by virtue of social welfare increases in retaining or applying for a medical card will also continue. The Irish Medical Organisation has been made aware of these initiatives and indicated that the developments are in line with its views.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means and residency. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Persons aged 16 to 25, including students, who are financially dependent on their parents are entitled to a medical card if their parents are medical card holders. Those who are dependants of non-medical card holders are not normally entitled to a medical card, except where they have an entitlement under EU regulations, or, where they are in receipt of a disability allowance. Students who are financially independent of their parents are entitled to apply for a medical card in their own right and are assessed on the same criteria as all other applicants. The decision on whether or not a person is regarded as a dependant, or as being financially independent, is made by the chief executive officer of the health board on the basis of the circumstances of each individual case.</p>

            <p eId="para_1837">Guidelines for a home care grant scheme are being developed by the health boards in consultation with my Department and are almost finalised. The scheme is intended to support older people in their own homes and will be available to both older people requiring discharge from acute hospital care and those who need support to maintain them in the community. The criteria for eligibility for the new scheme will be broadly similar to the criteria which apply to the nursing home subvention scheme with some amendments. Eligibility for the scheme will also be assessed on the basis of assessed medical need.</p>

Since the publication of the strategy in December 2001, funding has been provided to hospitals to open an additional 900 beds. This includes the 700 beds provided under the bed capacity initiative announced in 2002 and 200 beds provided as part of the commissioning of new units announced in September this year. The following table shows details of the position at October 2004 on additional beds for which funding has been provided.</p>

The maximum payment in any 12 consecutive months is being increased to €550. The new charge for outpatient services in respect of attendance at accident and emergency or casualty departments where the person concerned has not been referred by a medical practitioner is €55. This is the only statutory out-patient charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">There are a number of exemptions to the statutory charges, including for medical card holders with full eligibility, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks and children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school health examinations. Also exempt from the charges in respect of treatment for a particular condition are children suffering from prescribed diseases such as mental handicap, mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy. Persons holding a doctor-visit medical card will not be exempt from statutory charges unless they are covered by one of the other exemptions specified above. Where exemptions do not apply, the charge may still be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means and residency. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. The health board CEOs have, in the past, exercised discretionary powers in granting medical cards to those in special need where the income guidelines have been exceeded. The incoming Health Service Executive will be asked to draw up a transparent policy governing discretionary medical cards.</p>

            <p eId="para_1950">Palliative care services in the Western Health Board region are provided in a range of settings. Specialist palliative care in-patient services are provided by the Galway Hospice Foundation in Renmore and funded by the Western Health Board. Specialist palliative care is also provided, in the acute hospital setting, by a multidisciplinary consultant-led team and palliative support beds are provided in Ballina and Belmullet. In addition, day care services are available at the specialist palliative care unit in Renmore and home care services are provided in Galway, Roscommon and Mayo. The palliative care service — hospital, hospice and community — emerged in a very positive light in a needs assessment carried out by the board with the service structure and multidisciplinary team providing quality care for patients, families and carers. With the support of Mayo-Roscommon Hospice, additional nursing and allied health professional staff have been recruited since the needs assessment was carried out, further strengthening the service. The board has obtained financial clearance from my Department to proceed with the recruitment of a second palliative care consultant and my Department has also acknowledged the need for a third palliative care consultant post for the Western Health Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">The health board sought the advice of Comhairle na nOspidéal on how best to structure the consultant-led service in this new and evolving specialty to provide a quality service throughout the region. A subcommittee of Comhairle has met with representatives of the board, the Galway Hospice Foundation and the Mayo-Roscommon Hospice on two occasions and discussions are ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1952">When posts are approved by Comhairle nan-Ospidéal, they are filled through the local appointments commission in accordance with the statutory regulations governing such appointments in the public sector. Palliative medicine is a relatively young specialty with few trained specialists in Ireland. It has not been possible to locate a locum consultant either in Ireland, the UK or further afield in South Africa or Australia, despite the use of informal and formal channels including advertisements and recruitment agencies. The board will continue to explore all avenues with a view to securing the services of a locum consultant.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1958">Under the programme for prosperity and fairness, an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of Health and Children, was established to examine the feasibility of introducing a cost of disability payment, PPF 3.10.11. The current membership of the working group is as follows: Frank Tracy, Department of Health and Children; Anne Marie Kilkenny, Department of Health and Children; Terry Walsh, Department of Finance; John Fitzpatrick, Department of Finance; Brian Miller, East Coast Area Health Board; Claire O'Connor, National Disability Authority; Leo Sheedy, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment; Brendan Sheehy, Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform; and Enda Flynn, Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1959">The NDA, on the behalf of the working group, and in line with its own remit, commissioned research which was undertaken by Indecon into the feasibility of a cost of disability payment in Ireland. The purpose of this research was to advise the NDA and the working group of the additional costs incurred by people with disabilities, owing specifically to the direct or indirect costs of the disability and the appropriate mechanisms, policies or instruments by which to address identified additional costs. The resultant report, Disability and the Cost of Living, was published by the NDA early in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1960">In March this year, the working group produced a position paper which outlined an overview of the work it has undertaken to date, its current thinking and an indication of the next steps the it intends taking. The working group strongly recommends that urgent steps be taken to improve the quality of data on disability in Ireland as recommended in the Indecon report. This might include, for example, adjustment of existing data-gathering exercises undertaken by the Central Statistics Office or other relevant bodies to include questions on the numbers per household with disabilities, the nature of the disability and the severity of impairment. The working group considers that it is vital that comprehensive data is available on which to base consideration of the feasibility of a cost of disability payment. Given its advisory and research remit, the working group considers that the National Disability Authority has an important role to play in addressing these data gaps along with other relevant bodies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1961">The working group acknowledges that a number of Departments and Government agencies have previously carried out reviews of the various supports and payments for people with disabilities. However, these reviews have tended to focus solely on the operation of individual schemes without taking a broader view of how the measures involved fit into the overall system of disability supports. The working group proposes to examine the scope for rationalising and streamlining the various disability support measures with a particular focus on mitigating the additional costs of disability for a greater number of people with disabilities, especially in the case of those who wish to move from a position of total welfare dependence to one of greater economic independence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">With regard to the second point above, the NDA has recently commenced work in consultation with the CSO to improve the quality of data collection on people with disabilities. On the third point, the working group has begun to explore the pathway from welfare to employment for people with disabilities and, in particular, the benefits trap which exists for people with disabilities, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the medical card. I understand the working group expects to complete this work within six months.</p>

            <p eId="para_1964">Initially, the teen parents support initiative, TPSI, established three teen pilot projects in Dublin, Galway and Limerick. Following a positive evaluation of the three year pilot programme, it was mainstreamed in 2002 by the relevant health boards. To date, five programmes have been established and based in Limerick, Galway, Dublin West, Dublin North and Louth. The last two projects, based in the North Eastern Health Board and the Northern Area Health Board, were established in 2004 by the Department of Health and Children with funding by the Crisis Pregnancy Agency, or CPA. The projects were established as part of a planned phased expansion of the TPSI to each health board area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">Annually, the national TPSI programme supports approximately 450 young parents aged 19 years and under to overcome the many obstacles they face in their lives. Additional support services are provided during pregnancy and until a child reaches two years.</p>

            <p eId="para_1976">The provision of quality services through Irish is one of the quality customer service principles around which the entire public service modernisation programme is based. The Official Languages Act 2003 secures the rights of citizens to conduct their business with public service organisations through Irish or English. My Department is committed to improving the amount and quality of information available in Irish as a result. My Department does not account separately for each element of improvements in customer service and a breakdown of figures is not readily available, but the cost is not significant to the overall costs of publishing information and other aspects of providing a quality customer service. There is no separate provision in the 2005 Estimates for the cost of implementing the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003. It is intended that generally the Irish and English versions of reports will be part of the same publications. It is expected that my Department will be drawing up a scheme in 2005 in accordance with the Official Languages Act 2003 and a costing exercise may be undertaken as part of this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_2021">Any other gifts or inheritance that might have been received within the same group by an individual since 5 December 1991 will also be taken into account when applying the thresholds for the purposes of calculating capital acquisitions tax. If the total value of all inheritances and gifts received since this date is above the relevant threshold, then a 20% capital acquisitions tax will apply on the difference.</p>
            <p eId="para_2022">The Finance Act 2000 introduced a package of measures specifically designed to reduce the impact of capital acquisitions tax where assets with average values are transferred. These measures included increased thresholds and the introduction of a single rate of tax at 20%. In addition, section 151 of the Finance Act 2000 introduced a valuable exemption from capital acquisitions tax for certain dwelling houses. The purpose of the exemption was to benefit individuals who had been living in a house for a period prior to the taking of the benefit, either by way of gift or inheritance. The exemption is not, however, intended to exempt dwelling houses taken by individuals who are residing elsewhere, or who hold an interest in another dwelling house.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">The Deputy may also wish to note that tax relief is available under section 467 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 where a taxpayer employs a carer to look after the taxpayer or a relative of the taxpayer who is totally incapacitated. This tax relief is available at the marginal rate of tax for expenditure not exceeding €30,000 per annum. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that gift tax is a self-assessment tax under capital acquisitions tax and that, in the absence of a gift tax return, form IT 38, or any other supporting documentation it is difficult for them to give a definitive answer in respect of the potential tax liability, and any interest arising, in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">If the beneficiary requires information in the completion of the return, he may contact the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, capital acquisitions tax unit, ESE Region, St. John's House, Tallaght, Dublin 24 at 01-4149791 to 01-4149797. It should be noted however, that under the general circumstances outlined by the Deputy, gift tax would be payable in this case under section 6 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003. If the individual in question is unable to discharge his liability in one payment, he may wish, under section 54 of the Capital Acquisitions Tax Consolidation Act 2003, to avail of the statutory instalment arrangement to discharge his liability over a five-year period. In these circumstances, interest is chargeable on a yearly basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2509">Section 469 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief on the cost of maintenance or treatment in any hospital, nursing home, maternity home or other institution approved of by the Minister for Finance after consultation with the Minister for Health and Children. Following such consultations, the nursing home has now been approved for the purposes of the application of section 469. Costs incurred since 28 October 2003 in respect of maintenance in the nursing home in question qualify for tax relief, subject to the standard conditions for qualifying for that relief. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as regards the individual in respect of whom details have been supplied, the local Revenue office will re-examine that person's claim in the light of foregoing.</p>

            <p eId="para_2512">I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 122 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2513">My Department has not allocated a specific overall provision in its 2005 Estimates towards the cost of implementing the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003. Spending on the Irish language will occur across a range of areas. The main area of expenditure on the Irish language in my Department is through Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí. Gaeleagras was established in the Department in 1971 with the general aim of promoting the Irish language throughout the Civil Service. Gaeleagras continues to make a significant contribution to the promotion and development of the use of Irish in the Civil Service including supporting the implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003. In anticipation of an increased level of activity in 2005, the allocation for Gaeleagras next year is €369,000, an increase of €119,000 over the 2004 allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">With regard to the implementation of the Act within the Department, the Department is preparing a draft scheme under section 11 of the Act. It is anticipated that any additional costs arising with translation of material, publication of documents bilingually or advertising, etc. as set out in the Department's scheme will be met from within the overall administrative budget of the Department. As indicated the main area of expenditure on the Irish language in my Department is through Gaeleagras. Gaeleagras expenditure over the past five years is shown in the following table:</p>

            <p eId="para_2602">I have no plans at present to provide for special treatment of crèches under the Valuation Act. The Valuation Act 2001 maintained the long-standing position that commercial facilities, including child care facilities such as play schools, pre-schools, crèches and Montessori schools, are liable for rates. Exceptions to this key principle would quickly be followed by demands for similar treatment from the providers of other useful services and products, which would be difficult in equity to resist. The process would substantially reduce local authority revenues, which would have to be made good by imposing corresponding increases on the remaining ratepayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2603">The rateable valuation of commercial property is based on net annual value, that is, the rental value of the property. Any ratepayer dissatisfied with the rateability of a property, the valuation assessed on a particular property or the method of calculation can appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation in the first instance and subsequently to the independent Valuation Tribunal. There is a further right of appeal to the High Court and ultimately to the Supreme Court on a point of law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2604">The core objective of Government policy in the area of child support is to provide assistance which will offer real choice to parents and which will benefit all children. In that context, our policy has been to increase child benefit by substantial amounts as the main fiscal instrument through which support will be provided to parents with dependant children. Child benefit provides assistance to all parents in whatever caring choices are most appropriate for them and their children. In addition, unlike tax relief, it provides support to parents irrespective of their income status. The Government has also undertaken measures to favour the supply of child care by tax incentives to set up facilities and relief from benefit-in-kind for free or subsidised child care provided by employers. Taken together these represent substantial measures to assist with the cost of child care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2605">My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has overall responsibility for the formulation of national policy on child care. In that context, the establishment of the €449 million equal opportunities child care programme 2000 — 2006, with funding provided by the EU and the Exchequer under the national development plan, aims to increase the supply of centre based child care places by 50%, or approximately 28,400, by programme-end.</p>

            <p eId="para_2607">The disabled drivers' and disabled passengers' tax concessions scheme, which applies to certain persons with severe physical disabilities has been in operation since 1968. Its benefits have been considerably enhanced over the period. It involves relief in respect of vehicle registration tax and VAT may be obtained subject to the maximum limits of €9,525 for a driver with a disability, €15,875 for a passenger, family member or organisation. Relief is available for a vehicle which has been specially constructed or adapted for use by a person with a disability and which has an engine size of less than 2,000cc, in the case of a driver, and 4,000cc, in the case of a passenger or an organisation which represents persons with disabilities. The cost of the adaptation, in the case of a passenger, must amount to at least 10% of the cost of the vehicle exclusive of vehicle registration tax. The scheme also provides for repayment of excise duty on fuel used in a vehicle, for the transport of a person with a disability, up to a maximum of 600 gallons or 2,728 litres per year. These limits are increased to 900 gallons and 4,092 litres for an organisation which represents persons with disabilities. Vehicles are also exempt from annual road tax. The benefits amount to over €5,250 on average per person per year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2624">I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2625">I have not appointed a task force to study congestion at Dublin Port.</p>
            <p eId="para_2626">Dublin Port is under the control and management of Dublin Port Company, which is in State ownership. The company is one of ten port companies established under the Harbours Acts 1996 and 2000 and operating under the aegis of the Department. The Harbours Acts provide that the principal objects of each of these companies include the provision of such facilities, services, accommodation and lands in its harbour for ships, goods and passengers as it considers necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_2627">Ireland's commercial ports are vital transport arteries, carrying 99% by volume of our external trade. However, the internal resources of our commercial ports are not sufficient in general to fund large-scale infrastructure projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2628">The Department has drafted a comprehensive ports policy statement, which subject to Government approval, I intend to publish in the near future. One of the major policy areas addressed by the policy statement will be how to meet the predicted deficit in seaport capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2629">The Department has commissioned independent consultants, Baxter Eadie Limited, to prepare a series of reports on seaport capacity and future projected capacity needs. Earlier this year, Baxter Eadie Limited prepared a desk study update in order to identify the effect Ireland's changing economic circumstances has had on projected capacity needs at the seaports. The study takes into account current economic growth projections and looks at capacity up to 2014.</p>
            <p eId="para_2630">Looking to 2014, the study has found that traffic is expected to grow by 16.2 million tonnes, some 35% over tonnage handled in 2003, while growth in capacity over the same period is projected at a very low level, about 1% over the period. These projections are based on known changes, which have full approval for implementation and do not include any other plans for infrastructure improvements. A capacity shortfall of 12.2 million tonnes is projected by 2014. The consultants state that the situation warrants decisions and further action in order to avoid increasing delays and congestion in some ports, particularly for unit load cargoes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2631">The Department recognises that the study by Baxter Eadie Limited is necessarily an inexact exercise, the implications of which will need to be checked against actual experience in each of the ports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2632">In the context of the ports policy statement, I will be recommending to the Government that a policy framework be put in place to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a co-ordinated manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2633">The proposal by Dublin Port Company for the provision of a new port facility on the northern side of the port would fall to be considered within this proposed policy framework along with all other proposals from the public and private sectors to address the potential capacity deficit. Development of port facilities at ports other than Dublin will have no bearing on the assessment under the foreshore legislation of the application from Dublin Port Company to reclaim 21 hectares which is currently before the Department.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2641">I propose to take Questions Nos. 136 and 137 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2642">Over the last two years, a sub-group of the National Salmon Commission has been comprehensively reviewing the provisions of the Control of Fishing for Salmon Order 1980 and subsequent amendments. The recommendations made by the sub-group were examined this year by a joint National Salmon Commission-National Fisheries Management Executive Working Group chaired by the Department. Arising out of this process, a number of practicable amendments to the orders have been identified with a view to updating and improving the qualifying criteria under which licence applications would be prioritised and assessed by the regional fisheries boards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2643">A draft order, incorporating the proposed amendments, has been referred to the Attorney General's office for legal advice on their applicability. It is my intention that the final draft will then revert to the National Salmon Commission for their endorsement, following consultation with the stakeholders whom they represent, before implementing any changes to the orders.</p>
            <p eId="para_2644">Given that the commercial salmon fishing season does not start until early April each year, the joint working group recommended that it was no longer necessary to retain 30 November immediately preceding the start of the season as the closing date for receipt of licence applications. The joint working group recommended that the closing date should be deferred to 31 January preceding the fishing season. This will allow the fisheries boards more time to put in place the annual administrative arrangements for salmon fishing licensing as well as removing the onus on fishermen to lodge their licence applications so far in advance of the start of the salmon fishing season.</p>
            <p eId="para_2645">I can confirm for the Deputy that on 17 November last, I signed the necessary orders to amend the closing date. This later closing date will allow additional time for the other suggested amendments to the control of fishing for salmon orders to be fully considered in advance of their implementation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2716">No specific provision has been made in my Department's 2005 Estimates to meet any costs arising from the implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003. As the Deputy will be aware from a previous reply on this matter earlier this year, my Department was already meeting the required standards of bilingual practice prior to the enactment of the Official Languages Act 2003 in areas such as signage and stationery in publications such as the Department's statement of strategy, annual report and customer charter, and in regard to the right to receive a reply to correspondence in the official language in which it was written. Therefore, the Act in these areas involves no extra costs for my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2717">My Department has recently been included in the first tranche of public bodies required to produce an Irish language scheme by March 2005, in accordance with section 11 of the Official Languages Act. The scheme, which will be on a three year renewable basis, will be agreed with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív. It will be prepared in accordance with the guidelines recently issued by the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, under section 12 of the Act and will be based on an assessment of both the internal capability of the Department and the needs of the public the Department serves.</p>
            <p eId="para_2718">When the preparatory process is completed I will be in a position to say what, if any, additional costs may arise in the implementation of the Irish language scheme. I am, however, satisfied, given the Department's current policy approach to Irish language services and the fact that the scheme will be for a three year period commencing at the end of March 2005, that there will be sufficient funding within my Department's 2005 budget to meet any such costs.</p>

It is my Department's policy to make all key publications and leaflets available in both Irish and English and the Department's stationery is in bilingual form. It is departmental policy to place all advertisements in both languages. Furthermore, my Department has recently been included in the first tranche of public bodies required to produce an Irish language scheme by March 2005. In this regard, I refer the Deputy to my response to a question put down by him today.</p>
            <p eId="para_2721">No specific provision is made in my Department's budget for expenditure related to the Irish language as the use of Irish is treated as an integral part of the service provided by my Department. It is not therefore possible to quantify expenditure separately with any degree of accuracy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2726">The project sponsor employs the CE participant with the assistance of a grant from FÁS for this purpose. As participants pay class A rate PRSI, an entitlement to statutory redundancy exists if they have been engaged by the same employer for 104 weeks or more and their contract is terminated because of redundancy arising from the withdrawal of a CE place. Community employment participants who complete their contracts are not entitled to redundancy where they are replaced on the scheme. Where redundancy occurs the responsibility for payment of redundancy resides with the project sponsor. I am advised by FÁS that it is not aware of any <i>ex gratia</i> payments being made to participants on leaving schemes.</p>

No further documentation has been submitted. At the time, my Department also sent this employee a copy of its up-dated guide to the redundancy payments scheme for her information.</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">As we have no record of a statutory redundancy lump sum having been made to this employee, there was no question of the Department making a 60% redundancy rebate payment to her employer. Nor has an application for such a rebate been received.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">As the employee's employment was terminated on 1 August 2003, more than a year has passed since that date and she is therefore outside the one year time limit, 52 weeks, for making a claim for a redundancy payment. However, under section 12 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1971, as amended by section 13 of the Redundancy Payments Act 1979, the Employment Appeals Tribunal has discretion to extend this 52 week period where it receives the necessary claim within 104 weeks of the date of dismissal and is satisfied that the delay by the employee in making his or her claim arose through reasonable cause. The tribunal, which provides a fair, inexpensive and informal means for individuals to seek remedies for alleged infringements of their statutory rights, including redundancy-related matters, is based at Davitt House, Adelaide Road, Dublin 2 and has hearings across the country. Its telephone number is 01-6313005/6313006, Lo-Call: 1890 220 222.</p>

In relation to social insurance, the 2005 Estimate assumes an increase in the employee PRSI ceiling for 2005 by €2,020 to €44,180 and a footnote to this effect is included in the Estimates publication.</p>
            <p eId="para_2761">An annual review of this ceiling is provided for under the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993. The legislation provides that the Minister shall take into account changes in average earnings of workers in the transportable goods industries since the previous review, as recorded by the Central Statistics Office. Changes in rates of social insurance contributions or the health levy were not announced as part of Estimates 2005. Where such changes are made, this occurs in the context of the budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_2782">In administering the telephone allowance scheme, my Department notifies Eircom of customers who become entitled to, or lose entitlement to, a telephone allowance. In the case of an award of entitlement, Eircom applies the allowance to a customer's telephone bill. In the case of a termination of entitlement, Eircom removes the allowance from a customer's telephone bill. The relevant details are transmitted to Eircom electronically on a monthly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2783">Recently some difficulty was experienced by my Department in the exchange of telephone allowance information with Eircom. Analysis of recent figures shows that approximately 3,500 awards and terminations have been referred back to my Department for further examination. Such referrals are a normal part of the supporting business process but the numbers have increased significantly since August 2004. My Department expects the underlying cause of the recent increase in referrals back to it to be diagnosed and resolved very shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2784">Customers affected, who received a notification of award of the telephone allowance and who subsequently received a telephone bill with no telephone allowance applying, will, in most cases, contact the Department. They will be advised that the allowance should appear on their next or subsequent bill and that it will be backdated to their correct date of entitlement. None of those customers who are entitled to the telephone allowance will lose any benefit from the entitlement as a result of recent difficulties as the allowance will be backdated to their correct date of entitlement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2785">In some cases, where a large credit is due, my Department will arrange to pay the customer directly by payable order if they so wish. In other cases, where the customer has incurred a large bill, my Department will contact Eircom and make arrangements for the customer to make partial payment only until the allowance can be applied. Any inconvenience caused to the customers concerned is regretted.</p>

This amount comprises a personal rate of €62.30, qualified adult allowance of €41.30 and dependant child allowance of €16.80.

            <p eId="para_2836">The school meals programme operated by my Department gives funding towards provision of food services for disadvantaged school children through two schemes. One of these is the statutory urban school meals scheme currently operated by 35 local authorities. The Department jointly funds the food costs with these local authorities which also manage and fund the administration of the scheme. The second is the school meals — local projects — scheme, through which ongoing funding is provided by my Department to a number of individual schools and voluntary community groups in both urban and rural areas for specific school meals projects. This has recently been expanded to include pre-schools that are community based and which operate on a not-for-profit basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2837">In the case of these local projects, my Department funds the food costs, based on a rate per meal per child. The type and range of meals provided, as well as the method and logistics of supplying the meals, are decided by the individual local groups and schools that operate the projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2838">The programme aims to provide regular nutritious food to children to help improve their daily diet. It is an important component of policies to encourage school attendance and extra educational achievement by the children, particularly those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. In general, I am satisfied with the administration of the school meals scheme, although I recognise that given the range of authorities and voluntary groups involved in delivering meal facilities, some variations can occur in the services provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_2839">The Department of Education and Science is using its schools completion programme and Giving Children an Even Break initiative to encourage the introduction and extension of school meals projects and I expect to see further schools participating in the programme in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2844">It is the policy of Iarnród Éireann that all new stations and all stations undergoing major refurbishment are planned on the basis of meeting full accessibility standards for passengers with mobility and sensory impairments. The biggest problem is that most of station infrastructure — station buildings, platforms, overbridges — was put in place 150 years ago and requires substantial investment to be adapted to meet current needs. Iarnród Éireann is in the process of upgrading facilities at older stations and providing access to platforms that were previously inaccessible by way of lifts and footbridges. This work has been carried out so far in ten stations — Athlone, lifts to subway; Balbriggan; Laytown, almost completed; Longford, one lift to road bridge; Mallow; Portarlington; Portlaoise; Skerries; Portmarnock; and Templemore. Iarnród Éireann has also upgraded access in Carrick-on-Shannon and Sydney Parade stations, and is in the process of completing accessibility improvements in Athy station.</p>
            <p eId="para_2845">At present Iarnród Éireann is carrying out a feasibility study on the Dublin-Cork route with a view to initiating a programme to refurbish ten stations on the line to fully accessible standards. The completion of this work will coincide with the introduction of the new intercity carriages that will come into service at the end of 2005. The stations are: Heuston; Portarlington; Portlaoise; Ballybrophy; Templemore; Thurles; Limerick Junction; Charleville; Mallow; and Cork.</p>
            <p eId="para_2846">Iarnród Éireann is continuing with the DART upgrade project which, when completed, will provide full access in 23 stations for the mobility and sensory impaired. This will involve improvements in the current ramps in a number of stations and in situations where ramps are not possible, lifts will be built. These will be installed in ten stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2847">The accessibility of stations in north Tipperary is as follows: Birdhill has only one platform and this is accessible; Nenagh has only one platform and this is accessible; Cloughjordan has only one platform and this is accessible; and Roscrea has only one platform and this is accessible. In Templemore two lifts and a footbridge have been installed and further works will be carried out under the Cork route accessibility project to increase the accessibility at this station. Thurles has access to both platforms and the accessibility will be much improved when the work is carried out under the Cork route accessibility project.</p>

However, I am informed by Iarnród Éireann that a plan for enhancing the appearance of Broombridge Station has been prepared in conjunction with representative users of the station and this will be implemented before the end of the year. Considerable resources have been expended in trying to improve and maintain facilities at this station in the past. The last effort was in 2003. All of Iarnród Éireann's efforts are subsequently undone by significant and sustained levels of vandalism at the station.</p>
            <p eId="para_2853">Significant improvements in rail services along the Maynooth rail line have been delivered over the last five years and these will be added to in the coming years through the provision of additional rolling stock and capacity enhancements in particular. An increase in commuter services was achieved along this line from December 2003 onwards with the introduction of 80 new units of railcar rolling stock for use on such services. With the introduction of the new timetable in December 2004, all peak services on the Maynooth line will become eight-unit trains, providing a further capacity enhancement along the route. Plans are in place to further increase capacity along the line with new units of rolling stock to be introduced into service towards the end of 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2854">The feasibility of providing an additional station at Pelletstown, along the Maynooth line, is being assessed by Iarnród Éireann as part of a plan for further increases in capacity along the line, including a new station in the Docklands area.</p>

            <p eId="para_2874">The purpose of the scheme of community support for older people is to encourage and assist the community's support for older people by means of a community based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members.

            <p eId="para_2878">In 2001, an application to grant island status to Inch Island was received by my Department from Donegal County Council. This application was refused in January 2002 on the basis that I had in 2000 already approved a grant, which was subsequently paid, of £26,200, or 50% of the cost, to enable Donegal County Council to raise the level of the causeway serving Inch Island, thereby ensuring the island would be permanently accessible by road.</p>
            <p eId="para_2879">One of the main criteria for the granting of island status by my Department is that the island concerned must be cut off from the mainland daily by the tide. It is evident that Inch Island no longer satisfies this criterion. It should be noted, however, that my Department has received a further application from Donegal County Council for additional funding to assist with the cost of completing the works in respect of which the above-mentioned grant was approved. These works involve the construction of a stone wall for traffic safety purposes and the completion of a sea wall protecting the causeway. This application is being evaluated in the context of the funding available to me and the competing demands for same.</p>

            <p eId="para_2882">I propose to take Questions No. 183 and 185 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2883">The only specific provision in the 2005 Estimates for my Department with regard to the cost of implementing the provisions of the Official Languages Act 2003 is a sum of €700,000 in respect of the estimated operating costs of Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla for 2005. As the Deputy is aware, my Department has published its scheme under the Official Languages Act 2003. The scheme details specific commitments with regard to the improved delivery of our services through the Irish language. These commitments will be delivered from within the overall budget available to my Department in the relevant years and do not require the provision of additional funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2884">On the general issue of costs, as I have indicated in response to previous questions in this House, no formal costings have been done in regard to the full implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003 on the basis that such an exercise would not be feasible in advance of consideration on a case-by-case basis by each public body of what, if any, specific costs might arise for it. It is clear, however, that there will be some cost issues involved, particularly at start-up. In the normal course, however, these should be met from within existing administrative allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2885">Since costs will arise in connection with such matters as training and translation services, the position for individual public bodies, or indeed on an overall basis, cannot be established until individual schemes have been agreed in accordance with the legislation. Circumstances will vary greatly from one public body to another in regard to demand for the delivery of services through Irish. Some public bodies will be better placed than others in having the resources to meet this demand, given that they already operate, to varying degrees, a policy of bilingualism. It is a matter for each public body in the first instance to ensure that resources are made available in order to comply with the provisions of this legislation, in the same way as resources are made available to ensure compliance with obligations imposed by other legislation and by the requirements to provide quality customer service.</p>
            <p eId="para_2886">The issue of provision of funding for specific administrative costs for individual public bodies, regardless of whether these relate to the Official Languages Act 2003 or any other service delivery or policy obligation arising, falls to be assessed against formal business cases or proposals submitted as part of the normal annual Estimates and budget cycle and not otherwise. Given its position as the first constitutional language, the objective is to ensure that delivery of public services by public bodies, including provision of information about services and activities through the Irish language, is seen as normal and required to meet minimum standards of customer service and corporate governance, rather than an optional extra or add-on.</p>

            <p eId="para_2888">My Department allocates resources to the promotion of the Irish language in a number of different policy areas, which include funding to Foras na Gaeilge and to voluntary organisations outside the Gaeltacht through Ciste na Gaeilge. In addition, my Department supports the Irish language within the Gaeltacht through a range of different programmes and initiatives, including Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge, Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, grants under the Housing Acts (Gaeltacht) 1929-2001, Gaeltacht improvement schemes, the Gaeltacht summer camps scheme, the language assistants scheme, assistance for third level education centres, and specific measures arising from the implementation of the recommendations of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta.

            <p eId="para_2914">As the Deputy is aware, the Official Languages Act 2003 is the first piece of legislation to provide a statutory framework for the delivery of public services through the Irish language and its primary objective is to ensure better availability and a higher standard of such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2915">Clearly, full implementation of the Act will require us to draw on the language competencies of significant numbers of people across both the public and private sectors. As I have already informed the Deputy in reply to Question No. 334 of 1 October 2003, it was in this context that reference was made to an estimate of up to 2,000 such persons. I reiterate that I did not, at any time, indicate that an additional 2,000 jobs will be created in the public sector as a consequence of the legislation. It was in the context of the inaccuracy in the newspaper article of 14 November 2004 referred to by the Deputy, which stated that "the Government will have to employ an extra 2,000 fluent Irish speakers at a cost of over €100 million a year" and that translation costs arising from the Act would be to up to €150 million per year, that I used the terms "fantasy" and "nonsense" in my response.</p>
            <p eId="para_2916">I make the point again that the public service in Ireland has a total staff complement of approximately 280,121 people. Within this, a complement of 2,000 people with a competence in Irish, as referred to above, would represent less than 1% of the public service. It may be anticipated that employment will also be created in training, translating and so on, outside the public service.</p>

The purpose of this meeting was to explain the provisions of the Official Languages (Equality) Bill 2002, as it was then; to inform and update Irish language organisations of the progress of the legislation; and to provide a forum for such organisations to discuss and debate issues in relation to the legislation. The meeting also provided an opportunity for me, as Minister, to listen to and address some of the concerns and issues being expressed by these organisations regarding the proposed legislation. Invitations to this meeting were issued to all Irish language organisations and any organisation that requested permission to attend was granted that permission. No minutes of the meeting were taken.</p>

The personnel strength of the Dublin metropolitan region west division as at 25 November 2004 was 641, all ranks. The personnel strength of the Dublin metropolitan region west division as at 1 January 1999 was 542, all ranks. This represents an increase of 99, or 18.27%, in the number of personnel allocated to the Dublin metropolitan region west division since that date. An additional 22 probationer gardaí are due to be allocated to the Dublin metropolitan region west division on 26 November 2004, which includes the two probationer gardaí due to be allocated to Finglas Garda station.</p>
            <p eId="para_2981">It is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division to ensure that the optimum use is made of the existing resources within the division. In this regard, I am advised that Operation Crossover, a dedicated policing operation is currently in place in DMR west to counteract criminal activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2982">In relation to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased to say that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with a commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force. The Commissioner will be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these resources. Clearly, however, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_2983">In each of the next three years there will be a intake of almost 1,100 new recruits. The advertisement campaign for this first trench of 1,100 recruits was launched today.</p>

            <p eId="para_2991">I understand a number of initiatives have been implemented by the Garda authorities during the past 12 months which targeted persons engaged in anti-social behaviour.

            <p eId="para_2992">There is also one Garda youth diversion project in the area concerned. This project is a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved — or further involved — in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. By doing so, the project also contributes to improving the quality of life within communities and enhancing Garda-community relations.

            <p eId="para_3039">The statutory framework for the maintenance grants scheme, as set out in the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts 1968 to 1992, provides for means tested higher education grants in order to assist students to attend full time third level education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3040">In relation to income thresholds prescribed under the student maintenance grant schemes, the practice in recent years has been to increase the reckonable income limits in line with movements in the average industrial wage for the relevant year. Similarly, in relation to the value of the grant, the practice in recent years has been to increase the level of maintenance grants annually at least in line with inflation as per the consumer price index.</p>
            <p eId="para_3041">The special rates of maintenance grant, usually referred to as top-up grants, payable to disadvantaged grant holders, were introduced with effect from the 2000-01 academic year. The annual income threshold for the special rates of maintenance grant is increased, in line with the relevant social welfare payments. The current income threshold for top-up is €14,693. The higher, non-adjacent special rate of maintenance is based on the maximum personal rate of social welfare unemployment assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3042">The following tables provide details of the current reckonable income limits and grant rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_3043">The Abridged Estimates, which were published recently, do not generally represent the total planned provision for public expenditure. It is normal practice for the Government to review and adjust the expenditure provisions in the context of finalising the budget and in the light of more up to date outturn figures. Moreover, the estimate provisions are only the first stage in the process of determining specific allocations, improvements and initiatives across all sectors of education. This process is continuing and I will convey the necessary details as decisions are taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_3044">I envisage that the same process will apply for the academic year 2005-06 in relation to changes to the thresholds for eligibility and the grant levels.</p>

            <p eId="para_3152">Under section 11 of the Official Languages Act 2003, my Department is one of 25 public bodies that has been asked to draft a scheme describing what services it will provide through both English and Irish, through Irish only or through English only. The legislation recognises that it will not be possible for all services to be provided through Irish and that the priority is established by consulting with our diverse customer base. This consultation process is under way and on its completion in early January, my Department will be better able to gauge how much it will cost to implement the legislation. Based on expenditure patterns in 2003 and 2004 for administrative costs only, the estimated expenditure in 2005 is €75,000</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3187">I propose to take Questions Nos. 235, 236 and 243 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3188">My Department is responsible for the provision of residential services for children, generally up to 16 years of age, who have been convicted of an offence or placed on remand by a court. Five special schools for young offenders operate under the aegis of my Department. These have an occupational capacity of 114 residential places, comprising 99 places for boys and 15 places for girls. On Friday last, 19 November 2004, 78 of the 114 beds were occupied.</p>
            <p eId="para_3189">These special schools operate pursuant to the terms of the Children Acts, 1908 to 1989, which will be replaced by the Children Act 2001 when the provisions of the latter Act are commenced. The Children Act 2001 provides a new legal framework for my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Health and Children and their agencies in the delivery of support services for children with special care needs and those in conflict with the law. The Act provides for a major reform of the juvenile justice system and enshrines the principle of detention as a last resort.</p>
            <p eId="para_3190">My Department has responsibility for the implementation of Part 10 of the Act, which provides for the establishment of children detention schools to replace the existing special schools for young offenders. While some preparatory work is ongoing within my Department, Part 10 of the Act cannot be commenced until separate detention facilities are provided for 16 and 17-year-olds by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The capacity requirements of the special schools for young offenders have been declining in recent years, with the provision of facilities for "out of control" young people within the health sector, the increasing view of detention being a last resort as enshrined in the Children Act 2001, demographic developments and the development of alternatives to custody.</p>
            <p eId="para_3191">A key consideration in commencing Part 10 of the Act is the identification of the appropriate number of residential places required. In this context, my Department commissioned an international expert in residential care to undertake a preliminary review of the residential requirements for children detention schools to ensure that sufficient and appropriate places are provided into the future. The review report does not envisage any significant change in requirements in the short term and in the medium to long term, it envisages a reduction in demand for residential places for young offenders following the implementation of the Children Act 2001 and the increasing availability of early intervention measures and alternatives to custody. This reduction in demand will be coupled with a higher turnover and a more demanding population.</p>
            <p eId="para_3192">Having received the review report, my Department consulted with the Special Residential Services Board, which has been established on a statutory basis pursuant to the Children Act 2001 and whose functions include advising on the level and nature of residential accommodation required for children detained in children detention schools. The board, having considered the review report, has recommended a bed capacity of 88 places plus six step-down places for young offenders who are under the age of 16. Since April 2004, all bed requests for the special schools for young offenders from the courts have been channelled centrally via the Special Residential Services Board and my officials are liaising with the board in monitoring the demand for beds across the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3193">My Department is embarking on a capital redevelopment programme at the schools for young offenders located at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin. This programme will have regard to the number of remand and committal places required, the provision for boys and girls, the educational and recreational needs of the young people as well as the implications of shorter periods of detention envisaged under the Children Act 2001. The dual function of St. Joseph's Special School, Clonmel, which caters for both offending and non-offending young people, and its certification under the Children Act 2001 are also being addressed. On the finalisation of this process, the Department proposes to agree a strategic plan for the children detention schools sector. In addition ongoing capital is being invested to ensure that the schools meet modern child care standards in accordance with best practice internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_3194">All of the special schools for young offenders operate on a multi-disciplinary basis and offer individual care and education plans for the young people in their care. The aim of these programmes is to build upon the strengths of each individual young person. Many of the students in these schools present with particular problems in literacy and numeracy and a programme is designed for each student on the basis of his or her needs and abilities. Educational programmes can range from intensive learning support in literacy and numeracy to a wide range of academic and practical subjects that can be studied up to state examination level. The schools prepare students for the junior certificate examination and for the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, modules in each subject area where suitable. Of the 78 children resident in the schools, 49 are preparing for state examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3195">I refer to the recent establishment of a project team the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to examine the scope for rationalising and restructuring the State's services in the area of youth justice, with a view to improving the State's capacity to respond to juvenile offending.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3206">I propose to take Questions Nos. 240 and 241 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3207">The Education (Welfare) Act 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_3208">During summer 2004, the National Educational Welfare Board undertook a survey on the levels of school attendance for the school year 2003-04. This was the first time that data on school attendance at national level have been collected. The findings of the survey support the targeting policy followed by the board to date in appointing educational welfare officers to the areas of greatest disadvantage and will assist it in ensuring that all available resources are utilised to the full.</p>
            <p eId="para_3209">My Department recently conveyed approval to the board for the filling of a further ten educational welfare officer posts, bringing the authorised staffing for the NEWB from 84 to 94. These additional posts will enable the board to roll out its services further at local level around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_3210">The budget which has been allocated to the board for 2005 is €7.8 million, an increase of €1.3 million, or 20%, on the 2004 allocation. The percentage increase being allocated to the board for 2005 is more than double that for the education Vote as a whole and this provision will enable the board to continue to develop its services in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_3211">The Government's commitment to tackling early school leaving is reflected in the National Anti-Poverty Strategy, the National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion, 2003-2005, and the latest social partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative on tackling educational disadvantage, literacy and numeracy difficulties and early school leaving.</p>
            <p eId="para_3212">My Department's ongoing response to the issue of early school leaving comprises legislative measures such as the Education (Welfare) Act 2000, which established the National Educational Welfare Board as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance; curricular reforms such as the junior certificate support programme and the leaving certificate applied; and preventative interventions such as the school completion programme and the home school community liaison scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3214">On budget day 2003, the Minister for Finance introduced rolling five year multi-annual envelopes for capital investment. At the publication of the Estimates for 2005 last week, the current Minister indicated that he intends to deal with any adjustments to those envelopes in the context of the upcoming budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_3215">Consequently, I am not in a position to define my detailed plans for capital expenditure across the primary and post primary sectors in 2005 until after budget day. I can, however, give the Deputy a general indication of my intended approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_3216">Clearly, in 2005 I will want to make further significant inroads on moving to tender and construction projects that are already in the final stages of the design process and are likely to be ready to go to tender during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3217">In advancing the schools building programme, I will also be anxious to develop the focused schemes introduced to address historic under-investment in our schools — initiatives such as the summer works scheme, which benefited over 450 schools in 2004 and the initiative to allow small primary schools to undertake building and modernisation works on a devolved basis, which has already benefited over 60 primary schools. These devolved initiatives, along with the permanent accommodation initiative, have been welcomed by all the education partners in that they give funding directly to management authorities to manage their own building projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3218">I am convinced of the merit of using a devolved approach where appropriate and I see them as an important part of my strategy to improve school accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3219">In tandem with moving new projects forward, whether through traditional or devolved processes, I will of course be maintaining the asbestos, radon and dust extraction remediation programmes and be making the usual provision for emergency works.</p>

            <p eId="para_3221">The staffing of a primary school for a particular school year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on the 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_3222">It is open to school authorities to submit an appeal on the mainstream staffing, under certain criteria, to an independent appeals board which is now in place to consider such appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3223">Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3224">An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of any such allocations from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3225">My Department also allocates additional teaching support to primary and second level schools to cater for disadvantaged pupils, pupils with special educational needs, traveller pupils and non-national pupils with English language difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_3226">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratios at both primary and second level in recent years. The ratio at primary level has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year, while at second level the most up to date statistical data indicate that the ratio has fallen from 16.0 : 1 to 13.6: 1 in the same period.</p>

            <p eId="para_3243">I am aware that Naas, Sallins and Kill, like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by my Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3244">At primary level an entire new school has been provided at Killashee, while temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corbain, St. Conleth's and St. Mary's national school and St. Conleth's Naofa in Naas. Temporary accommodation has also been provided at one of the two nearby national schools at Caragh.</p>
            <p eId="para_3245">At Sallins national school, a seven classrooms extension is under construction. When completed, this extension will increase capacity from 9 classrooms to 16 classrooms. A brand new state of the art 16 classroom school, together with a double autistic unit is under construction in Naas town. This project, in particular, will assist in easing any difficulties for primary pupil places that may exist in Naas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3246">Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David's national school, at Kill national school and at Two Mile House national school. The accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Caragh and Convent of Mercy in Naas are also currently being assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3247">At post primary, the management authority of St. Patrick's post-primary school, County Kildare VEC, is currently progressing plans to re-locate the school and extend capacity to 1,000 pupils. Additionally, an extension project is under construction at St. Mary's College, which will increase capacity at the school to 900 pupils. A similar extension is under construction at Meánscoil Íognáid Rís and further accommodation needs at the school are currently in planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_3248">All of these initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the areas concerned. The school planning section of my Department will keep the position under review going forward to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_3255">My Department has received correspondence from the school concerning the proposed new system of allocation of resource teacher support in primary schools. I am conscious of difficulties that could arise in relation to the proposed new model, particularly for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3256">Accordingly, I will be reviewing the proposed model to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common mild learning disabilities without the need for cumbersome individual applications, while at the same time ensuring that pupils currently in receipt of service continue to receive the level of service appropriate to their needs. The review will involve consultation with educational interests and the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented next year. It is important to emphasise that applications may be made for specific resource teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower incidence special educational needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_3299">In addition to these special classes, there are three special schools in operation in the County Kildare area catering for approximately 157 pupils with special needs with a pupil/teacher ratio ranging from 6:1 to 11:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_3300">My Department also provides funding for the Saplings Project, a facility sanctioned on a pilot basis which uses applied behavioural analysis methodologies for children with autism. There are approximately 30 pupils enrolled in the facility.</p>
            <p eId="para_3301">In the case of post-primary schools, a total of 1,100 hours per week additional teaching support and 726.93 hours per week special needs assistant support has been allocated to post-primary schools in County Kildare for the 2004-05 school year to cater for pupils with special needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_3306">The staffing of a primary school is determined by the enrolment in the school on the 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is agreed for a particular year following discussions with the education partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_3307">The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the current school year is a principal and nine mainstream class teachers based on the enrolment of 250 pupils on 30 September 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_3308">With regard to special education teaching support, the proposed new system of teacher allocation involves a general allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, and those with learning support needs, that is, functioning at or below the 10th percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics. An additional 350 teaching posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. It is intended that the new system will be implemented for the 2005-06 school year and the school will be advised of its teaching allocation in advance of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_3309">The school currently has the services of two full-time and one part-time resource teaching posts and a shared learning support teaching post.

These resources can be put in place immediately.</p>

            <p eId="para_3311">Every effort is made to ensure that children with special educational needs receive an education appropriate to their needs. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child.</p>
            <p eId="para_3312">My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special needs and I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those currently in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3313">At present, there are more than 5,700 teachers in primary schools supporting pupils with special educational and learning support needs. In addition, there are in excess of 5,000 special needs assistant posts allocated to meet the special care needs of such pupils. The enactment of the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act and the establishment of the national council for special education will provide the key building blocks to underpin service delivery in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3314">My approach in addressing the issue of educational disadvantage is set in the context of the Government's National Action Plan Against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2003-2005 and the latest partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, which contains a special initiative focused on literacy, numeracy and early school leavers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3315">A key focus of education policy is to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk and to optimise access, participation and outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups. Some €540 million is being provided by my Department in 2004 for programmes specifically designed to tackle educational disadvantage. This direct expenditure on educational disadvantage represents an increase of over €80 million on the 2003 provision and nearly 8.5% of the net education budget for 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3316">The approach for education set out in the national action plan is based on a continuum of provision, from early childhood through adulthood, with the focus on preventive strategies, targeting and integrated community responses. My Department is currently finalising an overall review of its educational disadvantage programmes, with a view to building on what has been achieved to date, adopting a more systematic, targeted and integrated approach and strengthening the capacity of the system to meet the educational needs of disadvantaged children and young people. Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3317">Arising from these improvements, class sizes have reduced in the same period. The overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule has been reduced from 35 to 29. In line with the commitment in the programme for Government, class sizes will be reduced still further. This, however, can only be done on a phased basis having regard to the available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. The timing and manner in which the target set out in the programme for Government can be met is being examined by my Department in consultation with the education partners. My priority as Minister for Education and Science will be to continue targeting resources at those areas and people most in need.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3339">The total housing provision of almost €2 billion in 2005 — Exchequer and non-Exchequer — for social and affordable housing will enable my Department to continue to fund a diverse range of housing programmes to assist low-income to modest income groups who cannot access housing on the open market. The Government has placed a particular emphasis on ensuring that access to affordable housing is made available through a number of targeted schemes. These include the tenant purchase scheme, the shared ownership scheme, the 1999 affordable housing scheme and, more recently, affordable housing through Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2002 and the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_3340">Part V of the Act, which deals with housing supply, came into force on 1 November 2000. It was amended in December 2002 to ensure increased delivery of affordable housing in a more efficient and effective way. From 2002 to the end of June 2004, a total of 209 affordable units and 106 social units was acquired by local authorities under Part V agreements with developers. An eligible person for affordable housing in the context of Part V is a person who is in need of accommodation and whose income is not adequate to meet the payments on a mortgage for the purchase of a dwelling unit to meet his or her accommodation needs because the payments calculated over the course of a year would exceed 35% of that person's net income. In determining the eligibility of a person, the local authority must take into account the annual net income — that is, gross annual income net of income tax and PRSI — of the applicant and half the annual net income of any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with the eligible person and contribute to the mortgage payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_3341">On the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes, I have already announced increases in the income limits in July of this year. The eligibility limits for applying for the 1999 affordable housing and shared ownership schemes are now €36,800 for a single income household and €92,000 for a two-income household, using the formula of two and a half times the main income and once the second income.</p>
            <p eId="para_3342">At the time of the review, I also increased the maximum loan that can be advanced for a local authority house purchase from €130,000 to €165,000 and extended the period for which local authorities may advance loans from 25 years to 30 years. It is a matter for local authorities, in operating the schemes, to determine the maximum house price limits having regard to, <i>inter alia</i>, the ability of applicants to meet the mortgage and rent commitments involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_3343">The deposit required by applicants under the 1999 affordable housing scheme and Part V affordable housing scheme is 3% of the purchase price. Applicants under the shared ownership scheme are normally required to have a deposit of €1,270 but a local authority can decide to waive this condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_3344">The tenant purchase scheme is available to those who have been a tenant of a local authority house for at least one year. They may apply to the local authority to purchase the house either outright or by way of shared ownership. The purchaser receives a discount of 3% of the value of the house for each year of tenancy, up to a maximum of ten years, of a local authority house plus €3,809. Over 1,500 local authority houses were sold to tenants in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_3345">Under the 1999 affordable housing scheme, a mortgage subsidy is payable to qualifying households based on income bands. A similar subsidy applies under the shared ownership scheme towards the rent payments for that portion of the equity not yet purchased. The qualifying income limits and the amounts of the rent and mortgage subsidies under the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes, respectively, were increased four years ago for all transactions completed on or after 15 June 2000. They are now set as follows.</p>

My intention is that local authorities will facilitate parliamentary representatives, in the spirit and the letter of the regulations, in relation to the timely provision of local authority documentation and I intend, therefore, that the operation of the arrangements will be kept under review with a view to any necessary amendment of current guidance on these matters.</p>

            <p eId="para_3403">The Waste Shipment Regulation (EEC) No. 259/93 of 1 February 1993 sets out the controls applicable to shipments of waste within, into, and exported out of the European Union. All shipments of waste must follow various procedures and control regimes, which are determined by the type of waste shipped and the type of treatment that will be applied to the waste at its destination. Thus, different levels of control regime apply, depending on the risk posed by the waste and its treatment in terms of recovery, for example, recycling or disposal, e.g. landfill or incineration.</p>
            <p eId="para_3404">Shipments of all waste destined for disposal, and shipments of hazardous and semi-hazardous waste destined for recovery, are subject to the requirement of prior written notification and consent. Thus, when a waste producer or waste collector — the notifier — intends to carry out a shipment of hazardous or semi-hazardous waste for recovery or disposal, or a shipment of non-hazardous waste for disposal, he or she must submit prior written notification to the competent authority of destination and send copies of the notification to the competent authorities of dispatch and of transit. In Ireland the competent authority of dispatch is the local authority in whose functional area the waste is held immediately prior to export.</p>
            <p eId="para_3405">It will depend on the nature of the coal waste, its destination and the form of treatment proposed as to which procedure should apply.</p>
