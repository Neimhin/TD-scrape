#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.I last met the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board on 13 March and reported to the House on 20 March. It is likely that I will next meet with the board in the course of my visit to the United States over the Saint Patrick's Day period next year.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Will the Taoiseach indicate the number of times the Ireland America Economic Advisory Board has met in the past 18 months? Is the Taoiseach happy with the prospects for further American investment in industry here given that the placements of a number of largescale and high profile industries have been postponed in the past 12 months?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	2	The economic advisory board normally meets at least once but sometimes twice a year, usually in the spring and autumn session. Sometimes the board meets here or we may travel to the United States, although members of the board frequently travel back and forward. This year they put most of their effort into the meeting attended by the Tánaiste, which was a very successful US-Ireland business summit from 4 to 6 September involving political, business, academic and official figures from the United States, Northern Ireland and here. It focused on developing a US-Ireland alliance in terms of investment and trade. The investment this year and last year has  not been as good but there were some welcome announcements during the year, the latest concerning Abbott Laboratories which will create approximately 700 additional jobs over the next few years in Cavan and Galway, in addition to its new plant in Sligo. I understand there will be others also.Overall foreign direct investment on a global basis is well down from $1.5 trillion, the figure just 18 months ago. There has been an enormous drop in US investment outside the United States – in Europe, Canada and Latin America – which is creating problems in many parts of the world.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Given that American investment abroad may alter quite substantially depending on what emerges in the context of Iraq in the next fortnight, the nature of ongoing contacts between Irish and American business, and following the economic conferences that have been held subsequent to the initial one during President Clinton's regime, is the Taoiseach prepared to lead a formal delegation which would include the Tánaiste in her capacity as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, to explain to American business interests and investors that our country is not actually in a shambles but that there is quite a deal of scope for good American investment? Will he do that next year in order to expedite or clinch a number of these investments?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Americans look at us slightly differently – they see that we are the one country that has higher economic growth than anywhere else in Europe. Last week the Secretary of State for Health and Social Security was here with a high-powered delegation examining the bio-tech area. An international conference took place with attendance from many countries including our EU partners and significant figures from the United States and many other countries. They examined the future of the bio-tech area. I had the pleasure of opening the conference. There was an upbeat and positive atmosphere. I hope they are correct because that industry is taking a slightly different view to many of the other areas.I will outline some of the key outcomes of the summit in September. It was agreed that a partnership task force would create a strategic plan with specific action steps for the next meeting in March of the Ireland body to promote further technology transfer between Ireland and the United States and the island of Ireland. It is to identify new avenues of collaboration and to promote and foster world-class capability for research and development in ways that are mutually beneficial. That partnership group includes the chief executive officers of US corporations on this island, Irish chief executive officers, university presidents, Science Foundation Ireland and other representatives from relevant State agencies North and South. It also includes the US  Department of Commerce. They will drive the partnership task force and build a research and development and business co-operation plan.In the second major initiative it was agreed that the US council on competitiveness would explore future collaboration with the Northern Ireland Centre for Competitiveness and with the National Competitiveness Council and this has already commenced.The third initiative was the promotion of US-Ireland collaboration in financial services. It was agreed to create a US-Ireland financial services forum to discuss trade restraints, regulatory reform, emerging trends and other issues of joint concern in the financial services area.The fourth initiative was a US-Ireland business summit representing important milestones in US investment which are based in this country. This is similar to what Deputy Kenny suggests. We wish to maintain our position among small economies and continue to press for direct foreign investment from the United States. It was agreed that there would be a special emphasis on US companies to locate and operate profitably here. The ones that are still here are pro-enterprise and pro-investment attractions and continue to be promoted very actively by our investment agencies. Many people involved in the Ireland-America Advisory Board have an ability to open doors for us and they have been doing so for the last decade.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Will the Taoiseach agree it rings alarm bells for Irish business to see foreign direct investment plummeting by 60% in 2001 and the downward trend continuing? For the first time in 15 years, we saw unemployment growing by 3% in IDA Ireland-backed businesses in 2001. Will the Taoiseach agree a very radical and immediate response is required to what the chief executive of IDA Ireland, Sean Dorgan, has referred to as a shift to a post-Celtic tiger environment? How does the Taoiseach propose to shift policy to take account of the post-Celtic tiger environment given the drop in numbers of students choosing science and engineering and the low level of research and development? Will he convene any more meetings of the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board, or any other meeting with IDA Ireland to ensure there is a more immediate and urgent response than we see currently?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	6	It is a fact of life that foreign direct investment has declined all over the world, particularly sharply from the United States, from $1.5 trillion down to $700 million at the beginning of 2002, and it is still declining. That is an enormous drop, probably the biggest since the 1960s. We have been lucky enough to hold a good share of this investment, even if nothing like the share we got in the years 1998-2000. We are still perceived as pro-enterprise and pro-business and as having an attractive tax regime and particularly a good education system.The money we have put into research and development, linking universities with business and giving business an input into the curricula that are being devised, is a very positive development. Deputy Kenny referred to the situation in Iraq, and we can see clearly what is happening with the United States. Many people are holding back on projects to see how this situation pans out – many big corporations have stated so in this month alone. That clearly has an impact.One would normally expect that large businesses in particular would activate projects on the basis that low interest rates are one of the driving forces of the economy, but low interest rates in the United States this year have done little or nothing to alter any of the economic fundamentals. This is a fact, not an argument. We have to look to research and development with business, ensuring that businesses themselves contribute, as well as our educational bodies. We must also pay attention to the issue of competitiveness. The one concern I have is that when fortunes turn – they will, even if the position is not as strong as before – we must be in a competitive position to benefit from that and not to lose our place.We have lost a few percentage points in terms of the competitiveness league and we have to deal with this for when the economy is back on the up-turn and investors are looking to us again. This fall in investment is happening around the globe. I had the opportunity of speaking to the President of Mexico, which is very close to the United States, and its foreign direct investment has stopped almost completely, creating huge problems. We have to deal with the initiatives we have put forward, which are very useful for business here. The most important thing of all is to maintain as much of what we already have and sustain it.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The Taoiseach expressed the hope that things will not be as bad as Mexico, for example, but will he say whether there is a plan B in relation to the continuing problems with foreign direct investment which, it has to be acknowledged, are worldwide? Will investment be spread in a more balanced way around the regions? Will a more proactive role be taken in regard to research and development rather than waiting for companies to engage in it? Americans register 16 times as many patents as Irish people. Will we try to improve ourselves in that regard, given that what is at issue is not only a matter of competitiveness but a matter of initiative. Rather than relying on competitiveness, will the Taoiseach indicate what initiatives will ensure that we will go up the league in terms of research and development and in terms of spreading investment around the country?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	8	There are many initiatives. I spoke earlier about the biotech conference last week, arising from which there are enormous opportunities. It was well reported and documented. This country, as a European location for  biotech advancement, is attracting a good deal of interest. We have to wait for the investment to follow from the initiatives that have been taken. The people in this industry are buoyed up by the fact that they think they have got it right, in that, from a European perspective this could be a real centre of activity.Equally on the pharmaceutical end, we have already received one large development which is almost ready to open in this city. The IDA has been working hard on a number of other such developments which it believes will come to Europe. One has gone to Scotland and a number of others will come to Europe. Such developments involve large investment and high employment of mainly, but not only, graduates.We are spending historical rates of resources on research and development. The partnership task force has set out a strategic plan in this regard. Those are three large initiatives that have been taken.With regard to the Deputy's point of spreading investment, the national spatial strategy in near completion. While the strategy looks forward in terms of a 20 to 30 year period, it is important that a large proportion of the jobs created in the next five years are located outside the greater Dublin area – that there is a spread of such jobs to the regions. That is a challenge to the system. The Deputy mentioned not only foreign direct investment but investment by companies here. Regardless of from where the initiatives comes, about 90% of our start-up indigenous companies want to operate in the greater Dublin area. The challenge to the spatial strategy is to make sure in the short-term, over the next five years, it will ensure that the majority of employment is created outside the greater Dublin area. The strategy will be finalised and published shortly.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	9	What is the Taoiseach's assessment of the value of this body? I take it that it is nothing more than a group of American businessmen well disposed towards Ireland coming together on an unofficial basis to give advice from time to time? Is it more significant than that?With reference to the wish of foreign direct investment to locate in Dublin and the need for a spatial strategy, have any meetings of this body or businessmen concerned with it raised with him the constraint on such a spatial strategy or such an industrial strategy in terms of the location of foreign direct investment – the extent to which such a strategy is constrained by the Government's failure on the roll-out of broadband further exacerbated by the Book of Estimates last week? When the Taoiseach talks about technology transfer and the location of FDI, is it not the case that what I have outlined is a serious constraint on the future possibility of attracting foreign direct investment, especially to the regions?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	10	This group has operated for the past decade or so. It is an advisory board. It does  not have a statutory, formal role. It is a group of businessmen, some of whom are retired and some of whom are very active, but most of whom are prominent in the United States and are regular visitors to Ireland and supporters of what is Irish. They use their positions and resources to help organise many functions and occasions to open doors for Irish business people and educationalists. I am not saying Deputy Rabbitte said it but one could say they are no use. One member has supported third level education over the past ten years and it would be very different were it not for him. I think Members know the gentleman to whom I refer and his sensitivity about his name being mentioned, so I will not go into that. One of the largest concentrate plants in the world, with the exception of that in Puerto Rico, is located in Ballina. The decision to locate there was taken by a member from Ballina who wanted to do something there. When the financial services centre started up—
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Unlike Padraig Flynn who never wanted to do anything in Ballina.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	12	That could be true. In terms of the financial services centre and many other areas, I would not like to overstate their abilities and uses but they are good friends when required to gain access to people, whether in the sciences or business. In the telecommunications area, one of them, Mr. Thompson, chaired meetings on where we should go. Many of them have changed and new people have been brought in with the recommendation of the embassy, including people who are known by Irish universities and others. It is a useful and helpful group but I would not like to overstate its role.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I asked the Taoiseach about broadband.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Broadband is important. The roll out of broadband to central locations and towns has commenced. If one was to ask me about what these groups normally ask, it is not about broadband. Air links are what worry these people. When they are given the price of air links, it is the main issue they raise.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Has the Ireland America Advisory Board a view on the future and on the levels of investments which will continue to be made by US firms? Does the Taoiseach agree there is a serious danger of this State becoming over-reliant on US multinational corporations to make up for high levels of investment and employment given that the changing global economic situation may mean that many of these companies will retrench quite brutally and security of employment of Irish workers will not be paramount by any means in their considerations? There is also a great danger of this Government being compromised in taking an independent position on US foreign policy for fear of offending many of these powerful multi nationals. Does the Taoiseach believe it should be a question of encouraging indigenous and publicly owned industry over which we can have democratic control?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	16	What is good for this country is that we have employers. It would be good if we could have more of our own employers, particularly indigenous companies building on the back of multinationals, something which tended to happen a great deal in the past decade. There are many examples in the areas of implementation, technology and software development where Irish companies and entrepreneurial individuals with innovative ideas who were working in multinationals have branched out on their own to open up successful companies, in many cases supplying the components and technology to multinationals while also exporting. That is a good thing.Obviously, it is not a good idea to have all one's eggs in the one basket. We should try to seek investment from whatever source, whether the European Union, the United States or elsewhere, but we should also try to develop our own industries as much as possible. The Deputy would agree there is a benefit to this country attracting US investment to Europe. It will go to Europe anyway, either to one of the applicant countries or to one of the 15 member states. If we attract our fair share of that, it adds value.The same is true for exports. If the companies here are producing and developing new products and exporting to other countries, which happens to a great extent, then there is great potential for business. We have developed in a range of areas, both with our indigenous companies and multinationals. We are one of the biggest exporters of software products in the world – we are certainly far ahead in Europe. We are also the biggest exporter of pizzas in Europe. We have managed to extend our range from the high-tech area to food items and that employs many people which is good for the country. I would not get too excited or hung up about us being too much into the pockets of the United States. We should not go out of our way to have a go at the US at every possible opportunity – and I know the Deputy would never do that.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	17	There is no fear of that ever happening in the case of the Taoiseach.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I am struck by the Taoiseach's remark on the importance of broadband. It is a bit like Dan Quayle saying that outer space is very big. His comments on the roll-out of the spatial strategy being 20 or 30 years hence appear to be somewhat contradictory when its very fundamentals were dispensed with last week in the Book of Estimates, in terms of major road and infrastructure projects. Traffic jams this year will cost €600 million to the economy.Did the Government, or the Department, carry out an analysis of the fall-off in tax revenue and,  if so, how much of that can be attributed to the loss of overtime payments, particularly in regard to American-based IT companies?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	19	The Deputies' questions are about the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board. Questions regarding this area to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will follow immediately. I wish to call two other Deputies and then have a final reply from the Taoiseach. The next set contains 18 questions and, in fairness to the Members who submitted them, time must be allowed for them to be answered.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	20	In view of the recent criticism of the Government in The Wall Street Journal, with regard to the lack of infrastructure in the west of Ireland, how does the Taoiseach propose to address it if the Ennis bypass is shelved? American companies that have set up there cannot do business and this will stifle the growth of industry in the west of Ireland. The Wall Street Journal does not criticise the Government lightly, but it has done so—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Deputy has asked his question.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Will the Taoiseach outline how we will bring investment to the area if we do not have the infrastructure to allow companies to take the merchandise to Shannon Airport in time for delivery?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	23	A brief question from Deputy Gilmore.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Taoiseach referred to the national spatial strategy. Will he confirm to the House that the Government has agreed the national spatial strategy and when will it be published?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	25	The Deputies seem to be wandering a bit away from the questions that were submitted.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	26	With regard to Deputy Kenny's point, in the past few years, and currently, we are spending an enormous amount of money on broadband. It is unfortunate that so much is being left to the State. It is a pity that the ICT companies would not invest more in it. They are reluctant because they got badly stung in other areas. It is the same in regard to the 3G licences. The State has been stuck with an undue burden which we continue to address.With regard to infrastructure, the figure is still over €5 billion and when compared, relative to any other country, we are spending far more than anybody else.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Apart from in the west of Ireland.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	28	The Deputy is correct in saying we need it and we are still spending vast sums of money on the capital programme.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Not in the west of Ireland.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Work is fairly well advanced with regard to the national spatial strategy and it will be published shortly. I do not have a date but it may be in the next two weeks or so. I do not want to be held to that but it should not take much longer than two or three weeks.Deputy Kenny asked me about the breakdown of taxes. I do not have precise figures but there are companies in the high-tech area that are still doing well, which is not the case with chemicals or pharmaceuticals. Some hi-tech sectors are still doing well but sales in sectors such as software and PCs, which are driven by consumer demand, are down. Exports averaged 16% per annum for the past four years whereas this year they will reduce to 4%. That has had a knock-on effect on production and employment and the position is similar throughout Europe.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 21, inclusive, together.I refer Deputies to my statement to the House on 6 November when I reported extensively on the proceedings of the Brussels European Council, including the preparatory meetings held  before the Council and bilateral meetings held during the Council. I also outlined the preparations for the European Council in Copenhagen. In addition, the Minister for Foreign Affairs answered a wide range of questions on the European Council.The European Council marked a major success for the European Union and Ireland and laid the foundations for the successful conclusion of the enlargement negotiations at the Copenhagen Council in December. Since making the statement, a meeting has been agreed with Prime Minister Rasmussen of Denmark on 5 December. The Prime Minister will visit Dublin as part of his tour of capitals in preparation for the Copenhagen European Council.With regard to my travel plans over the coming months, I will pay an official six day visit to Mexico in mid-January. This visit, which is at the invitation of the Mexican Government, will afford an excellent opportunity to review the bilateral relations between our two countries and to explore ways of increasing trade. To this end, I will be accompanied on my visit by representatives of Enterprise Ireland among others. I was delighted to welcome President Fox to Government Buildings on 13 November. This was the first State visit to Ireland by a Mexican President. Our meeting provided us with the opportunity to review the excellent bilateral relations which exist between our two countries.During our discussions, I briefed President Fox on recent developments in the EU and on the imminent enlargement of the European Union to include up to 12 new member countries. We discussed the role of the European convention in addressing the vital questions on the future direction of Europe in the run up to Ireland's Presidency in 2004. We noted the growing importance of trade between our two countries and of the wider trade relationship between Europe and Latin America. Bilateral trade between Ireland and Mexico is valued at almost €800 million, making Mexico our largest trading partner in Latin America. As Mexico and Ireland both currently serve on the UN Security Council, the President and I also discussed a wide range of international issues.I have also planned two one day visits to the Czech Republic and Portugal at the end of January and the beginning of February respectively. I will attend European Council meetings in Brussels and Thessalonika in March and June respectively. I also expect to visit Washington for St. Patrick's Day.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	32	On the last occasion, the Taoiseach said he was to speak to the Prime Minister Mr. Blair about Sellafield at the European Council meeting in Brussels. Given that the American Government has confirmed that the voice of Osama bin Laden is on recently released videotape in which he makes direct terrorist threats against Britain, did he raise the matter with Mr.  Blair? Will he arrange a visit by officials from the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland to British Nuclear Fuels Limited so that they can examine the consequences of increased security arising from the possibility of a terrorist attack on Sellafield? Given that the worsening global terrorist threat is very real, will the Taoiseach ensure that an invitation is extended to these officials as a matter of urgency?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Those questions may be more appropriate later. A number of questions have been tabled to the Taoiseach regarding his meetings with the British Prime Minister.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The Taoiseach undertook to raise this specifically with Mr. Blair.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I pointed out to Deputy Kenny previously that because of discussions on Northern Ireland issues at my last meeting with the Prime Minister, we did not get to discuss this issue at the formal session, though I had a discussion with him on the fringes of the summit. I will raise the matter relating to the Radiological Protection Agency of Ireland with him. There is a number of issues relating to Sellafield and the security threat and Deputy Kenny is correct in his assessment. Over the past two weeks, there has been a number of statements by the British Prime Minister and reports by British security intelligence sources about serious threats. They heighten security generally, and more particularly at Sellafield. We have had some communications on that but I will raise the matter relating to the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland with them. Much coded language is being used at present and we are trying to find out how specific some of these matters are. Even if they do not concern Sellafield, some of the issues that have been raised are worrying. The national safety committee has been working on these issues and it has good contacts and links in that regard. However, I will try to get some data and, in so far as it is not highly confidential, report it to the House.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Has the Taoiseach had any discussions about the reconfiguration of constituencies for future European elections? Has the commission been set up? Of whom is it likely to be comprised? When is it likely to be convened? Would the Taoiseach be agreeable to the commission appearing before the relevant committee of the House to hear the views of Members on this issue before it is decided?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I presume the Deputy is referring to the EU constituencies for the 2004 election.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Yes.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	39	To the best of my knowledge no date has been fixed and nothing has been set up although I can check for the Deputy. If there  are representations, I will be glad to hear them. I think I saw somewhere that the commission was to be set up next March but I will check for the correct information. If Members wish to air their views in committee, I have no problem with that.

There will be 12 MEPs from this State in future. Will the Taoiseach indicate when we are likely to know the configuration of the new constituencies?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	41	It would be good if this was done as soon as possible. To the best of my knowledge, the completed census figures will not be available until autumn next year, which will be too late. Whatever examination takes place will have to be on the basis of the existing areas but I will confirm that for the Deputy.

We are running out of time. The Deputy should confine himself to asking questions rather than making statements.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Is the Taoiseach aware that on the first day the weapons inspectors arrived in Iraq the United States, incredibly, launched a series of bombing attacks? Does the Taoiseach agree that he should cancel his visit to Washington in the event of the United States Administration launching an unjustified war on Iraq, which it obviously seeks regardless of what happens on the weapons front?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	45	I have no such invitation at present. If I had and if I was going to America, I would accept it. I do not believe that is the US intention. The Security Council approved resolution 1441 and the arms inspectors have started their work. There is a 30 day period followed by a 15 day period so over the next 45 days Saddam Hussein will, hopefully, comply with the resolution, to which we gave our input, and satisfactorily complete the process. We will thus avoid any difficulties about military action.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Does the Taoiseach feel anger at the delay in EU enlargement which he claimed he would feel had the Nice treaty been rejected? We now discover EU enlargement is to be delayed by at least four months. Is this expected to be the final delay or are there other difficult problems that might cause further delays in EU enlargement, which everybody in the House supports?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	47	There is no delay. What happened yesterday was based on the work that is continuing to complete enlargement. The EU General Affairs and External Relations Council had a meeting with Foreign Ministers of the ten Laeken candidate countries to discuss issues to be resolved in the final stages of negotiation. It is hoped that the work they completed yesterday will allow an intensive fortnight of discussions to proceed with a view to completion. A number of issues have arisen concerning a number of countries but approximately 90% of the enlargement work for the ten applicant countries has been completed. Following the two week period of discussion, the Presidency of the European Commission will propose a package to the partners for agreement. Once that has been obtained the candidate countries will meet again with the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on 9 December. The Council will then finalise its affairs for the European summit in mid-December and the applicant countries must then complete their own ratification procedures.For some time we had tentatively envisaged 1 January 2004 as the accession date for the ten applicant states, but it was recognised that the deadline could not be met. Therefore, it has now been agreed that 1 May 2004 will be the date of accession for those states. It is not a delay but, rather, follows an analysis by the EU Presidency for the time required both by the EU and the applicant countries to ratify the treaty of accession.It was also agreed yesterday that commissioners for the new member states will join the Commission from 1 May 2004. They will do so without portfolio until the new Commission is appointed in autumn 2004. The new member states will participate in elections to the European Parliament in mid-June 2004. They will also have rights of participation in the next Intergovernmental Conference. Now that all states have ratified the Nice treaty, the timescale for accession has been fixed and, hopefully, there will be no changes in the dates to which I have referred.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	48	It is a four month delay.

Otherwise, the applicant countries' representatives would have joined the European Council earlier and the entire Commission would have had to be altered during its final months in office. It would not have made much sense to do that. Many of the applicant countries want to have all of next year for the purpose of ratifying their own treaties of accession. Therefore, this is a sensible, agreed position to take, both for the member states and the applicant ones.

Will the Taoiseach use that opportunity strongly to oppose this measure, which will deal a mortal blow to the fishing industry and the communities it supports? Will the Taoiseach tell us if the draft EU constitution, which arises from the convention, will also be addressed at the Copenhagen Summit? What is the Taoiseach's view of an EU constitution which would supersede all state constitutions? Does he believe in the words of the draft as presented, that "a union of European States which, while retaining their national identities, closely co-ordinate their policies at the European level and administer certain competencies on a federal basis"? Does the Taoiseach support this federal project?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	51	As regards the Deputy's first question, the Common Fisheries Policy will be discussed next week and a full Fisheries Council will be held later in December. I do not expect it will be on the agenda for the European Council's summit meeting.On the Deputy's second point, after the listening phase that went on for the past number of months, the convention has now reached an important stage of its work. The former French President, Monsieur Giscard d'Estaing, has published a draft constitutional treaty. There are many aspects to that treaty, some of which I favour and some of which I am concerned about. It is all up for discussion.There are ten sub-groups, some of which have reported, others will report before Christmas and some may report in January or even February. The more formal plenary session will be held on 10 December, which Oireachtas Members will attend, and the Government will also pay close attention. We are now at an early stage.I am not in favour of any kind of federalist Europe. There are different kinds of groups in the convention – there are sceptics, although I am not one of them, federalists, integrationists and intergovernmentalists, so there are many different positions. That is what the convention and forum will be about for the next year. They hope to complete their work by next summer at the earliest.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The Italian Prime Minister, Mr. Berlusconi, seems very enthusiastic, given the work leading to the intergovernmental conference, that he may be able to sign off on a new treaty of Rome. Does the Taoiseach's timescale envisage that happening or does he see this carrying through to Ireland's Presidency in 2004?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	53	What is the Taoiseach's view on the European Council proposal to open the Irish fishing box to the fleets of Spain and other countries in the context of depleting stocks? In terms of globalisation and north-south, rich-poor issues, what is the Taoiseach's assessment of the Ger man-French agricultural pact and its implications for such issues?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	54	On the Intergovernmental Conference, I do not see how one could envisage Italy wrapping this up based on what happened originally, although I can understand why Mr. Berlusconi would like to do so. The idea was that this would be a break, and I favour a break between the two. That makes eminent sense. I do not agree with this but there will be a debate on the issue.Deputy Rabbitte asked me a straight question about the fisheries proposal and the straight answer is that I oppose it. It goes against all the advice we have on conservation, never mind the damage it would do. We have fought on conservation issues for many years and this runs against our position in those battles. I do not agree with it.The move on the agricultural issue is very beneficial for us. It is a good deal for us although, like every other deal, it may not include everything we want. The concept behind the deal is that direct payments for the ten new member states would be phased in incrementally, as proposed by the Commission. In 2004 they would get 25% and 5% in 2005, 2006 and 2007. They will then be paid 10% up to 2013. Within those figures the direct payments are not index-related and have not been for a decade, as Deputy Rabbitte knows. Taking the 1% which will apply on top of that in 2006 and the fact that rural development, the REPS and other environmental issues as well as the matters of Romania and Bulgaria have been excluded, so far as one can look at the figures up to 2013 it seems there is enough for existing member states. Obviously that is on a very tight basis.Germany has made a large contribution to make this happen because it pays over 25% of the budget. The critical view is that Germany will do well out of enlargement anyway so it should do so, but that is a big move from where Germany has been for the past two years. From an Irish perspective it is a very good deal. It means no change to the end of 2006.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I think it is a very good deal for the Irish but obviously when the discussions are held again in the world trade round, different arguments will be put forward about how we deal with food supply and other issues.However, there may be some changes, notwithstanding this. For that reason Irish farmers should be doing more to make themselves ready for a position, even if it is sometime between 2006 and 2013, when the Common Agricultural Policy will not provide in the long-term the kind of resources we now have. Those resources are fairly well pro tected for a decade. I did not think we would get a deal as good as this after 2006, but I still think this issue will come home to roost.With regard to the world trade round, there are many areas that will change. It would be advisable for us, and for Europe, to continue to work with Mr. Franz Fischler on some of its reviews, even if they do not have legal status. The issues he is trying to deal with in his review are among those that will protect European agriculture subsequent to the world trade round. Last week I had a good assessment of the world trade round, as seen by the Mexicans. Europe will have to give way on a number of issues. It is better that we agree on this rather than get into difficulties arising out of a Doha package when it comes, as it will come.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The Government remains committed to the long-term development of the forestry sector. This commitment has again been reiterated in the programme for Government.Over the last six years, 1997-2002, expenditure on forestry amounted to over €540 million or an average annual spend of €90 million. This figure is not so far from the 2003 allocation of €82.58 million. During that period some 83,000 hectares have been planted under the afforestation programme. This represents an average planting rate of almost 14,000 hectares per annum.Under the national development plan expenditure of over €900 million has been designated for forestry. This again represents a significant commitment on behalf of the Government and the European Union to the medium and long-term development of the forestry sector in Ireland.The allocation for forestry in 2003 of €82.58 million has to be seen not only in the context of the general budgetary situation but also of expenditure in this area over recent years and the funding commitment in the national development plan. Under this Government expenditure on forestry has geared up significantly with a projected out-turn this year of almost €107 million.I am confident that we will, on the basis of the allocation provided, achieve a viable planting programme in 2003. To that end I am meeting tomorrow morning with representatives of the forestry sector to see how best we can together  achieve this objective. I am confident we can achieve a viable planting programme.There is absolutely no question of any cuts in grant and premium levels, which remain unchanged. In fact, the Deputy will be aware that the Government secured increases of over 30% in 2000 in grant and premium levels. In addition we also secured a commitment to review the grant and premium levels in 2003 with the possibility of increases from 2004.The Government remains strongly committed to the continued development of the forestry sector. Our performance and delivery on this over the past five years is a matter of record. With the support of the sector I am confident we will achieve a viable planting programme in 2003.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	59	How many acres or hectares will be planted in 2003? This cutback will devastate the forestry industry. It is estimated that the forestry programme for next year will be halved in hectarage. This means that half the stock in tree nurseries throughout the country will be unusable. As many as 20 million young trees which have been prepared over the past three years – 20,000 hectares at 1,000 trees to the acre – will not be planted. What does the Minister of State propose for those businesses which have trees waiting to be planted but which cannot be planted because of cutbacks?Is the Minister of State aware that the National Council for Forest Research and Development has commissioned Dr. Richard Moloney of UCC to assess the impact this cutback will have on the economy? Dr. Moloney reckons there will be a loss of about €44 million to the rural economy. Does the Minister of State accept that the cutback of €22 million will mean a saving of only €11 million to the Department because the other half represents EU matching funding? Even though the Exchequer may save €11 million we will lose €22 million in direct payments to the rural economy. In fact it is estimated by Dr. Moloney that there will be a net loss to the Exchequer.

I have listened for the last number of days to representatives of the forestry industry making wild allegations. I have discussed this matter with individuals from the industry in the past week and I intend meeting representatives of the industry tomorrow morning to work out how we will spend the €82.5 million, which is a substantial amount of taxpayers' money.I remind the Deputy that in 1997, when his party was in Government, the spend was €64 million. The expenditure of €540 million over the last five years is a significant investment in the forestry industry. When I examine the Estimates with representatives of the industry we will be able to plan a viable planting programme for 2003. I am totally committed to a continued afforestation programme.

#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	74	It is too early to speculate on possible benefits to the economy. A considerable amount of analysis of existing data together with much further appraisal work on the prospect will  be required. It is expected that appraisal operations will resume at the earliest possible opportunity during the drilling season in 2003. Even at that stage it is unlikely there will be enough known to judge the economic significance of the find given the depth of water – 1,500 metres – the distance from shore and the lack of infrastructure in the area. There was a period of four and a half years between the initial find on the Corrib gas field and the declaration that it was commercial.The licensing terms for oil and gas exploration and development cover in a comprehensive way the terms and conditions governing all aspects of exploration and development including the general terms relating to frontier exploration licences. The Dooish well, if it is commercial, will be developed under the 1992 terms.The use of Irish goods, services and employees is a crucial means by which exploitation of our hydrocarbons adds value to the economy. However, the Government does not expect exploration companies to avail of Irish goods, services or employment where these are clearly uncompetitive. It does, however, expect that any company operating in Ireland for the long-term will see that it is in its own best commercial interest to build strong links into the Irish economy and to demonstrate a significant economic and social dividend. In that context I have arranged to meet with SIPTU on the general question of ensuring that companies operating in the Irish offshore, whether exploring or producing, use competitive Irish services to the greatest extent possible.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Does the Minister agree that he has been constantly misled by the exploration companies on the extent and timing of finds? Does he further agree that the current licensing terms afford no benefit to this State as it has no stake in any find and earns no royalties and, in turn, grants massive tax write-offs? Will the Minister take steps to change those terms?Furthermore, does the Minister believe that the role of the former Minister, Ray Burke, in granting those terms warrants a full investigation? Will he establish the State petroleum corporation as an active agent in the exploration of our oil and gas reserves and will he put pressure on the oil companies to employ Irish workers? At the moment, to work offshore, an Irish rig worker has to go abroad and come in with a rig, and the reason for this is the deunionising of the oil rigs. Is the Minister prepared to insist on the oil companies employing Irish workers and using services from this State? Finally, will the Minister state whether the 1975 or 1992 terms apply to the Ramco find in the Seven Heads field?
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I do not accept that we have been misled by the oil companies. We have efficient officials in the Department who are on top of their brief. In respect of some of the issues raised by the Deputy, it is the policy of this Govern ment, as it was of previous Governments, that companies operating in the Irish offshore should use Irish goods and services to the greatest extent possible. I recently made that point at the petroleum dinner I addressed.A framework group representative of my Department, the State's development agencies, the Irish Offshore Operators' Association and the Irish offshore service industry, as well as the unions, has the task of ensuring that Irish companies are made aware of, and given the opportunity and assistance to bid for, upcoming work in the Irish offshore. It is very involved in this area. In the event of the Dooish discovery becoming a commercial project, it will be involved in selling Irish goods and services and promoting the employment of Irish employees, of which the Deputy spoke.As I said in my initial statement, I have arranged to meet Noel Dowling, the national secretary of SIPTU, on 3 December to discuss in general how to ensure that Ireland benefits to the greatest extent possible from offshore hydrocarbon exploration and production.The changes made in 1987 to the offshore exploration licence terms were designed to keep exploration in Ireland at a sustainable level. The changes addressed the falling levels of both exploration and commercial finds and sought to make exploration in Ireland attractive for the industry when several other countries of north-west Europe were enjoying commercial finds. In fact, these adjustments were consolidated in the 1992 licensing terms and have been left unchanged by every Government since then. Despite the relative attractiveness of these terms, no company has benefited from them to date. Therefore, there has not been a big influx of companies because of the change in the licensing regulations.

Legal opinion received from the Council legal services at the end of October advised that the arrangement governing access to waters and resources in western waters and the Irish Box provided for in Council regulations would cease to have legal effect on 31 December 2002.The legal framework governing access was a difficult political compromise agreed in the context of the full integration of Spain and Portugal into the Common Fisheries Policy. The provisions which govern conservation in the Irish Box should continue after the end of 2002. It is clear that the Commission has been of the same opinion in so far as it did not envisage an end to the western waters regime in its Green Paper on CFP reform or in the proposals for reform introduced in May 2002.This legal opinion is incomplete and flawed. My legal advice is that the regimes in place for the Irish Box and western waters do not expire and I have forwarded legal arguments to support this contention to the Commission and Council. Over the coming weeks, I will be highlighting the differing interpretation of the legal position to the Commissioner, the Presidency and my ministerial colleagues in Europe.Since the legal advice from the Council legal services became available, apart from meetings at official level, I have met the Portuguese Minister for Fisheries, who shares some common ground with Ireland on this issue, and the Danish Minister for Fisheries, who currently holds the Presidency of the Council for Agriculture and Fisheries. I also had a meeting with EU Commission officials, including director general, Jorgen Holmquist, and I held a bilateral meeting last week with Franz Fischler, the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Fisheries, involving the Irish fishing industry. At the meeting, Ireland's case that the waters within the Irish Box are very sensitive and play an important role as nursery grounds for stocks in western waters and beyond was made strongly. The need to maintain and enhance the current restrictive regime, which is fully justified on the grounds of conservation and rational exploitation of fish stocks, was strongly emphasised.Commissioner Fischler stated that the Commission is seeking a way of preserving fish stocks and preventing the increase of fishing effort in the Irish Box that treats all member states in an equal way. However, the Commissioner considers that the rules currently governing the Irish Box, which relate to the 40-vessel limit for Spain, are discriminatory and must be changed from the 1 January 2003.I have serious concerns about this approach in so far as the current 40-vessel restriction for Spain  is an effective instrument for conservation and must be retained. My legal advice does not support the Commissioner's contention that the present regime is discriminatory. I consider that the Irish Box regime was a political compromise agreed after intensive negotiations over a three year period in the mid-1990s. It is not acceptable that we walk away from these arrangements on the basis of a legal opinion that would not have the confidence of the main players in these arrangements.I will continue in the coming weeks to work vigorously to have Ireland's position on this issue fully understood by my colleagues at Council and by Commissioner Fischler, both from a legal and political perspective. It is crucial that Council be fully informed of the consequences for fish stocks and for fishing communities around Ireland dependent on fishing of any change in this regime that would increase access or fishing effort within the Irish Box.

Maybe we will return to that issue later.I was at the press conference with Franz Fischler. I was devastated and stunned by what he told us. He said our fishermen on the western, eastern and southern coasts were in for some difficult times. He said there would be much hardship for the fishermen of Ireland. That was his fundamental judgment on the future of our box on the west coast and on proposals in respect of the cod and white fleet fisheries.Does the Minister agree with the comments of Commissioner Fischler that our coastal communities from Howth to Castletownbere and up to Killybegs are in for some devastating times as a result, perhaps, of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources taking its eye off the ball? Is the Minister prepared to publish the legal advice he took to the meeting with Franz Fischler so we can see its impact?I commend the Minister for meeting the Portuguese and securing their support. He said he had secured the support of six states, including, ironically, Spain. Does he consider that his diplomatic efforts over the coming months will be successful, given that the huge Spanish fleet off the west coast has never had any interest in the conservation of Irish fish stocks or in the welfare of Irish coastal communities?The Minister said the key decision affecting this issue was taken in the 1970s and 1980s and was political rather than legal. Does he intend to pursue the valuable recommendations of the previous Government's strategy review group,  chaired by the distinguished former public servant, Mr. Padraic White, on the extension of coastal zones, the use of flags of convenience and so on? Will he indicate whether the recommendations on conservation and the protection of the boxes made by fishermen over the past four or five years will be acted on?

For example, since 1996 the allocation to forestry has increased by 251% while the increase for telecommunications over the past three years has increased by 7,500%, from €400,000 in 2000 to €36 million this year. Funding for the Marine Research Institute has increased by 250% over the past five years while the allocation to BIM has increased from €10 million to €25 million.I agree with Deputy Broughan's comments on the strategy review group chaired by Padraic White, who I will meet later today. The group's report is concise and clear. It has been used by my officials and has been raised with Commission officials on any occasion we have met to consider this issue.Commissioner Fischler referred to pain and hardship that may be suffered in the future. This will apply to all fishermen across Europe, not only in Ireland. Fishermen in this and other countries have taken a very positive approach to the issue of conservation and they are aware of the implications of dwindling stocks. That is why we strongly argued that it is not possible on the one hand to have open season on the Irish Box while on the other hand being opposed to overfishing. The Commission has acknowledged this.This issue was brought to a head because Spain requested a legal services opinion. We disagree with it and have put forward a counter argument. That will be discussed next week at the Council of Fisheries Ministers and again next month.

Ireland is part of a group of states which are of like mind in their approach to a number of issues, especially the proposed reduction in fleet numbers. Spain, Portugal and France are our main allies in that regard. However, we cannot agree on every issue. For example, on the question of the Irish Box we vehemently disagree with the Spanish. The Portuguese are allied with us and it should also be noted that the EU Commission insists that the effect of laws should not be discriminatory. The agreement made in the middle 1990s to deal with the consequences of the accession of Spain and Portugal and their dealings on the CFP is political rather than legal in content. It has no time limit and as far as we were  concerned this was until very recently understood by the Commission.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	84	Politicians cannot decide what or who is legally correct. In view of this, will the Minister indicate how he proposes to get legal clarity before the negotiations begin? Otherwise, the restrictions within the Irish Box will be used as a bargaining tool. It could mean that we will have to make concessions in our negotiations with other countries to secure what we want on the question of the box. Will the Minister indicate whether, before the political wrangling begins, it is his intention to get definitive legal clarification on the Spanish objective to use the Irish Box?Will he also indicate what kind of signal he considers is being sent to fishermen by the proposed cuts in funding, including a 12% reduction in the funding to BMI, a 31% cut in grant aid to fish processing and a cut of 3% in funding for the development of fisheries harbours? Will he also indicate whether he obtained assurances from Commissioner Fischler on the question of the Hague preferences, whereby Ireland and the United Kingdom can be allocated extra quota when TACs are not fully met in Europe as a whole?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Commissioner Fischler was positive on the question of the Hague preferences. He wants them codified as part of European Union legislation. The issue to be addressed is what is understood by the preferences. Time is running short and there is a desire by all the member states to have the question of the Common Fisheries Policy finalised before the end of December. That is probably optimistic. It is not the case that the Irish Box will be given up as a quid pro quo in any negotiations. The Commission has always taken the view that the question of general access to waters around the European Union will be considered within the context of a review in 2003 and 2004, not under the current review.On the question of the Estimates, I remind the Deputy that in 1997, when his party was last in Government—
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	86	That does not address the position today.

This year we will allocate €30 million, similar to the sum allocated in each of the past two years. Since we took up office in 1997 there has been a cumulative increase of 758% in the funding allocated to this area. I rest my case.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	89	There is a reduction in the allocation for the coming year.

Critical negotiations involving the Presidency and the Commission are planned for the Council on 27 and 28 November. The priorities for the Irish industry in the Commission's proposals and the strategy for pursuing them have been worked out in close association with the Irish national strategy review group on the CFP under the chairmanship of Padraic White. Industry representatives have also been involved.I am involved in an intensive programme of meetings with fellow Ministers at European level to create alliances on key priorities with France, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Spain and the UK. Over the past two weeks I held detailed discussions with the Portuguese Fisheries Minister and the Danish Minister for Fisheries who currently holds the Presidency of the Council for Agriculture and Fisheries. The meeting with the Portuguese Minister focused on shared concerns about possible changes to the regulations governing the Irish Box and western waters. The discussions with the Danish Minister focused on identifying priorities and ensuring that the Presidency understands the basis for the changes we are seeking to the Commission's proposals in any compromise.I held a bilateral meeting involving the Irish fishing industry last week with Commissioner Fischler, the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Fisheries, with whom I took the opportunity to hold a private meeting to impress on him the critical importance of delivering change in the reform package to address the disproportionate impact the package will have on the Irish fishing industry. I will be working in close association with industry representatives to advance Ireland's position in the negotiations and I have arranged further meetings with ministerial colleagues in Europe. I will keep in close contact with the Presidency and the Commissioner in the coming weeks.I am committed to finding compromises that achieve the sustainability necessary for the long-term future of the industry in the most effective and equitable manner without creating unnecessary hardship in our coastal communities.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I find the mention of the word "compromise" by the Minister disturbing because the fishing industry is well aware of the compromises that have been made since 1972. Does the Minister agree that the current threat to the fishing industry here is another consequence of the consistent failure of successive Governments to safeguard the national interest? Does he further agree that the estimated €120 billion worth of fish taken from Irish waters since accession to the EU more than compensates for the €30 billion we have received? Does the Minister accept that Ireland is a net donor to the EU as a result of the taking of natural resources, such as our fishing stocks, by other European countries? Will the Minister assure the House that the Government will refuse to accept any opening of the Irish Box conservation area and support the fishermen's organisations which have unanimously rejected the Commissioner's proposed cuts on TAC and the methodology by which those proposals were reached? Will the Minister challenge a methodology which forces Irish fishermen to give up the industry and assure the House that he will not allow that to happen?I attended a meeting last week which was addressed by the Commissioner who told us that his legal advice indicated that Spanish access to the Irish Box was guaranteed. He also said quite clearly that this was the result of its accession to the EU. The supposed scientific advice available regarding cod, haddock and flatfish argues the necessity of a reduction in fishing, particularly of cod, but the evidence and advice from fishermen is that there has been a modest revival of cod stocks over the past two years. Does the Minister accept what the fishermen's association and those involved in the industry say? Today I heard proposals for an 80% reduction in fishing for cod, a 40% cut for flat fish and a 60% cut for haddock. Does the Minister accept that this will be detrimental to the survival of the fishing industry and, if so, what does he propose to do to defend it?

I have been working very closely with the industry and it knows full well my views and those of my officials on the preservation of the Irish Box. We will be using every method available to fight for that, but we are one member of a 15 member Union and there are countries with a larger number of votes than we have at the Council table. I could walk out, but I will not because it is better to be in there fighting for a good compromise to guarantee the fishing industry moves forward. In regard to the comments last week of Commissioner Fischler, the industry accepted that the implementation of EU law cannot be discriminatory. If there is pain to be taken, it must be taken proportionately by other countries, not just by Ireland.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 94 together.A consortium that includes the organisation referred to by the Deputy is assessing the feasibility of developing an offshore wind farm in the Tunes Plateau area off the mouth of Lough Foyle. In a report entitled Assessment of Offshore Wind Energy Resources in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the area was identified as having suitable wind strength for wind farm development. The report was commissioned by the Northern Ireland Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment and the then Department of Public Enterprise, with support from the European Commission under the INTERREG II programme.Some months ago, my Department became aware that the consortium was carrying out a feasibility assessment and has examined the matter in consultation with relevant Departments and offices. On the basis of this examination, it has been concluded that part of the area in respect of which the assessment is being carried out is within the jurisdiction of this State. The organisation referred to by the Deputy has been advised accordingly and informed that the appropriate authorisations under the Foreshore Acts will be required in respect of any development related to a wind farm proposed in this jurisdiction. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland and the Crown Estates Commission have also been advised of the position.The consortium is currently preparing an environmental impact statement in connection with proposed applications for consent for the wind farm development. The EIS will address a wide range of issues, including the possible implications of the development for fisheries and the coastline. In the event that the consortium advances its proposals on the basis that part of the proposed development will be located within this jurisdiction, the EIS will have to accompany any application for authorisation under the Foreshore Acts. If the proposal is progressed by the consortium on the basis that no part of the wind farm will be located within this jurisdiction, the Northern Ireland authorities will nevertheless have to consult this State in relation to the environmental implications of the proposed development. In either event, I assure the Deputy that full and careful consideration will be given to all environmental issues relating to the proposed development.

I hope to have some impact in this area, and in Carrick-on-Shannon last Thursday I made a substantial policy statement on the issue. I issued a press release in the past two days outlining details in that respect.Regarding the mission statement, my officials are currently in consultation with me on putting together a strategy statement which it is hoped will be finalised towards the end of this year. Much emphasis will be laid on sustainable energy.

In fact, the details were released on Wednesday, 6 November, less than two weeks ago, and indications are that the companies in the industry are still studying the details and considering them in the context of their business plans. The main details are that the area under the initiative is being made available for licensing in four distinct tranches and that the schedule for closing dates for applications is as follows:Tranche115 March 20032 (and 1)15 October 20033 (and 1 and 2)15 March 20044 (and 1, 2 and 3)15 October 2004The Deputy will understand that it is too early to know what the response will be in terms of full applications for exploration.

Do the Ministers believe there are any lessons to be learned from that experience in that smaller energy companies like Ramco, which operate in Scotland and elsewhere, might be the ones we should encourage to come here? Will the Minister of State agree, however, that the general point made by my colleague earlier, that the situation in relation to exploration licences—

It means that the old Kinsale gas field will continue to be viable for the next ten years, which is very welcome. I congratulate the Minister on his involvement in that process.On the question raised by Deputies Ferris and Broughan, is the Minister satisfied that the balance is right between ensuring we have a suitable environment to attract drilling companies into our waters to drill for oil and gas and ensuring that when it is found, we will get a sufficiently good deal for the State in terms of royalties and tax returns from those finds?

There is always a question about balance but from dealing with companies such as Ramco, unions, etc., we  believe the balance is reasonably correct but there is always room for review.On the question of the tax returns, there will be significant tax returns from the Ramco development. The fact that it had a market for the gas and was able to sell it on is a positive development when one considers that the energy import dependence ratio now stands at over 80%, which is 30% higher than any other country in the European Union. We have to examine the possibility of exploration and encouraging companies like Ramco to come here while also taking into account the points raised by Deputies Ferris and Broughan. The balance in relation to work, goods and service and all of that area will continue to be taken on board by the Government.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	121	As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 114 on 9 October last, I expect to receive the main report of the Sea-Fishing Boat Licensing Policy Review Group early next year. A key factor concerning its deliberations and the timing of its report will be the outcome of the re-negotiation of the EU Common Fisheries Policy now under way.The review group can decide to report earlier on separate issues on which it may consider that urgent decisions are required of me. One such issue is in relation to the current requirement for certain polyvalent fishing vessels to have fished for herring and-or mackerel for 16 weeks in the previous four years in order to be considered to have "active pelagic" capacity. I have agreed to an urgent interim recommendation from the review group that a moratorium on active pelagic track record be put in place in respect of 2002. This measure stems from the need to take account of particular circumstances which have arisen in 2002 in relation to the Celtic Sea herring fishery, mainly regarding stock conservation, but it has general application to all pelagic fisheries for polyvalent boats. The moratorium means that polyvalent boats which did not fish for herring and-or mackerel in 2002 will not be considered as having had a break in their active pelagic track record.For replacement capacity purposes, polyvalent boat owners may have 2002 excluded from the determination of active pelagic history, that is 16 weeks in each of the last four years, for their boats. For example, boats must have had an active pelagic history in the four preceding years, 1998 to 2001, in order to be considered to be active pelagic capacity for replacement capacity purposes in 2003.The review group proposes to comprehensively examine the active pelagic policy requirement,  along with all other pelagic related issues, and revert to me with their considered recommendations in due course.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	124	The digital hub, which is the Government's flagship project in the digital content sector, aims to cluster Irish and international new media companies, research and development and educational-community initiatives in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin.The digital content industry has been identified by our development agencies as a high growth, value added industry where we already have significant strengths. Since the beginning of this year, considerable progress has been made in advancing the project. The Digital Hub Development Agency Bill, which provides for the placing of Digital Media Development Limited on a statutory footing, was published in January 2002. The Bill completed Second Stage in the Seanad on 17 October last and is currently at Committee Stage in the Seanad. It is hoped to have the legislation enacted by the end of the year.Property purchase amounting to €75 million has been completed. The property which is currently vested in the Commissioners of Public Works will be transferred to the new agency on enactment of the legislation and the refurbishment of property purchased for the project will be undertaken by using a public private partnership model. Digital Media Development Limited commenced this process last June and recently announced that four consortia have been short-listed to go to the next stage of the PPP process.It is envisaged that when completed, the project will deliver 500,000 square feet of enterprise, learning and educational, residential and retail space. In order to accelerate the provision of enterprise space, preliminary work is under way on the refurbishment of a 1930s landmark build ing, the Printworks, as a high-tech, broadband enabled facility catering for established and high potential start-up companies in the digital media sector in a joint venture between DMDL, Enterprise Ireland and Dublin City Council. Construction of a three kilometre high speed, fibre broadband network in the hub at a cost of €2.29 million was completed in September 2002 and a network operations centre is scheduled to be in place by the first quarter of next year.The former executive chairperson of the company, Mr. Paddy Teahon, resigned last September and was replaced as chairperson of the board by Mr. William Burgess, former chairman and managing director of IBM Ireland. The board has recently appointed Mr. Philip Flynn as chief executive of the company who is to take up his position in December.Additional information.Extensive consultation has taken place from the earliest stages of the project with the local community to ensure that the locality benefits from the project.The Liberties learning initiative, an education-community based programme being run in conjunction with the development of the digital hub, is now under way. Through this, DMDL is working with local schools, training providers and the National Council for Technology in Education to promote ICT skills in the local community. In addition, a "learning space", which will provide a focal point for education and training, will be available shortly in space currently being refurbished along Thomas Street.

An official has been given the exclusive duty of organising consultation with the residents' associations, community groups and public representatives. There have been 150 meetings and contact has been established with 140 community groups. A questionnaire was distributed in early 2001 to 10,000 postal addresses in the area.The housing element will be part of the proposals made by the four consortia which have been short-listed. The issue of social and affordable housing will obviously be taken into account and it will be necessary to comply with existing planning criteria in that respect.

In answer to Deputy Upton's question, the Department of Education and Science has been involved in the discussions and negotiations relating to the setting up of the digital hub. A former Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science is on the board. Substantial funding has been allocated not only to the educational content of the digital hub but also to MediaLab Europe which is already up and running. The idea is to have a cluster and network so that new companies with new ideas can develop in consultation with other companies within the sector. MediaLab Europe is working well and it is envisaged that the same principles will apply to the digital hub.

Higgins – the urgent need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to apologise on behalf of the State to Carolyn Swift for the disgraceful action of the police against the Pike Theatre on the occasion of its production of "The Rose Tattoo" in May  1957, to acknowledge the impact this action had on the members of this small and courageous theatre and to ask if he will, as a gesture of goodwill, make such reparation as is appropriate to the surviving member of the company, the lives of whose members were irrevocably damaged by the actions taken in the name of the State; (3) Deputy Gregory – the need for flood alleviation measures to be put in place at high risk locations along the River Tolka particularly at Botanic Avenue and Ballybough in Dublin city, the need for funding from central government for this emergency work, to prevent the recurrence of recent flooding causing damage to hundreds of homes; along with appropriate compensation for the many victims of last week's flooding; (4) Deputy Hogan – the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to accept responsibility for the alarming deterioration in the competitiveness of the Irish economy as outlined in the recent report of the World Economic Forum; (5) Deputy O'Dowd – to ask that the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources contributes to the cost of the Ballymakenny Cross route in Drogheda, County Louth; (6) Deputy Allen – to raise the situation whereby old age pensioners are being told by health boards that they have to wait years to have essential repairs carried out to their homes because the Department of Health and Children has not allocated sufficient funds to meet the requirements of the elderly; (7) Deputy Deenihan – the urgent need to find a resolution to the strike by psychiatric nurses at Tralee General Hospital, County Kerry; (8) Deputy Gilmore – the delay by the Department of Education and Science in progressing the building project for St. Anne's national school, Shankill, County Dublin.The matters raised by Deputies Gilmore, Deenihan, Michael D.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	135	The Taoiseach and the Government gave specific commitments to the Irish people some months ago. A number of documents have been published relevant to the conduct of the affairs of the nation – the Fianna Fáil manifesto, the health strategy and the national development programme. Commitments given by the Taoiseach have not been honoured at home and international commitments in terms of Ireland's overseas aid have not been honoured. What the Taoiseach and individual Ministers say on behalf of Government are completely irrelevant, they do not mean anything.In the context of commitments given, 200,000 people who had expected to be given medical cards are now severely disappointed; 25,000 people on waiting lists had expected those lists to be eliminated; and thousands of young people have had their dream and aspiration of house ownership shattered because of the withdrawal and abolition of the first-time house buyer's  grant. Does the Taoiseach accept that he is undermining the democratic system and debasing politics by making statements, giving commitments and making promises that are clearly nothing but a web of deception? The people have been deceived to a point where Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are back in Government, the financial situation and management of the country is in a complete shambles and people are frustrated, disappointed and angry at what has happened and by statements coming from the Taoiseach and his Ministers. Even at this late stage, will the Taoiseach reverse what has been his latest cynical and cruel announcement in the Book of Estimates last Thursday, to do down many of the commitments he gave in the past six months?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The circumstances and the setting for the publication of the Book of Estimates last week were entirely different to recent years. We have watched the decline in economic activity and growth through last year and into this year. I have put those figures and statistics before the House on many occasions and I am sure there is no need to repeat them. World economic growth has slowed markedly this year and the outlook for next year is not very different. The latest consensus forecast for this year from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank is moving towards 2% of GNP.The first priority of the Government in dealing with the Book of Estimates was to get back to a sustainable rate of spending. This does not mean a reduction in absolute levels of spending, nor does it mean low levels of spending. Spending has risen by 40% in the past two years, so we are working from a high base. The Book of Estimates this year is low and it has to be because our revenue base has decreased – it is down to 3% whereas we predicted 8.5%. Over recent years revenue has exceeded expectations.We cannot spend what is not there. If I was doing that the Deputy, rightly, would criticise me strongly, no matter how desirable the objective of the spending. We can all agree on certain priorities, and the Government has set out its priorities. We are continuing to put in resources. Spending next year will be over €31 billion, compared to €17 billion five years ago. We are putting this money into health, social and family affairs and education. Health spending is up 7% on a year-on-year basis, up €520 million on 2002 and up €4.9 billion, or 141%, on five years ago. Spending on social and family affairs is up nearly €300 million, or 3%, on 2002 and up €4 billion, or 70%, on 1997. Spending on education is up nearly €300 million, or 6%, on 2002, and €2.1 billion, or 71%, on five years ago. It is on a very high base.Of course it would be very nice if increases in income matched some of these spending increases, then we would have no difficulty. The Government would be able to give large increases, although we have been criticised strongly by Deputy Kenny and everybody else for  high increases in spending this year as we try to get back to the 14% level.Deputy Kenny mentioned a number of areas and I will respond to the one directly related to a comment I made about overseas development aid, ODA. The allocation in the Abridged Estimates volume for the Ireland Aid programme next year is €373 million. It represents an increase of €33 million, almost 10% over the final allocation for 2002, so it is a very high increase in a difficult area. This demonstrates our commitment to the aid programme even in very difficult financial circumstances, and I know that is acknowledged by many of the groups involved in this area.

Does the Taoiseach not agree that the number of houses going to first-time buyers is down 20% on what it used to be? Does he not accept that democracy is based on trust and that where a Government abuses the trust of its people by not honouring its commitments, it debases the entire democratic system? Arising from the publication of the Book of Estimates last week, is it not now a fact that the three documents before me – the national development plan, the health strategy and Fianna Fáil's A Lot Done, More to Do – are now in shreds and are as completely and utterly irrelevant as the comments being made by the Government?

In respect of the Book of Estimates, which of the cuts embarrass the Taoiseach most? Is it the refusal to raise the  eligibility for medical cards and keep his promise to give 200,000 additional people a medical card, his failure to agree the refurbishment programme for dilapidated and run down primary schools, the scrapping of 5,000 jobs on the community employment scheme, the abolition of 41% support for FÁS and a similar cut in the IDA Ireland budget, the postponement of Luas for 12 months, the fact that he has not provided one single cent for the 2,000 additional gardaí as promised in the programme for Government, the 1,000 jobs that are being lost in rural Ireland because of the cuts enforced on the forestry programme, the 63% cut in spending on race relations or the further cuts in the ODA programme which make the target of 0.7% by 2007 as committed by the Government simply unattainable? Is the Taoiseach embarrassed because his backbenchers are in revolt or is it because he has cut the first-time buyers' grant, shattering the dreams of thousands of young people all over the country who are trying to get a home of their own? Which of these cuts embarrass the Taoiseach most?

We have been able to give them large increases of 70%. In education we are spending €5.6 billion.It is a difficult year, we know that, and we have to try to make the necessary prudent policies so that we can work ourselves through it and be able to maintain economic growth and stability and, in the meantime, help those who need it most.

What about the 5,000 people that the Tánaiste has thrown out of work and abandoned in the most vulnerable and exposed communities in the country? Then there is the people on very modest incomes who will not get a medical card.Does the Taoiseach accept this is the exact opposite of what he promised during the recent general election? Does he accept that he and his Government lied to the people at the time of the general election, or is he saying that he is lying to them now, or that he does not know the difference?

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	167	Does the Taoiseach stand over his claim that he does not favour opening up the Irish box to more Spanish and other non-Irish EU trawlers? He does not appear to understand that an oil spill, such as the one off the coast of Portugal as a result of which 21 million tonnes of oil is likely to spill and affect our coast as well as many other European coasts, would do far more damage to this country than any amount of trawlers in the Irish box.Apart from the Estimates meltdown, which provides that coastal protection will be down 72% and even humanitarian flood relief will be decreased from €8.5 million to a mere €59,000, does the Taoiseach recognise that in a typical year there are 20 marine accidents in Irish waters? A report in the Department of the Communications, Marine and Natural Resources states that we urgently need to buy an emergency towing vessel to cope with the likelihood of such an oil spill. We need a GPS type marine safety information system and the designation of coasts off the west and the North as high risk areas from which such vessels should be kept. Is the Taoiseach prepared to give attention to our maritime environment in the light of this timely warning from the Prestige tanker which has foundered and is discharging oil? When will he respond to and act on the recommendations of the Irish emergency towing vessels study which is now more urgent than ever given the probability of damage to our shores even from an oil spill from as far away as Portugal? 
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	168	As I said earlier during Question Time, we oppose the opening up of the Irish box because these waters are sensitive. They play an important part in nurturing stock levels in a wide area far beyond this country. Our fishing industry is critically dependent on the stocks in the Irish box and it has a key interest in their  sustainability. If there was to be open access to the Irish box, that would run counter to the desire of the Commission to conserve fish stocks. Those are the reasons we oppose the opening up of the Irish box and we will continue to do so. The Deputy is aware that since Spain's accession to the EU in 1986 a key issue for Ireland has been how to protect our fishery zone in the context of the Spanish fishing fleet. It is the largest in the European Union. We have argued our position at the meeting I mentioned earlier and we will do so at the meeting on the Common Fisheries Policy next week.With regard to the tanker accident off the coast of Spain, the EU Commission is co-ordinating and providing information on the accident. The latest news is that the tanker was hauled off the north coast of Spain. It is still unclear what caused the accident. The tanker did not hit rocks. The oil spill is estimated to be 5,000 tonnes which has affected about 20 miles of coastline. The tanker is currently being towed to deeper waters and efforts are being made to remove oil about hundred miles off the coast of Spain in 3,000 to 4,000 metres of water. Spain has called for international assistance and a number of European countries with specialised oil recovery vessels are providing such assistance. The coastguard here is monitoring the position. The tanker broke up this morning and sank. Reports suggest that little oil has been taken off it and the prevailing winds suggest that the oil will pollute Spanish and Portuguese coastlines. We cannot be sure what will happen and I appreciate there are concerns. Regrettably, the oil spill is a major problem for those two countries, but I hope it will not be a major problem for us. The oil in question is heavy oil. It floats below the surface, which is making it more difficult for the authorities monitoring and reporting the oil spill to clarify the position.The other questions Deputy Sargent asked could be dealt with by way of parliamentary questions. I am aware of the difficulties and problems he raised about navigational issues. If he tables parliamentary questions on them to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern will answer them.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I asked the Taoiseach these questions because we now have visual proof of his interest in the marine from photographs taken in Drumcondra. I wanted to press the issue with him because given his interest in flooding it seems strange that according to the Estimates there will be a cut in humanitarian flood relief from €8.5 million to €59,000. Is he convinced that there will not be any further flooding? Has he managed to grapple with and conquer the problem of climate change and global warming? Is he able to say to our fishermen that there will not be any need for the 1999 report commissioned by the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources which states that we urgently need an emergency towing vessel? This need is too urgent to be deferred until  the next time questions are tabled to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; it must be acted upon.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	170	The tentative figure put in under this heading has been the same for the past five years.

Every year when a crisis has arisen such as the regrettable incidents of flooding in Meath, Dublin, north Kildare and in some other parts of the country over the weekend, it must be dealt with. The scheme that was operated by the Red Cross under the Office of Public Works on the last occasion there was flooding will also operate on this occasion. I think this matter is the subject of a request under Standing Order 31, but if it is not, it will be dealt with in precisely the same way as the flooding that occurred in Gort, Clonmel and other locations.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	172	The resources that are necessary to provide for such relief are on the basis of humanitarian need and cannot be budgeted for. Such relief is not budgeted for, otherwise resources would lie there unused as happened some years ago. Regrettably such relief has been called for on two occasions this year – the flooding that occurred on 1 February and the flooding last weekend.

We cannot agree to the Order of Business on that basis. This is an important motion. Policing is central to the peace process and to the Good Friday Agreement and is of direct concern to everyone on this island. The House referred this motion to committee only a fortnight ago. It went to the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights at which there was a limited discussion. There was no opportunity to tease out the detail of the motion. Now it is back here and this House is being asked to adopt the motion without debate.I would like to make it clear that we would welcome and support the proposals contained in this motion but they are premature in our view because we do not yet have a policing service in the North of Ireland acceptable to all sections of the community and that is in evidence almost on a nightly basis with the ongoing horror and nightmare with which the people of Short Strand and other areas must contend. I ask that we do not proceed without debate on this important matter and that we afford the opportunity to the House to discuss the detail of the motion and the issues arising therein and therefrom. I request that that be agreed to, otherwise I will have no option but to oppose the Order of Business.

Every Deputy should have an opportunity to have his or her say on the Estimates, even those on the Government benches who are publicly castigating the Taoiseach and every Minister on local radio stations. They oppose the Government's Estimates when they are down the country but they want to side with their Ministers in here.

We will have less than one hour for discussion on this subject today and a little more than four hours tomorrow. That, Sir, is entirely inadequate and I ask the Taoiseach to permit the House to give the book of evidence, given the impact it will have on the quality of life of so many people—

Let some of our colleagues on the Government backbenches pass through the lobbies and vote with the Opposition before some of these cuts are put through.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	205	The Green Party supports the Fine Gael amendment and I ask the Taoiseach to agree to its acceptance. The Book of Estimates does not involve only a tinkering with figures but a radical adjustment of the Government's fiscal priorities and Members should have the opportunity to discuss every proposal relating to the downgrading of spending priorities in each Department. I ask the Taoiseach to accede to Deputy Kenny's request.

It is important to recognise that the discomfort on the Government benches in not only confined to the withdrawal of the first time buyer's grant but also to the Government reneging on its pre-election commitment to extend the medical card scheme to more than 200,000 extra people. This bites at those who are least well-off in our society. I ask  the Taoiseach to accommodate the extension to allow Members the opportunity to freely exercise their vote and judgment on the amendments that have been presented, including one from my colleagues.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	207	It is several years since we had a debate on the Book of Estimates and I am glad there is interest in the Government's proposal to do so. Because of the Private Notice Question, the Government Chief Whip removed the Private Security Services Bill, 2001, which was scheduled to be taken between 8.30 p.m. and 10.30 p.m., from the Order of Business. There will, therefore, be more time available than we thought originally. Members will have an opportunity on reflect on what is in the gross voted expenditure.There has been an 84% increase in spending, before budget day additions, since 1997. The Department of Health and Children Vote has increased by €3.6 billion to €8.9 billion while the allocation to the Department of Social and Family Affairs has increased from €5.7 billion to €9.7 billion and that to the Department of Education and Science from €3.2 billion to €5.6 billion.

In view of that, why is the Department of the Environment and Local Government refusing to accept applications for that grant from first-time buyers?

Apparently, there are many Members on the Government side of the House who wish to reject these regulations. Why is it, therefore, that applications for the first-time buyer's grant are being refused when the House has not yet decided upon the issue and has 21 sitting days within which to do so?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	257	Members of the public have until 4 December to apply, provided that such applications are covered by the regulations set out by the Minister last Thursday.

The House has 21 sitting days to decide this issue. The Taoiseach should clarify this today as there are many people who are trying to buy homes and they do not know where they stand on this. Will the Taoiseach clarify today whether an applicant for the first-time buyer's grant can continue to make that application and have that appli cation processed until 21 sitting days have elapsed and the House has decided on this issue?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	259	That is correct. If the contract is signed they can apply. Where a contract to purchase or a contract to build is entered into on or before 14 November or, in the case of a self-built house, where the foundations are poured on or before 14 November, the people involved have until 14 December, otherwise they cannot apply.

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I propose to answer all five questions together.I wish to express sympathy on my own behalf, and that of the Government, to everyone affected by the flooding in recent days. It has been a traumatic time for people whose homes have been flooded.Flooding has occurred in many parts of the country. The cause was exceptionally heavy rainfall during a two day period on 9 and 10 November which led to flooding of homes in Athlone, and again on 14 and 15 November which primarily affected the east of the country, particularly Dublin city, Meath and Kildare. On its own this concentrated heavy rainfall would not have been expected to have such disastrous consequences. However, when combined with two and a half times average rainfall in the month of October and the first two weeks in November it led to the disastrous consequences we have witnessed.The immediate concern in this situation is, of course, to respond quickly to those who are affected by the flooding. Emergency plans were put into action by several local authorities. I commend the local authority staff, the Civil Defence, the Army, the Garda, the fire brigade, health authority staff and my own staff in the Office of Public Works who were on the spot straight away helping people whose homes were flooded and some whose travel arrangements were disrupted. The commitment of public service and voluntary staff in this type of situation is exceptional and deserves recognition.As soon as the seriousness of the situation and the numbers of homes affected by the flooding became apparent, I asked my officials in the Office of Public Works to begin preparations for initiating a humanitarian aid scheme. The House will be aware that the Government has approved such schemes in similar situations in the past, most recently following the devastating flooding in Dublin city in February of this year. At its meeting today the Government approved my proposal to initiate a similar scheme in this case.The scheme will be administered by the Red Cross on behalf of the Office of Public Works. Application forms for the scheme are available from the Red Cross at a freephone number, 1800 923 424 and at www.redcross.ie. The eligibility criteria are extreme hardship, homelessness, damage to homes and serious injury. The scheme does not provide for compensation for losses. It pro vides for assistance where extreme hardship has been suffered. The closing date for receipt of applications by the Red Cross is 6 December. Following this, the Red Cross will commence the process of evaluating applications and visiting all applicants to assess need. Payments will commence a number of weeks later.The scheme will be funded from within existing financial allocations to the Office of Public Works. The extent of funding required will become apparent in the next few days as applications are received and more information is collated on the extent of damage caused. Recent comments in the media suggest that approval of funding for this scheme somehow represents a reversal of Government decisions on the Estimates. This is not the case. These schemes are, of their nature, entirely unpredictable and it is not the practice to provide for them in advance in the Estimates.The flooding in Dublin city and Meath arose from the River Tolka and its tributaries. The Tolka has a history of carrying significant run-off flows within its watercourse and has flooded frequently, most recently in November 2000. The catchment area of the river falls within the functional area of three local authorities – Meath and Fingal County Councils and Dublin City Council. As the lower and middle catchments of the river, in particular, and certain concentrated areas within the upper catchment have witnessed significant increases in land development, the risk of flood damage to property and infrastructure has also increased. There has never been a fully inclusive analysis of the river's behaviour under a full range of potential floods and certainly there has been no investigation of the catchment's response to severe rainfall as it is currently developed and as planned to be developed.In June 2001, Dublin City Council commissioned the greater Dublin strategic drainage study – GDSDS – which is a multi-million euro engineering study of the strategic drainage requirements of the greater Dublin area. Given the history of flooding in the Tolka, on the initiative of the Office of Public Works the city council agreed to include a study of the Tolka in the GDSDS. The flooding element of the study is funded by the Office of Public Works at a cost of €870,000. The study is expected to be completed in May 2003. Surveying is now completed and the consultants are commencing work on the hydraulic model of the catchment. Meath and Fingal County Councils are also participating in the study.The aim of the study is that a comprehensive report will be produced that will include the development of a robust model representing the hydrological and hydraulic characteristics of the River Tolka catchment. Such a model will have the ability to map flood risk. Using model output, the technical and economic merit of various options for flood management, taking account of current and future land developments, will be presented within the report.My officials in the Office of Public Works have confirmed that the consultants carrying out the study are not in a position to indicate at this stage what the findings of the study will be or what flood alleviation measures can be recommended. Neither is it possible to undertake interim works at specific locations. In the absence of the full report of the study any interim works could exacerbate flooding problems upstream or downstream. I have asked my officials in the Office of Public Works to ensure that the report is completed on time so that early consideration can be given to its findings.Notwithstanding this, the Office of Public Works will provide assistance to Dublin City Council in dealing with the immediate effects of the flooding and we have been in discussions with the city engineer about this. I am referring here to repairs to walls, culverts and river banks which have been damaged in the flooding. Indeed, Office of Public Works staff were mobilised yesterday at the request of the city engineer to deal with the collapse of the river bank at Tolka Road. They are still working there today. The city council is rightfully taking the lead in dealing with these immediate needs and I assure the House that the Office of Public Works is available to assist in whatever way we can.

#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	300	I pay tribute to the community spirit which sustained the people of the Ballybough, Clonliffe and Drumcondra areas of Dublin city during the recent floods.The Minister of State has referred to the flooding in Botanic Avenue in November 2000. Last week this flooding was repeated at the same location and at Tolka Road, Distillery Road and Clonliffe Road in the Ballybough area. There are obvious works which need to be done at those locations. Bridges need to be either raised or replaced by ones which will not block rising flood waters. Large areas of embankment wall need to be replaced and significant dredging needs to be carried out.Does the Minister of State agree that this work needs to be put in place as an interim action plan rather than waiting for a flood alleviation study which was first promised for the end of this year and then for April of next year? The Minister of State now tells us the study will not be ready until later next year. Will he make the money and staff available to do the necessary work at the blackspots which have histories of flooding? It is clear that the climate is changing and we have seen recurring episodes of heavy rainfall. People who have gone through the trauma of the recent flood – some for the second time in two years – fear that unless these measures are taken at blackspot locations they could be facing a third experience of similar flooding during the course of this win ter. I pay tribute, as the Minister of State has done, to Dublin City Council, the fire service, the Army and the other services for their response. However, this response took place when it was already too late and when hundreds of people's homes were devastated.Will the Minister of State ensure that whatever interim measures are required at black spot locations, which are in a very limited area of Dublin city, be carried out? There would be no potential impact on other areas, but the measures are desperately needed at those locations to prevent further recurrence of the flooding that has caused such disruption, upset and devastation for many hundreds of families.

The report from the consultants would not in any way recommend interim measures in respect of any of the black spots to which the Deputy referred. The indication might even be minor when he talks of raising or replacing bridges or building walls and there is—
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	302	These are low-level pedestrian bridges that clearly contributed to the flood.

The fallout from allowing the floods to go down faster or slower or building a wall anywhere can have devastating effects in exceptional circumstances. I need to stress again to the House that the circumstances were exceptional – there was exceptional rainfall for a month and a half and then we had an extreme case in which the rainfall of a month and a half fell in 36 hours. I hope the chances of those circumstances being repeated are slim, but in such circumstances the consequences of dealing with the black spot areas could be even more severe.All the damage that has been done will be repaired and the Office of Public Works, in conjunction with Dublin City Council, is working on it at the moment. Until the black spots are identified by the consultants, I am not keen to recommend that we move on them.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	305	That is condemning people to a repeat of what has happened already.

I too pay tribute to the people who suffered, the hundreds that have been evacuated from their homes. Their homes have been  destroyed and all the family heirlooms and items in the ground floors are gone. Homes never come right after a flooding of this nature. People are now looking for reassurance that sufficient funding will be put in place so they will not be too much out of pocket and so they will not suffer from spiralling insurance costs or a refusal of insurance in the future. They also want to be reassured that this will not happen again.I found the statement of the Minister of State that there will be no interim measures introduced totally unacceptable. Does he not agree that the Office of Public Works and his Department are responsible, through Dúchas, for the rivers within the city of Dublin and that, although they have dredged part of the Tolka stretching down towards the sea, they have not dredged the rest of it where the flooding has taken place? Will the Minister of State not begin immediately the dredging of the Tolka? There are trees, sand banks and mud banks in the Tolka which have been there for ages.We had a serious enough flood two years ago in exactly this month, almost to the day. Therefore, given the present climate, it is to be expected that we will have another flood within a year or two. Meteorologists say in today's papers that the one predictable thing is the weather and when flooding will take place. Therefore, it is not an act of God and humans can intervene. The Minister of State is telling us that, despite the fact that people's homes have been flooded to this degree, his Department will not intervene. Can he not assure us and the people who have suffered that the Tolka will be dredged and that the weirs, dams and bridges, some of which are low-lying and makeshift and lower than they were originally conceived to be, will be dealt with immediately, and that the walls along the Tolka will be rebuilt and raised higher where there is a potential danger of flooding?We want answers to these questions. We are waiting for a promised report which was initiated two years ago when the flooding took place and which is now due in another year. We do not know when it will be published, and it will cost millions of euro to carry out its recommendations. In the meantime, tens of millions of euro could be lost and there could be further human suffering. Could we have some reassurance from the Minister of State that some action will be taken?

Because of the history of flooding along the Tolka, we funded and instigated the  study that is being carried out. The indications from the Office of Public Works at this stage are that interim measures, as suggested by Deputies Costello and Gregory, are not viable in terms of the overall—

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The river, which is very extensive, goes all the way from County Meath to Dublin Bay. There are difficulties at each stage of it. The overall cost of the scheme could run to over €100 million. We know from Office of Public Works experience that even before one puts a digger near a river, because of environmental impact and archaeological studies, it is guaranteed that there will be delays and other interest groups with something major to say. That is not to say that Dublin City Council, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, is not working on the river as we speak. If the black spots which Deputy Gregory says are so obvious are apparent, I am sure they will be dealt with.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18146	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The Minister of State in his reply spoke of compensation being available for damage to homes, but then said it does not apply to compensation for losses. Does that mean that people will not get any compensation for damage to their furniture, equipment or cars? Some streets resemble the Somme at the moment in terms of the damage that has been inflicted.What will be covered by the scheme? Will the Minister of State agree immediately to fund, at a cost of €1.5 million, the early warning scheme? Dublin City Council has an application lying with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in this regard and it would at least allow a proper early warning scheme to be put in place. This is the third occurrence of flooding within 12 months that has affected some part of Dublin. We need the early warning scheme and I ask for a clear commitment in that regard.Will the Minister of State say today that the Office of Public Works is taking responsibility for flood relief in Dublin city and that he will not expect Dublin City Council, which is not an expert in this field and does not cover the entire catchment of the river, to bear responsibility? Is the Minister of State accepting an Office of Public Works-sponsored flood relief scheme which will be properly funded?As other Deputies have asked, is the Minister of State agreeing to certain amounts of repair? Surely, the removal of silt that has been brought  down by this flood constitutes a form of repair. There should be a minimum level of dredging just to restore the situation to the position ex ante. That, at the very minimum, must be provided for by the Minister of State. Can we be clear that the Office of Public Works will not be found wanting financially in respect of the works that Dublin City Council identifies as necessary so those of us who, thanks to the dual mandate, are able to represent people in both chambers can be satisfied that action will be taken when problems are diagnosed?
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The last payout we had was in Dublin city, East Wall and Ringsend. A sum of €8.5 million was paid out through the Red Cross. There were 725 claims and the average payment was €10,377. Payment was made to households that suffered damage to cover the cost of replacing carpeting and furniture. The compensation did not cover businesses that had to close or employees who could not travel to work.The Red Cross has much experience in this area. I recently received from the chairman its report on the last incident and I understand there were scarcely any complaints. It is the intention to re-engage the Red Cross and I am sure that even in advance of the closing date for submission of application forms its officials will visit houses to see what needs to be done. The Government intends to do whatever is required.Dublin City Council is responsible for the maintenance of the River Tolka.

The Estimate for flood relief has doubled from €10 million to €20 million. We will seek to operate within those resources.This is the wettest year on record. While there is much talk of the impact of global warming and there has been an increase in the number of damaging incidents caused by the weather, this trend may not continue. When the report is completed it will be our responsibility to ensure that the necessary funding is available to implement the recommendations.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18146	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	323	The early warning question is not within the Minister of State's remit but perhaps he could arrange to forward a reply to me.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The Minister of State indicated that the average payment made to the victims of last year's floods was approximately €10,000. In most of the houses I visited the cost of the damage will amount to between €40,000 and €50,000. Many of them are without insurance cover. In view of this I hope the funding to the Red Cross will not be limited as it will take considerably more than €8 million to repair the damage done on this occasion.The consultant's report will not be ready until next May. However, the issues involved do not require the application of rocket science. Given his farming background, the Minister of State will appreciate that a JCB could solve many of the problems. It does not require consultants to be told that the rivers at risk require to be dredged, including the River Tolka and the river going through my local area. That work could be started immediately because similar flooding could occur at any time between now and next May.Many short-term measures can be taken. Will the Minister of State indicate if money will be provided to the local authorities which propose solutions? For example, my local authority, Meath County Council, proposed to bank an area in Clonee but that work was unable to proceed because of a lack of money. The council is already overdrawn by €6.5 million.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Many of the households affected by the recent flooding have insurance whereas the majority of houses affected by the flooding in the East Wall last year did not. The question of insurance will not disqualify households from receipt of Red Cross aid, although it will be taken into account.I wish it was a simple matter of using a couple of JCBs for remedial work. An extreme situation occurred last weekend. We must consider all recommendations for reducing the risk of further flooding and I will put the suggestions made by Deputies to the consultants. They have indicated that some proposed interim measures are not viable, but we will consider them further and see if at least some of them can be implemented.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I wish to express my solidarity with the residents who suffered the trauma of the floods and I also appreciate the great work done by the rescue workers. Does the Minister of State agree it is extraordinary that one episode of rainfall, albeit of unusual intensity, should bring the capital city to a standstill, with thousands of workers virtually trapped in their workplace, on public transport or in their cars as they took between three and seven hours to get home? Does he agree that it is indicative of a badly neglected infrastructure and the failure to accept that  it must be modified to cope with the reality of climate change?Does the Minister of State agree that it is grossly irresponsible for local authorities and developers to build thousands of homes on the flood plains of the River Tolka when it is clear that the surface water from such developments will create huge problems? Will he give a commitment to include in the strategic study the proposed developments of 2,300 units of accommodation at the Phoenix Park racecourse and approximately 4,000 units at Kelletstown on the flood plain of the River Tolka? Does he agree that there must be an urgent review of the plans for these developments to ensure the disaster suffered by householders last week will not be repeated?Will the Minister of State clarify the position regarding the Red Cross assisted humanitarian aid scheme? In one area flooding occurred to residents who had been in their new affordable homes for eight or ten weeks, homes they had to struggle to acquire. Unfortunately, as a result many did not have contents insurance and suffered heartbreak when the flooding ruined their new furniture, perhaps given to them as presents by their relatives. Will the Minister of State give an undertaking that the restoration of such furniture and equipment will be covered by the scheme and will be done expeditiously, before Christmas because of the extra hardship that will otherwise be involved?
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	328	Extreme weather this year has caused destruction not only in Ireland but across the Continent, from Germany, through eastern Europe and even on the Costa del Sol. It is difficult to legislate for what has happened, which has caught the authorities across Europe by surprise. That is not to say that we should not be watchful for the future.The substantial developments along the River Tolka valley will be considered in the strategic study. New developments will be looked at in light of that, but there may be a slightly larger question mark over their viability in terms of where they are situated. The Deputy spoke of the height of irresponsibility, but the height of common sense would be to act in light of the fallout we have seen. The Office of Public Works and the city council have measured the flood levels very carefully and they have reached a height that we have never seen before. What we have seen is extreme and that establishes a new basis and standard for future developments.In terms of clarity, the Red Cross scheme administered before was set up to deal with losses, but it does not provide total compensation. It provides for the loss of furniture and the cost of being out of one's home. People from the East Wall had to find accommodation in bed and breakfast establishments for substantial periods of time. I have the greatest confidence in the Red Cross, given its experience, to deal fairly with  these circumstances. I merely gave the example of the fallout in terms of the average losses, which is not to suggest there will be a limit above or below that this time. The matter will be entirely in the hands of the Red Cross who will deal with this independently. It will be up to the Office of Public Works to find, within the constraints of the current budget, the money to cover those losses.

There are very important matters to be discussed in the remaining time. These questions have now gone on for 34 minutes and I appeal to Members to be extremely brief to be fair to those who wish to contribute to the major debate which is to follow this business. We may be depriving Members of the opportunity to contribute by reason of lateness.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Is the Office of Public Works responsible for anti-flood measures regarding rivers? That is fairly straightforward. The Minister of State said that the city council was responsible for cleaning rivers. If the Office of Public Works is responsible for anti-flood measures, will it ensure that funding is made available to implement whatever measures its engineers and those of Dublin Corporation decide are necessary? It does not matter if that work is done by the Office of Public Works or the council, but it must be done now. Dredging the city section of the Tolka must be included in those works and it will not have any negative impact elsewhere. If anything, the effect will be positive everywhere. Will the Minister of State arrange a meeting between the consultants concerned, the city council and local representatives to deal with these issues with the urgency required? The weather system is clearly changing, this has happened twice in two years at these locations and it could happen again this winter.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	331	It is disturbing that the Minister of State did not indicate that interim measures were to be introduced. I thought Waterways Ireland was responsible for the waterways in the city and that the local authority was responsible for dealing with cleaning. We need to get a further commitment because this is November and it is very likely we will have another flood within the month. We may also have one in November 2003 and we must put the necessary interim measures in place immediately, which is not to talk of an overall plan. Where it is determined that methods can be introduced quickly can we have a commitment that they will be? Can the Minister of State provide the House with a straight answer regarding the fund that has been brought forward under the aegis of the Red Cross? Is it going to be disbursed under the same terms of reference as the East Wall fund?
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	332	Is the Minister of State aware that where people do not have a mortgage and are not in the habit of repaying a mortgage protection policy and insurance cover? That needs to be taken into account in any calculation and assistance given to those who have been flooded. Given that the city council has flagged the inadequacy of the drainage system due to the building of the city outwards not upwards as well as the significance of climate change, does the Minister of State agree it is time to introduce a flooding plan on a county by county basis? Such plans would provide for known flash points like the Poddle River in Kimmage where the sluice gate is regularly blocked by debris swept down the river leading to flooding of the road and of homes. Known flash points should be identified as part of a county plan so that when rainfall of the sort we have seen takes place, someone will be charged with the responsibility of going to unblock that debris before flooding occurs. That could help to solve the problem. We have a national accident emergency plan which is on a county by county footing. Why do we not have a flooding plan, particularly if this sort of thing can be predicted to happen again?

Will he address the issues which have been raised in those questions? It is clear to all lay persons that there is an urgent need to carry out remedial works and I refer to my own constituency which is a case in point. At the same locations in Leixlip, Celbridge, Maynooth, Straffan and Johnstown we have had the same problems over and over. In cases where people have been refused insurance as a result of repeated flooding over the years, will the Minister of State use his influence with the relevant authorities, the Red Cross or others, to ensure they are compensated?

Is he aware that his predecessor said exactly the same thing with respect to Arklow last year? That report has now been published and funding has been sought for an early warning system and remedial works, but none is forthcoming. People in the Tolka basin and in Arklow have as much chance of holding back the tide as they have of getting funding from this Government.

McCarthy & Partners, consultants, and to deal with all the problems associated with the River Al in the Willow Park estate area?

Otherwise, all rivers are the responsibility of the local authority, be it Dublin City Council in this case, Fingal or Meath County Council. Prior to this flooding, the Office of Public Works had no responsibility for the maintenance, deepening or otherwise of that particular river but because of our experience we knew that a flooding threat existed. We offered our expertise and €870,000 to fund the study, and we take our responsibilities seriously in that regard.There is much confusion in the House about responsibility for anti-flood measures. Waterways Ireland has responsibility for the canals, North and South; it has nothing to do with rivers. Responsibility for this area lies with the local authorities and currently we do not even have the legal power to have any involvement in the River Tolka. We are there at the behest of Dublin City Council. It is not our responsibility, therefore, but  the new work that has to be done will become the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.In terms of the Office of Public Works's work in hand, whether it be the various stages of flood relief measures, from early feasibility studies to works on site, we are talking of a cost of €300 million. Major flood relief schemes are currently under way in Kilkenny city and Carrick-on-Suir and a number of other schemes, including Arklow, have either gone through the planning process or are at some other stage. A total of €300 million is being spent on those works which are ongoing as resources become available.I confirm for the benefit of the two Deputies from the Athlone area that Athlone will be included in the humanitarian aid. We had a meeting here one night at 9 p.m. with the Office of Public Works, the Deputies and representatives of Westmeath County Council. A further meeting took place yesterday and there will be ongoing meetings. Clearly much work has to be done in that regard because the very first communication we received from Westmeath County Council about the floods in Athlone was the day after the floods, so we cannot be too far ahead of the posse. The question of who will fund that particular measure, whether it be the county council or the Office of Public Works, will come up for further debate.I confirm again that the Red Cross scheme does not provide compensation for losses. It provides for assistance where extreme hardship is being suffered. The closing date is 6 December. The eligibility criteria are extreme hardship, homelessness, damage to homes and serious injury. All of the concerns raised by the Deputy will be included in the criteria and in the calculation of loss.

The closing date is 6 December and I hope the Red Cross will have some of its work done before then. Obviously the people concerned have to first deal with their insurance companies, which I understand are on the ground taking care of losses. There will not be a lack of finance. The moneys will be made available to the Red Cross and, though it is a short time between 6 December and Christmas, we will strive in every way possible to have those funds made available by Christmas.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I move:That Dáil Éireann commends the 2003 Estimates for Public Services (Abridged) published by the Minister for Finance on 14th November, 2002.I am happy to have the opportunity to talk about the 2003 Abridged Estimates Volume. The media debate about the Estimates in recent days has been littered with misconceptions and inaccuracies. I want to take the opportunity today to correct some of those.Some newspapers have referred to a planned increase in spending next year of 2% compared to a 20% increase this year. Neither of these figures is correct. It is true that last week's Abridged Estimates Volume provides for a 2% increase in spending. However, I made it clear last week that the AEV does not include any provision for social welfare rate increases, benchmarking or any other pay increases. I will deal with these issues on budget day. It is true that the end October Exchequer returns showed spending at that point was nearly 20% above spending in the corresponding period last year. However, the forecast outturn figures for 2002 which were included in last week's AEV show that, at this stage, the forecast outturn for net voted expenditure is only slightly above the Revised Estimates Volume provision. These are provisional figures and the end of year Exchequer returns will be available as usual in early January. However, my aim and expectation remains that spending this year will come in on, or close to, target.I have an excellent track record overall in terms of ensuring that public spending each year is managed within the approved allocation for the year. Between 1997 and 2001, the average variation between the level of spending planned in the Revised Estimates Volume and the end-year outturn was less than 1%.Another common misconception is that Ireland's share of spending relative to national income is much lower than that of other European Union countries and that our level of public service provision is correspondingly lower. This suggestion is based on cross-country comparisons which indicate, for example, that total general Government spending in Ireland is budgeted at about 35.5% of GDP for 2002, compared with an EU average of 47%. However, this comparison is misleading. Ireland's taxable capacity, which delivers the resources for public service provision, is essentially related to gross national product, not gross domestic product. Our GDP is about 20% higher than our GNP whereas there is no real difference between GDP and GNP in other EU member states.In addition, a lot of expenditure is age related – pensions in particular. Other EU member states currently have a far less favourable demographic position than us. On average, 16% of other member states' populations are aged 65 or over whereas only 11% of our population is in this age group. This means, for example, that other EU member states have to spend much more to provide the same level of pensions and health services as us.If one takes account of these factors, our spending ratio is much closer to the EU average and because I have managed our budgetary  affairs prudently over the years, we now spend far less on debt service than others, about €1,000 less per household per annum.Amid much talk of cutbacks, I want once again to remind this House of the scale of investment in our public services in recent years. I am proud that our growth rates since 1997 have allowed us to spend more on public services than has ever been possible in the past. In fact, we have had the highest rate of increase in public spending of all EU member states over that period. Spending on day to day public services here rose three times as fast as in the average EU member state between 1997 and 2002.The Abridged Estimates provide for total gross expenditure next year of €36.7 billion, nearly double the amount spent in 1997. Current spending will be over €31 billion compared to €17 billion in 1997. Since I became Minister for Finance, funding for the health service has increased by €5.3 billion, education spending has increased by €2.4 billion and social welfare spending has increased by €4 billion. Capital investment next year will be over €5 billion compared with only €2 billion in 1997.Taking account of the Estimates figures just published, and before any budget day additions, public expenditure will have increased at an average of about 13% per annum over the period 2001 to 2003. We are now operating from a very high spending base. This will allow us to continue to deliver high levels of public services.This Government has consistently shared with the people the fruits of our economic success. We have used those resources to reform our tax system, invest in our public services, reduce our debt and establish the national pensions reserve fund to safeguard the pensions of this and future generations. Clearly, as economic and revenue growth moderates, we must bring our spending increases into line with tax revenue. The only other alternative would be higher taxation or higher borrowing. We built our economic success in recent years by putting sound taxation policies in place and this Government will not abandon those policies. The Government is also well aware that higher borrowing is not the answer – history has surely taught us that much.The EU Stability and Growth Pact requires us to keep the general Government finances close to balance or in surplus and to take corrective action when there is an actual or expected divergence from this objective. We made it clear in An Agreed Programme for Government that we would respect this sovereign commitment. We must face reality. The pace of international economic activity continues to be sluggish amid uncertainty about the timing and the pace of any pick-up. Our economy is in good shape and in a good position to deal with the current slow down. We are determined to secure the maximum value for expenditure to further improve the quality of service provided to the public.Government has to prioritise its spending and difficult choices are required. It is not possible to  afford the same priority to each sector. It seems that everyone is prepared to ream off along list of high priority programmes but no one is willing to propose a reduction in even one specific spending programme. The Government has decided to continue to provide substantial funding in 2003 for health, social welfare, education and transport infrastructure. This has inevitably required a tighter approach in other areas. The Government did not make these difficult choices lightly. It is all too easy to ignore the realities. Government is about making choices. Constructive opposition might be expected to signal what areas of expenditure are of a lower priority.Whatever problems exist in relation to the quality and quantity of our public services, money alone is clearly not the answer. If it were, we would have solved all our problems by now. Greater attention needs to be devoted to securing value for money through more effective control and management of public expenditure. It is a matter for each Minister ultimately to manage within his or her total allocation next year and to secure the best possible value for money from that allocation.The success of any expenditure management system is crucially dependent upon a shared recognition by each Minister and his or her Secretary General of the need to ensure that appropriate financial control systems are in place and are functioning effectively. Ministers and their management advisory committees need to consider emerging expenditure trends on a regular basis and ensure, through this process, that budgets are being properly controlled and managed. Starting next year, I intend to publish the yearly spending profiles which are submitted to my Department at the start of the year. This will allow members of this House and commentators to make a more informed assessment of the pattern of spending as shown by the Exchequer returns which are issued by my Department shortly after the end of each month. I will continue to submit monthly expenditure management reports to Government on emerging spending and revenue trends.Each Department's financial control system should include appropriate risk assessment measures and contingency provisions. I will ask that a review of spending patterns over the past five years be undertaken as part of the process of assessing the risk of future expenditure overruns on particular programmes. Depending on the outcome of the risk assessment measures, I expect each Minister to agree with his or her accounting officer a contingency amount within the 2003 allocation to be held back from specific allocation to cater for unforeseen pressures emerging as the year progresses.As with any other spending programme, schemes where it is particularly difficult to forecast demand must be managed effectively. I am asking Ministers to ensure that Departments examine these schemes, assess the factors which influence the behaviour of both the clients of the  scheme and those delivering the service, and prepare contingency options for changes in the rules governing such schemes or in the delivery mechanisms. Where evidence of higher than anticipated spending begins to emerge, Ministers must respond quickly by putting in place measures to bring spending into line with the approved allocation.I am also introducing revised arrangements for managing capital spending. These will require each Department to provide details of all capital projects which it proposes to initiate during 2003 and which are planned for the following four years. Departments will also be required to provide an end of year report showing the actual expenditure outturn and outputs delivered.The expenditure management arrangements should also provide incentives for Departments to improve efficiency and cost-effectiveness. As a general rule, where Departments secure savings as a result of efficiency measures or steps they have taken to curtail a programme, these savings should be available for other high priority programmes within the same Department. Similarly, proceeds arising from the disposal of surplus property should be available to finance high priority capital projects within the relevant Department.Extra income arising from specific policy changes, particularly where these involve user-charging mechanisms which would improve the management and delivery of particular schemes or programmes, should be available to the relevant Department. I will develop these ideas further in consultation with my Cabinet colleagues.While these control measures are very important in their own right they are also designed to encourage public service managers to seek out and exploit greater efficiencies. A number of initiatives are already in place which will help put the spotlight on value for money issues, including the management information framework, the expenditure review process and the forthcoming mid-term evaluation of the national development plan. I am aware that more needs to be done.For a number of years now, a three year planning horizon has been in place for public expenditure. I want to develop this further to give greater certainty to Departments in relation to planned allocations over the medium term. I have already introduced a five year financial envelope in the public transport sector to facilitate greater planning and more effective management of expenditure.My Department is currently considering whether a similar approach can be applied in other large capital spending areas. Ministers and Secretaries General are responsible for managing spending within their areas and I want to give them the maximum flexibility to do so effectively. Greater delegation must be coupled with greater accountability. The public has a right to see  whether it is getting value for money. The Estimates provide an enormous amount of detail on the allocations across Votes and programme areas and are an essential tool in the Government's accountability to the Oireachtas. However, they tell us nothing about the outputs which are linked to those resources. Only when we can assess the outputs delivered, can we be in a position to assess whether we are getting real value for money from all of our public services.This House can be confident this Government will protect and consolidate the economic progress achieved to date under our stewardship. We will pursue a sustainable budgetary policy, one that meets the needs of the current situation and that is capable of quickly restoring our capacity to provide for improved public services. We will take whatever steps are necessary to secure a sustainable financial position and evidence of this is clear in the 2003 Abridged Estimates. I commend this motion to the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18146	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	349	With the permission of the House I propose to share my time with Deputies Timmins and O'Dowd. I move the following amendment:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"rejects the Book of Estimates for 2003 which have failed to initiate any serious reform of public services to deliver value for money but have simply targeted the easy options for cutting spending without heed to their impact on the economy or the community."I suppose it would be churlish not to welcome some tighter control as announced by the Minister for Finance in the latter part of his statement. To be brutally honest, it is far too late to talk about control when in the past two years alone the Minister has allowed spending to increase by 40% at a time when he raised only 5% extra in revenue. That was the time for the Minister to heed the warning signs of an economy going wrong. The Minister's announcement also shows the extent to which proper controls had rusted over during the course of this Government's tenure.The Minister announces as news that Departments should show the outputs they deliver or that savings made should be available for other programmes or that changes in the rules of schemes should be under consideration when there are cost over-runs. To say that this is something new or original just shows the extent to which the Minister failed to respect his responsibilities to deal with the public money, the money raised from taxpayers, and to use it properly to give value for money. That will be the epitaph of this Government.It is the job of the Minister for Finance to heed those warnings. It was the current Minister for Finance who built his reputation on dissent from the sort of swashbuckling over-spending Mr.  Haughey engaged in when he was Taoiseach. Yet when the test came and it was his turn to control spending, he was found wanting. The reason vulnerable people will suffer in the next 12 months is that the Minister's courage failed him. When the test came he was not there to ensure that money was spent wisely.Now we are seeing a knee-jerk reaction as he seeks to reinstate his political reputation at the expense of some of the weakest sections of our community. It is not the demands of first-time buyers, the thousands of people on the waiting lists or the people living in fear of crime without the services of a Garda who have created the sort of financial problems we have today. The responsibility lies four square with the Minister, the Taoiseach and his colleagues in Government, who refused to act when action was needed and who deliberately concealed the need for action from the electorate when an election was pending.The Government revved up this vehicle of State spending to an incredible speed, at more than 20% per annum. Now that we are on the slippery surface, the Minister will do the very thing one does not do when speeding on slippery surfaces – slam on the brakes. We know what will happen, we will go into a skid and the people who will be hurt are those who are not well belted in. It will not be the Minister and his colleagues, who are well belted into the plush seats in their Mercedes, it will be the small people who depend on Government to deliver services. It will be the first time buyers struggling to get on the first rung of the ladder of home ownership. It will be the people waiting to get into hospitals who find beds closed. It will be those old people who are sitting in fear in their homes, worried about crime, who find that the Garda are not there, that they are confined to barracks because there are no payments to be made to them.It will be the children who are trying to learn while sitting in sub-standard schools with sub-standard toilets. It will be the people on community employment who will go on to the dole. It will be the patients on long-term medication who will have to pay more. These are the people who will carry the can for the way in which public finances were managed in the past two years. Let us be very blunt about it, the Minister for Finance was ashamed to mention any of these people in his speech. His speech was confined to accountancy-speak about slide rule approaches to the way public funding must be managed. This is not good enough. The people who are suffering and who will suffer are flesh and blood people who depend on public services to be cared for in their old age or when they are vulnerable or exposed.That is the betrayal that has happened in these Estimates. There is no sign of serious reform in the way spending is undertaken. There is no bureaucracy being reformed, no programmes being dropped because they have past their date of usefulness. When one dissects the Estimates, one does not see any serious reform going on, any  non-performing programmes being closed down to make way for worthwhile programmes. What one sees is the sort of crude cutting of transfers that go to the public, like essential repairs grants or first-time buyers' grants or home help. Either that, or one sees the traditional measures – repairs and maintenance – cut back, petrol allowances cut back, postage or IT improvements cut back. All the things that lubricate a decent public service are being curtailed as a sort of stop-gap to try to deal with this runaway spending.On stripping down the Minister's Estimates one sees that when one takes away social welfare, he has made provision of 6% in relation to pay, but in terms of the remainder, the crumbs that come across the table to those who depend on public services, the increase is just over 1%. This is a savage real cut in the actual services that come down from the big bureaucracies and reach the homes of people.We are seeing classic accountancy cut backs in these Estimates. Over the next year we will see expensive hospital beds lying idle with no patients. We will see social workers confined to their offices because they have no petrol allowances. We will see outreach services for vulnerable people only open at office hours when they are of little value. We will see housing bureaucracies administering schemes but with no money or houses to allocate. We will see prisoners confined to their cells without rehabilitation. We will see foresters without saplings to plant. We will see costs shunted on to hapless consumers, causing congestion as the capital projects are stalled.That is the sort of result that will come from this slide rule accountancy that is being engaged in tonight. It is the people at the end of the line, the people who do not have the loudest voices, who will take the hit. These are the wrong Estimates being introduced by this Minister at this time. We have already seen the approach taken by a Minister who told people to get out and party. Now he is saying people must accept a wage freeze. The Minister has no credibility in asking people to accept a wage freeze.Here is a Government that assured consumers there would not be a rip off during the euro changeover, but the rip off happened and Ministers sat on their hands. Far worse, not only did they sit on their hands but they enthusiastically got in on the act. We see more of this in the Estimates. In summer, patients waiting for long-term medication saw a 21% increase, now patient care is to go up again. Casualty department costs went up 26% in summer, hospital beds costs went up by 10%. Now costs are to go up again. The cost of VHI went up by 18% in summer, now it is to go up again. Local authority rent went up by 18% in summer, now it is to go up again. The cost of electricity is to go up by 13%, public transport by 9%, and charges to send children to college by 69%.This is the sort of stealth tax that is hidden in these Estimates. That is the approach of a Government that is bankrupt of ideas on how to  manage public services, to deliver proper quality services to the people for whom they are responsible. It is sad to see these Estimates. They are the wrong Estimates from the wrong Minister. The country deserves better.

It explained how the boom happened, dealing with domestic and external factors. In terms of domestic factors, it listed a favourable environment for foreign direct investment, an elastic supply of good quality labour based on our educational system, the industrial peace we had and strong public finances. In the book, Professor Brendan Walsh prophetically states that a year is a long time in economics. The Minister for Finance will remember the book well because he launched it around March or April of last year—

What has happened since then? We had a €4.8 billion surplus, now we are down to €1 billion-plus.Relate this to the factors that the professor pointed out were necessary for the boom. Does the favourable environment for foreign direct investment exist anymore? I do not know. Do we have an elastic supply of good quality labour? We have cut backs coming in education and talk of the reintroduction of third level fees. Given the increases Deputy Bruton outlined, how much longer are we to have industrial peace?The book goes on to outline the measures that should be taken during a downturn. The main one is to maximise the efficiency with which we spend public money. It would appear the Minister has set out in his submission today to try to put measures in place to do that. It is something we have articulated on this side of the House for a long time. Can the Government be believed, however? We have come in here for several budgets and when a national development plan was launched with great fanfare and great confidence, yet none of it has ever come to fruition.There is one thing on which I have to commend the Minister. He has given a speech of almost 2,000 words without once mentioning the first time buyers' grant. I have a little bone to pick with him on this because the Government has done a brilliant job on it. I am not here to defend the Government but no Minister has defended it. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, could not be found for two days to come on local or national radio. He was at a launch for a council in Waterford. I then turned on the television and saw him on screen, but he would not answer the questions put to him. The Minister for Finance can defend the abolition of that grant. When first introduced it  represented 5% or 6% of the purchase price of a house in 1977. It was increased only once or twice since its introduction. If it had been index linked, it would be approximately €15,000. It can only be availed of by first time buyers of a new house. In the region of half to two thirds of first time buyers buy second hand houses.Many inequities in the grant can be pointed out, but why did the Minister not mention the abolition of the grant? The Government decided beforehand to have a loss leader. It decided to pick a small item, the abolition of the first time buyers grant, on which the public would focus. Every Fianna Fáil backbencher is speaking about it. The media often say not to shoot the messenger, but in this case I must shoot the messenger. For the past five years the media has been sold a dummy. Every week in the national newspapers and out on the plinth the same faces can be seen and the media run with the same story. What will the backbenchers do? They will do nothing. This is all orchestrated. Those who spoke out in the previous Government were rewarded. My constituency colleague, Deputy Roche, was appointed Minister of State, and a former Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cúiv, who voted against the Nice treaty, was appointed to Cabinet.I am certain the Minister for Finance will bring in a tax credit for first time buyers of new houses or second hand houses on budget day, for which he will get a round of applause. Deputies Fleming McGuinness, O'Flynn and Lenihan – the party's answer to Buzz Lightyear – will then be on the plinth saying the same thing. They will all be seen as wonderful men. All the cutbacks in the areas of roads, health, environment and education will be forgotten, as we all go home happy for Christmas. The Minister for Finance knows that is true. I must hand it to his spin doctors, but time has caught up with them. I hope the messengers will get it right for once.The value of the agricultural industry to the economy increased from 2.3% to 2.4% in the 1980s, which over a ten year period gave rise to an increase in wealth of 23% to 24%. The value of the agricultural industry to the economy increased by only 0.5% or 0.6% in the 1990s, a decade when the economy doubled in size. It increased only to that level because it did not advance structurally. It is regrettable that the cutbacks in agriculture in the Estimates are in those areas where the structure could be improved. The Minister's friend, Professor Walsh, states that where countries cut back on research and innovation in a downturn, they never catch up. Research in the agricultural budget will be cut back by 24% at a cost of €7 million. The Minister for Agriculture and Food should have looked elsewhere for such resources or maybe he should have secured more for research, as this industry is going through difficult times, and I regret the cutback.The allocation to An Bord Bia, which is meant to be marketing our overseas produce, will be cut by 13%. The allocation for REPS, which is  important for environmental protection, will be decreased by €44 million. The national development plan, which is meant to address the structural difficulties in agriculture, in respect of which I regret I do not have more time to elaborate, has been reduced by 44%. I congratulate the Minister for Finance on that stunt. Fair play to whoever thought of it, but how it was manufactured will come out in time.

I particularly draw to the Minister's attention the fact that the shared ownership scheme in the urban borough council in Drogheda is closed and has been for some time. Shared ownership is a good concept. It gives people, who otherwise would not have the capacity to buy a house and who perhaps earn less than the national average income, the opportunity to buy a house. The council in Drogheda has not been accepting applications for the past month, nor will it tell us when it will be in a position to reverse this. It appears it will not open the door again to such applicants, even in January after the budget has gone through. There is a crisis in respect of home ownership. I ask the Minister to investigate this position.The Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs portfolio has been devastated by cuts in excess of €50 million in the Estimates. These can be examined under three headings. There is an overall cut in expenditure of 26% under the heading of rural affairs. That will have a significant impact particularly in respect of jobs in the west, part of the BMW region, where the IDA and other statutory organisations are working to create jobs. In particular the Western Investment Fund, which had a budget last year of €6.3 million, will be reduced next year to €2 million. What impact will this savage cut have? If the Minister telephoned that body, it would tell him the facts. It expected to support approximately 400 jobs through community and private partnerships across the west – an area which surely needs more investment, not less – in the next 12 months. It is shameful that its budget has been cut by this significant amount.If one focuses on the west, one realises the infrastructure and commitment needed to keep communities and families together in their environment rather than having to move to large towns. People want to sustain jobs in their environment, but with these savage cuts the Minister is not allowing them to do so. The allocation for CLÁR, a programme specifically related to keeping people in rural communities which are disadvantaged, will be savagely cut by up to 25%, at a cost of more than €3 million, which is unacceptable.There is an overall cut under the heading of community affairs of more than 7% in the Estimates. This comes back to the question of the sustainability of life in rural communities, particularly in the west. The allocation for community and voluntary services will be cut from €34 mill ion to €29 million, or 16%. The forthcoming budget is exacerbating the problems of western development by destroying whatever nurturing and initiative there is among members of the communities and by destroying the community and voluntary organisations, which will be decimated by these cuts.Tá ísliú 10% ar an mbuiséad iomlán don nGaeltacht. Tá laghdú 20% ar scéimeanna feabhais sa Ghaeltacht, ó €12 mhilliún go €10.5 milliún. Ní rud maith é sin ach go háirithe. Teastaíonn na rudaí céanna ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus a theastaíonn ó dhaoine atá ina gcónaí ins na bailte móra, ar nós bóithre, mar shampla, ach ní bheidh siad le fáil an bhliain seo chugainn. Níl mé sásta leis na giorraithe seo.The most important cut in the Gaeltacht budget is to Údarás na Gaeltachta. It was to spend €32 million this year, but under this harsh, hard-hitting, hard-cutting unacceptable regime, its budget will be cut back to €25 million, a reduction of 22%. One of the core issues in the report of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta, which was set up by the Minister, Deputy Ó Cúiv, to examine the future of the Gaeltacht, on how new jobs could be sustained and how the Gaeltacht could be developed, was the expansion and improvement of facilities and services provided by Údarás na Gaeltachta. These Estimates show clearly how bad the Minister, Deputy Ó Cúiv, has been in making his argument at Cabinet in respect of Coimisiún na Gaeltachta, which is to explore the future for Gaeltacht communities, given that Údarás na Gaeltachta will be savaged by these cuts.When we rang Údarás na Gaeltachta to find out cad a bhí le déanamh aige, dúradar that it believes it will have to sell sites and properties, which is the complete antithesis of rural development and Gaeltacht development.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	354	The date, 14 November, will be remembered by many people who had a dream of buying an affordable house as the day the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, lit a bonfire under their dreams. I have a typical letter from a constituent, a young man with a wife, who is working as a research assistant and his only option of getting a house was Fingal County Council's affordable housing scheme. He states that the prospect of he and his wife getting a house and being able to start a family has been ripped away at the last minute because while he was approved in principle he has not as yet been allocated a house. He states that the Minister said that people do not need the money and that the abolition of the grant will have no real effect. Those were the Minister's words – that people would not notice the loss of €3,500. This measure has possibly lost that man and his wife the only chance they had of buying a house and starting a family. Contrast the treatment of such a young couple with the Minister's favourite children, the  investors, who are cosseted with tax breaks which he has set up and elaborated each year in office.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."Ba mhaith liom mo chuid ama a roinnt leis na Teachtaí Boyle, Connolly, Joe Higgins agus Ferris.Seo an chéad deis ag an gComhaontas Glas reachtaíocht a thabhairt os comhair na Dála seo. Tá ceist os ár gcomhair atá an-thábhachtach i saol agus i dtodhchaí an náisiúin. Is é an reachtaíocht sin an Bille um Bainistiú Dramhaíola (Leasú), 2002.Statements will be made in this debate which will stand the test of time or will be found to be flawed to the point of being dangerous. The Green Party seeks to remedy a number of the flaws in the Waste Management Act, 1996, and the Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001. This Bill seeks to enshrine in law a ban on incineration, to require targets to be set to implement waste minimisation, to ensure local councillors are responsible as well as accountable for waste policy for their administrative areas and to ensure that for the first time, the definition of a zero waste strategy is enshrined in law.We are at a cross-roads in regard to incineration. I spoke to people from different countries on the telephone about this issue. It is clear people from countries with incineration believe, in many cases, there is another way. Unlike those countries, we have the benefit of hindsight. Technology has moved on. With alkaline hydrolysis, an approved technology in the United States and, we expect, soon to be approved in the European Union, incineration is not required for BSE infected material. Chemclaving and autoclaving is available in regard to medical and hazardous waste. There are many ways to minimise waste which were not available previously when people had to face the issue of waste management.For those reasons, I seek a frank debate in the House and, based on the technology we now have, to put forward a policy which will ensure Ireland remains incineration free. That will be of immense benefit not only to the health and food safety record of this country but will be an important benefit in marketing our food internationally, particularly our meat and dairy produce.I implore the Minister to take this legislation on board. It may not be the Government's final word on the matter, which we are prepared to accept. However, the Minister should at least accept the spirit in which it is offered, that is, as  a timely amendment to the Waste Management (Amendment) Act which will ensure incineration does not become a spectre on the Irish environment and that the future of this country lies in following an incineration free and zero waste strategy.The Government must show leadership as well as ensure democracy is allowed to be part of the Irish political scene. Under the 1996 Act regional plans were permitted in lieu of local plans in administrative areas and I ask that that be reviewed. This Bill provides a requirement that each administrative area have its own waste management plan. That does not preclude a regional plan being the final part of a waste management strategy but it should not be in lieu of a local administrative area plan. This is analogous to the local development plan which, naturally, follows the administrative boundaries. The same should be true of the waste plan initially so that local accountability is maintained and democracy is rooted in the administrative area of the local council.A zero waste strategy will be the most enlightened path a country can take when dealing with waste. It is as enlightened as looking for zero road tragedies and road accidents. The Minister will know more than most how difficult it is to attain that but, nonetheless, it does not stop him setting targets seeking zero road deaths. I commend the target in regard to road deaths but there should be similar political will to ensure zero waste in time. A strategy should be put in place with targets set for waste minimisation. Once those targets are reached, the targets may be pushed forward towards zero waste. That is perfectly feasible and is a practice being followed. I acknowledge nobody has reached it but it is the way forward.

The Minister should not confuse strategy with an end result. The strategy must be put in place so we keep moving forward rather than being satisfied with the fairly random percentage targets which are being set at present. They are a percentage of a quantity which is not defined. I ask the Minister to grasp the nettle, about which he keeps talking, but in a way which future generations will appreciate.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	358	It is a privilege for myself and Deputy Sargent to introduce our party's first Bill to be debated and voted on in this Chamber. I ask the Minister and the Government to consider a practice slowly developing in this House of giving honest consideration to Bills presented by Members on this side, allowing such Bills to go to Committee Stage and, ultimately, to be enacted. It would be to our benefit as a Legislature if we were allowed that opportunity.The Waste Management (Amendment) Bill is short. It seeks to correct flaws which have  become apparent in the 1996 Act and, more particularly, in the amending legislation in 2001. I refer to my experience of the 2001 Act, in particular. That Act was introduced by the Government because of impatience with a number of local authorities which had not approved regional waste management plans. I was a member of one such authority, Cork City Council. One of the other authorities, Galway Corporation as it was then known, had approved a waste management plan but had not approved it to the satisfaction of those determining waste management policy in Ireland; it had approved a plan which did not include the incineration option. The amending legislation was drafted, passed and forced on this local authority to bring about a different solution. For those of us who believe in local democracy, it was an unfortunate turn of events. In Cork City Council, we were never given the opportunity of voting on the local waste management plan. We debated it in the chamber and put forward amendments. It was then put into suspension while the city management allowed for the new legislation to take effect and to abrogate the decision itself at the expense of the local decision makers. Again, for those of us who care about waste management, as well as local democracy, that was a very unfortunate turn of events.The waste problem can be described as a waste crisis. The Minister and Government representatives have described it as such. How we define the problem and how we develop solutions to it depends on how imaginative we are in regard to the problem itself. The Green Party will be proposing solutions that deal with the problem at source. Unfortunately, the complication for the Government is that this problem needs to be dealt with in its end result. Ireland has the highest per capita amount of waste created in the world, outside of the United States, on which we are fast catching up. Why is so much waste created and why has no serious effort been put in place to reduce it? No serious efforts have even been put in place to reduce the rate of increase of the amount of waste. As a result we are the litterbug of Europe.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	364	That is a fact. Our recycling strategy is pathetic. It is minimal and ineffective. At a rate of 8% we are lagging at the bottom of the European league table. The Minister sought to make  capital out of a recent announcement that he was giving additional moneys for recycling facilities. Any additional money is welcome but he was offering less money than the Government had already promised in the national development plan. This is the direction of Government policy in regard to identifying waste as a problem and in trying to bring about a solution.The Government has chosen, instead, to go down what seems an easy disposal option. I represent the constituency of Cork South Central where it has been proposed to install a national toxic waste incinerator. The Government seems to believe that because the area is a sacrifice area of sorts with its heavy concentration of industry, which already takes care of a large amount of waste products, it should be the receptacle of all other waste created elsewhere in the country. This is the Government's kind of whole hog approach to waste management which totally ignores the feeling of local communities, such as those in Ringaskiddy. Ringaskiddy is the most obvious case because what is being proposed there will be of a larger scale and will have a more damaging effect than elsewhere in the country, but the same is true for County Meath and County Louth and Ringsend. Indeed, anywhere there has been a proposed incinerator it is an effort by authorities to avoid dealing with the problem at source which would ensure that we do not have such an amount of waste to be disposed of in the ways that are being suggested.The Bill does not just propose that we do not go down the incineration road, but also addresses the need to re-introduce a greater degree of democracy in our local government systems. It does so in terms of making the decisions and taking responsibility for decisions in regard to waste, but it also changes the emphasis. The Government has never adopted a three Rs approach to waste prevention. There has never been any serious attempts to reduce the amounts of waste being created. No infrastructure for the re-use of waste has been put in place. As I have already mentioned, we are at the bottom of every European league table in regard to the recycling of waste.We should not be approaching the debate by saying that things are happening to some extent and can be better in the future. We have been having this debate since Ireland promoted a green Presidency of the European Union in 1990. In the 12 years since then, all the statistics in regard to waste creation, in terms of reducing and recycling waste, have worsened. They have worsened most under the current Government, yet no one seems to be prepared to take responsibility for that.

If the Minister is prepared to take responsibility, I urge him to take it in the area of the waste that is being created. If he can show us strategies that lead to the production of less waste than is currently created then there will not be any need for an incinerator. If he can put those policies in place, he will have our support. We can only have a waste management strategy that takes into account the fact that this is a small country that should not have to implement policies that force us to produce more waste to justify an incineration infrastructure that cannot be substantiated on economic grounds.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I support and welcome the Bill. The principles it lays out should be fundamental to any waste strategy. We have had a pathetic failure in respect of effective waste management policy and implementation from successive Governments.Virtually the only policy approach we have had for many years is the bankrupt one of levying a charge for waste disposal. In the case of householders that means an extra tax at local level. Now that the Government has made such a mess of the public finances it will be squeezing the local authorities to an even greater degree in terms of shortfalls in their financing, resulting in a demand for refuse charges to be further increased. Waste collection in County Sligo has been privatised resulting in a rate of €10 per bag in one housing estate. That is an appalling dereliction of responsibility by successive Governments.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	374	This Government and the previous one bear a heavy responsibility for this approach. In terms of household waste, the EPA's database report of 1998 found that household waste accounted for only 1.5% of waste that was going to landfill. It was a minuscule amount in comparison with agricultural and industrial sources as well as construction and demolition waste which was the vast majority of it. Householders are not the problem. Successive Governments have failed to deal with the issue of a reduction of packaging, which creates a significant amount of what householders put out as rub bish. They have no option but to take it when they buy goods in a shop. The packaging of goods is quite incredible. Ordinary household products on sale in supermarkets such as food, mechanical goods or basic appliances have one, two or three layers of wrapping. It is ludicrous that a single lamb chop or a doughnut with a hole in the middle should be wrapped on a foam plate with clear plastic.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I agree with the Deputy.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	376	That is waste. I avoid those products as a matter of policy when I shop.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	378	Such packaging should be banned. As a demonstration for my own county council, I did €20 worth of shopping and brought the packaging waste into a meeting. It was incredible, yet the Government refuses to take on vested interests who want to sell their products while cutting the throats of their competitors. Householders are, therefore, waste receivers, not polluters. That principle is ludicrous and will prevent the development of a proper policy.The "polluter pays" principle is almost another tax and it was introduced in that context in 1983 when there was a major betrayal of PAYE workers through the introduction of water and household waste charges. The Government should take on the vested interests. Happily, we saw off water charges when they were proposed even though a similar propaganda ploy was adopted at the time whereby the charge was to be implemented as an incentive to conserve water. There are effective mechanisms for conserving water involving simple changes to the building and design regulations governing house building that could save billions of gallons of water in the capital city annually. However, instead of adopting such a conservation approach, people are made to pay to resolve the problem—

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I assure the Minister those jobs were not created by the Minister for Finance while he looked after the very rich last December. These funds should have been invested in a major waste management plan instead of lining the pockets of large corporations for repatriation overseas in addition to the €20,000 million they will send out of the country this year in profits made from the labour of Irish workers.Incineration is wrong from a health perspective, despite the Government's protestations that the problem of toxic emissions has been eliminated. Nobody believes that. Incineration is counterproductive in terms of economics as more waste needs to be generated so that such plants are profitable for privateers who are muscling in on it and, therefore, it will not reduce waste.Tá praiseach cheart déanta ag an Rialtas maidir le polasaí dramhaíola.

Such a strategy should have been at the heart of the Bill and the core objective of waste management. It was not and the truth is that incineration and the pampering of business interests who want to profit from bogus waste management schemes is at the heart of waste management legislation. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have over the past five and a half years shown that nothing will be allowed stand in the way of railroading incinerator projects into our communities.Worse still, the previous Minister for Environment and Local Government used waste management as a means to undermine local democracy in Ireland and his amendment to the Bill  removed power from local authorities, giving central Government an executive role in deciding local waste management strategies.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	393	They would not take responsibility.

He stated in May 1999 that he would "put local government back at the centre of local democracy and put councillors in a pivotal role in the new system". It was another false promise.We welcome the sections in this legislation that go some way to redressing the negative aspects of Deputy Dempsey's amendments and return power for the making, reviewing and replacement of waste management plans to democratically elected councillors. However, more needs to be done, as Deputy Dempsey's successor has shown the same contempt for local democracy. Within weeks of taking up office Deputy Cullen, not content with proposals for sneaking stealth taxes into hundreds of thousands of 26 County households through new charges for refuse collection, pronounced there was too much democracy in the 26 Counties.Surely it should be up to the councils who draft and negotiate waste management plans to decide what charges or levies there should be, if any.

The Minister's fast track and one stop shop approach is driven by the desire to cut to the chase. He stated: "I am not interested in more great debates". The Government does not want a debate on waste management.

The logic of these proposals is to get people to recycle more, according to the Minister. Here local government does have a role. It will collect the new taxes from householders who are, effectively, being denied any say in the waste management strategy.

The last Government and its predecessors  failed miserably to manage our massive waste problem. They presided over the lowest levels of waste reduction and recycling in Europe. That is an indictment of the Government and its predecessors. They failed to put in place a national strategy aimed at reducing the output of waste by manufacturers, the packaging and retail industries and the construction industry.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	401	It is amazing that independent assessments claim Ireland has one of the best strategies.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	402	They have failed to create an infrastructure to recycle the maximum possible volume of waste. Instead, they stood idly by even over recent months while the State's only glass recycling plant, the Irish Glass Bottle Company in Ringsend, was closed with the loss of hundreds of jobs.Rather than target the producers of waste, the Government has based its waste management policy on a network of incinerators which will need a constant stream of refuse to operate. It also plans to penalise even further the householders who find themselves at the end of the waste chain, having to dispose of waste they did not create. These plans must be resisted.The Minister has complained that the Government is "knee deep" in reports. Now he has decided to paper over the cracks in the Government's waste management strategy by pushing through as many incinerator projects as possible. This will, no doubt, make the waste management industry happy. It should be no surprise that the employers' organisation, IBEC, has welcomed the Minister's proposals, given that the new charges on households mean a let-off for IBEC member companies, who are the main producers of packaging waste. Interestingly, both IBEC and the Government seem to be against discussing a zero waste option. In IBEC's case, there is the money to be made from building and running incinerator projects.Already, 25 expressions of interest have been received by the Dublin Government for building a so-called waste to energy incinerator in Dublin's Poolbeg area.

They will help industry make as much profit as possible without regard to the consequences  and they propose to make the consumer pay for it.We welcome the amendments in this legislation. They demonstrate that there is vibrant and dynamic opposition in Leinster House to the incineration options. Section 22(10)(a) will reverse the anti-democratic legislation introduced by the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government. It returns the power to develop and implement waste management strategies to locally elected representatives. This section also returns power to councils to ensure that waste management plans ratified by local authorities are implemented by county managers. The importance of this monitoring function is vital, as many good elements of waste management plans have not been implemented by local council management. Section 22(10)(b) puts the incineration option out of bounds. This is only right as we must make it clear that incineration or any of its pseudonyms, such as waste to energy projects of thermolysis, do not have any part to play in a real waste reduction strategy.Bringing incineration to Ireland is equivalent to bringing the nuclear industry to Ireland. It is dirty, harmful to health and, most importantly, it is unnecessary.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I welcome this Waste Management (Amendment) Bill as a major contribution to putting a strategy in place for efficient waste management throughout the country. It makes it incumbent on each local authority to draw up and implement a waste management plan, with the emphasis on waste separation, recycling and the provision of a schedule for minimisation targets as part of a zero waste strategy.Government investment in recycling centres is of paramount importance to encourage private waste companies to become involved in the recycling process. It is essential to develop a recycling ethic nationally, particularly through schools, in order to ensure its success. I congratulate all the schools, teachers and pupils who have raised local awareness of waste management and the environment.The success of the plastic bag levy is a case in point, where a proposal caught the imagination of the public, forced people to think positively about using alternatives such as the "lifetime" bags and became an unqualified success, with resultant benefits for the recycling cause. It was conservatively estimated that 1.3 billion plastic bags were used annually in Ireland, that is, roughly 350 bags per individual in the country. In the United States, paper bags have been used for many years and have wide acceptance. Waste separation using differently coloured bins has been long established in the United States. It is illegal to place organic waste in bins. Glass is placed in blue coloured bins, with newspapers placed on the kerbside, and the only requirement is for the papers to be bound together with cord.In Ireland, most of our paper banks have disappeared without trace. I feel particularly guilty  about disposing of large volumes of newspapers in the regular bins. The excuse given for ending paper recycling was that there was a glut of paper on the world markets and that recycling paper was not economically viable.We need to consider landfills as potential resource centres from which energy can be recovered to the benefit of the entire community. About 10 megawatts of power is recovered from methane gas emissions from landfills in the greater Dublin area and fed into the national electricity grid. In Britain such landfills provide light and heating on a permanent basis to numerous boroughs in Britain's major cities.In my constituency the proposal for an incinerator at Killacorn, near Emyvale, has been a source of considerable concern for some time. This process, euphemistically called "thermal treatment", is widely used in the United States and in Europe. Citizens' coalitions of grassroots environmental groups have grown up in more than 20 states to oppose incineration. Throughout continental Europe, such incinerators have constant instances of thermal emission breaches and respiratory illnesses, lung cancer, etc., are particularly prevalent. The release of dioxins, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide into the atmosphere will exacerbate atmospheric pollution and chronic illnesses.Emissions also contain cancer causing heavy metals, as well as toxic chemicals, which have serious detrimental effects on male and female reproductive systems, cause severe immune system neutralisation, as well as inducing adverse hormonal effects within a radius of 30 miles from the incinerator. Dioxins enter the food chain through their accumulation in fats, meat, poultry, milk and even mothers' milk. This is due to emissions from the incinerator being carried for a distance of about 30 miles by wind currents. Falling with the rain, dioxins land on vegetation, which in turn is eaten by animals, thus entering the food chain.Incinerators operate 24 hours a day and there is no satisfactory monitoring system to detect breaches of dioxin levels in the emissions. The highly toxic flue ash or residue from the thermal treatment or burning process is used as a base for car parks, paths, etc., and it contains levels of dioxins, lead, arsenic and mercury which have been estimated to be 800 times above the safety level. The history of violations, non-compliance and environmental harm caused by incinerators in Europe and the US clearly reveals the difficulties and dangers of disposing of waste through this process. North Monaghan, and Killacorn in particular, can do without this threat to the environment and public health.We are in the throes of a waste crisis. Increased affluence is invariably accompanied by the generation of vast quantities of waste, unless people are provided with incentives to change their previous patterns of behaviour. Everyone is aware of the overriding need to reduce the volume of refuse and recycle. Such terms have almost become  buzz-words. The question of replacing plastic packaging, beverage cans and glass bottles has long been ignored.The building industry is not blameless in generating huge quantities of rubble, conservatively estimated as accounting for 40% of municipal solid waste. We are racing headlong towards a situation where landfill sites will no longer be available and local authorities will be required to have their own individual waste management plans in place within their own boundaries. The Bill is designed to hasten that process and I welcome it.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I welcome the fact that the Green Party has published this Bill so early in the life of this Dáil because once again its Members have demonstrated that they lack any substance and are bereft of ideas when it comes to being serious about the environment. With the publication of the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2002, the Green Party – it is important to emphasise that it is the Irish Green Party – has again demonstrated that it lacks any kind of political maturity. Rather than construct a reasoned and realistic waste management policy based on the facts, it remains wedded to the soft option, the publicity stunt and the elevation of woolly aspiration above actual achievement. Put simply, until such time as Ireland's Greens put substance before soundbite and adopt a serious and pragmatic approach to environmental management issues, as many of their European counterparts have done, they cannot and will not be taken seriously.This Bill is no more than a stunt, a needless distraction that seeks to negate the steps taken under the Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001, to bring the waste planning process to a satisfactory conclusion. It would lead to a further round of planning controversy, as well as disrupt the ongoing implementation of the regional waste management plans adopted last year. It would deny the option of energy recovery from waste, a legitimate process utilised for environmental benefit throughout the European Union and further afield. This is unacceptable.I am determined to keep our focus on the early delivery of improved waste services and a modern, sustainable waste management infrastructure. Accordingly, it is my duty, as Minister, to oppose the Bill. There is a consensus that waste management is poorly developed and that early action is needed. We are experiencing steadily increasing waste arisings, reflecting ongoing and still relatively robust economic development. The amount of waste being recycled is increasing significantly, but from a very low base. We had one of the lowest rates of municipal waste recycling  in the European Union, although we are now approaching the EU average. We have no significant biological treatment capacity and no energy recovery infrastructure. Consequently, we are heavily reliant on landfill to deal with our waste arisings, but many of our landfills are small and require significant upgrading to ensure requisite environmental protection. We face an imminent shortfall in national landfill capacity. This cannot continue.In policy terms, we are committed to a long overdue move away from one dimensional and unsophisticated waste practices towards a modern, environmentally sustainable system of waste management. Our objectives are clearly stated in our published policy documents. Our challenge can be put simply: sound waste management demands a significant environmental and lifestyle behaviour change. Essentially, we need to radically transform the way we think about and deal with waste. We need an integrated waste management approach which incorporates innovative policy initiatives and fiscal measures to decouple as far as possible ongoing economic growth and waste generation.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	412	Where waste arises, we want to deploy recovery options that will deliver much higher levels of materials recycling and biological treatment, and recover energy from combustible wastes that cannot be recycled. With all of this in view, we have come through a lengthy and often difficult regional planning process. These plans entail the provision of integrated waste management services and infrastructure with a balance of local and large-scale facilities. Typically, they provide for local awareness raising and waste minimisation efforts; the segregation at source and separate collection of recyclable and organic materials in urban areas; extended networks of "bring" facilities for recyclable materials, especially in rural areas; civic amenity sites and waste transfer stations; biological treatment of green and organic household waste; materials recovery facilities; thermal treatment facilities; and baling and residual landfill requirements. I am now preparing a national overview of these waste plans to make sure that, taken in the round, they can fully deliver on our requirements. Overall, however, I am satisfied that they create a sound basis for sustainable waste management into the future.What we need now is action and implementation. At national level I am intent on bringing forward a range of new initiatives, including a national waste prevention programme; a market development programme for recyclable materials; further producer responsibility initiatives; an office of environmental enforcement to secure improved enforcement performance, including in relation to illegal waste activities; a national strategy on biodegradable municipal waste, which  reflects the requirements of the EU landfill directive; and bans on the landfilling of recyclable materials.At regional and local level we need to improve public education and awareness, continue the expansion of segregated collection services and "bring" facilities, and ensure the rapid provision of the infrastructure necessary properly to manage our various waste streams. Providing new infrastructure on the scale needed represents a major and expensive undertaking. Solutions will be delivered through constructive engagement between the public and private sectors, ranging from informal agreements regarding the delivery or services and facilities to more formal joint venture arrangements and fully fledged public-private partnerships, or PPPs, especially where the delivery of regional infrastructure is concerned.Progress in the development of PPPs is well advanced in the Dublin region in particular. An environment fund has been established to which the revenues from the landfill and plastic bag levies are hypothecated. A new capital grants scheme is in place to incentivise the rapid provision of waste recycling facilities. I recently announced a first round of grant allocations of up to €15 million towards local authority infrastructure and further allocations will follow as soon as possible early in the new year. However, while the Government and local authorities are now pressing forward in honest endeavour, the Green Party seeks to fight past battles based on a policy perspective that, frankly, does not seem to be shared by their European counterparts.

I would like to refresh his memory about the current position in Australia. He referred to the great plans the Australian Capital Territories Government had. I am happy to inform the House that the ACT Government now proposes new targets for the 2010 strategy and has acknowledged that the whole strategy needs to be relaunched within the community. Melbourne had a policy of no waste and almost 80% of its waste was going into landfill but now it has announced it is assessing thermal treatment technology as part of its strategy to 2005. So much for Deputy Sargent's great enunciation on what is happening in Australia when it has abandoned everything it started two or three years ago, realising those were nothing but woolly aspirations.There is a reality in the waste management infrastructure in Ireland which divides it into four streams. The great environmentalist countries which are often referred to here, the Scandinavian countries, all use thermal treatment as part of their strategies. The strategy in this country—

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I have no problem with the word. I will be using it when I come to thermal treatment. I will put some facts before the House, though Deputy Boyle will not want me to.Essentially the Bill seeks to facilitate the early variation or replacement of regional waste plans.  As I said before I was interrupted, under section 22 this provision was introduced last year to ensure a period of stability during which local authorities can focus on plan implementation. I do not propose to remove this safeguard. The regional waste management plans adopted last year are not just, or even mainly, about thermal treatment, as the Greens would like to propagate. They are about better integrated waste management services for the regions, delivering a much higher recycling performance, recovering energy from waste which cannot be recycled, and using landfill as the last resort for residual wastes which cannot otherwise be treated.Thermal treatment, whether by incineration or other technologies, is envisaged as only one component of an integrated infrastructure which will facilitate recycling and biological treatment of 40% to 50% of waste. Opposition to thermal treatment proposals centres on two issues: perceived risks to public health, and a perceived conflict between incineration and materials recycling. For the benefit of those who have an open mind in this matter, there is an informed consensus that modern municipal waste incinerators, employing modern technologies and subject to compliance with strict environmental standards, do not present a significant risk to the environment or public health.

The EPA considers that municipal waste incineration, operating to the best modern standards and incorporating energy recovery, is preferable to landfill from an environmental viewpoint.Particular attention has focused on dioxin emissions from proposed thermal treatment facilities. The fact is that dioxin levels in Ireland are extremely low and despite the scare stories, there is no reason to expect that waste incineration, operated to current stringent standards, would have any significant effect on background levels. The Green Party knows this well. The main sources of dioxin emissions to air are and continue to be uncontrolled combustion sources – uncontrolled waste and wood burning, accidental vehicle and building fires, bonfires, fireworks, etc.

They could be, if incineration was prioritised and insufficient effort was put into composting and materials recycling but our regional plans clearly provide for the reverse. They first provide for maximum achievable recycling, with targets of up to 50%, and only then do they give consideration to thermal treatment and landfill of the remaining waste. Under these plans, the capacity of the proposed thermal treatment facilities is deliberately limited. The argument that the provision of thermal treatment means incinerators would have to be fed, thereby reducing efforts to recycle, is not valid. We are committed to meeting specific EU and national recycling targets.Throughout the EU the most environmentally progressive member states combine an  impressive recycling performance with a significant reliance on thermal treatment as part of art integrated approach to waste management. In 2000 there were 304 incineration facilities operational in Europe, treating 50 million tonnes of waste and generating significant amounts of electricity and heat for district and industrial heating. The expectations are that reliance on incineration with energy recovery will increase, as the EU seeks to increase diversion of waste from landfill. Is everyone out of step except us?In this regard, it is telling that the concerns expressed by the Green Party in Ireland do not appear to be shared by their European counterparts. For instance, until relatively recently, the Environment Ministers in France, Germany and Flanders all came from Green Parties. None of these Ministers saw fit to try to ban or phase out waste incineration with energy recovery. In fact, the Flemish Minister recently approved the provision of further municipal waste incineration capacity for that region. Why is the Irish Green Party out of step not only with environmentally sound waste practice throughout Europe, but also with European Greens?

Waste management plans would be required to provide that waste is recycled at the "lowest effective level", whatever that means. Every home would have to separate waste, suggesting that all will avail of segregated collection services. Each village and urban district in the State is to have a reusable material clearing depot. Do these proposals take account of either cost or practicality?What is more interesting is what the Bill does not say. The Green Party's ten point plan for a zero waste strategy does not mention the word "landfill". This is another waste management option it finds unacceptable so it is wished away. Our waste is made to disappear in a cloud by a Green Party three card trick. Waste that cannot be recycled is to be cured and stored in locally based waste depots. Are unknown quantities of waste to be stored indefinitely in local housing estates? According to the Greens these storage waste facilities must be lined cell systems that control the flow of rain water, fluids and gasses from them. In effect, they propose a small landfill in each local authority area. They give no consideration to the need to reduce the number of landfills and achieve economies of scale that can support the application of modern environmental standards to such facilities.

At national level the elimination of the need for landfill and 100% recycling without reliance on incineration is, and remains, simply an aspiration. Despite claims to the contrary no city, state or country anywhere has managed this feat or is even remotely close to doing so. There is nothing wrong with long-term aspiration but it cannot be allowed to impede the taking of action that is required now to meet today's problems.Sinn Féin has also wrapped the green mantle of zero waste about itself and, no doubt, will also support the Bill. Sinn Féin's waste policies are even more threadbare than those of the Green Party. Among other populist positions they oppose all forms of incineration. They seek to reverse the privatisation of local authority waste services while at the same time opposing household waste charges, denying local authorities the funding necessary to run these services. This position clearly disregards both the polluter pays principle and relevant EU legislation.I could comment on the legislative validity of certain provisions of the Bill. For instance, I doubt the provision in subsection 2(a) is legally meaningful, given that all local authorities have already made plans prior to the date specified in subsection (2), and hereafter may only vary or replace such plans.

It would be better if, in going forward, we had the active support of a party that claims such strong environmental credentials. Instead, however, the Green Party seeks to obstruct and delay and make woolly proposals which will have no effect in dealing with the serious waste problem in the country. I am not prepared to see their policies succeed. Accordingly, I oppose this Bill.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	475	It is a relatively short time since the Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001 was debated at some length in the House and tortuously in committee. Numerous amendments were proposed by Deputy Gilmore and others and those of us who were members of the select committee became more familiar with waste man agement strategies and with viewpoints on them than we had ever expected. Some of the issues which have been raised tonight were discussed at that time and the positions in relation to them have not changed much.We are all aware of the controversy which surrounds the issue of waste management in local areas. The history of landfills, particularly at a time when local authorities were short of cash, is bad. Councils were unable to devote sufficient resources to them and management was poor. We face a growing mountain of waste and we must deal with it. I was a member of a local authority which had one such landfill site close to the town of Ennis. The authority faced a very expensive legal action, which it lost, and was put in the invidious position of having to find an alternative site. It was a difficult process which created difficulties for many people.I am prepared and disposed to approach this debate from a practical point of view, taking account of experience in my own area and nationally. It is also incumbent on us to take account of best international practice and experience. In that context, the Waste Management (Amendment) Bill, 2002, flies in the face of common sense and reason. Environmental management issues demand serious debate and effective and workable policies. The regional waste management plans which were adopted last year generated huge controversy. This Bill would disrupt their implementation and create chaos in the area of waste management.

He is a member of a local authority which could not be said to be even barely managing.We cannot continue to delay and pretend there is no need for a modern sustainable waste management structure. The effect of this Bill would be to undermine the efforts of a great many agencies and individuals to deliver improved waste services. No one can deny that waste management is a critical issue and one which we have not excelled at addressing.Increased waste recycling is encouraging but we are beginning from a very low base. Traditionally it was the lowest in the EU and while we are coming close to the EU average we have a huge amount of work to do in the area of recycling. We must be prepared to embrace modern technology and to change our focus if effective systems become available. We traditionally relied almost exclusively on landfill. Most landfills were small and inadequately funded. They were certainly inadequately managed and most had no environmental protection. We are currently beset  by a shortage of landfill nationally. It is a miracle that we are barely coping and we cannot afford to have this position further undermined.People who live near the newer landfills have good reason to be nervous about their possible detrimental effects. They are undoubtedly making their judgments on the history of the mismanagement of landfills. Some are quick to attribute the NIMBY factor to local objections. This is grossly unfair and I do not blame local people for taking issue on the basis of their own and others' experience. It is inevitable that we move, to some extent, away from landfill. The challenge is to devise and finance a modern, environmentally sustainable system of waste management. We cannot afford to fail.Neither can we avoid additional biological treatment capacity and the provision of an energy recovery infrastructure. This requires an integrated waste management approach and fundamental lifestyle changes from everyone – individuals, corporations and all who are part of the problem. The polluter pays principle needs to take effect at the manufacturing stage more than at the end of the cycle. I am in danger of agreeing with Deputy Joe Higgins on that point. It is one we need to address. We have long advocated a carrot and stick approach but the evidence suggests that the stick will need to brought to bear more than heretofore.We must face up to the fact that no matter how far recycling strategies advance there will still be waste to be disposed of. It is all very well to aspire to a zero waste situation but if that is attainable it is a long way off and there will be a long interim during which we will have to deal with the problem.Despite technological advances the real options are landfill and combustion, ideally combustion which recovers energy. In general, the regional waste management strategy seeks to balance local and large scale facilities.It is encouraging that more and more householders are prepared to co-operate with bottle banks and Bring areas. In many areas there is not a sufficient number of these facilities. There is also a hard core of citizens who will never be prepared to co-operate with this strategy. People in these circumstances frequently call for the matter to be addressed through the education system and the schools. My 20 years of experience in that particular area force me to be somewhat cynical in that regard because we must accept that the kind of example young people see in respect of littering is truly appalling. It would be impossible for any education system to redress the balance. However, schools do play an important role and local communities, when there is community activity and involvement, have also been proactive, and effectively so.In my area, most of the people who collect waste are local contractors – people who are new to the business – and they tell me that a very important part of their income stream comes  from recycling. They say that it is becoming increasingly important to their long-term plans.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I am sharing my time with Deputy Gilmore.Waste management is at crisis point and it is said that it will deteriorate even further unless realistic measures are put in place to address the problem. At present, landfill is the main disposal method for dealing with our waste. Over 90% of waste is disposed of in this manner, leaving Ireland with one of the worst recycling rates in Europe. Fine Gael commits itself to reverse this trend by immediately tackling years of policy neglect and one of our first priorities would be the setting up of a national waste management authority, whose remit would be to implement a national programme of recycling, re-use and reduction in conjunction with local authorities by developing the necessary waste management infrastructure.I am concerned at the present ad hoc arrangement and I believe the agency could bridge local authority and regional borders to co-ordinate and give real effect to a national programme of waste management. The agency would also ensure that best waste management practice became the common standard throughout the State.I am totally in favour of actively promoting a programme of waste reduction and minimisation. I do not look on waste as a product that we must dispose of, but as a resource, and we must maximise its re-use and recycling potential. The primary objective is to promote waste minimisation and recycling.The concept of "zero waste" should be incorporated in all approaches to managing the nation's waste. Zero waste is not only about recycling and diverting waste from landfill, but also about examining the production of waste and aiming to ensure that producers of waste bear responsibility. The approach to zero waste management would have three important elements. Firstly, consumers and local authorities would be asked to look at waste as a resource by ensuring separate bin collections to households, providing compost bins to all households and banning certain wastes from landfills, such as biodegradable waste, batteries and tyres. Secondly, businesses and producers of waste would be asked to seek out material efficiencies and redesign products and packaging that the community could not use, repair, recycle or compost. Producers' responsibility would be extended for their products and packaging by establishing take-back, re-use and manufacturing schemes. This would be achieved by providing incentives to discourage over-packaging; running product take-back schemes pertaining to products such as end-of life-vehicles, electrical and electronic goods; and introducing packaging take-back schemes, for example, deposit return sales. Thirdly, we would support and develop "zero waste" policies by providing recycling subsidies of a fixed payment per tonne for specific materials; developing stable markets  to offset the volatility of recycled products; designating recycling as a manufacturing industry for capital grant and taxation purposes; charging Enterprise Ireland and the county enterprise boards with the task of identifying commercial applications for waste resources and assisting indigenous companies to develop recycling as a business; pursuing policies at EU level to ensure that the banning of certain packaging products will not be viewed as anti-competitive; controlling at source the production of hazardous waste by introducing regulations to ensure all licences and licence reviews address the minimisation, re-use and recycling of such waste; ensuring that planning applications address the minimisation, re-use and recycling of building materials; introducing regulations or specifications to ensure the re-use of building materials; and introducing regulations in respect of product manufacture that will make them easier to recycle, for example, plastic rings and labels on plastic bottles.I recognise there will always be some residual waste for end disposal, but I believe that our waste management proposals would result in a significant reduction in the waste destined for landfill. A very successful programme operated by Cork City Council and Galway City Council should be looked at. For example, in Galway, the council has already managed to divert over 60% of waste from landfill and it is an indication that policies which aim to implement a zero waste policy can be successful.Public concerns regarding incineration are based on real fears relating to dioxin and particulate matter emissions. The landfill disposal of residual toxic ash material has also caused concern. Properly engineered and well-run landfill sites are the best option available to dispose of waste that has been stripped of all its recyclable products.The Government's waste incineration policy must be questioned and, when given the opportunity at the Oireachtas Committee on Environment and Local Government, I will propose and press for the setting up of an Oireachtas sub-committee to examine all alternative waste disposal options. This committee should be given resources and the support of experts who could be consulted and who could give advice. We could initiate an all-party approach to a very serious problem.Policies that look on waste as a resource must be expanded and promoted at all times in preference to incineration. The news in the past week that the Minister has cut recycling grants to local authorities by €5 million is a serious setback to Ireland's waste management policy. We are being told by this Government that better waste management is one of its top priorities and that the early implementation of regional waste management plans is a cornerstone of that project. However, the Government is now cutting millions from grants to local authorities to provide recycling services.The reality is that pious platitudes from the Government are just not good enough. What is required to achieve our objectives is the allocation of resources to our local authorities, not cutbacks. This is just another example of the Government preaching one thing and doing the opposite. These latest cutbacks are a hammer blow to the Government's long-promised plans to protect the environment.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I thank Deputy Allen for sharing his time with me and enabling me to contribute to the opening debate on this Bill. I congratulate the Green Party on the introduction of its first Private Members' Bill for debate on Second Stage in the House. As Deputies Sargent and Boyle said earlier, it is an important occasion and one that should be acknowledged in the House.The Labour Party will support this Bill although it does have some difficulties with regard to some of its detail and some items it feels are absent from it and which probably should have been included. Essentially, the Bill is seeking to undo the damage which was done to local democracy by the Waste Management Act, 2001, which I strongly opposed on behalf of the Labour Party, as Deputy Killeen acknowledged. The legislation which was put through by the Minister's predecessor flew in the face of local democracy and transferred, notwithstanding what the present Minister states, to unelected local authority officials the power to make waste management plans.More serious than allowing for the transfer to the county manager the responsibility for making a waste management plan, the Act also provided a short cut through the planning process for the establishment of waste facilities, especially for the anticipated development of incinerators around the country. The Minister said solutions will be delivered through constructive engagement between the public and private sectors, ranging from informal agreements regarding the delivery of services or facilities to more formal joint venture arrangements to fully fledged public private partnerships, or PPPs. This means that a waste infrastructure will be developed by private interests, who will be facilitated by the Act by being given a short cut through the planning process. Planning applications will be effectively circumvented.The Green Party Bill also seeks to exclude incineration as an option for the treatment and management of waste. The Labour Party agrees with that position. Unfortunately, the Minister has not set out an alternative strategy. The Government takes a two-tier approach. The first, involving its public face, is expressed periodically in press statements, the launching of recycling grants and the publication of documents and the many reports burdening the Minister. In it the Government agrees to an approach to waste with which most in this House would agree. It includes an integrated waste management approach and a  significant emphasis on recycling, re-use, recovery and prevention of waste.However, nothing the Government does in practice advances this strategy. Recently the Minister announced grants totalling €15 million for recycling projects. This is a cutback on what was announced in previous years and it will do little or nothing to advance recycling. A lot of material is being collected for recycling but it is doubtful if it is being recycled. The Government allowed the closure of the only glass recycling facility, the Irish Glass Bottle Company at Ringsend, and the paper collected for recycling is shipped to the Far East or, in many cases, is dumped in landfill facilities. A make believe approach to recycling is in vogue while the real agenda, largely unspoken, is the advancement of the development of five or six regional incinerators.The Waste Management Bill, 2001, was introduced by the Minister's predecessor because the Government had expressed its unhappiness that local and regional authorities were delaying the making and preparation of waste management plans. We were all given the impression that action and implementation was required and that as soon as the adoption of the waste management plans had been completed there would be a great deal of action in dealing with the waste problem, to be done against a backdrop, recognised by all, that existing landfills are filling up and are running down. Furthermore, the standards at which they must be managed are considerably higher than in the past which means that the option of landfill is dwindling as a viable solution.Since the enactment of the Waste Management Act, 2001, the purpose of which was to force local and regional authorities to adopt waste management plans, there has been little or no action in advancing the waste management agenda. The Minister stated: "I am now preparing a national overview of these waste plans to ensure that, taken in the round, they can fully deliver on our requirements. Overall, I am satisfied they create a sound basis for sustainable waste management into the future."  These plans were compiled, at considerable cost to the public purse, by waste management consultants. One firm of consultants was responsible for compiling a large number of them. The Waste Management Act, 2001, forced through this House and the other House by the Government, was supposed to ensure they would be adopted so we could proceed with their implementation. The Minister now says he is conducting a national overview of them to ensure that they can fully deliver on requirements.

It states: "Remember, remember, the 5th of November."  I gather a number of Fianna Fáil backbenchers want to adopt this rhyme to take account of their current predicament in regard to Estimates day 2002, the high point of Deputy "Guy Fawkes" McCreevy's career. It would state "Remember, remember 14 November". That was the day he exploded forever his and his party's reputation for financial and economic competence. On 14 November Deputy "Guy Fawkes" McCreevy blew up all hope of putting our infrastructure on  a modern footing and shredded his flagship national development plan. It was the day the Minister destroyed totally what lingering credibility attached to his colleague's health strategy. Remember, remember 14 November, the day he made ordinary citizens, particularly the vulnerable, pay the price for his incompetence and his pre-election splurge by slashing essential public services. Guy Fawkes is remembered with traditional bonfires but the Minister for Finance made his own bonfire on 14 November when he lit a fire under Fianna Fáil's book of vanities, its election manifesto.I remind the House of some of what was promised to the electorate last May by Fianna Fáil. On page 66 of the manifesto Fianna Fáil promises to expand the Garda by a further 2,000 members, on page 57 to invest in school buildings to ensure that every school attains modern standards within the next five years and on page 54 to extend medical card eligibility to over 200,000 extra people with clear priority given to families with children. On page 53 of the same document, Fianna Fáil attests it will implement the national health strategy, including a programme to increase by 3,000 the number of public hospital beds, and end hospital waiting lists within two years. To this end €1,100 million of additional capital spending was promised. On page 43, Fianna Fáil supports the idea of lower pricing for public transport during peak travel times, on page 44 the party commits to continuing with the very significant programme of investment in non-national roads which are so essential to the fabric of rural areas and on page 62 it promises a further expansion of social housing programmes to meet the housing needs of 15,000 households per annum.The Book of Estimates says something different. According to Vote 20 there is not a single penny more for additional gardaí while Vote 27 describes a 13% cut in the capital budget for primary education. Vote 33 provides not a single additional medical card and instead of the €1,100 million in additional health capital spending there will be a mere €3.8 million. Vote 32 gives no real additional resources to CIE while allowing for increases in bus and train fares. Vote 25 provides for a 27% cut in funding for non-national roads and Vote 25 for a 5% cut in the social housing programme.I have already referred to the dilemma of those in the affordable housing category who have had their first time buyer's grant taken away by the Government. Fingal County Council has built more affordable housing than any other local authority and we have more in the pipeline. At present, 420 people have been approved for that type of housing which they are to get next year, but they are short of that as of this week.

Fearing the fire was not bright enough, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, took out the building plans for colleges and universities and added them to the bonfire.The Book of Estimates sets out catastrophic decisions in relation to capital spending which amount to a total betrayal of the country's interest. It is no exaggeration to call this national sabotage and to accuse the Ministers responsible of economic treason. There was never the remotest chance that growth rates would remain at around 10% every year, but it is widely accepted that there is potential to grow at a sustained rate of 4% to 5% per annum for some years to come. That rate exceeds greatly the European average. The capital programme is the path to achieving this goal by removing the bottlenecks that are retarding growth, increasing inflation and making investment here highly risky. The assault on the capital programme is short-sighted in the extreme and undermines the future capacity of the economy to achieve steady growth rates. It destroys confidence by resuming wretched stop and go and boom and bust cycles.For years Ministers were fond of quoting international competitiveness indices when Ireland was high on the league table but these same indices have now downgraded our economy from No. 11 to No. 24, citing in particular continuing weaknesses in infrastructure. In dumping its national investment plan, this Government is gambling  rashly with our international standing. International investors looking at Ireland will get two definite signals from this Government that may well cause them to think twice about the value of locating here. They see a country that has prospered and accumulated substantial wealth, yet whose Government has chosen to abandon plans to use that wealth to establish conditions for future prosperity with better roads, railways, communications, schools and universities. Without investment, there is no basis for future prosperity and if a country will not invest in itself, how can it expect others to do so?The Book of Estimates is a vote of no confidence in the economy. We should look at the public capital programme and compare the 2003 Estimates to those for 2002. Funding for agriculture and food has been cut by 30% and for forestry by 6%. The Minister cannot be proud of that. In the case of the latter there will be a real bonfire as saplings being reared for planting are destroyed thanks to cuts in the planting programme. Tourism funds have been cut by 11% after two of the most difficult years for the industry in recent memory. Fisheries have been cut by 26%, energy by 21%, and regional broadband provisions by 27% despite the waffle from Government about putting Ireland at the forefront of the knowledge economy. Cuts in education are of the order of 17% and none of these figures account for inflation. The Government will not invest in its own country. The same applies to the extraordinary national pension reserve fund and the international observer will ponder what this tells them about Ireland. The sum of €1 billion is set aside for investment to meet future liabilities, except that this year it must be borrowed and invested internationally during a very uncertain time in the equities market. We know from the last annual report and information available that the fund has taken a hit equal to a whole year's investment. Is the Government so lacking in confidence in the long-term future of the country that it cannot or will not find a route to have part of the fund invested in our roads, communications networks and public transport?The Taoiseach highlighted the urgency of the roads and public transport programme by creating a new Department to oversee its implementation. It has been a total failure. We heard that within days the Minister was ready to go full speed ahead with the Dublin metro, with instructions to the Railway Procurement Agency to get the job done and have it finished the day before yesterday. By the end of the summer, however, he had backtracked and trimmed his sails. He revised his instructions to the agency to confirm its mandate only for the construction of the rail link from the city centre to the airport. Even those limited objectives appear now to have been dumped. At his press conference the Minister  appeared to be unsure whether any funds had been allocated for the metro, for instance, and had to be gently reminded by his officials that €9 million was still available for planning in relation to transportation in the greater Dublin area.As with rail, so too with the roads programme. The Minister has been forced to delay the commencement of essential road improvements, a delay that is causing consternation among every section of industry, domestic and international, commerce and tourism.The worst approach is the one the Minister and his colleagues are pursuing. They announce plans, strategies, quangos and study groups by the dozen, but just when it comes to the point of committing real resources, they pull back. This does nothing but destroy confidence and leaves our country open to very unfavourable comparisons with others. For instance, how did medium-sized cities in France get their light rail systems fully in place in a five to six year time-frame? How did Athens get a two line metro system up and running in quite a short time-frame, with two others to be ready for the 2004 Olympics? We boast that we now out-perform these countries in productivity, growth and wealth. If that is the case, why do we lag so far behind them in getting our infrastructure right?On the single issue of health, the Government must stand accused of succumbing to the oldest vice in the handbook of political chicanery: "If you feel like lying, at least tell a big lie". The Government did this with gusto. It added zest to the lie. It told it up and down the country with a zeal and enthusiasm that would leave one breathless. We first had the health strategy, with its promise of capacity building. In plain language, this meant new beds, wards and step-down facilities with a price tag of €7.7 billion over the decade. A full €1 billion of this funding was to be allocated in 2003. The 14 November bonfire left only €3.8 million of this funding intact for 2003, a pathetic four cent for every €1,000 promised.The inescapable fact is that our population has increased with which comes additional pressure on the hospital system. To date, very little capacity has been added to the hospital system since the ill-judged reductions in bed numbers in the late 1980s. The health strategy promised an additional 3,000 beds, but there has not been any delivery or commitment of resources.What is the biggest lie of all? The answer – a permanent end to waiting lists in two years. There are only 534 days remaining for the Government to make good on this promise. The Estimates make it plain that it will not even make a start. The Minister said waiting lists would be gone in two years and that 200,000 additional medical cards would be issued. Instead we face the second increase in the threshold for the drugs refund scheme while the medical card commitment has gone straight into the bin. The Minister for Fin ance prides himself on low taxes, but by increasing the drugs refund scheme threshold in this cavalier way he has slapped a tax on family illness, wiping away in these two strokes and in the additional cost of health insurance this year alone many of the financial gains to ordinary families of his tax reductions in recent budgets.The decisions on education are completely mystifying. What is it about the Government that it can meet on a Saturday to make grandiose spatial plans about developments throughout the length and breadth of the country in a logical and organised way but will not guarantee the provision of new schools in the locations chosen as development zones? I cite one such zone on the edge of the constituency of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, where the Bacon reports suggested a high density housing zone, with which my own council, Fingal County Council, has gone along. It is proceeding with some 3,500 additional new homes planned for the area alongside the 3,500 built in the past five years, but when Fingal County Council approached the Department of Education and Science to nominate a delegate to sit on the steering committee for the special development zone, it met with a cold, negative response. There is no commitment to meet the demand for additional schools that must arise when homes are built in such numbers in a very short time. In fact, now that the Minister is abolishing the first time buyers' grant, he might give the occupants of the new homes a free placard because as sure as eggs are eggs, they will be out campaigning for their new school within three or four years of taking up residence in their special development zone homes. That is what the Government is doing. The shredding of the primary schools capital programme in the Book of Estimates can only confirm the misgivings of families in these zones, to say nothing of the wholesale deceit practised last May on hundreds of communities in relation to new and refurbished schools.There is a fairly nasty piece of political subterfuge in the severely reduced allocation to third level. The Minister for Education and Science has decided to get his way on third level fees by hook or by crook. There is a black hole in the Estimate in relation to third level capital funding and spending. By reducing funds for capital investment at this level and reducing funds promised for research, the Minister and the Government hope to promote a clamour from university and college heads for the reintroduction of fees by either the front door through fees or the back door through registration or other charges. The Minister wants others, that is, the heads of the colleges and universities, to do his dirty work for him. They would be fools to fall into his trap. Knowledge industries are the key to future industrial growth and a full, sustained commitment to educational access is a vital element in promoting  the image of Ireland as a suitable location for industry.There is a myth abroad, encouraged by Fianna Fáil, that these cuts are somehow necessary and that future economic prosperity depends on them. The opposite is the truth. The Minister for Finance stoked the boom and is now pushing Ireland deeper into recession. His stop-start approach is delivering not boom, but bust. These cuts will not just depress the economy in 2003 by shredding the national development plan, they also will undermine the basis for growth for years to come.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	495	With the publication of the Book of Estimates, the Minister for Finance has helped to redefine the up and down cycle we usually refer to as "boom and bust". That cycle can now be referred to as "splurge and slash". The Minister decided, half way through the life of a Government, that it was politically expedient to let go of any semblance of financial controls, let public finances run riot, allow Ministers to spend as they saw fit and ingratiate themselves with a voting electorate to gain the ultimate prize of re-election. As a political strategy, it was on the button, but as a way of running the economy and sustaining it into the future, it is something for which all of us now have to pay.The 2% actual increase in expenditure in the Book of Estimates, which is below the rate of inflation, is illustrated by a number of cuts. There are areas where the Government is proposing to spend less money in 2003 than it spent in 2002. The direction of these cuts underlie the philosophy of the Minister, namely, that those who should pay for his profligacy are the most vulnerable in society.The Minister has chosen to cut funding programmes and support systems for the most vulnerable. Funding for victim support is reduced by 5% and the Equality Authority will face a reduction of 4%. Funding for persons with disabilities will be reduced by 44%. Anti-racism programmes will see a funding reduction of 57% and legal aid of 4%.The Minister has also chosen to undermine our future economic development. He has deemed that the building of economic intelligence and information is going to be less important in 2003. He has decided to reduce funding to the National Economic and Social Council and to the National Economic and Social Forum. He has decided that the Central Statistics Office should have a 40% cut just because there will not be a census in 2003 and as if the need to produce statistics concerning a wide area of economic life has suddenly  stopped. He has reduced funding for the Office of the Ombudsman by 14% and the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner by 2%.That the national roads programme for new roads is not proceeding to the extent that had been indicated is not something that the Green Party will shed tears over but that the secondary roads programme is being emasculated shows that in terms of travelling in and out of Dublin and around the country this Government has a very skewed sense of priorities.In terms of industrial development the Government has decided there should be less funding available. The funding for new buildings for industrial units provided by the IDA is to be reduced by 84%, or €16 million. Grants by Enterprise Ireland to indigenous industry, the sector of the economy which we need to encourage if we are to become more self-reliant, is to be reduced by 18%, or €14 million. Funding for the Office of Consumer Affairs will be down by 7%.Most pernicious are the cuts proposed in the education programme. Primary school building projects are down by 4%, or €13 million while secondary school education is to lose 10%, or €20 million. Third level and further education, the sector which brings back those who have been disappointed and let down by the primary and secondary sectors, is down by 40%, or €85 million.One of the anomalies in the Estimates is that funding for the Secret Service will decrease over last year but is a massive increase on what was originally proposed. It went up from €450,000 last year to €900,000. It is now being pared back to €850,000. Given the mindset of the Government and the wish to keep most of what it does secret, it is something I can readily understand.The most upsetting element of this Book of Estimates is that the community and voluntary sector has been assaulted by this Minister for Finance. Community and voluntary grants are down by 16%, or €5.5 million. Funding for social inclusion measures has been reduced by 6% while funding for the Western Development Council is down by 60% and for community enterprise and information technology for community groups is down by 84%. Funding for the money advice and budgeting service is down by 8%. In social welfare, family income supplement is down by 18%, unemployment support measures are down by 64% and the carer's allowance is down by 2%. This is a Government which says that not only did it make a mess of spending up to and beyond the general election but that it will not take the responsibility and the blame while those who have least in society can and will. This Government cannot expect support from this side of the House by engaging in such action. This country deserves better both economically and socially. It is the intention of my party to challenge a Government which sees these not as the essen tials of everyday life but as some type of added extras.

I would like to commend the Sinn Féin amendment to the House:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"condemns the 2003 Estimates for Public Services (Abridged) published by the Minister for Finance on 14th November, 2002, as a programme for cutbacks which:runs totally counter to the pre-General Election commitments of both the Fianna Fail party and the Progressive Democrats party;renders inoperable the Programme for Government, the National Development Plan and the National Health Strategy;will cause real hardship in the areas of health and education; and calls, in particular, for the reinstatement of the first time home buyers grant and the fulfilment of the commitment to extend medical card cover to an additional 200,000 people."The Government is asking the House to commend the 2003 Book of Estimates which has caused justifiable anger and outrage throughout the State. The Estimates represent a programme of cuts and they promise a budget which will totally negate the commitments made by the two Government parties before the general election. The Government has effectively torn up its own programme for Government, the national development plan and the national health strategy. It has flittered each and every one of them. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats misled the electorate before 17 May. I do not believe for one moment that the Minister for Finance, at the very least, did not have knowledge of the true state of the public finances. A memorandum proposing cuts of some €900 million was being prepared in the Minister's office and was issued in June, a matter of weeks after the election. We had forewarning of what was to come immediately after the general election when we compared the Fianna Fáil election manifesto with the programme for Government. One of the most significant commitments in the manifesto was the elimination, not the reduction, of hospital waiting lists in the space of two years. Between the election and the publication of the programme for Government, the promise was silently dropped. That was a foretaste of what was to come; we have the full menu in the Book of Estimates.The most shameful and disgraceful broken promise has to be the Government's reneging on its commitment to extend medical card cover to a further 200,000 people. It should not be seen  simply in the context of this year's U-turns by the Government, the annual roll-call of U-turns. Throughout the years of the Celtic tiger, people on low incomes who earned that little bit over the limit for qualification for the medical card had a right to expect that increased prosperity would finally allow the Government to extend qualification. Prior to the election they were led to believe that it might happen and now they have been betrayed.The Government is bragging about its increases in the health budget but the reality is that the 6% spending increase for next year is far behind medical inflation which is currently running at 10%. Health boards are already running over budget for 2002 and this will likely be carried forward into 2003. The drop in expected spending will cause substantial cutbacks in services and in jobs. Patients will suffer and sadly some might die as a result. The Department of Health and Children has confirmed that no new beds will be opened next year. We were promised over 3,000 new beds within the ten-year period of the so-called health strategy. The two-tier public health service is unreformed, inefficient and bureaucratic. It has never recovered from the cuts of the 1980s. The public health service is carrying the private system on its back. Now the Government has effectively binned its own health strategy.I wish to express the outrage of people at the Government's slashing of the first-time home buyer's grant. This is an appalling act and it must be reversed. It too must be seen in a broader context – the abject failure over five years of the Government's so-called housing policy. We have over 50,000 people on local authority waiting lists. We have young people taking on huge mortgages as house prices continue to rise despite the economic downturn. Now those people who managed to clamber on to the property ladder in the absence of proper social and affordable provision are to have this grant taken away from them. The already totally inadequate social housing programme is to be cut by 5%.The Government backbenchers who have gone on the airwaves expressing personal opposition to the removal of the first-time buyer's grant should put up or shut up and vote to reinstate this grant. This is their opportunity.The last Dáil saw repeated efforts by Members on all sides to press for real progress on the primary school building programme. There was hardly a Deputy that did not raise the case of schools in his or her constituency that were waiting years for badly needed new build or repair work. Some of these children are trying to learn in atrocious, Dickensian conditions.Again, the pre-election promise from this Government was that it would deliver. The budget would go up and the work would be done.  Another false commitment and another betrayal. I urge support for the amendment in the name of the Sinn Féin Deputies in the House.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	497	The Book of Estimates published on 14 November is outrageous, unacceptable and irresponsible. Some commentators have suggested that the Estimates are the result of incompetence or mismanagement or of some mistaken notion on the part of the Minister and the Government. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is a deliberate, ideologically-driven, right wing, Thatcherite policy undertaken to make PAYE workers, social welfare recipients and the poor generally pay for the huge transfers of funds that took place over the past five years in Minister McCreevy's five budgets.Huge amounts of money have been transferred to the people who were already very wealthy and who did not need it. The gap between rich and poor over the course of those five budgets grew by something like €390 per week between a person on unemployment assistance and someone on a salary of £50,000. The figures for higher earners and more wealthy individuals are much worse than that. So this is not in any way a result of incompetence or mismanagement, it is a deliberate policy of supporting the very rich as against the ordinary poor people either on social welfare or PAYE.Neither is it true that the Government found out about the financial situation after the general election. On 5 December 2001, the Minister for Finance notified the European Union of €900 million of cuts he was going to propose for 2003 as part of our agreement under the Growth and Stability Pact, so he was well aware of the cutbacks that he was proposing six months before the general election. However, he was prepared to go on record during the election to say that no cutbacks, secret or otherwise, were being considered.The electorate was simply told lies during the election, and this Book of Estimates proves the point. The health strategy, the Fianna Fáil election manifesto and the programme for Government are all in tatters. In relation to health, it has already been pointed out that we were promised an elimination or abolition of waiting lists within two years. Anybody who knew anything about the health service knew that this was simply unattainable, that it was untrue and that the people proposing it knew it to be unattainable. It could not be achieved without huge transfers of funds that were never proposed.Two hundred thousand people have now been betrayed regarding the non-granting of medical cards that were promised during the election campaign. Twice in six months the drug scheme has been changed to ensure that people will pay more for drugs – people suffering long-term ill ness. It has been said that there is a long-term illness scheme which covers drugs but there are very many long-term illnesses that are not covered by the scheme, such as asthma, and families are paying through the nose for drug schemes month after month.In my home town of Clonmel we have St. Joseph's Hospital, where there are patients on corridors, in beds, on trolleys and in accident and emergency departments waiting for hours on end to be admitted. The main roof of the hospital is leaking down on top of patients and staff. It was promised that it would be approved for funding this year but that has gone by the wayside also. We were promised that a 23-bed unit, the shell of which is in place in the hospital, would be funded this year to ensure that people would no longer have the indignity of being placed in beds on open corridors. That is also gone by the wayside.The radiotherapy service that we in the south-east are entitled to, and which was promised by various Ministers and Ministers of State during the election campaign, has been reneged upon as well. Various other aspects of the health budget, including disabled persons grants, are being slashed by county councils and local authorities who do not have the money and are not being provided with the money by the Department.The transport Estimate shows that there are huge cutbacks on necessary road works affecting constituencies like mine, where the Cashel bypass has again been put on hold. Huge cutbacks will decimate the maintenance and upkeep of regional and country roads. The Estimates herald the approval by the Minister for Transport for the closure of rail links from Limerick Junction to Rosslare and from Limerick to Ballybrophy. The €34 million flood alleviation scheme for Clonmel, promised last year by the Minister who sat here up to a few minutes ago, and which was supposed to begin in 2003, has been reneged upon. More people can expect to be flooded by up to four or five feet of water in their homes in future in Clonmel and south Tipperary.The education cutbacks are probably the most disgraceful of the lot. Young children are being taught in damp, decrepit, leaking, over-crowded and rat-infested conditions in schools. John Carr put it well when he said that we live in a country where a champion racehorse like Rock of Gibraltar enjoys better conditions than many schoolchildren.

Given those circumstances, basic facts must be faced. We either control expenditure, which will increase next year and we still have to take account of rises in social welfare expenditure, etc., or we must raise taxes. The third option – which I believe the Opposition would like – is to borrow ad nauseum, but that has two downsides. It cannot be done under the stability pact and those who borrow sooner or later have to pay back what they borrowed.

Nuair a tháinig mé isteach sa Roinn, ní amháin gur éirigh liom airgead a fháil do na bóithre áise ach fuair mé airgead do na bóithre portaigh, don athnuacháin baile, do na bóithre straitéiseacha agus do chéanna Gaeltachta. Beidh €10 milliún le caitheamh ar sin an bhliain seo chugainn. Ní raibh pingin á chaitheamh ar bhóithre nó ar infrastruchtúr na Gaeltachta seachas corr-ché anonn is anall nuair a bhí Páirtí an Lucht Oibre i mbun na Roinne.Tá mé bródúil as an rud atáimid á dhéanamh mar níl aon cheist faoi ach go bhfuil bun eagar na  Gaeltachta thar a bheith lag agus go bhfuil go leor le déanamh fós len é a thabhairt suas don chaighdeán náisiúnta. Tuigeann pobal na Gaeltachta go bhfuil níos mó déanta faoin mbun eagar le cúpla bliain anuas ná mar a rinneadh ariamh.Chomh maith leis sin táimid ag leanúint leis na scéimeanna a bhaineann le cúrsaí halla agus caithimh aimsire. Arís, creidim go bhfuil an ceart céanna ag pobal na Gaeltachta do shaoráidí maithe caithimh aimsire agus atá ag dream ar bith sa tír. Tá na scéimeanna seo á riaradh tríd an Roinn seo, idir an scéim tithíochta, na scéimeanna a bhaineann le cúrsaí bunstruchtúir agus na scéimeann a bhaineann le hallaí pobail, mar déantar na scéimeanna sin a riaraidh tré mheán na Gaeilge. Is cuid den crann taca don teanga, atá go mór faoi bhrú sa Ghaeltacht, atá iontu.

Investment in the Gaeltacht is only an effort to catch up with addressing the lack of infrastructure there.

Faoi na scéimeanna chultúir agus shoisialta sa Ghaeltacht, íoctar na mná tí, scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge agus na scéimeanna sin, agus tá eagrú nua á dhéanamh agam faoi scéim labhairt na Gaeilge. Maidir leis na mná tí, is dóigh liom nach iad muintir na Gaeltachta amháin atá tar éis buntáiste a fháil as an scéim sin. Is scéim náisiúnta í a bhfuil meas ag pobal na tíre. Faigheann gasúir  ó gach uile ceantar den tír buntáiste as an scéim sin agus tá sé fíor-thábhachtach tacaíocht a thabhairt di.Tuigtear dom go raibh úrlabhraithe an Fhreasúra ag caitheamh anuas ar an laghdú san údarás. Ar ndóigh, tá athrú struchtúir á dhéanamh ansin. Trí bliana ó shin dúirt mé go mba cheart scrúdú a dhéanamh maidir le sealbhachas an údaráis. Ní fheicim buntáiste ar bith ag an údarás a bheith ina thiarna talúin gan brabach ag go leor sealbhachais a bheadh i bhfad níos úsáidigh dá mbeadh cuid mhaith acu in úinéireacht na ndaoine atá i seilbh na monarcan.It makes no sense for the assets of Údarás na Gaeltachta to be tied up in that organisation when some units could be strategically sold to the occupier who would then have the value of the asset as security. I decided three years ago that a much more dynamic approach should be taken to Údarás na Gaeltachta financing. I have no doubt that, by the end of next year, there will be more development in the Gaeltacht with the budget I allocated because of the structural changes I have put in place than will have happened even this year with record funding.I wish to refer to the community development support programme and the partnerships. There is enough money in the fund to implement the full range of existing programmes. The White Paper commitments will be spread over a slightly longer period and there will not be the same rate of growth as previously. The provision for the Western Development Commission is based on the likely demand because this year it was not able to spend the money given to it. I see no point in the Minister allocating—

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	526	These Estimates and the spending cuts planned under them are not only intolerable, they are inexplicable. Not one economic commentator much less political party suggested that cuts of such an order of magnitude were necessary or desirable. Everybody who spoke in advance of the Estimates maintained that infrastructure spending and capital investment should be maintained to ensure we sustain competitiveness and keep jobs and to give us the ability to grow in the future, yet inexplicably the  Minister targeted infrastructure spending for the biggest cuts of all, guaranteeing job losses in the short-term and inhibiting growth and the creation of jobs in the future. The job losses will be greatest in the construction industry where only a few months ago, the Minister and other Ministers told the construction industry to gear up for the big spend under the national development plan.At a time when he should be priming the economy which, as a previous speaker said, is slowing down, the Minister is engaging in pro-cyclical policies, in addition to policies which are taking huge sums of money out of the economy such as the savings scheme and the national pension fund. Either the Minister wants to plunge the economy into outright recession or he is so concerned with his image that he will go to almost any lengths to prove he is a man capable of making hard decisions no matter what the consequences. Nobody ever doubted the Minister's ability to make hard decisions but we doubted his ability to make wise decisions.Fine Gael demanded the Minister rein in current spending. We demanded evaluation and reform of structures and spending programmes. We demanded value for money and efficiencies. We demanded an end to the unplanned and untargeted incremental spending we have seen in recent years without any evaluation of the outcome of that spending, except perhaps an electoral evaluation. What we got instead were savage and equally unplanned and inefficient across-the-board spending cuts in virtually every programme. The irony of all this is that these cuts will not save money. Instead, they will increase inefficiency and, ultimately, they will be seen as an even more reprehensible waste of money. The overheads will not change and bureaucracies and structures will stay in place. All that will happen is that services to the public will be cut across the board. Local authorities will have JCBs sitting in depots rusting and engineers will be twiddling their thumbs in offices around the country, all for the want of a ha'p'orth of tar. There will not be money for materials to do essential repair work and this will result in bigger bills further down the road.Nowhere will the service cuts be more severely felt than in the health service. Maybe one can postpone repairs to roads for a little while, but one cannot postpone repairs to people. If there must be health cuts, one must plan them in such a way that at least they have the merit of achieving value for money, but there has been no attempt to do that. Instead, we will have hospital labs with expensive equipment and idle staff but no supplies. Theatres will close down for the want of essential, although minor, repairs. Social workers will sit in offices because they will have no petrol allowances. I could go on, but what it boils down to is that not only will the health ser vice become more inefficient, there has been no attempt to establish priorities to protect the sickest and the most vulnerable people. The budget for acute hospitals has been savaged. The place where acutely ill people who are in a crisis go for treatment has been targeted for massive cuts. I do not think people realise how big the cuts will be. The Minister for Health and Children will not be worried about patients on hospital trolleys in corridors this time next year because they will not get as far as the corridors. They will be out on the streets because by this time next year hospital budgets will be non-existent and hospitals will have to embark on massive borrowing or will have to close their doors.I would like to share a story with the House because it epitomises what is happening in the community to our sickest, most vulnerable and dependent people. I came across this case yesterday which concerns a mother suffering from multiple sclerosis who is confined to a wheelchair, whose husband is dead and who has a 14 year old daughter in school. Until recently she was lucky enough to have the services of a community employment scheme care attendant. When the scheme ended she applied for a home help. The reply from the health board was that it could give her a home help for two hours per week. That was all it had funding for. However, as she has a 14 year old daughter, it was expected that she would be able to care for her mother. Does that not say it all about the kind of society the Government has overseen in post-Celtic tiger Ireland? Obscene as that story is, we will hear many more such stories before this year is out if the spending cuts go ahead as planned.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	527	The cutbacks contained in the Book of Estimates are shocking by any standards but when viewed in the context of the healthy state of the Exchequer only six months ago, they are brutal and shocking. This Book of Estimates was born out of lies and deception, with breathtaking acrobatic reverse somersaults which would do justice to Olympic gymnasts. It is a remarkable turn-around by any standard. The question on everybody's mind is, how could Exchequer funding go so dramatically wrong in six months? People cannot accept it because they know it is not right. The question being asked in every pub is, where did the missing millions go? Nobody has answered that question in this debate so far. How could the Taoiseach promise 200,000 people six months ago that they would get a medical card but so cruelly dash their hopes last Thursday? How can a Government or its Deputies face school managers, school children and parents and tell them their schools will not be refurbished for another five years after what they heard at the last general election? I could go on and on but I do not have the time.Cuts in respect of the farming community amount to 30%. The enterprise section, the Western Development Commission, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and anybody who might create a job face cuts. That makes a mockery of what the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, tried to tell us earlier.There are, however, other projects buried in the Book of Estimates which will not come to light until prised out of the Government. One such project is the new community hospital in Tuam. An undertaking was given by the Taoiseach in my presence and that of 300 others before the general election that it would be funded in 2003. Last Thursday and Friday, yesterday and today I made several telephone calls to the office of the Minister for Health and Children. As an elected Member of this House, I expect to be told by the relevant Department what is or is not in the Book of Estimates. I did not get an answer to any question I asked. I tried to raise the matter in the House today but was prevented from doing so as it is against the rules of the House. We talk about open government, but the Government is not open. Either the money has not been allocated or there is a skirmish going on behind the scenes to try to save the backbenchers from east Galway by coming up with a story. The Western Health Board does not know whether there is funding for this hospital. Irrespective of what party is in Government, a Member of this House should have access to public documents. The Book of Estimates is a public document and I am entitled to know its finer details. I have been refused that information on no fewer than seven occasions. I am going to keep at it until I find out whether or not the Government has reneged on another promise.

The global economy is in recession. World economic growth has faltered and the days of double digit growth have passed. Yesterday the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, admitted that his country's economic prospects were not promising and that he expected no improvement in the short term. On Friday the head of the International Monetary Fund warned that the global economy is in a difficult situation, that growth over the coming months was set to be slower than expected. The US economy is expected to grow at just 1% in the current quarter. The Italian economy will grow by just 0.6 % this year. Plainly, this is not  the time to back the policies of punitive taxation, massive borrowing and permanent deficits. Yet these are the concomitants of the policies advanced by the Opposition, paying lip service to the notion that spending must be reined in while at the same time criticising every cut in spending. This is the shallow double-think which plunged the country into depression in the 1980s, and which guides Opposition policy today.The last time Fine Gael was directly elected to office was 1982. Just four years later we had the highest debt-per-head in the world. A quarter of a million people were unemployed. Some 40,000 people a year were emigrating. This was achieved with the help of the Labour Party. It is evident that they have learned nothing. Plainly, the party which would spend €400 million compensating taxi drivers; spend millions more on Eircom shareholders; lay off 40,000 public servants and introduce a new 30% tax rate is not the party to lecture the House on fiscal rectitude.

The last time the Deputy was in Government, she gave the poor a £1.50 increase in the old age pension. The Deputy should not lecture me. She also gave a monthly increase of £1 for child benefit. The Deputy was a member of the party responsible for it.On 26 April, at the outset of the election campaign, I set out my agenda.

I further asserted that we could not go back to the era of high borrowing which only ensures a real deterioration in the national finances and contributes to economic instability. We could not tax and spend our way to providing more employment and better services – as the Labour Party was telling us it would do, if returned to office. This is the stance which underlined our approach to the general election and it underlined our  thinking regarding the Estimates. It will ensure that Ireland does not return to a 1980s-style borrowing spiral, by following the tax and spend policies which the parties opposite desire, particularly, the Labour Party. In light of budgetary constraints we simply have to prioritise – there is no realistic or sensible alternative.

That is the simple maths of the matter. Despite all this, the current and capital gross allocation for 2003 will be nearly double the amount spent in 1997. There can be few instances where modern western governments have managed such an increase, a doubling of expenditure across the board in five or six years. The health spend is up by €4.6 billion.

In the other areas of my Department huge progress will be made in 2003; more than €32 million will be invested in broadband infrastructure, completing private sector projects and beginning work on the new local authority metropolitan area networks.Deputy Crawford, who is sitting opposite, will be delighted to hear that Monaghan, Cavan and Louth will be recipients of much of the spend next year and the following year, in regard to broadband. He need not go back home and claim credit for it either.

Some large projects on which we embarked over the past two years, such as the new marine research vessel, are reaching completion. The economy is still growing but at a slower pace so spending too must slow. It is the only tenable approach to the present difficulties. It is the approach which we adopted in 1987, which built the Celtic tiger. It is the right approach today as well.The parties opposite argue that we squandered the boom, that we spent too much. Were we wrong to increase social welfare payments above the rate of inflation? There were record increases in old age pensions above the growth rate of the average industrial wage and far above anything ever even conceived by the parties opposite, particularly the party of the so-called left. Were we were wrong to take 380,000 taxpayers from the tax net; to pursue the policies which provided 370,000 jobs; to provide the infrastructure we put in place over the past five years; and to build the pensions fund – which the Labour Party wanted to raid, in order to spend today?

It was spent on jobs, pensions, infrastructure and prosperity. The paucity of policy on the benches opposite is underlined by the fact that, at the same time, the Government is being criticised for having spent too much and for not spending enough. In reply to the accusation that the Government has spent too much, the parties opposite have been challenged, time and again this past week, to outline where they would make cutbacks. In reply to the accusation that the Government is spending too little, the parties opposite have been challenged to outline the borrowing and the tax increases which they would implement. They have shirked and shied away and we still await their answer. We have not had replies from either leader of the main Opposition parties.Ireland is suffering the effects of a global economic slowdown. Tax revenue targets are down right across Europe and the US. Although economically we are suffering less than our European neighbours, we are suffering all the same. We have to accept this challenge and manage the economy accordingly in a way which is sustainable and beneficial in the long-term. Our growth rates remain a multiple of the EU average. I was in Portugal last week and both the  Prime Minister and President said that they would like to have the same problems as Ireland. It is way above the EU Stability and Growth Pact. That is the legacy of the previous five years. We have maintained jobs, pensions, infrastructure and prosperity. We are well placed to ride out the current challenges.The Government was re-elected on the basis of its economic record. No Government has made and spread wealth to the same extent. It is imperative that we accept short-term pain for long-term gain. The alternatives are depressing as any of us who were around when Fine Gael and Labour were in power will be aware. There is Sinn Féin economics, which comprise naive mingling of pre-Whitaker protectionism and secondary school Marxism, or the Labour and Fine Gael economic option, which offers only a return to the 1980s.The Fianna Fáil general election manifesto, which was held aloft earlier by Deputy Burton, states:We believe that the clear and obvious lesson of the times that Ireland has left behind is that we cannot tax and spend our way to employment and better services. In fact, the surest way to cause unemployment and undermine the public finances would be to implement unsustainable spending plans or to try to return to the days of high taxation.This policy received a resounding mandate in the May election. The programme for Government reiterated that we would keep the public finances in a healthy condition. That is what we are doing and will continue to do. We will simply not allow the finances to deteriorate as they were allowed to do in the past. Writing in the late 1980s Professor Joe Lee, asserted: "It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that Irish economic performance has been the least impressive in western Europe, perhaps in all Europe, in the 20th century". Since 1987 that has changed. Despite the global economic downturn the economy is stable. Unemployment is low while growth is relatively high and the economic fundamentals are sound. It is our job to keep it that way and Fianna Fáil will ensure that is the case in years to come.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Exactly. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs asked us to face reality. However, part of the problem is that some of us faced reality and did not make promises that could not be delivered. For example, 5,000 FÁS workers face a sad Christmas following the reduction in community employment scheme places. These are people on the lowest rung of the employment ladder who had a slight hope of gaining full-time employment. Funding for flood relief was reduced in the Book of Estimates by 99%, yet when the Taoiseach walked around Drumcondra on Friday morning he announced an immediate U-turn. A similar U-turn did not take place when farms in the Shannon Basin and County Monaghan were flooded and animals were kept indoors for months.The Ombudsman's budget was cut by 14%, yet salaries for those working for the planning tribunal were increased by 125% because the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform made sure he looked after his own. Funding for regional county roads was reduced by 27% while funding for urban regeneration was reduced by 59%. The message being sent to rural Ireland is there will be no bypasses built in areas like my own.Our economic position has changed dramatically over the past few months but while the Government was aware there was a downturn, the Minister for Finance said there was no danger and there would be no cutbacks or adjustments. The allocation to community and voluntary services has been reduced by 16% while the funding of CLÁR has been cut by 25% even though it was promised that its allocation was guaranteed for two years. The western development fund has been cut by 68% while the farm assist scheme was also hit. There was a major information deficit in regard to this scheme, resulting in farmers not knowing about it, yet no increase has been provided in the Book of Estimates.The funding for family income supplement has been reduced by 18% while employment support services funding is down 31%. Will the Book of Estimates prop up the underdogs in society? The allocation for forestry has been reduced by 22%. Does that mean there will be no more planting this year? We were informed yesterday that young saplings would be burnt off. The funding for Teagasc, the advice service for farmers, has been cut by 13% while Bord Bia's support has also been cut by 13%. Funding for REPS, a scheme in which farmers placed a great deal of hope to help them run efficient, environmentally friendly farms, has decreased by 19%. This is some message for rural Ireland. Even the money available for the farm retirement pension has been cut by 5%.However, the worst measure that has been taken in regard to rural Ireland is the 44%  reduction in funding for agricultural development under the national development plan. The Minister for Agriculture and Food, who has the proud record of closing five agricultural colleges in three years, is—

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	568	The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources stated that the Government made and spread wealth, but it will be remembered as disappearing wealth. That is why we are facing major cutbacks. I am worried about value for money, not spending money without getting results.Is it possible the post of Minister of Finance is the only job one can hold where if one gets it wrong, one is allowed to publish a Book of Estimates which robs certain sections of the community of their basic human rights to make up  for one's short-sightedness and mismanagement? The Minister has misused his position of power and blatantly promoted self-gain for himself and his political party. When he misled or misread the public finances, he decided to rob Peter to pay Paul. We have a duty to look after the people, but the Government has not done so.We all have the right to expect decent health care and to expect our children to be educated in their communities in a heated, well-equipped classroom and not stand in line waiting for a chair, never mind a suitable classroom, whether we are rich or poor. There are many people in my constituency and throughout the country who cannot attend local schools because they have not been built. There is a shortage of schools, the schools that have been built are falling apart and prefabricated units are used instead. Despite this, the funding for schools building projects has been cut. That will do nothing to resolve the problem.The Book of Estimates is a bloody disgrace and we are having this debate as a result of the mismanagement of the public finances. It is a blatant attempt to keep the better off section of the electorate happy. They have been targeted at the expense of the needy, poor and sick and the education of our children. Do not misunderstand me. One cannot spend what one does not have. The figures printed in the Estimates are probably the most this country can afford at present without admitting that we have to borrow. How in God's name have we arrived at this financial situation? That is what really gets up my nose.Why did first-time buyers have to suffer the loss of their grant when certain sections of our population, who directly benefited from our over-spending policy, could afford to give something back? Why must we hand over millions to the health service? I have no problem with giving millions to the health service but why do we have to do it? That service has been given "millions and millions", in the words of the Minister for Finance, since 1997. Why must we still do it? It is because we did not get value for money. Millions were squandered with no results. We have seen nothing for them.The Minister said during the week that he is only paid to do one job, that of Minister for Finance. Surely, however, his conscience should not allow him to hand over such vast sums of money to Departments which have either, according to himself, been mismanaged or incompetent. It must be part of his brief to have some form of control over the money he is dishing out. It is a pity the Minister did not take the advice he offered when introducing the special savings scheme. The intent of the scheme was to encourage individuals to save over a period of time. Why did the Minister not adopt the same policy, which he preached so well over the national airwaves, when dealing with the country's finances? Did he not know about economic ups and downs? They  happen all the time. That is what economics is about. One cannot be riding high for five years and expect nothing to happen afterwards.Why are we squandering money on foreign exchange? According to reports, the pensions fund has lost about €1 billion since it was established. Why are we doing this? Again, it is mismanagement of money, throwing good money after bad. That money should be invested in infrastructure which would give a return and provide for pensions in the future. If we had committed even a small portion of the national GDP into savings instead of trying to buy the last election, the Estimates would read differently today. The Estimates only deal with expenditure. What will happen with the money that is due to come into the Exchequer?These Estimates are the attempt of an accountant with an abacus to balance the nation's books when the country clearly needs a statesman and a man of vision. The cutbacks in the capital expenditure programme are so criminally wrong it is a pity they cannot be referred to a court. What sort of country will we have if we do not invest properly in it? The Taoiseach claimed today that we are spending more money on infrastructure than most of the countries in Europe. He appears not to realise that we are way behind other countries in terms of infrastructural development. We have much ground to cover.An article in one of the national newspapers some weeks ago drew a comparison between how much it cost to build two kilometres of road, a bridge or a tunnel in Ireland with the cost in the rest of Europe. There was a big difference. It is millions of euro. It is no big deal to say more money is being spent in this country. What matters is results. We are not getting them and these Estimates will not help us get them.

Much of the focus has been on those areas where priorities have been re-examined and the Government has adjusted the profile of spending to reflect those priorities. While the Government has had to make choices in relation to spending programmes and the timing of its commitments, it is noteworthy that in the past number of years there has been a huge increase in the level of State resources across a range of areas.There has been a significant increase in the amounts invested in our schools and hospitals.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	576	Considerable effort has gone into massive improvements in the level and quality of public services in recent years. The Government will continue to seek to upgrade our services and infrastructure over the course of its lifetime.One commentator has likened this year's Estimates publication to the first act of a two act play, with the budget as the second act. The truth is that the publication of the Estimates is but one further episode of a long running epic in which the Government has managed to combine reduced taxation with improved services and the commitment of much needed resources dedicated to modernising the country's infrastructure.As my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has announced, next year's spending will be over €31 billion compared to €17 billion in 1997. If we focus on the recently published Estimates alone, we lose sight of the massive increases in resources the Government has put into improving the level and range of public services. I will return to that theme when I discuss my Department's Estimates. Before that, I wish to put the Estimates into a proper economic context.Economic growth in many developed economies has slowed in 2002 and economists are not optimistic about the outlook for 2003. This has led to budgetary problems in other countries, so it is not just Ireland which has been affected by the economic slowdown. Compared with what we have been accustomed to, the growth in national income will remain relatively subdued next year. The Government has taken this into account in framing the Estimates for 2003. There is no doubt that the worsening economic situation has made the Estimates process more difficult than at any time in recent years. Tax revenues have been lower than expected while spending pressures have increased. However, like any household  faced with changed circumstances, the Government has faced up to its task and made hard choices to get back to a sustainable rate of spending growth.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	578	The benefits of recent economic growth have been invested in widening and deepening the level of social protection which our society offers to citizens. Across a range of programmes and schemes, the fruit of our economic growth is clearly visible. The Government has massively increased spending on social welfare in recent years, from €5.7 billion in 1997 to an estimated €9.7 billion in 2003, an increase of 70% even before provision is made for rate increases and other changes to be announced in the budget. This rise in spending has more than outstripped inflation, resulting in significantly higher social welfare spending in real terms.

Pension rates for older people have increased dramatically. Significant increases were also provided in the rate of QAA for pensioners where the qualified adult is 66 years or over. As a result of Government policy, the personal rate of old age contributory pension has increased by nearly 50%. Widow's contributory pension for people aged 66 years and over has been increased by 50%.Since 1997, general social welfare increases have been well ahead of inflation. The personal rate of payment for most recipients has increased by at least 37% and the corresponding rate for a couple has increased by over 44%. In addition, the Government provided for additional special increases for persons with disability, such as a disregard of €120 of earnings for rehabilitative employment for persons on DA, blind pension and SWA.

This compares with an increase of 2% in total public spending—

By protecting the level of spending on social welfare, the Government has shown a clear sign that it is committed to building on the dramatic social progress that has taken place in recent years. Underlying this rise in total spending are increases across a range of spending programmes. Child benefit will rise by €100 million, driven mainly by the very significant increases provided in recent budgets, which apply for the full year 2003.

SWA spending will rise by €75 million due to a range of factors, including increased expenditure on basic SWA payments, increases in once-off exceptional needs payments and particular increases in the rent supplement. The increased expenditure on rent supplement arises both from increases in the level of rents and increases in the number of people claiming rent supplement.I have not had enough time during this debate to impress upon Opposition Members the value we place on caring for the underprivileged.

I raised the matter previously on 14 February and it appeared in the Official Report of that date. In his reply on that occasion, the Minister for Finance told me that "the project will continue to the preparation of tender documents and the invitation of tenders as soon as possible under the expanded building programme". He went on to say that the Department was fully committed to the provision of additional accommodation for St. Anne's school.The school is seeking two additional classrooms, a staff room, a library, a computer room, essential rewiring, fire protection works and the installation of a new boiler, as well as some outdoor works associated with car parking and a playground.After I raised the issue on the Adjournment on 14 February, the school management met the then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, on 19 February. According to a letter which I have received from the school management, Deputy Woods told them "I look forward personally to turning the first sod by the end of the year."  On 14 March, my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, for whom I have a very high regard, personally attended the school. She brought the good news that the Minister had sanctioned the school building project. I must confess I thought she was a bit like Neville Chamberlain coming back from Munich, waving around the Minister's letter of sanction. It was a case of "sanction in our time". In any event, she was given several rounds of bualadh bos by the assembled gathering in the school hall and  went on to be handsomely rewarded electorally in the subsequent general election. Unfortunately, however, the election changed the fortunes of the school because afterwards matters went distinctly cold in the building unit of the Department of Education and Science.

In the intervening period, the school management made a number of representations to the Department and the Minister. I raised the issue again in the House on 5 November and in his reply the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, said: "Later this year, when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 Estimates, I will be framing a further comprehensive programme of works that will proceed to construction, and the school concerned will be one of those considered for inclusion in that programme."  That is a considerable change from where we were almost a year ago when, in reply to a parliamentary question, I was told that the building project was part of the Government's programme and that it would proceed to tender stage.The parents and staff of the school have become so outraged at being let down by the Government on the commitments that were made prior to the election that over the past couple of weeks they have staged a number of public protests in the Shankill area. I am asking the Minister of State to respond specifically to what they are seeking, which is very simple – they want approval to proceed to the tender stage. As far back as last February, they were told that they would be enabled to proceed to tender, and were told by the previous Minister that he would be turning the sod before Christmas. They were told by the Minister of State that the building project would go ahead and, prior to the election, they were told that it had been sanctioned. I am asking the Minister to give them the go-ahead for tender and to proceed with this long overdue and necessary school building project.

At present, St. Anne's national school has a staffing level of a principal, 18 mainstream class teachers, two learning support teachers and two resource teachers, one of whom is shared and based at the school. The enrolment at 30 September 2002 was 504.St. Anne's national school's present facilities consist of 16 permanent classrooms, a general purpose room and ancillary accommodation. A project to provide additional classroom and ancillary accommodation, as well as developing an area of land to provide a car park, is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning.The Department of Education and Science has an extensive primary school building programme for 2002, which is currently under way. Details of the programme are available on the Department's website. Decisions on projects proceeding to tender and construction in 2003 will be taken in the light of the allocation for primary school buildings, taking into account the contractual commitments to be met on projects approved and the priority to be afforded to individual projects.The Department of Education and Science intends to publish its expenditure proposals for school buildings in January and the relevant schools will be advised of the position at that stage. The Department is fully committed to the provision of improved accommodation at St. Anne's national school. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity of outlining the current position.

The PNA has been involved in negotiations with management for over 18 months regarding the unsuitability of the unit regarding its overall size, the lack of a proper reception area and the lack of secure facilities for high-risk patients.Up to seven years ago those high-risk patients being admitted to the unit under Garda escort were being admitted under a loophole in the Mental Health Act, 1945. Arising from the death of a patient while being escorted to the unit, the Garda reverted to escorting patients to St. Finian's Hospital, Killarney, where proper secure facilities were available along with adequate staffing levels. This procedure was in place for seven years until two months ago, at which stage there was a change at the request of the Southern Health Board, I understand. Now patients under Garda escort are coming directly to the admissions unit for assessment.The unit is totally unsuitable for high-risk patients. Plans to extend the unit to include an observation area are now very much on the long finger and there are concerns following the publication of the Estimates that it may not be provided in the foreseeable future. The health  and safety of patients and staff are at risk when one considers the age profile of many patients. I am aware that the new psychiatric facility in Portlaoise, for example, would have an independent facility for psychiatry for later life.The dispute revolves around the fact that there has been no investment made in the acute psychiatric admissions services either from a structural perspective, to improve the actual admissions unit, or from a staffing perspective in increasing nurse numbers. The Southern Health Board management may claim that staffing levels are comparable with other admission units but this is clearly not so. There are 50 beds in the unit and until this dispute the unit was often overcrowded with 53 beds, while staffing numbers are 11 by day and six by night, with no supervisory post at night. If one compares this with the roster at St. Michael's unit in the Mercy Hospital, Cork, one sees the latter has a staff complement of 15 by day, with nine on long shifts from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. and the remainder covering activation and developing social skills in areas such as substance abuse and relaxation. These activities and responsibilities are covered by the 11 staff members in Tralee but from 6 p.m. the staff complement drops to six. These staffing levels need to be reviewed immediately.In the past week a commitment was made that a personal alarm system will be put in place within two weeks, which is welcome. A risk assessment procedure has been put in place and two clinical nurse specialist posts are to be upgraded from the existing staff complement. I understand it has also been agreed that if there is overcrowding, management will provide an extra staff member on an overtime basis.However, no financial commitment has been given regarding structural changes to the unit, nor has the board provided a timetable for the necessary training of staff in the handling and management of aggressive and violent behaviour, training the health board provides. At present approximately seven staff members out of 50 have taken the training courses.The inadequate staffing provision must also be addressed so the best service can be provided for patients. It is also critical that patients under Garda escort are assessed first in St. Finian's Hospital, Killarney, until the unit is made safe from the health and safety perspective and staffing levels are dealt with.This dispute must be dealt with immediately before it escalates into an all-out work stoppage which results in major hardship for patients and nurses alike.

The Commission on Nursing,  which produced its report in 1998, proposed a radical blueprint for the development of the professions of nursing and midwifery. The recommendations of the commission were accepted in principle by the Government and implementation of those recommendations is now well advanced.By far the most significant of these recommendations was the proposal to transfer the education of nurses into the education sector and the introduction a four-year undergraduate degree course. The new degree commenced in 13 higher education institutes last month.Recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives has been an issue of concern in recent years. Developments in relation to the education of nurses have coincided with a dramatic increase in the number of places available for nursing students. This year 1,640 nursing places are available, which is 58% higher than that available in 1999.In the case of psychiatric nursing there has been a threefold increase in the number of student nursing places available since 1999. While psychiatric nurses represent about 12% of the register maintained by An Bord Altranais, the number of nursing degree places available represents 21% of the total.A major concern of the Commission on Nursing was the question of professional development and career pathways for nurses and midwives. The commission recommended the establishment of the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery for the purpose of furthering the development of nursing as a profession with a particular emphasis on post-registration education and training.The commission also recommended changes in the grading structure and the introduction of clinical nurse-midwife specialists and advanced nurse-midwife practitioners. To date, almost 1,400 clinical nurse-midwife specialists and advanced nurse-midwife practitioner posts have been developed under the auspices of the national council. Of this number, 383 have been created in psychiatric nursing, and this represents 27% of the total.In accordance with recommendation 4:55 of the Commission on Nursing, a national pilot programme for the formal training of health care assistants commenced in November 2001 and was successfully completed in May 2002. The deployment of health care assistants will reduce the level of non-nursing tasks currently being performed by nurses and midwives, and will allow for the more effective utilisation of the professional skills of nurses and midwives.The measures that have been taken will transform the profession of nursing, and the high capital and ongoing investment in the profession must be acknowledged. In addition, significant pay increases have been awarded to nurses in recent  years, over and above those provided for in the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness.This is intended to bring to the attention to the House the serious commitment of the Government to the development of nursing as a profession, and to psychiatric nursing in particular. The issues in relation to the acute psychiatric unit at Tralee General Hospital revolve around security and staffing levels and admissions under Garda escort. The unit opened in 1991 and from the outset, admissions requiring Garda escort were brought to the unit for medical assessment. This practise was discontinued some time ago, following identified difficulties with the Garda provision of escorts under the Mental Health Act, 1945. This year, my colleague the Minister for Health and Children made a statutory instrument, S.I. No. 355 of 2002, designating the unit as a district mental hospital for the administrative county of Kerry. This enabled patient admissions under Garda escort to resume.The matters at issue as far as the Psychiatric Nurses' Association is concerned are security, staffing levels, employment of temporary staff and upgrading of staff to clinical nurse specialist level and I will deal with these issues in turn. In relation to security, management of the Southern Health Board has placed tenders for personal alarms which will be integrated with the hospital security system.The staffing levels at Tralee acute psychiatric unit have been kept at a level consistent with the needs of the service since the unit was opened in 1991. The Southern Health Board has informed me that it is satisfied that current staffing levels are adequate for patient care and safety and are comparable to staffing levels in other similar services in the region.The health board recently placed advertisements for the creation of a panel of registered psychiatric nurses to fill vacancies on a permanent basis as they arise. The director of nursing is currently in the process of applying to have two posts upgraded to clinical nurse specialist level. The industrial action being taken by the PNA has included temporary work stoppages and works-to-rule on certain days over the past week or so.Management of the Southern Health Board wrote to the Psychiatric Nurses' Association last Friday, 15 November 2002, setting out the actions it has taken to resolve the issues and inviting the union to reconsider its current action and to engage with the board to bring about a model of best practice in the area. Furthermore, the employee relations officer of the Southern Health Board has offered to have the dispute referred to a third party, provided the Psychiatric Nurses' Association suspends its industrial action. However, this offer has not proven acceptable to the PNA.I am sure the House will agree that all reasonable efforts have been made by the Southern  Health Board to deal with the issues raised, and I appeal to the union to take up the board's invitation.

Sadly, since I first raised the matter in the Dáil, Carolyn Swift has passed on. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to her, to acknowledge her contribution to Irish theatre and to offer my sympathy to her family and wide circle of friends.It is no reflection on the Minister of State if I say I am disappointed that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not find it possible to be here. The papers made available in January 2000 were a partial file of the matter dealt with in the case of "The Rose Tattoo". I ask the Minister of State to undertake that the remaining papers be made available, including those dealing with the Secretary of the Department of Justice, as will enable us to arrive at a final conclusion in this sorry matter.Carolyn Swift co-authored with Gerard Whelan a book published by New Ireland Press. She ends the book by saying:Our plea, obviously, would be for a fuller release of the remaining Rose Tattoo papers. If our scenario is even partly correct then the gaff in any case is blown. If it is incorrect, then the remaining documents will discredit with little difficulty.The book continues:This is all that Swift wishes for. Not apologies, restitution, explanations, honours or anything else. Simply an opportunity, if her own explanation of its roots is so wide of the mark, to lay the ghost of "The Rose Tattoo" case once and for all.I remember, as a very young person, reading about this case. My interest was in the Pike Theatre. Through my own associations I was involved with some people who founded small theatres in Dublin. The 1950s was an absolute barren place where all the shutters were down. I do not say we have fallen into any happy circumstance since then. The position of actors in this country is still a disgrace. When they go to social welfare offices they cannot have their occupation listed as one from which they are unemployed. They are regularly asked why they have not taken up such and such a job. The way we treat actors is a scandal and a disgrace.However, in comparison with that, what happened in 1957 was appalling. In the preface to the book to which I have made reference, Carolyn Swift wrote:Ever since the first policeman darkened the doorway of the Pike Theatre in May 1957 I have been asking myself the same question. "Why were my husband and I being threatened? Why were the full forces of the State ranged against our tiny theatre? Why were our lives being destroyed? Why "The Rose Tattoo" and why us?It is a matter of the utmost importance that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, even now, give the undertaking I have sought in relation to meeting the full requirement of the Archives Act and make all the papers available. It is also important that he reflect on the actions of the police, three of whom arrived in the theatre and gave evidence which later proved to be totally unsustainable, but not until Alan Simpson had been dragged through the courts. He found himself standing in the dock accused of indecency. In the history of theatre in Ireland and Britain this was one of maybe two or three occasions on which this had happened.Why had it happened? I have my own views, as a person writing about this period and lecturing on it. It was, after all, within six years of the debacle of the mother and child scheme. Many things were going on. A very interesting hypothesis is advanced in the book to which I have referred. People can read the book and develop it themselves. It might be less a case of the most obvious abuse of the church's position than the use of the church by a Government seeking to outflank right wing censorship forces which were being, perhaps, replaced in the censorship board.On 24 May 1957, Alan Simpson found himself in the dock. All the forces of the State were ranged against him. Think of the circumstance, for example, that because of a preliminary and not a full hearing, costs could not be got. He and his wife, who were already under terrible financial pressure, had to take the risk and discuss how they were going to afford to move from the High Court to the Supreme Court. It was too late to save their theatre or many aspects of their lives. It was an appalling abuse of State power and it is appropriate that, even now, it be acknowledged that the State's forces were abused.At that time there was not a theatre company in the world which would not have glowed from a positive review from Harold Hobson. He wrote of Anna Manahan's and Kate Binchy's magnificent performances. He spoke of the tiny theatre where people pushed together. A hypocrisy of the whole affair is that both before and after they were internationally recognised they had been feted by politicians who sought to meet them and shake their hands, and were part of the social life of Dublin. They were regarded as stars shining in a total bog, which was theatre in Dublin. This was a disgraceful episode. It ruined the lives of people and ruined a small theatre company.Will all the papers now be revealed, as Carolyn Swift has sought? Will, even now, an apology be made on behalf of the State for what happened in that appalling period in May 1957.

Eventually, after hearings in the High Court and the Supreme Court, the case was dismissed in the District Court.While Alan Simpson and Carolyn Swift were not found guilty of any offence by a court, nevertheless it seems to be widely accepted that the legal proceedings fatally damaged the viability of the theatre, forcing it to close within a few years. This seems to have been due to a combination of two factors, the expense involved in the drawn out legal proceedings and the unfavourable publicity resulting from the nature of the charges against the theatre.While I would not make any claims to be an historian of the Irish theatre in the 20th century, it seems to me that most people with expertise in this area agree that the Pike Theatre made an outstanding contribution to the development of theatre in this country in the 1950s by bringing before the public plays which they would otherwise not have encountered. These included both Irish plays of a new type, such as those by Brendan Behan, and international plays, and plays which could be said to fall into both categories, most famously Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot".I pay tribute to Carolyn Swift and Alan Simpson for their pioneering work in this regard undertaken in conditions, both financial and cultural, much more difficult than those similar theatre would experience today. Both Ms Swift and Mr. Simpson, I am glad to say, continued to make an outstanding contribution to the cultural life of Ireland in the years after the demise of the Pike Theatre. With other Deputies, I learned with regret of the death of Carolyn Swift a few days ago after a long illness.The recently published book Spiked, by Gerard Whelan with Carolyn Swift, states that papers released to the National Archives under the National Archives Act by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Office of the Attorney General provide a significant amount of new information on the case, although in their view the papers available in the National Archives are incomplete or papers have been lost over the years. As far as my Department is concerned, I assure the House that any papers in the Department relating to the case are released in full conformity with the provisions of the National Archives Act.

Only a minority of the population was living 45 years ago and an even smaller minority remember the events in question or formed a view on them at the time. It is almost impossible for us, in the year 2002, to put ourselves into the frame of mind of people in 1957-58. In saying this, I am not attempting to offer reasons for the actions some people took at the time. At the same time, I am not attempting to apportion blame, in so far as blame is to be apportioned.With the passage of the years and the gradual disappearance of those involved in the events we are discussing – both those involved with the Pike Theatre and those who took the action they did against the theatre – it is impossible to discover definitively why those who decided that legal action should be taken made that decision.

The action taken then would have been taken a few years later, but it is not possible for us at this remove to revisit the considerations which moved people to act as they did at the time.I think it is fitting that Deputy Michael Higgins has raised the matter here this evening and that, accordingly, the record of this House will note with regret the passing of Carolyn Swift. More importantly, it will also note the outstanding contribution she made, despite adversity, to our cultural life.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	609	In response to a parliamentary question I submitted to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in October 2002, I was informed there were 9,700 people waiting to have essential repairs carried out on their homes. I know from experience that some of them are waiting for well over two years to have vital work carried out.The most recent letter I received about the special housing aid for the elderly scheme was from a senior environmental health officer in the Southern Health Board regarding a constituent of mine. The letter stated that the Southern Health Board was operating the scheme on behalf of the Department of the Environment and Local Government and that all the 2001 funding received by the health board had been allocated. The letter stated that the application of the 80 year old woman could not be approved because of lack of funds. The only hope offered to the elderly lady, living in appalling conditions, was  that next year's allocation might be known by February and that she would be contacted afterwards with an up-to-date evaluation.There is such a demand on the scheme that the allocation made to most health boards was exhausted early in the year. The Southern Health Board had 907 persons waiting to have work carried out and an average of 20 jobs were completed per month or 240 per year. This means that the elderly people in Cork and Kerry can expect to wait between two and four years to have essential work carried out. The reality is that many of these elderly people will have died before their turn comes.In June 2002 there were 9,707 elderly people waiting for repairs, 1,183 in the East Coast Area Health Board, 1,077 in the Midland Health Board, 1,385 in the Mid-Western Area Health Board, 1,582 in the North-Eastern Health Board, 893 in the North-Western Health Board, 1,208 in the South-Eastern Health Board, 907 in the Southern Health Board and 1,472 in the Western Health Board.This neglect of the elderly is another feature of the hidden Ireland that Ministers who are insulated by the champagne bubbles and celebratory balloons tend to ignore. Added to the 9,700 applications under the housing aid for the elderly scheme, there are a further 6,700 applications with local authorities under the disabled person's grant scheme.I advocate that the Ministers for the Environment and Local Government and Health and Children get their act together and co-ordinate their efforts to have one authority administer an amalgamated scheme. It is cumbersome and inefficient to have health boards administering a scheme funded by the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The victims of underfunding and inefficiencies are the elderly. They built the economy and are now being told to get in line and wait their turn for help that would add much to their quality of life, help that will arrive too late in many cases.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I thank Deputy Allen for raising the matter and am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the scheme, which is one of the schemes run under the Department.The task force on special housing aid for the elderly was set up in 1982 to undertake an emergency programme to improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or unsanitary accommodation. Typically, aid is available for necessary repairs to make a dwelling habitable for the lifetime of the occupant. In 2000 the scheme was extended to include the provision of suitable heating systems where necessary to meet the needs of elderly persons.The scheme is administered by the task force, which includes representatives from a number of Departments and agencies – the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Health and Children and Social Community and Family Affairs, FÁS, ALONE, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and two local authorities, Dublin Corporation and Cork County Council. In the interests of elderly persons whose housing conditions are improved under the scheme, the scheme has since its inception been administered with flexibility and a minimum of bureaucracy. Over the years, health boards have, within the terms of the guidelines, evolved a priority list to ensure that the most urgent cases are dealt with as quickly as possible.The scheme is operated on the ground by the community care departments of health boards which use various mechanisms to carry out the work under the scheme, including contractors and FÁS workers. A grant-based approach is adopted in the operation of the scheme. The mechanisms may vary from one health board area to another. In the Dublin area, FÁS workers were mainly used, but that system seems to be very much in decline and it is being operated by other means. Health boards have been asked by the task force to use a combination of these approaches, with the most suitable being applied as appropriate in individual cases.Funding has increased significantly although the fund is still relatively small. In 1997 it was £4 million and this year it is €11.9 million. The allocations to the boards are determined by the task force taking account of the funding available. It is done not on the basis of a geographical spread of the population, but on the statistical returns received from the health boards. The health boards have a vested interest in putting forward the maximum number of cases. The scheme is regarded as very effective and public representatives always speak very highly of it. It is said that 47,000 cases have been dealt with over 20 years.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	611	The scheme is a good one but the problem is that there is not enough money.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I accept that. I am not sure if the scheme is dealt with in the same way throughout the country. In my city council area many of the things we would have tried to do under this scheme in the past couple of years have been done under the essential repairs grant scheme. I sometimes wonder if it was right for this scheme to become involved in central heating because in the Eastern Regional Health Authority Area this aspect has quickly taken up much of the funding. Perhaps the scheme should concentrate on the smaller things and get value for money. In some parts of the country the essential repairs grant scheme has been extended in tandem with the  disabled persons' grant scheme and they might be a more appropriate mechanism for getting the bigger jobs done.I will take a continuing interest in this area because traditionally the special housing aid for the elderly scheme was geared towards smaller jobs. Given the lack of FÁS workers to do that kind of work the scheme may have been extended to the bigger jobs, which is using up the available funds. Many local authorities have problems with the essential repairs grant scheme and the disabled persons' grant scheme in that they are not allocating enough money to them from their own funds. There is no difficulty from the Department's point of view, which allocates as much as two thirds of the funding. The funding allocation for next year will be approximately €11 million, which is much the same as this year. Funding for  the housing aid for the elderly scheme has not increased but it has for the essential repairs grant scheme and the disabled persons' grant scheme, which constitutes the bigger fund. Perhaps the mix between all three schemes is wrong and I will address that aspect.I question whether it is right for the housing aid for the elderly scheme to become involved in the bigger jobs. Deputies with their own contacts or who are involved in the task force may have a view on this. Perhaps it would be better to use the other two schemes for the bigger jobs and confine this scheme for what it was intended and what it was good at. I will consider the matter further and see what can be done.The Dáil adjourned at 10.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 20 November 2002.

The well is located in the Rockall Basin some 125 kilometres north-west of County Donegal and is the second deepest water depth in which a well has ever been drilled in Irish waters.The operators have lodged all technical data relevant to the well with my Department. This has been reviewed and assessed by the specialist staff in the petroleum affairs division, PAD, of my Department. The well has penetrated a substantial column of hydrocarbons. However, before the size of the accumulation or the possibility for any commercial development can be assessed, a considerable amount of analysis of existing data together with much further appraisal work on the prospect will be required. It is expected that appraisal operations will resume at the earliest possible opportunity during the drilling season in 2003. EEIL and PAD agree that while it is too early to know the full significance of the drilling results they demonstrate the presence of a working petroleum system and as such are encouraging for this well and for the exploration potential of Irish frontier areas.The operator has, with my agreement, suspended the drilling operations due to worsening weather conditions and the safety aspects of the operation. The operator has indicated that it hopes to resume appraisal of the find next year. Any meaningful report will require the results of that appraisal.The legislative basis for the State's ownership to any discoveries in the area are the Continental Shelf Act, 1968 (No. 14 of 1968) and the Continental Shelf (Designated Areas) Order, 1993 – S.I. No. 92 of 1993.

In fact, all decisions relating to the inclusion of areas in the general felling licence and the treatment of environmental considerations are the sole responsibility of the Forest Service. Coillte Teoranta is involved only in its role as landowner.The procedures in relation to the annual general felling licence are subject to ongoing review. The procedures currently in place represent a significant strengthening of the Forest Service controls in the felling area. Prior to 2001 inspections of areas covered by general felling licences were carried out subsequent to felling in accordance with the Forest Service's audit of felling. The changes in procedure in relation to Coillte Teoranta's general felling licence for 2002 were brought about in order to facilitate Forest Service inspections of silvicultural and environmental considerations at the local level in respect of each area on the general felling licence application prior to felling.The aim of the new procedures is, inter alia, to identify and to exclude areas considered sensitive by the Forest Service from the general felling licence procedure. These areas were to be dealt with under the limited felling licence procedure. However, it would appear that a number of such sites were in fact dealt with under the general felling licence procedure. I have asked my Department to look into this matter and will revert to the Deputy in due course.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	617	I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 84 together.Council Regulation (EC) No. 2978/94 deals with the implementation of the International Maritime Organisation Resolution A.747 (18) on the application of tonnage measurement of ballast spaces in segregated ballast oil tankers. The regulation aims to implement a resolution adopted by the IMO in 1993, the objective of which is to encourage the use of environmentally friendly tankers and the use of segregated ballast tanks in oil tankers. The regulation introduces a differential calculation system for fees for oil tankers to be followed by port, harbour and pilotage authorities in order to reach the objective of the IMO resolution.Under the EC treaties, regulations are directly applicable in all the member states without the need for any national implementing legislation. The regulation is binding on port, harbour and pilotage authorities within the community being the authorities specified therein. The Harbours Acts, 1996 to 2000, provide that a port company operating under the Acts may, in respect of pilotage services that are provided by pilots in its pilotage district, impose charges at such rates as are from time to time determined by it. Accordingly, in the event that any pilot is of the view that he or she is adversely affected by the application of the regulation he-she should refer the matter to the relevant port company. The objective of the regulation is to encourage the use of environmentally friendly oil tankers.I take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the Deputy the fact that the regulation is repealed from 31 December 2007 by Regulation (EC) No. 417/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council which deals with the accelerated phasing-in of double hull or equivalent design requirements for single hull oil tankers.Accordingly, the preamble to the 2002 regulation notes there are no reasons to maintain beyond 2007 the differential charging system for which the 1994 regulation provides.

I am currently considering the options for bringing the matter forward. The costs incurred by my Department relate to the work undertaken on the Department's behalf by a consortium of consultants led by AIB Corporate Finance who were engaged to manage the multiplex licence selection process.To date some €2.65 million in fees – including VAT – plus expenses of €113,000 has been paid to the consortium and €120,000 in fees plus – plus VAT – is outstanding. The consultants' fees relate to the period from February 1999 to October of this year.With regard to the costs incurred by RTE, the sale of the RTE transmission network and the costs associated with the sale process are matters in the first instance for that company. I understand from RTE that it has provided for costs of €11.8 million in relation to the potential disposal of its transmission network.

My Department's policy is to preserve the salmon resource in its own right and for the coastal communities that it helps to support.In recent years my predecessors introduced a range of measures to conserve salmon stocks including confining the drift net season to the months June and July and the introduction of a quota system for all commercial salmon fishermen. I have asked the National Salmon Commission to review the effectiveness of the measures in place for salmon conservation and make recommendations to me for 2003 and beyond, as they see fit.I can assure the Deputy that I will consider, as a matter of priority, any recommendations received for the conservation of our salmon stocks.

A number of seminars to support the early introduction of these new regulations have been held around the country.The maritime safety directorate in my Department has also recently prepared a consultation paper on the wearing of life jackets or personal flotation devices on small watercraft and copies of this have been sent to interested parties. Advertisements are also being placed in national and trade papers seeking the views of the wider public on the issue. The consultation paper is seeking views in respect of the adequacy of legislation regarding the carrying and wearing of life jackets or personal flotation devices – PFDs – across the board. The directorate wishes, in particular, to ascertain the extent of public consensus in support of the statutory obligation to wear life jackets or PFDs on pleasure craft in a wider array of circumstances than is currently the case, including on all small open decked craft and on non-mechanically propelled craft.The maritime safety directorate has requested interested parties to respond by 31 December 2002. I would encourage the widest possible participation in this consultation process and I will bring forward proposals for any necessary legislative change as quickly as possible following assessment of the public response.In announcing my review of safety on small craft, I also indicated that the enforcement of regulations would be a key component and work is currently under way on this matter.

I am of the view that the provisions which govern conservation in the Irish Box should continue after the end of 2002. It is clear that the Commission has been of the same opinion in so far as it did not envisage an end to the western waters regime in its Green Paper on CFP reform or in the proposals for reform introduced in June 2002.The legal opinion received from Council legal service at the end of October is contrary to the Commission and Ireland's previous view on this issue and in my view is incomplete and flawed. The Council legal service advice provides that the western waters regime expires from 31 December 2002. I will be contesting this advice in Council.I am also involved in an intensive series of meetings at European level to draw attention to the very serious consequences arising for fish stocks and for the Irish fishing industry if unrestricted access to the Irish Box is allowed from the beginning of next year. In the past few weeks I have met the Portuguese Minister for Fisheries, who shares some common ground with Ireland on this issue, and the Danish Minister for Fisheries who currently holds the Presidency of the Council for Agriculture and Fisheries. I also held a bilateral meeting involving the Irish fishing industry last week with Commissioner Fischler, the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Fisheries. At the meeting Ireland's case that the waters within the Irish Box are very sensitive and play an important role as nursery grounds for stocks in western waters and beyond was strongly made. The need to maintain and enhance going forward the current restrictive regime, which is fully justified on the grounds of conservation and rational exploitation of fish stocks, was strongly emphasised.  I will continue in the coming weeks to work to have Ireland's position on this issue fully understood by my colleagues at Council to ensure Council will be fully informed when this issue is considered by it in the coming weeks.

I concur with the Forum on Broadcasting's recommendation that the role of RTE as the national public service broadcaster should be reaffirmed.On how RTE should be funded in the future, I agree with the Forum on Broadcasting's recommendation that RTE should continue to be dual funded, receiving moneys from the proceeds of the television licence fee along with commercial revenue. I expect to receive a formal application from RTE shortly for an increase in the television licence fee and that application will be considered on its merit.

On foot of the survey of the River Robe carried out by the Western Regional Fisheries Board, which found that nearly 70% of the river as surveyed is now classified as slightly or moderately polluted, the board established a catchment management group to put in place collective action to turn this situation around. As part of this initiative, the board convened all the parties to agree locally based strategies for tackling the specific problems of the Robe catchment.The Western Regional Fisheries Board applied for €10,000 in respect of work this year on the Robe River catchment management, the allocation of which I recently approved. Applications for further funding for the Robe River catchment management group, as with all such groups, will be considered in the context of available resources in 2003 and forward years.

This advice involves wide ranging reductions, in some cases over 50%, in many of the whitefish fisheries of interest to Ireland. There are also large reductions recommended in the mackerel, herring and horse mackerel fisheries.In relation to the cod stock in the Irish Sea and the stock west of Scotland, the advice recommends a closure of all fisheries for cod as a targeted species or by-catch. In respect of these stocks it also provides that where cod represents an incidental catch there should be stringent restrictions on the catch and discard rates of cod with effective monitoring of compliance with those restrictions. This advice was reviewed by of the Scientific, Technical, Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, a group of independent scientific, technical and economic experts appointed by the European Commission. STECF noted that there is serious concern about these stocks and that stock recovery is unlikely unless stringent management action is taken immediately.

Cork County Council submitted three proposals in relation to coast protection works required at Youghal. It is proposed to carry out the works in three phases. The estimated cost of these works is €5.55 million.The question of funding works there in 2003 and beyond will be considered in the context of the funding available for coast protection works and overall national priorities.

There are concerns in relation to the legal aspects of this proposal. These relate particularly to the exercise of powers within areas under the sovereign control of Ireland and the efficacy of prosecutions in the Irish courts taken on the basis of inspections and detentions by the patrol vessels of other member states. Following careful examination of all the issues involved, I am not supporting this proposal. I consider that the most efficient application of control of Ireland's exclusive economic zone is through the Irish naval service which has the necessary powers under Irish law.I am very supportive of many of the other measures included in the Commission's proposals on fisheries control and enforcement. I strongly support measures to bring more conformity across the EU to sanctions being applied for fishery offences and for more co-ordination and co-operation in control activities between member states. I am also supportive of extending the use of vessel monitoring systems, VMS, and the introduction of electronic logbooks.Ireland has for many years been at the forefront in pressing for a more efficient and effective control and enforcement regime under the Common Fisheries Policy and an even handed approach to its implementation across the Union.As the waters around Ireland are rich fishing grounds where many fleets operate, the protection of fish stocks against illegal fishing activity is critical for the maintenance of Ireland's peripheral coastal communities, which are dependent on these fishing grounds. It is also critical that a level playing field applies across the community so that fishermen have confidence in the system. I will be working in the upcoming negotiations to agree practical measures that will achieve this objective.

The report does not mention the licensing terms for oil and gas exploration in any context, either in the main body of the report, in the appendices or in the statements made to the tribunal. Neither does the report identify any links between the individuals examined by the tribunal and the industry.The 1992 licensing terms and regime were introduced against a background of a steep decline in exploration activity in Ireland's offshore during the preceding few years. Ireland was, and is, competing internationally to attract exploration companies to our offshore area but unlike some other countries in north-western Europe Ireland has yet to establish itself as a petroleum province. Since 1971, 121 exploration wells have been drilled which has resulted in just four commercial discoveries to date: Kinsale, 1971; Ballycotton, 1989; Corrib, 2001; and Seven Heads, 2002. These figures show a success rate of one commercial discovery for every 30 exploration wells drilled. This compares with a UK success rate of about one in 12.

To this end, the directive agrees common criteria for inspecting ships which use a port of the Community. These criteria comply with the undertakings given by the authorities of the member states under the Paris Memorandum of Understanding on Port State Control. One of the directive's key provisions on port state control of ships lays down that at least 25% of the number of foreign ships entering the ports of a member state should be inspected.On 26 June 2002 the Commission decided to bring an action in the European Court of Justice against France and Ireland for their failure to enforce legislation on the state control of vessels in their ports in respect of the year 2000.Ireland's inspection rate has increased greatly over the past few years. Approximately 7.5% of foreign ships entering our ports were inspected in 1999, 14.6% in 2000 and a total of 21% of ships were inspected in 2001. In the year 2002 to date, 318 port state control inspections have been carried out in the State which represents an inspection rate of nearly 24%.To enable Ireland to continue to meet its port state control obligations in the future ten additional vessel surveyors have recently been appointed to the maritime safety directorate within my Department. These new surveyors are currently undergoing training. The directorate is also developing a management information system to enhance the collection of data required for improved management of our port state control operations.Port state control is a very effective measure in encouraging full compliance with international safety standards and I have asked the maritime safety directorate to give this work a priority. I am confident that Ireland will not only meet the target but will exceed the target of 25% in 2002.

It also recommends, where cod represents an incidental catch, stringent restrictions on the catch and discard rates of cod with effective monitoring of compliance with those restrictions. This advice was reviewed by of the Scientific, Technical, Economic Committee for Fisheries, STECF, a group of independent experts appointed by the European Commission. STECF noted the serious concern about the stock and stated that stock recovery in the absence of  immediate stringent management action is unlikely.There are currently no proposals from the European Commission for fish stocks in the Irish Sea. In the light of ICES advice and the STECF comments, the Commission will bring forward proposals in the next few weeks for all stocks. These proposals will be considered by the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in December. During his visit to Ireland last week I made Commissioner Fischler aware of the consequences such a closure would have for the Irish fishing industry, and he indicated that he was willing to explore other options which would allow a reduced level of fishing, particularly the introduction of fishing effort limits, days at sea. I consider that this tool is not appropriate for the Irish fleet and am pressing for alternative measures that will provide the necessary protection for these key stocks.At national level, the ICES advice and the STECF review of the advice are being examined. A recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, involving closed areas to protect cod spawning grounds and fishing gear restrictions, is already in place. This plan was introduced in 2000 in consultation with scientists and the fishing industry to protect and rebuild the cod stock. The catch by the Irish fleet of cod in the Irish Sea is relatively modest with a significant portion taken as a by-catch in the nephrops fishery. Ireland will be seeking, as a priority, agreement to a regime that enables the nephrops fishery to be maintained while ensuring that by-catches of cod are minimised. Proposals for 2003 will be considered in the context of the scientific advice and current measures in place under the recovery plan. In addition, there will be consultation with the industry representatives in order to determine a national position taking account of the imperative to ensure recovery of the cod stock and the needs of coastal communities dependent on fish stocks.

A condition of the current State aids clearance is that projects are selected by competitive tendering. I must therefore announce competitions from time to time to award support under the AER programme. The amount of AER supported capacity connecting to the network in 2002 is a measure of the final projects connecting under the AER III competitive round. This is not, however, a measure of market interest or support available.Since the AER programme was launched in 1995, five AER competitions have supported the development of alternative and renewable energy based electricity generating plant. Three of these competitions included a wind energy category. In all there are 17 windfarms operating under the AER programme. These windfarms produce enough electricity to power some 65,000 homes from approximately 100 MW of generating capacity. The target for the period 2000-05 is to add an additional 500 MW of renewable energy based electricity generating capacity to the electricity network. In the previous AER rounds planning consent was not a precondition and a significant number of projects declared successful in AER subsequently failed to secure planning consent. In the current programme, applications are confined to projects with planning consent. I am confident, therefore, the build rate among successful applications in the current programme will far exceed its predecessor.The AER programme has provided sufficient confidence to banks to fund projects up to 80% by debt and the number of projects successful in the planning process is growing all the time. Overall, therefore, I am satisfied the AER programme is a successful intervention in the market to ensure that projects which would not otherwise be built are built. Furthermore, I have stated publicly I will engage in a public consultation programme on all issues facing the renewable energy sector. This consultation process will open early next year. I expect to receive submissions on all topical issues including the strengths and weaknesses of the current support system and the merits of alternative support systems. Respondents will find I am open to persuasion on the most appropriate support mechanism going forward.

The application was assessed and prioritised by BIM for Exchequer and FIFG grant assistance in August 2002 to allow submission of the project to the aquaculture selection board for the southern and eastern region. The application is one of a number of applications to be submitted to the aquaculture selection board in the context of any further project approvals. A meeting of the board scheduled for October 2002 was deferred due to uncertainties prevailing with regard to the 2003 financial envelope for aquaculture development to be provided to the Department in the Estimates.Over the coming weeks the Department will be examining the extent of financial commitments arising out of grant aid awarded to date under the scheme and will also be examining the projected demand relating to prioritised projects in the context of available funding for 2003. Decisions in regard to processing third tranche applications will be made in the light of the outcome of this exercise. The processing time from receipt of applications by the agencies to the date of decision by the southern and eastern aquaculture selection board for the two tranches to date has been five months and six an a half months respectively.

This is a matter for Enterprise Energy Ireland Limited acting as developer for the field. My understanding with regards to the development of the field is that the pipeline works have been postponed pending a determination being made by An Bord Pleanála in relation to the terminal at Bellanaboy, County Mayo. The Deputy will be aware that I have given all the necessary permissions and consents for the Corrib gas field development in so far as my Department is concerned.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	657	The Common Fisheries Policy does not operate on the basis of national zones. The legal position within the European Community, since the mid 1970s is that all waters within 200 mile coastal zones are regarded, for fisheries purposes, as "Community waters". National 200 mile limits are, therefore, not used as a basis for compiling fisheries statistics or stock assessments. Catch statistics are com piled by all EU member states based on the statistical zones defined by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. These zones do not correspond to national waters or zones of economic interest but reflect the actual distribution of fisheries resources.The basis for firm estimates of the quantity and value of catches within the Irish 200 mile zone is not therefore currently available. The sea area defined by Irish 200 mile limit is encompassed within ICES zones VI and VII but these zones extend to a geographic area far larger than the Irish 200 mile limit. Some 40% of all catches in EU Atlantic waters come from ICES areas VI and VII and the proportion of these made in the Irish 200 mile limit can be estimated. This estimate relies on a number of assumptions about the percentage of each fleet's catch in ICES zones VI and VII which can be attributed to the Irish 200 mile limit and also on factors such as the number of vessels of all member states fishing in Ireland's 200 mile limit; the percentage of allocated quotas which each state takes in the 200 mile limit; the non-quota stocks taken in the 200 mile limit; the catch per unit effort for the various fleets; and information from inspections of log books and landing declarations of vessels. On this basis, my Department estimates that the value of the annual catch of Irish and other fleets in the Irish 200 mile limit is €1 billion. In 2001 the total catches landed by Irish boats was valued at over €250 million.In relation to the Irish Box, I am of the view that the provisions which govern conservation in this area should continue after the end of 2002. It is clear that the Commission has been of the same opinion in so far as it did not envisage an end to the western waters regime in its Green Paper on CFP reform or in the proposals for reform introduced in June 2002.The legal opinion received from Council Legal Service at the end of October is contrary to the Commission and Ireland's previous view on this issue and in my view is incomplete and flawed. The Council Legal Service advice provides that the western waters regime expires as from 31 December 2002. I will mount a strong challenge to this position based on the legal advice received by my Department. I emphasised to Commissioner Fischler at our recent meeting that the waters within the Irish Box are very sensitive and play an important role as nursery grounds for stocks in western waters and beyond. I will continue in the coming weeks to work to have Ireland's position on this issue fully understood by my colleagues at Council in order that they will be fully informed when this issue is considered by Council in the coming weeks.

I would like to thank the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, for his work in this area.Before the summer, the Government agreed a range of measures recommended in the Wilson report, including the assigning of a high ranking official of my Department to advance and monitor the implementation of the recommendations contained in it. In addition, in respect of the recommendations relating to financial assistance and as a variation of the recommendations contained in the report, the Government have agreed in principle to the establishment of a trust fund, analogous to the Memorial Fund in Northern Ireland, to address the financial needs of the victims of the conflict in Northern Ireland and their families in this jurisdiction. A working group of officials from relevant Departments have drawn up detailed proposals for the operation of the fund.

In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced in line with reduced levels of long-term unemployment and a strategic shift in policy in favour of training and other more appropriate supports. The average participation rate on community employment in 2002 is expected to be in the region of 28,000, with a projected year-end participation rate of 25,000. Funding available under the 2003 Estimates will provide for an average participation rate of approximately 22,000 in 2003.The Government is very much aware of the important contribution that community employment has made to the development of services for local communities over the years. In this context a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of community employment, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. The outcome of these deliberations will help to inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of community employment and the provision of community services.

The Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, is the principal legislation dealing with occupational health and safety. It sets out the responsibilities of both employers and employees in relation to providing a safe working environment. The Act applies to all places of work and to all employers, employees and the self-employed. The 1989 Act is supplemented by a series of regulations. One such set is the European Community (Protection of Workers) (Exposure to Noise) Regulations, 1990. These regulations, which apply to all workers, lay down certain standards and requirements which should be met in order to minimise hearing damage caused by loud noise.The monitoring and inspection of workplaces is a day to day matter for the authority in which I have no direct function. However, I been informed by the authority that their inspection and awareness programme will continue this year, and 125 inspections of places of entertainment took place in 2001. In addition, 24 improvement notices were issued and 42 advice letters issued. Furthermore, 93 premises had levels above 85 dBA and 62 had levels above 90 dBA. Draft guidelines for noise in the entertainment section have been drawn up by the HSA and are being discussed with the industry.

Over the past two years, the building has been marketed by the  IDA as a location for new inward investment. A number of companies have expressed serious interest, but as yet no project has been secured for the building. The IDA continues to promote the building in conjunction with the owners, Fruit of the Loom. The issue of sub-division has as yet not been seriously considered as any such sub-division would require either a private developer or a local enterprise company to purchase the building and carry out the necessary sub-division. This sub-division would be required to meet current building regulations which could require significant finance. A further factor which may restrict the site's potential for incubation units is its size, c. 64,000 sq. ft, which would require that there was sufficient demand for this amount of space if it were to be developed into incubation units.

The task force comprised representatives from IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, FÁS, the county enterprise board and Dundalk Institute of Technology. It operated under the chairmanship of IDA Ireland. I requested the task force to liaise with the public sector, private sector and community bodies which could assist in promoting Drogheda for investment and job creation. The task force held six formal meetings and was involved through its members in a number of initiatives and liaisons with other parties in Drogheda. A final report of the task force was submitted to me on 10 October 2002 and, acting on the advice of the chairman, I have formally dissolved it. While there is some confidential information relating to specific companies contained in the report, a copy without this confidential element, will be forwarded to the Deputy.The main focus of the task force was on attracting a replacement industry and the provision of assistance to the Tellabs employees to secure alternative employment. I understand that the vast majority of the former staff of Tellabs have now obtained alternative employment. I can assure the Deputy that each of the member organisations of the inter agency task force will continue to work closely with the local authorities and will participate with the chamber of commerce in a group to promote Drogheda for new investment and development.

Of these, 234 have commenced operations employing approximately 1,500 persons. The budget for the social economy programme in 2003 is €30.836 million, an increase from €20.55 million in 2002. This will be sufficient to fund commitments on the projects approved to date but does not allow for the approval of further enterprises. The next year will be a period of consolidation for the programme with a focus on enhancing the sustainability and viability of the established social economy enterprises. A review of the programme is being carried out and this together with the review of the community employment programme will inform the future direction of these initiatives.

However, the area found was only 14.76 hectares, a land parcel of 3.00 hectares was found to be a beach. This does not qualify as forage land and cannot be claimed as such. This resulted in an over-claim of 3.00 hectares or 20.33%. Under the EU regulations, no penalty is applied when the over-claim is less that 3%, the penalty is based on double the difference when the over-claim is between 3% and 20% and when the over-claim is greater than 20%, a 100% penalty must be applied. Therefore in this instance, a 100% penalty applies and no area based payment can issue to the applicant.

The contracted area in his plan was 24.89 hectares, 2.69 hectares of which was target area land. Under the scheme conditions then in force, payment at the enhanced rate for target area land was made on the full contracted area of 24.89 hectares. An amended agri-environmental plan was received from the person named in July 1999. In the meantime the scheme conditions had changed and the amended plan was subject to the new conditions. These conditions provided that only the target area land would be paid at the enhanced rate. The person named has, therefore, been paid the correct rates.

Since demand for reserve quota exceeded that figure, there were not enough  rights available to satisfy all applicants. Consequently, quota had to be distributed in accordance with the priorities laid down by the quota review group and EU regulations as follows: 5% of the reserve had to be reserved for category B applicants – farmers with holdings on offshore islands; 10% of the reserve had to be reserved for category C applicants – organic farmers; and the remaining quota was distributed to qualifying applicants under category A – first-time applicants under 35 years of age who, under EU rules, had to be given priority.As a result there was no quota left to allocate to any applicant under category D, farmers who required additional quota to ensure viability of their holding. Since the person named applied for an allocation of quota under category D, it was therefore not possible to allocate quota to him from the 2003 national reserve.

The legislation has its origins in the wake of the BSE crisis and the purpose is to provide assurances to consumers that bovine animals of unknown origin do not enter the food chain. This legislation applies equally to stray animals. Unless the origin of the animal can be established, the animal cannot be permitted to enter the food chain and must be slaughtered for destruction. Follow-up of reports of stray animals is a matter for the local authorities.

Data for the years 1990-93 is not readily available. The numbers of ewes actually paid premium normally represent 95% to 97% of those for which application is made, the difference being mainly accounted for by potentially eligible ewes dying before the end of retention period, ewes for which application is made not being presented for inspection, no ewe premium quota held by the applicant and penalties imposed for failure to maintain the number of ewes for which application is made.Number of Ewes Claimed on Under Ewe Premium Scheme 1994 to 2002

The commonage framework plans require a reduction of 127,325 ewe quota rights across the six designated counties. Allowing for the fact that a total of 106,720 quota rights had previously been frozen in these counties, the net additional reduction in numbers now required is 20,605.

Where a representative number of shareholders in a commonage do not accept the scientific basis on which the commonage destocking figures in the framework plan are based, they will have the possibility of putting their case before the appeals body. Some funding will be made available to appellants to enable them to have a professional assessment of the framework plan carried out. Pending the outcome of an appeal, the destocking in the relevant framework plan will be implemented.

I am aware of the contention that non-farming activities by other parties have caused some of the degradation on the commonage in question. However, these factors were noted by the planning team in its assessment. The prevention of deleterious actions by other parties is a matter for the owners of the commonage to pursue directly.An appeals process will be announced shortly under which a representative number of shareholders in a commonage, if they do not accept the scientific basis on which the commonage destocking figures in the framework plan are based, will have the possibility of having it reviewed.

All the technical veterinary issues to permit trade to resume have been agreed with the Egyptian authorities.The resumption of beef exports to Egypt is now a commercial matter for the industry. The recent introduction of a special EU export refund rate for Egypt which is 30% above the normal level, should be of major help in allowing Irish exporters regain a strong presence on this important market. This refund was introduced following strong representations to the EU Commission. I made it clear to the industry here that a longer term perspective should be taken in relation to this particular market in view of its importance as a major importer and that the opportunity now presented by the reopening of the market and the introduction of an exceptionally high refund level should not be lost.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	702	Moving to a system of calculating stocking density based on 365 days would involve establishing the tag numbers of all animals on holdings at any time throughout the year, looking at their ages and, in the case of females under two years, checking whether they had calved, establishing the number of days they were on the holding and attributing a livestock unit value of one to animals over two years or cows present on holdings for a full year or a proportionate part of a livestock unit for other cattle aged over six months. This exercise would involve a considerable amount of processing time for the 110,000 farmers who participate in the scheme and could give rise to payments being delayed with consequent irritation to farmers. As a result, my Department considered it prudent to retain the five census dates system with the improvement  of using the database to establish the numbers of bovine animals to be taken into account.I am conscious, however, of the possibility of census dates affecting the market and with the new flexibility allowed by the CMMS database, the census dates will vary to a greater extent than in the past. This will make it more difficult to anticipate them. EU regulations provide that census dates cannot be announced until at least two weeks after they have passed. The timing of notification of census dates can also be used to make it more difficult to predict when they occur.

He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department within 21 days setting out any facts which he wished to put forward to support his case. He asked for a review by letter dated 28 February 2001. His case was examined and the original decision was upheld. He was notified of the results of the review by letter of 10 April 2001 and was given the opportunity to appeal the decision to the headage and premia appeals unit. His case was fully examined in the appeals unit, where the decision to refuse grants was upheld, and he was notified of same by letter of 15 October 2001. At his request, his case was further examined at an oral hearing on 19 December 2001, but the appeals unit did not amend its original findings and informed him accordingly by letter of 9 January 2002.

In the short tax year 2001, that is, the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001, an individual whose income was £10,775 –€13,681 – or less was exempt from the health contribution. The taxpayer's income in the 2001 tax year was above the exemption limit. He was not, therefore, exempt from the 2% health contribution.Under section 11 of the Health Contributions Act, 1979, as amended, pensions paid by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and corresponding pensions paid by other EU member states are exempt from the health contribution. However, the exemption does not apply to occupational pensions. The taxpayer received a UK occupational pension of £5,573, €7,076.25, in the 2001 tax year. As this pension was not exempt from the health contribution and as his total income was above the exemption limit, he was charged £111.46 –€141.53 – health contribution in respect of his UK occupational pension.

It did not find that the charging of such tax was in itself contrary to EU legislation. In Ireland VRT is not calculated on the same basis and, therefore, this ruling has no implications for the Irish system.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	709	In the last budget I announced that the payment dates for preliminary tax payable by companies were being brought forward to one month before the end of the accounting period. This is being introduced over a five year transition period and will be fully effective for accounting periods ending after 2005 when 90% of final liability will be payable one month before the end of the accounting period. During the transition period, preliminary tax will be payable in two instalments, the first due one month before the end of the accounting period and the second within six months after the end of the accounting period. The amount of the first instalment will be: for accounting periods ending in 2002, 18% of the final liability, but in the case of a small company, the payment can be based on 20% of the previous year's liability; for accounting periods ending in 2003, 36% of final liability, but in the case of a small company, the payment can be based on 40% of the previous year's liability; for accounting periods ending in 2004, 54% of final liability, but in the case of a small company, the payment can be based on 60% of the previous year's liability; for accounting periods ending in 2005, 72% of final liability, but in the case of a small company, the payment can be based on 80% of the previous year's liability. In the case of an accounting period which is less than one month and one day in length, the first preliminary tax instalment will be due on the last day of the accounting period. In the transition period the second instalment should bring total preliminary tax payments for the accounting period up to 90% of the final liability for the accounting period.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	710	The new pay and file arrangements for self-assessed taxpayers, which were provided for in section 78 of the Finance Act, 2001, were introduced this year. They represent a major change in the arrangements under which self-assessed taxpayers file an annual return and pay the tax due. The new pay and file arrangements will bring major advantages and simplification to the self-assessed system and will streamline filing and payment obligations for the self-assessed taxpayers and their agents. They bring together into one date, 31 October, the payment of tax and the filing of returns. It means that preliminary tax for one year and final tax for prior years are being paid as one.For the current tax year 2002, the due date for payment of balances of 2001 self-assessed income tax was brought forward from 30 April 2003 to 31 October 2002. This was part of a number of changes involved in the move to the calendar year which gave rise to cash flow losses and gains in several areas in both 2001 and 2002. At the time, it was estimated that the change in the due date in the case of self-assessed income tax would produce a once-off cash flow yield in 2002 of €95 million.

It is tentatively estimated that the portion of this full year cost affecting the 2002 calendar year, including the impact on the first instalment of preliminary tax brought forward from 2003 into 2002, is approximately €65 million. The full year cost of introducing a 12.5% rate of corporation tax for profits earned on or after 1 January 2003 is currently estimated at €305 million. It is  tentatively estimated that the portion of this full year cost that will affect the 2003 calendar year, including the impact on the first instalment of preliminary tax brought forward from 2004 into 2003, will be in the region of €100 million.

In this context, tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. The basis for the current taxation of married couples derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy v. the Attorney General – 1980 – which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together. The tax treatment of unmarried couples who co-habit was unaffected by the Murphy judgment. Each partner is taxed as a single person and each is entitled to the tax credits and standard rate band appropriate to single persons.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	714	As of 15 November 2002, there is a total of 612 appeal cases, technically reviews, on hands in the Office of the Information Commissioner. The breakdown of these appeals in terms of the year of receipt of the appeal is as follows: 1999, 14 cases; 2000, 90 cases; 2001, 283 cases; 2002, 225 cases; total, 612 cases.Due to the introduction on 1 April 2002 of new working procedures in the Office of the Information Commissioner, it is not possible to give an overall average of the length of time taken to complete a review. All review applications received since 1 April 2002 are being dealt with immediately by the Office of the Information Commissioner. However, it is his objective to have the cases received since dealt with to the greatest extent possible within three months. Some 74% of cases received and decided since then have been dealt with within the three month period. Cases received prior to 1 April 2002 will continue to be processed alongside the more current cases, but it may take two or three years to clear the backlog. The Commissioner will, however, keep all his working arrangements, including those for dealing with the arrears cases, under regular review.On its establishment in 1998 the office had a staffing complement of nine. I have sanctioned a further ten posts in 2000, but the impact of this reinforcement on the arrears situation was lessened by delays in recruiting and selecting them, which resulted in the office not reaching its full strength until October last year.

Monitoring of the properties affected is ongoing and any damage attributable to the scheme will be made good. Liaison with the property owners concerned is also continuing on an ongoing basis. It is stressed that at no time was there a risk to public safety.The damage to the roadway and properties on John's Quay was brought to the attention of Kilkenny City Council at meetings of the Flood Relief Scheme Steering Committee on 1 and 19 August 2002. The steering committee was established at the commencement of work on the scheme and includes representatives of the principal stakeholders, that is, Kilkenny County Council, Kilkenny City Council, Office of Public Works, Mott MacDonald, Office of Public Works's consulting engineers, the fisheries board and Dúchas, archaeology, flora and fauna, etc. The committee has met on a regular basis, at least once a month and sometimes more often. At each meeting the parties present are updated on progress and areas of concern. Both Kilkenny County Council and Kilkenny City Council are represented on the steering committee by their respective senior engineers and the minutes of each meeting are circulated to both local authorities. I am confident the steering committee provides the most effective methodology for exchange of information and reporting on the progress of the scheme.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	716	I propose to take Questions Nos. 187 and 188 together.I fully support the Government position on the issue of developing countries debt and my address to the annual meetings of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund does not conflict with that. As co-authors of Ireland's debt strategy document, my Department was actively involved in formulating the Government position on developing country debt.Since the launch of the debt strategy, Irish officials have had consultations in Washington with the Bretton Woods Institutions. In addition, the debt strategy document has been forwarded to Ireland's representatives at the IMF and the World Bank in advance of the annual meetings of these institutions. We have actively promoted our policy internationally at both political and official level. The Deputy can be assured that the international community has been made aware of Ireland's policy on developing country debt. I draw attention to the Taoiseach's address to the World Summit on Sustainable Development where he articulated Ireland's policy in relation to cancellation of developing country debt.My Department, in close co-ordination with Ireland Aid, will continue to promote our views on debt relief in all relevant international fora. We will also continue to monitor closely developments in the HIPC initiative process and to participate actively in all relevant international meetings. Our debt strategy will guide us as we seek to ensure that the HIPC countries' efforts to achieve the millennium development goals are not inhibited by a continuing high level of debt and that a sustainable exit from the debt treadmill is secured.I remind the Deputies of the Government position in relation to debt cancellation, as stated in our debt strategy document. We have concluded that in principle the total cancellation of the debts of the heavily indebted poor countries is a politically acceptable objective and one that we would support. Total cancellation would, however, have to be funded largely through additional donor contributions. In order to mobilise the necessary funds for total debt cancellation, a greater number of donors, particularly the larger economies, would have to increase their ODA more rapidly and take concrete steps to meet the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on ODA.

In addition, the majority of its directors must be resident within the State and the organisation must have a permanent establishment within the State. The rationale underlying the requirement for a foreign charitable body to be established in the State for the purposes of tax exemption is based on the fact that what may be recognised as a charity in one country may not necessarily be regarded as a charity here in Ireland.

I understand however that Deputies who were elected in 2002 were contacted following their election and all who indicated a requirement were supplied with PC facilities pending completion of an EU tendering process by the office. The office intends to issue a second or upgraded replacement PC-printer as appropriate to those Members who require same and, in this respect, following EU procurement processes and approval of the Government Contracts Committee, contracts are now in place for supply of new equipment. The only supply tender awaiting GCC approval is for the supply of laptop PCs and the office understands this is being dealt with in the current week. All Deputies were issued with a requisition form for their new PC and printer requirements. Most Deputies have now replied and the first issue of additional equipment in respect of those replies received and clarified will commence this week.

In budget 2002 I increased the rate of excise duty on cider and brought it in line with that levied on beers. It should be noted that beer and cider are competing products. I have received pre-budget submissions about the excise duty on cider which will  be considered along with all pre-budget submissions. As the Deputy is aware, it is not customary for the Minister for Finance to indicate in advance what measures, if any, will be taken in the budget.

The review involves officials in the budget and economic division of my Department in consultation with the relevant officials in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. This matter has also been considered by the Tax Strategy Group. As the Deputy will be aware, this group consists of officials, advisers and programme managers from a number of Departments, including the Department of Finance. I intend to consider this matter in the context of preparations for the forthcoming budget.It is long standing practice that, in the weeks prior to the annual budget, the Minister for Finance does not indicate, one way or the other, what measures may or may not be included in that budget. However, in my first budget I introduced a major curtailing of certain reliefs relating to property investment. In subsequent budgets and Finance Bills, I introduced various anti-avoidance measures and I have not hesitated to act to counter certain tax loopholes when these were brought to my attention.

The dissemination of information on NDP investment is also part of the agreed provisions of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and is required under EU Regulation 1159/2000 which sets down the requirements on information and publicity actions for EU Structural Funds. These require that information and publicity on projects and programmes of interest to potential beneficiaries should reach the economic and social partners, organisations promoting equal opportunities for men and women and non-governmental organisations. Expenditure on publicity and information is eligible for co-financing under EU regulations.  The NDP information unit co-ordinates periodic information and publicity campaigns in national and local media providing details of projects, programmes, case studies and contact points for further information. Awareness research conducted and published by the NDP information unit earlier this year, a copy of which was placed in the Library, clearly indicates that people are interested in finding out about actions under the NDP and that national media and local radio are a preferred mechanism for receipt of this information.Recent national supplements and advertorials in The Star, Irish Independent, Sunday Independent, Evening Herald, Sunday World and Irish Examiner on the NDP cost approximately €86,900, although final invoices have yet to be submitted. In addition, an advertorial was undertaken in the Public Sector Times costing €2,000. A three phased regional advertising campaign on the NDP in local press and radio is ongoing. Phase one and two were undertaken in June and September-October 2002 at a cost of €237,885. Phase three will commence in January 2003 and cost approximately €130,000.In 2001 the NDP information unit undertook and supported through individual advertisements a number of supplements-advertorials in the national media at a cost of €95,977.66. Publications involved included Sunday World, The Irish Times, The Sunday Tribune, Irish Construction Industry and Inside Business. In addition to the NDP/CSF, information office publicity activities related to the NDP are undertaken by the various implementing bodies as required to ensure the successful implementation of measures under the NDP. Details of the cost of these initiatives are not available in my Department.

The scheme is operated by the Department of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The scheme provides for the issue of working visas to citizens of countries which require a visa to enter Ireland and work authorisations to citizens of countries which do not require a visa to enter Ireland.Applications for work authorisations for ICT technicians are accepted from persons outside the State only. Applications must normally be made through the Irish embassy or consulate in the applicant's country of permanent residence and applicants may be required to attend for interview. If there is no Irish embassy or consulate in the country in question, the application may be made through any Irish embassy or consulate through the applicant's reference in Ireland or direct by post to the Visa Office, Department of Foreign Affairs, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2, Ireland.An applicant for an ICT technician work authorisation should present a completed application form; a job offer and contract from an employer in Ireland stating the starting date and pay and quoting the employer's registered number for tax purposes and the applicant's passport number; a passport valid until the expiration date of the relevant work authorisation; two photographs; an application fee of €50 or equivalent and evidence of relevant third level qualifications.Outlined below are details of the number of work authorisations issued to ICT technicians by nationality based on figures provided by Irish missions abroad for 2002 to date:

Under the initiative the level of debt relief granted is related to defined debt sustainability criteria. These, in turn, are based on statistics such as debt to exports ratios. All of Ireland Aid's programme countries, except Lesotho, are classified as heavily indebted.By September 2002, 26 countries had qualified for debt relief amounting to $25 billion under the HIPC initiative. About half of this relief stems from a reduction in their debts to the World Bank, the IMF and regional development banks. The remainder comes from the cancellation of their bilateral debts to individual Governments. Almost all the major Government creditors have indicated they will write off 100% of the debts owed to them by the HIPC countries qualifying for debt relief. The debt relief granted to date translates into a reduction of 50%, on average, in the annual debt service payments of the HIPC countries or annual savings of $800 million.In July 2002, my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, launched a new debt relief strategy which had been agreed with the Department of Finance. This updates and develops the Government's position on the debt crisis which had been issued in September 1998. The strategy raises a number of concerns about the operation of the HIPC initiative, such as the adequacy of the existing level of debt relief and the projections and assumptions used in the calculation of sustainable debt levels. The World Bank and the IMF have admitted that between eight and ten countries emerging from the HIPC process continue to have unsustainable debt levels.

My Department has recently concluded consultations with trade unions and staff interests on the implementation of these measures. It is intended that they will be implemented at an early date.

At present, there are 51 pre-schools for Traveller children and children attending the primary school system are supported by approximately 400 special resource teachers for Travellers. Traveller children of pre-school age and in the first and second level systems are also supported by the visiting teacher service for Travellers.An Advisory Committee on Traveller Education was established in my Department in 1998. This committee is representative of all the partners in education and Traveller interests as well as officers of the Department. In addition, a senior official post has been designated within my Department to take a lead role in co-ordinating the development of a continuum of supports to facilitate Traveller participation in education at every level of the system.

One of the main purposes of the revision was to adjust the syllabus content at higher, ordinary and foundation levels to ensure they can be taught and learned in their totality in the time available for mathematics in the junior cycle and adequate levels of competence can be achieved by students.Concerns have been expressed about the performance of students in leaving certificate mathematics. Among the reasons cited in chief examiner's reports for low grades are poor levels of understanding of basic mathematical skills and knowledge. The step to remove choice from the examination papers in the junior certificate was taken to encourage full coverage of the courses. The change was made as a positive step towards ensuring that students starting senior cycle mathematics will have covered common basic material and will have solid foundations upon which to develop their mathematical competence.It should be noted that currently junior certificate foundation level students do not have any element of choice in their examination and all other candidates have a compulsory section on each paper that contains no choice. There is no evidence from students' performance in junior certificate mathematics examinations to date that those who have been afforded choice have used it to their advantage. In practice, many candidates have attempted all the questions on the papers. It is, therefore, expected that the decision to remove choice will not adversely affect students' performance or, indeed, their interest in taking higher level mathematics.The context in which this decision has been made should also be noted. It has been made in conjunction with other changes that are intended to make the examinations more accessible and attractive to students. The style of the examination paper for ordinary and foundation level candidates has been altered. Also, a new format has been introduced for all questions.

These bodies do not refer individual applications to my Department except in exceptional cases where, for example, advice or  instruction regarding a particular clause in the relevant scheme is desired. It appears no such advice or instruction has, to date, been sought in the case of the student, referred to by the Deputy. If an individual applicant considers that he or she has been unjustly refused a maintenance grant or that the rate of grant awarded is not the correct one, he or she may appeal to the relevant local authority or VEC.Where an individual applicant has had an appeal turned down, in writing, by the relevant local authority or VEC and remains of the view that the body has not interpreted the schemes correctly in his or her case, a letter outlining the position may be sent to my Department. Alternatively, as already indicated, the local authority or VEC may in exceptional circumstances seek clarification on issues from my Department. However, it is not open to me or my Department to depart from the terms of the maintenance grants schemes in individual cases.

A shortfall in her qualifications has been identified and she is currently in correspondence with the secretariat to the Secondary Registration Council as to how this shortfall can be made up.My Department has not received any application from this person for recognition as a primary teacher. In order to be fully recognised to teach at primary level in this country and, therefore, to be entitled to take up permanent posts, teachers must have undertaken a recognised primary teaching training course and possess a recognised primary teaching qualification. Such a qualification is usually achieved by a person graduating from one of the recognised primary teacher training courses in the colleges of education, including the postgraduate conversion courses. It is open to degree holders wishing to pursue a career in primary teaching to opt for the postgraduate diploma in primary teaching.

Primary school transport routes are planned so that no eligible child will have more than 1.5 miles to travel to a pick-up point. Pupils living off the main route of service are generally expected to make their own way or be brought to convenient pick-up points along the main route. Home pick-ups were never envisaged as part of the scheme, as the cost of providing such a service on a countrywide level would be prohibitive.The families in question reside 0.4 miles and 0.1 miles form the route of service to the school attended. As the service is within guidelines, it is not open to the Department to extend the service as requested. Provision has been made for parents to pay for extensions of bus services, where feasible, having regard to time schedules and avoidance of major disruption to other pupils using the service. Should the families wish to avail of this provision, they should notify school transport section of my Department.

In the circumstances, the family was informed that my Department is prepared to sanction a remote area grant, towards the cost of private transport arrangements to the school. The grant is normally claimed at the end of the school year. When claiming, a statement from the school authorities setting out the number of days attended in the school year and the number of days the school was open during that period, should be forwarded to the school transport section of my Department.

In view of the extensive nature of the programme, my Department has no current plans to start architectural planning for further major primary school building projects. My Department will review the position in the light of the allocations to be made for school building purposes and when all budget decisions have been taken by the Government.In the meantime, the school's board of management should ensure that essential health and safety issues at the school are attended to. It should, therefore, continue to use the devolved grant for minor works and if the cost of any works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the devolved grant, it may apply to my Department's building unit for grant aid.

This does not involve additional funding to that being provided under the NDP.To date my Department has received in excess of 280 proposals under both strands of the RAPID programme covering a wide range of activity. As the vast majority of these proposals were submitted after commitments had already been made in respect of 2002 funding, it has only been possible to support a small number of proposals this year. Further approvals will be considered by my Department in the context of 2003 budget allocations. However, there is already a very significant level of investment in the RAPID areas by my Department under the various programmes and schemes aimed at tackling educational disadvantage in the formal and nonformal sectors such as the home-school community liaison scheme, school completion programme, giving children an even break, third level access programmes, adult education and youth programmes.Tackling educational disadvantage is one of my key priorities. I intend to ensure that available resources are prioritised on an ongoing basis to target the most disadvantaged communities including the RAPID areas to overcome the barriers to participating in education and achieving better outcomes.

Other services provided by post offices such as over the counter welfare payments are not affected by the dispute. I also understand that, aside from certain isolated cases, the contingency arrangements put in place by An Post have ensured that mail deliveries continue to be made in rural areas.I stress that I have no statutory function in such disputes, nor would it be correct for me to intervene in a matter which is for the board and management of An Post to resolve. However, I am pleased to note that Mr. Phil Flynn, who has successfully acted as a mediator between the Irish Postmasters' Union and An Post in the past, has convened a meeting of both parties this week in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Given the very serious financial difficulties facing the company with losses of €20 million forecast for this year, which can only be aggravated by industrial action of this nature, I trust both parties will make every effort to reach an agreement in the interest of the company, its employees and its customers.

As part of the restructuring programme, the containment of production costs is considered by the company to be an urgent priority. The decision to discontinue taking harvested seaweed from Donegal was, therefore, made by Arramara Teoranta on a strictly commercial basis as part of its overall strategy to secure its future.I recently agreed with my Cabinet colleague, the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, who has responsibility for Gaeltacht affairs, that ownership of Arramara Teoranta will be transferred to Údarás na Gaeltachta. I am confident that Arramara Teoranta will benefit greatly from the expertise that Údarás na Gaeltachta, as the industrial development authority for the Gaeltacht, will bring to the company.

The following may clarify the situation.Training in this area is provided by Teagasc and is funded by the forest service of my Department. Teagasc currently has nine full-time forestry advisers trained on all aspects of hardwood production. Short courses on hardwood production are run countrywide when and where required as part of the annual training programme, with over 500 in attendance this year alone. In addition, as part of this programme, six major demonstrations were held around the country recently with over 1,000 farmers in attendance. A major part of these courses was focused on hardwood production and best silvicultural practice. Teagasc has three courses on hardwood production approved by the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC. It also holds field days and field evenings throughout the country. All courses are widely advertised in local and national press and are open to any interested party to attend. It is also open to farmers to contact their local Teagasc forestry adviser at any time for free advice and consultation. These measures provide adequate training and expertise on all aspects of hardwood establishment and maintenance at this time.

In that context we are technology takers in the main.While acknowledging our high dependence on energy imports, I nonetheless am confident that this reliance can be significantly reduced with greater investment in energy efficiency to curb overall demand and by harnessing more indigenous energy sources. Sustainable Energy Ireland, which was established as a statutory agency on 1 May this year, implements initiatives on renewable energy and energy efficiency on behalf of my Department. Under the economic and social infrastructure operational programme of the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006, funding of €223 million is earmarked for the authority's operations and programmes. The agency recently launched a five year strategy to promote and assist energy efficient practices in all sectors and to encourage alternative technologies, including renewable energy and combined heat and power.The increased use of indigenous renewable energy technologies in green electricity production is a cornerstone of the solution to reduce our import dependency. The Government's current target is to deliver an additional 500 megawatts of new green electricity production plants to the network by 2005. This target originates in the publication of a Green Paper on Sustainable Energy in 1999. The target will be implemented through competitions conducted under the alternative energy requirement programme, AER, administered by my Department. Last Thursday I announced the broad terms and conditions of the AER VI competition which will ensure that the target is delivered.More recently, an EU directive on the promotion of renewable energy in electricity production – 2001/77/EC – was published. This directive imposes a binding obligation on member states to develop a programme to increase the consumption of green electricity. The obligation addressed to Ireland is to increase green electricity to 13.2% of total consumption by 2010. I indicated that I intend to undertake a public consultation process in early 2003 on future targets and the most appropriate support mechanisms to deliver the target to 2010. This consultation will commence once the AER VI competition is formally launched.

The Irish fisheries patrol area includes the Irish Box. European fishing regulations are clear with regard to the requirement for all fishing vessels to stow securely those nets they are not legally entitled to use while fishing within special regulatory areas. These frequent checks at sea include the inspection of the fishing gear used by vessels using the methods and criteria prescribed under EU fisheries legislation. These fishing gear inspections are intended to ensure compliance with all European regulations regarding minimum mesh size criteria. The catches aboard are also inspected for compliance with EU fisheries legislation governing the requirements of minimum sizes of fish and the recording of catches retained onboard.My Department's land based inspectorate carries out regular inspections of Spanish registered vessels. Non-Irish fishing vessels are required to give prior notification of landing which includes information on all the catches retained aboard the vessel. Routine inspections are also carried out of the fishing gear to ensure compliance with European regulations governing fishing gear and of the minimum sizes of fish permitted to be landed by these vessels when these fishing vessels use Irish ports.

In total, 96% of all sample results indicating the presence of marine biotoxins in excess of the permitted limits are reported to farmers within three working days of such samples being taken. There have been no product recalls of Irish shellfish, associated with marine biotoxins, to date during 2002 and there have been no reported human illness to date associated with the presence of marine biotoxins in Irish shellfish.The recent appointment of a shellfish sample co-ordinator by my Department will ensure that these high standards are maintained and improved for the benefit of Irish shellfish producers and the consumers of their products.

Information and data gathered by the Marine Institute in the course of mapping and profiling Ireland's extensive coastal and marine offshore resource is also made publicly available.The current bank of knowledge is expected to be significantly supplemented through three initiatives undertaken by or on behalf of the Marine Institute, namely: a study on special areas of conservation, SACs, in selected bays on behalf of Dúchas; a feasibility study for a largescale inshore mapping study; and a survey by the Geological Survey of Ireland, GSI, of the offshore seabed. These studies are expected to assist, inter alia, in the identification of areas in which aquaculture activities may be undertaken sustainably. The findings of the first two studies are expected to be available in March 2003. The GSI survey will be undertaken over the period 2003-06.

Such mechanisms represent the best method of achieving value for money for the taxpayer, while ensuring that development continues apace.As the Deputy will no doubt be aware the State Authorities (Private Partnership Agreements) Act, which came into effect on 22 March 2002, explicitly empowered State authorities to enter into joint ventures for the purpose of, and to contract with private financiers of, a public private partnership. The Deputy will also be aware that the proposed national development finance agency will, among other matters, assess optimal financing for public investment projects including PPPs.While I have no specific proposals at present in respect of public private partnerships, my Department continues to review expenditure programmes with a view to assessing their suitability for public private partnership. I have also asked my officials to work closely with the national development finance agency, when established, to inform our assessment in this regard.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	810	I propose to take Questions Nos. 295 and 300 together.There are improvements in the area of offshore petroleum developments. I granted Enterprise Energy Ireland, EEI, and its co-venturers Statoil and Marathon, a petroleum lease for the Corrib gas field on 15 November 2001. I subsequently issued all the necessary statutory approvals and consents for the development of the field. The development is at present on hold pending the determination by An Bord Pleanála of the planning appeal in relation to the terminal for the gas field. The oral hearing in the appeal resumes on 25 November 2002. The target date for first gas is early 2005.Last week saw the issue of the second petroleum lease under the 1992 terms to Ramco Seven Heads Limited and its partners. The Seven Heads Group expect to submit a plan of development shortly with a target of first gas for late 2003. Marathon propose to drill a further well next year to access gas that was not being drained effectively by the existing wells.In short, the State is moving from being more than 80% dependent on gas imports to a situation over the next few years in which the indigenous sector will supply the bulk of its requirements. Unfortunately, the past year has seen a very steep decline in exploration activity. Exploration licences have declined from 32 in 1998 to seven at present and there is a commitment for only one further exploration well in 2003. However, I am assured that although these areas off the west coast are not easy, with all the problems associated with frontier areas, there is considerable untested prospectivity there. This is evidenced by the very encouraging news from Enterprise Energy Ireland's Dooish well off Donegal. The well penetrated a substantial column of hydrocarbons. However, before the nature and size of the accumulation or the possibility for any commercial development can be assessed – it is in nearly 1,500 metres of water – a considerable amount of analysis of existing data together with much further appraisal work will be required. It is expected that appraisal operations will resume at the earliest possible opportunity during the drilling season next year.Given the serious decline in exploration, my concern to get ongoing exploration activity to the highest extent possible, has prompted the Porcupine Basin licensing initiative, announced a few weeks ago. On 6 November I published a notice setting out details of the licensing process to be followed in the initiative. The area comprises the entire Porcupine Basin – excluding the two areas currently licensed – split into four tranches, based on a detailed technical evaluation of the basin's prospectivity carried out by the petroleum affairs division, PAD.

I have had a number of meetings with the national representative organisations in recent weeks and will meet the fishermen's organisation on a number of occasions again in the coming weeks.The position in respect of fish stocks is that the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, ICES, has provided scientific advice on the state of stocks for the 2003 fishing year. This advice involves wide ranging reductions, in some cases over 50%, in many of the white fish fisheries of interest to Ireland. There are also large reductions recommended in the mackerel, herring and horse mackerel fisheries.

In June 2002 the director announced that following a competitive selection process held during the year Hutchinson Whampoa, Vodafone and O2 had been offered  licences to provided 3G services in Ireland. These offers were subsequently accepted.There were two types of licence to operate 3G in Ireland on offer. The A licence won by Hutchison Whampoa, with a total fee of €50.7 million, provides for 80% population coverage with minimum roll-out requirements of: 53% of the national population by end December 2005; and 80% coverage by the end of December 2007. The B licences, which were taken up by O2 and Vodafone, with a fee of €114.3 million, provide for a minimum of population coverage of 53% – equivalent to five major cities – and roll-out requirements of: 33% demographic coverage by the end of June 2006; and 53% demographic coverage by the end of June 2008. The differentiation in the fees reflects the greater roll-out cost to the A licensee in meeting the coverage and time constraints compared to the minimum requirements for the B licences.

However, recognising that there are areas of the country that are  not as economically attractive for firms to invest in infrastructure and services due to differing demographics and population densities and mindful that the global economic downturn has adversely affected companies' ability to invest, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to facilitate the roll-out of advanced communications infrastructure which seek to address gaps in communications infrastructure in regional Ireland.In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled out broadband nationwide to a value – both public and private funding – of €70 million were supported and are now completed. These projects entailed the roll-out of broadband services in the Border, midlands and west region and the south and east region.Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the indicative figure allocated to telecommunications initiatives was approximately €200 million. Funding under this communications and e-commerce measure of the NDP will be utilised to lever and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services which will enhance the potential for the development of affordable electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of last year which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of next year and will entail an overall investment of €160 million in broadband leveraged from grant assistance of approximately €55 million.Of the projects selected under this call under the communications measure of the NDP 2000-2006, my Department will fund Esat-BT with up to €9 million to roll-out a €25 million DSL programme at 40 centres outside of the Dublin area. Under the second call, €3.7 million has been made available to Eircom in respect of DSL roll-out at 14 exchanges nationwide. I am also aware that Eircom is rolling out DSL at 32 centres in the greater Dublin area. I am further informed that by the end of the year 500,000 lines will be DSL enabled which will greatly facilitate the deployment of broadband nationwide.

As the Deputy knows, exploration for minerals here is undertaken by private enterprise holders of prospecting licences granted under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999. In my statutory report to the Oireachtas under those Acts for the six months ended June 2002, I said there were 391 extant prospecting licences at the end of last June. Gold is known to occur in the rocks in many parts of Ireland and there is a continuing interest in exploring for it. It is the sole target of three current prospecting licences and incidental target of more than 100 more. Silver is normally found in Ireland as part of the suite of base metal ores and so it is an incidental target of more than 360 licences. There is also a minor interest in exploring for other high value metals and for diamond and other gemstones.

The company stated that the reason for the proposed cutting down of trees was that they had been requested by Aer Rianta to remove the trees under the terms of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1998. Section 46 of that Act provides that notwithstanding anything contained in the Forestry Acts, 1946 to 1988, Aer Rianta may remove any tree growing on land in the vicinity of a State airport which, in its opinion, interferes with the operation and development of that airport or which it considers obstructs or otherwise interferes with the safety or navigation of aircraft using that airport. On the basis of the information contained on the felling notice, my Department decided not to prohibit the felling of the trees.

Under these Acts, each port company issues to the Minister fully paid-up shares in the share capital of the company equal in nominal value to the sum representing the value of the property transferred to the company on its vesting day. Subject to the Acts, I may exercise in respect of these shares all the rights and powers of a holder of such shares. The Acts also provide that the articles of association of a port company shall provide that the number of directors shall not be more than 12 persons each of whom shall be appointed by me with the consent of the Minister for Finance.As with all State port companies, Dublin Port Company is obliged by Statute to operate on a strictly commercial basis and to conduct its business at all times cost effectively and efficiently. Since its formation as a port company in 1997, Dublin Port has published an annual report and financial statements in accordance with the Companies Acts. I am pleased to note that the company has been consistently profitable since its inception. I have requested the port company to forward a copy of the company's latest set of accounts to the Deputy for his information. As regards industrial relation matters, it is not the Minister-shareholder's function or responsibility to interfere in the day to day business of the port company and such matters are the remit of the board and management of the port company.

Entitlement to orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. Patients assessed as category A have severe malocclusions and should receive urgent orthodontic care. Patients assessed as category B have less severe problems and are placed on orthodontic treatment waiting lists.

The task force is, among other issues, considering the proposed development of a consultant-provided public hospital service and quantifying the resource and cost implications involved. The task force is also addressing the reduction in working hours for non-consultant hospital doctors arising from the EU directive on working time and the medical education and training requirements of our hospital medical workforce. The task force will also address the associated medical staffing needs of the hospital system and consider the medical education and training requirements arising from changes to the current model of delivering services.Regarding the treatment of patients with prostate cancer, the National Cancer Forum in conjunction with my Department is developing the national cancer strategy 2003, which will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the coming years. As part of this work, the National Cancer Forum has established a number of multidisciplinary sub-groups. The sub-group on generic screening is reviewing all issues relating to screening, including examining specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. A sub-group on generic symptomatic disease has also been established. This group is reviewing cancer policy and models for the organisation of cancer services in other jurisdictions. A sub-group on evidence-based medicine has also been established. This group is developing a framework for the development, implementation, monitoring and updating of guidelines for the treatment of patients with cancer. The recommendations of these groups will inform the development of the new national cancer strategy 2003.

Kerry Community Transport was one of the eight original groups selected for operational funding and has received funding of €114,276 so far under the initiative. The overall allocation is being paid in instalments and I understand from Area Development Management Ltd., which is managing the RTI on behalf of my Department, that a further allocation would be due to the group in the near future. In all some €3 million will be spent on the RTI this year and a similar amount is earmarked for 2003.

As envisaged in the DTO strategy, a key priority aspect of the investment in the future will be suburban rail, Luas and Metro, which enable a high capacity alternative to private car commuting to be provided along selected transport corridors.Over the last number of years there have been significant developments in rail-based public transport in the greater Dublin area, and further enhancements are also planned. Progress to date includes a 50% increase in DART capacity since 2000 as a result of the introduction of 38 additional DART cars and 100% increase in the capacity of the Maynooth line as a result of doubling of the track and provision of additional carriages.Over the next two years, it is anticipated that morning peak capacity will increase on key rail commuter lines in and out of Dublin through the following planned investment, entry into service of 80 additional diesel railcars, the first batch of which will be delivered early next month, €117 million investment in Heuston Station between March 2002 and mid 2003 to provide four additional platforms, a signalling system upgrade and increased track capacity which will enable the station to handle extra mainline and commuter trains, particularly at peak times. Kildare line upgrade will enable a 130% increase in peak hour suburban capacity by end 2003. An additional programme of investment is being developed for investment in suburban rail for the period beyond 2003 in respect of the DART upgrade, Maynooth and Kildare lines, which will further expand rail capacity to meet the needs of the greater Dublin area.

The line is being held on a care and maintenance basis, should future business opportunities arise.The strategic rail review, which is nearing completion, will provide a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail network in the light of the emerging spatial planning and regional development policies and local land use and transportation studies. The future development of the Foynes rail line will be considered in the context of the outcome of this review. I expect the strategic rail review will be published in late January 2003.

The RAPID programme is aimed at prioritising national development plan funding to various disadvantaged neighbourhoods in large urban areas. Under the scheme, Bus Éireann introduced a new route in Cork city, southern orbital bus service, on a pilot basis. The Department provided funding of €288,000 towards the project.The attached table lists project applications in respect of Strand 2 provincial centres which have just been received from Area Development Management Limited, who run the RAPID programme.

Design work has been completed for some time and installation work is under way at various stations on the line and is scheduled to be completed in mid 2003. Upon completion, passengers on the Galway to Dublin route can expect a significant improvement in terms of comfort, safety and speed. Adjustments to the track on the Athenry to Claremorris line have been made as a consequence of these signalling upgrade works. I have been advised by Iarnród Éireann that services have not operated for some time on the Athenry to Claremorris line. I understand that should services resume, the necessary adjustments at Athenry can be made reasonably quickly, at a cost of approximately €750,000.The strategic rail review will provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail passenger and rail freight sector. I expect the strategic rail review will be published in late January 2003.

The bureau's powers and functions are set out in the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, 1996, together with provisions for administrative, operational and ancillary matters. The bureau is a national unit under the direction of a senior officer of the Garda Síochána and there are no plans to expand its work in the form of mini-bureaux. The national drugs strategy 2001-08 provides, however, that the assets of middle-ranking criminals involved in drug dealing will be targeted. The bureau has established appropriate liaison arrangements with Garda divisions throughout the country in order to achieve this objective.

There is provision in the Acts for an extension of the terms of reference upon a request by the tribunal. The question of extending the terms of reference was raised with the tribunal at the preliminary hearing and the tribunal stated that it will consider any arguments, based on evidence, which are put to it. Any request by the tribunal for an amendment will be dealt with by the Government under the terms of the Tribunal of Inquiry (Evidence) Acts.On the question of representation, the position is that the persons concerned were granted the right to full representation at a preliminary hearing of the tribunal in July. There are many parties involved in the matters being inquired into by the tribunal. The scope and nature of these inquiries have been outlined by the tribunal in its comprehensive opening statement in Donegal. It is my view that all concerned should co-operate as fully as possible with the inquiries. Such co-operation is the best means of helping the tribunal to establish the truth and thereby ensure justice for all parties.

While the study into convictions for the drug trafficking offence created by section 4, commissioned by my predecessor, has not yet been completed, the preliminary indications are that the main factors taken into account by the courts in cases where a sentence of less than ten years has been imposed are where the accused pleads guilty to the offence; co-operates with the prosecuting authorities; and materially assists the Garda Síochána with its investigations. I am satisfied that the provisions have had a beneficial effect and I will consider the results of the study referred to when they become available.

The other locations are Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Ennis, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford. Contracts have been placed in relation to the systems for Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick. Work is ongoing in each of these locations and it is intended that the installation of cameras will commence when the planning process with the relevant local authorities and the refurbishment of rooms in the Garda stations to accommodate the CCTV monitoring rooms and associated equipment have been completed. Preparation of the detailed technical specification documents by the Garda authorities for the CCTV systems in Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford is well advanced and these are expected to go to tender in 2003. Planning for the installation of the CCTV systems in the remaining seven locations is scheduled to commence in 2003.I am advised by the Garda authorities that the Office of Public Works is finalising structural work at Finglas Garda station to provide for the installation of a CCTV monitoring room and associated equipment in Finglas. I am also advised that the design of the camera poles has been completed and the camera locations have been finalised. The planning process in relation to the camera poles is ongoing. While the timescale for completion of the CCTV scheme is difficult to clearly define, it is envisaged that the system will be up and running during the first half of 2003.

The Minister for Health and Children and the Garda Commissioner have informed me that they have no knowledge of such a conference. I can confirm, therefore, that the conference in question was not a meeting within the framework for formal co-operation between the administrations of the member states as provided for in the EU and EC treaties. Outside of that formal framework, however, there is a wide variety of programmes which co-finance projects, including conferences and seminars, and which allow for exchanges of views between representatives of a broad range of civil society. Such conferences and seminars, which are informal in their conclusions, do not necessarily involve participation by the Administrations of the member states.The international drug control treaties, adopted within the United Nations, oblige participating states to limit the use of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances exclusively to medical and scientific purposes. These conventions were established by the international community to protect public health and safety. This position was endorsed by the participating member states, including Ireland, at the special session of the UN General Assembly on Drugs in June 1998. A political declaration was adopted at the special session which re-affirmed the unwavering determination and commitment of the member states to overcome the world drug problem through domestic and international strategies to reduce both the illicit supply of and demand for drugs.Any change in the above position would require an amendment to the UN treaties and it is not correct to suggest that EU law could override national law in this area. Co-operation between the member states of the EU in the area of public health is governed by the treaty establishing the European Community. The treaty provides that a high level of human health protection shall be ensured in the definition and implementation of all Community policies and activities and that the Community shall complement the member states' actions in reducing drugs-related health damage, including information and prevention. There are no provisions in the EU or EC treaties which would allow for the legalisation of drugs.

The Deputy indicates the person may have lodged a complaint directly with the Garda Síochána Complaints Board. As the Deputy will be aware, I am precluded under the Garda Síochána (Complaints) Act, 1986, from inquiring or intervening in any way in relation to a complaint before the board.

Local Garda management is satisfied that the current personnel strength of Castledermot Garda  station is adequate to meet the present policing needs of the area.There are currently no plans to increase the personnel strength of Castledermot Garda station. The situation will, however, be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available, the needs of Castledermot will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

I am further informed that from 1/1/2002 to 17/11/2002, 1,228 burglaries have been reported to the Garda authorities in the Dublin South-West area, and a total of 171 of these burglaries have been detected. I am also informed that, to date, 205 charges have been brought before the courts relating to these activities. It should be noted that these figures are provisional and subject to change.

I am further informed that there have been 360 individual visits to licensed premises in the Dublin South-West area since January 2002 and that of the prosecutions taken to date two have resulted in closure orders. I am also informed that there are seven cases currently pending in relation to the supply of intoxicating liquor by license holders to underage persons and that a further three cases are pending in relation to the supply of intoxicating liquor by non-licensed holders to underage persons. I understand that members of the Garda Síochána in the Dublin South-West area are proactive in relation to dealing with consumption of alcohol in a public place, and on-the-spot fines are issued daily.The national age card scheme, introduced by statutory regulation, continues to reduce the possibility of underage persons successfully purchasing intoxicating liquor.

These include direct police action, from detection and prevention to the use of numerous diversion and referral schemes.The law governing the disposal of vehicles, often irresponsibly sold on to young people, is governed by the Road Traffic Acts and the Waste Management Act, 1996. This legislation comes within the remit of the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government is of the view that the issue of company cars is best dealt with in the context of agreement with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry and other interested agencies on an acceptable vehicle recovery scheme. Such a voluntary, industry-led producer responsibility is not only in keeping with our requirements under the relevant European directive on end-of-life vehicles but appears to provide the most effective means of addressing the problem of the supply of such vehicles.

My subsequent reply of 12 November, in which I stated that I had been informed by the Office of Public Works that they were close to completing the purchase, was based on information from that office that the legal formalities relating to the purchase had been virtually completed.I do not think that too much should be read into technical differences between closing a sale and completing all of the formalities of sale. There was certainly no intention to cause any confusion on the matter. The substance of the matter remains that the site has now been purchased. The building of the new Garda station at Leixlip will be progressed with all due urgency in accordance with overall priorities within the Garda building programme and the availability of financial and other resources. I am not in a position at this time, however, to say when the project will start.

At that time the hostel was designated as an accommodation centre for both single males and females. In July 2002, for operational reasons related to the make up of the care of asylum seekers then requiring accommodation, it was decided to redesignate the Ormonde Hostel as a centre for single males only. All the women then resident in the centre were offered alternative accommodation in whichever other centre operated by the Reception and Integration Agency of my Department they chose. However, the person in question declined to move at that time as she wished to remain in the Kilkenny area. At present, the agency operates no other accommodation centre in Kilkenny to which she could be transferred and its proposals to construct a system built accommodation centre in Kilkenny are currently the subject of judicial review proceedings. The agency has advised me that the offer of alternative accommodation elsewhere in the country has remained available at all times and is still open to her.As regards her asylum claim, I am informed that her appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal has been completed and that a decision has issued to her.

No dedicated departmental financial allocations have been established to provide potential funding for RAPID proposals as such. However, my Department decides on approving funding for RAPID proposals within the context of existing allocations across Votes under my Department's remit. Particular priority is given to RAPID proposals which fall within the functional areas financed by the NDP.To date this Department has received 47 RAPID proposals. Examples of the type of proposals received by the Department under RAPID are childcare projects, Garda youth diversion projects, proposals for CCTV schemes, proposals, such as the deployment of gardaí, which would be a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide on and probation and welfare projects.I regret to inform the Deputy that in the time available it has not been possible to provide information on the funding which has been approved by the Department under the RAPID programme. However, I will forward this information to the Deputy as soon as possible.

Consequently, he was required to destock by 41 ewes, bringing him to a total of 94. As he was still over his quota, he did not suffer a loss of premium but qualified for a payment for loss of headage and, in 1999, a one-off payment of €2.54, £2, per ewe culled. In the years 1999 and 2000 the person received loss of headage payments of €643.76, £507, and €572.65, £451, respectively. However, from 2001 headage became an area based rather than an animal based payment. Therefore, he did not qualify for any payment from this Department from 2001.

Other meetings have taken place at other times and are a regular feature of the continuing liaison with the Department of Finance in relation to the management and control of expenditure of my Department's programmes.The question of spending pressures was discussed with the Department of Finance at this May meeting and on other occasions. From these discussions, and following consideration of the issues by the Government, it was agreed that an excess of some €50 million for recoupment to local authorities in respect of accommodation for homeless persons, including asylum seekers, should be offset by savings in a range of other programmes. The details of these arrangements have been set out in the reply to Question No. 1582 of 9 October 2002.

One formal meeting has taken place between officials of my Department and the individual concerned to discuss a revised list of caretaker duties. An increase in remuneration has been offered but has not at this time been agreed. There are no proposals to appoint the person concerned to the position of full-time operative. My Department has also discussed the situation with the relevant trade union.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	949	Payment of the 4% increase under the third phase of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness (PPF) is conditional on the achievement of specific performance indicators, as provided for under the Government's modernisation programme for the public service.Achievement of targets is subject to verification under the independent quality assurance mechanism established under the PPF. Following the transfer of heritage functions to my Department, arising from the formation of the present Government, a short but unavoidable delay occurred in implementing this pay increase for non-established staff. Instructions to pay the increase, effective from 1 October, have issued to local pay centres and it is anticipated that payment will be made to all staff from the 28 November 2002.The trade unions representing non-established staff have, for some time, been seeking the introduction of electronic money transfer "Paypath" to allow payment of wages to their members' bank accounts. Until now the systems in use did not permit this facility. However, with the recent introduction of improved computer software this can now be facilitated. A recent pilot project has been used to successfully test the system. All staff have been invited to join "Paypath" and their responses are now awaited.

They will also be borne in mind in determining the 2003 non-national road grant allocations which will be announced in early 2003. The significant resourcing of the non-national roads programme in recent years has provided the opportunity, at the discretion of the road authorities concerned, for prioritising action in relation to the problems identified in the interim report, if necessary on a phased basis.My Department will also be prepared to consider sympathetically any request from local authorities in the Shannon catchment area to adjust their multi-annual restoration programmes so as to prioritise works to repair flood damage to particular roads, or to raise roads to prevent future flooding.

The computer systems used by local authorities are supplied by the Local Government Computer Services Board – LGCSB – other than in the case of the four Dublin authorities, Cork County Council, Cork Corporation, Cavan County Council, Wexford County Council and Wexford Corporation. In order to cater for TRS, the LGCSB, in conjunction with the local authorities served by their systems, carried out major modifications to the existing housing loans systems. The nine authorities who are using computer systems other than the LGCSB systems have had to carry out their own modifications to cater for TRS.I understand that the tax relief system is now in operation in all local authorities other than South Dublin, Dun Laoghaire Rathdown and Fingal County Councils. In relation to these authorities, I understand that the system will be in operation shortly and that appropriate adjustments will be made to mortgage holders accounts.

Spending on water services is being increased threefold under the current NDP by comparison to the 1994-1999 period. This investment is being funded by the Exchequer with support from the European Union and, where appropriate, capital contributions by the non-domestic sector in accordance with the water pricing policy established by my Department. Details of currently approved schemes are set out in my Department's water services investment programme 2002-2004, which is available in the Oireachtas Library.

In operating the scheme, local authorities should have regard to local circumstances in determining maximum price limits or any other details they deem appropriate. I consider that these issues are best determined by individual local authorities.I understand that Fingal County Council does not limit the cost of shared ownership properties to €127,000. In fact, I understand the council has just completed a shared ownership transaction of a property costing €137,000 and are currently acquiring a number of houses directly, which they envisage will be sold by way of shared ownership, for amounts in excess of this price.

Expenditure by individual local authorities on the scheme is subject to the annual capital allocations notified by my Department. Where local authorities propose to exceed this allocation they must obtain the prior approval of my Department. However, detailed information on the day-to-day operation of the scheme in individual local authorities is not available in my Department.Details of general activity under the scheme are published in my Department's housing statistics bulletins which are available in the Oireachtas Library. Activity under the scheme has increased significantly. The number of transactions completed in 2001 was 1,611 compared to 1,190 in 2000. At the end of June 2002, 1,871 approvals in principle had issued in cases where transactions had not yet been compiled.I intend to continue and support the shared ownership scheme as an important instrument in support of affordable housing.

Where they are provided, their function is to reduce vehicle speeds, reduce the number and severity of accidents and lessen concerns over road safety. It is possible that some minimal increases in noise and vehicle emissions may occur but these can be minimised with good design. My Department, in conjunction with the Dublin Transportation Office and the Department of Transport, is preparing a traffic management guidelines manual which will, inter alia, deal with speed management and traffic calming.

The body's remit is the management, maintenance, development and restoration of the inland navigable waterway system, principally for recreational purposes. The matter raised by the Deputy is a day-to-day operational matter for Waterways Ireland and not for Dúchas.Waterways Ireland informs me that there are 115 boards in the weir at Meelick. The purpose of these is to ensure a sufficient depth of water to allow for navigation in times of low water flows. The level of water on this stretch of river is controlled by these weir boards in conjunction with 18 sluices at Marlborough, near Meelick, and 12 sluices at Meelick. The navigation weir boards have been removed from Meelick Weir and all sluices, both at Meelick Weir and at Marlborough Sluices, have been fully opened to afford the maximum drainage benefit possible. Any flood debris at the weir is removed on a continuous basis, when it is safe to do so. When all the weir boards are removed and all the sluices are open, Waterways Ireland has no further control over water levels. Water levels on the Shannon are controlled by a series of weirs with sluices; the levels in the channels are controlled by Waterways Ireland and in the lakes by the ESB.

As part of its terms of reference, the committee was asked to examine and make recommendations and report to Government on the possibilities for recognition and accreditation for voluntary work and for training undertaken as a volunteer, measures to widen the pool of volunteers and the range of supports needed in order to promote, sustain and develop volunteering.The national committee published its report, Tipping The Balance, on 16 October 2002. The Government's commitment to supporting volunteering was stated in the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity published in September 2000 and was demonstrated by the establishment of the committee shortly afterwards. When creating the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in June 2002, the Taoiseach indicated that the Department would have responsibility for issues relating to volunteering.Tipping The Balance is an extremely detailed and comprehensive report covering many aspects of volunteering with wide-ranging recommendations which affect many state and other bodies. The report and its recommendations are currently under consideration in my Department. In addition to my Department's examination of the report I intend to bring it to the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Social Inclusion for its consideration.

My Department was represented on the inter-departmental steering group set up to prepare the National Spatial Strategy. My concerns were articulated at the various meetings of this group and were taken into account in preparing the strategy.

In this regard, it is intended to undertake a review of the programmes and activities which come within the remit of my Department, with a view to achieving optimal coherence across the various schemes. Any proposals in relation to the future administration and delivery of these programmes, including the community development support programmes, will be considered in this context.

This funding is provided by way of grant aid to voluntary groups and organisations who have undertaken to identify those elderly people in need of assistance under the scheme. Since the commencement of the scheme of community support for older people, a total of €2.5 million has been allocated to the scheme, which at the end of 2001 had assisted some 89,136 individuals. A sum of €4.4 million has been provided for the scheme in 2002. The total budget for the scheme is allocated to the regions by the percentage of the population aged 65 and over. The north west region's allocation is 7.1% of the total budget. Donegal has approximately 60% of the relevant population base. To date, 23 groups in Donegal have applied for funding under the scheme, all of which have been approved for grants totalling €83,540.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	981	Expenditure on rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme was €179.4 million in 2001.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	982	The person concerned has been in receipt of disability allowance since 28 February 2001. On the basis of his means assessment he is entitled to the maximum weekly rate of €118.80 per week. However, €5 per week is being withheld towards recovery of an overpayment of €24,843.95 in respect of unemployment assistance which was paid to him previously. The overpayment arose because the person concerned failed to notify my Department that he had married and that his wife was employed. He appealed the decision and after an oral hearing an appeals officer disallowed the appeal. Summary proceedings were also initiated against the person concerned under the Social Welfare Acts. He was convicted in Westport District Court for offences under the Social Welfare Acts and a fine of €150 was imposed.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	983	The position in this case is as set out in my reply to the Deputy's Question on 9 October 2002. The person's appeal has been considered by an appeals officer who has decided that an oral hearing is necessary. This will be arranged as soon as possible. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims and the insurability of employment must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	984	Social welfare old age pensions comprise two types, contributory pensions which are based on social insurance contributions and non-contributory pensions which are based on a means test. It has been government policy for many years to increase the numbers with individual pension entitlements based on social insurance. In this regard significant progress has been made by extending social insurance coverage, easing qualifying conditions for contributory pensions and by the introduction of special pensions such as the pre-53 pension, special pension for self-employed and pro-rata pensions for those with mixed insurance. The old age non-contributory pension, OANCP, is a social assistance scheme which is designed to provide financial support for older people who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension schemes. In common with other social assistance schemes, the  OANCP features a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need.There are approximately 43,000 people aged 70 or over who are not in receipt of a social welfare payment. These would include former public servants, self-employed and others who do not have the necessary social insurance contributions for a contributory pension but whose means are such that they cannot satisfy a means test. The cost of a pension for this group at the maximum rate of the old age non-contributory pension would be €304 million per annum. In addition, those over 70 years of age who are already receiving pensions at reduced rates or are being paid for as qualified adults would need to have their payments increased. An age breakdown of those receiving such payments is not readily available so it is not possible to estimate the cost of this aspect of the proposal.The final report of the National Pensions Board, published in 1993, examined the option of adopting a universal pension scheme but concluded that the existing system of a social insurance scheme supported by a means tested scheme was the most appropriate one. The issues concerning provision of social welfare pensions are being examined in the context of the phase 2 report of the review of the qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. The review is at an advanced stage of preparation and it is hoped to publish it as a discussion document early in 2003.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	985	People who qualify for means tested pensions or allowances such as old age non-contributory pension, unemployment assistance or one-parent family payment automatically qualify for fuel allowance. The majority of people who receive fuel allowances qualify because they satisfy the relevant means test for their primary weekly payment. In the case of contributory pensions such as old age contributory, retirement and invalidity pensions, which are not means tested, a person may have a combined household income of up to €50.79 per week or savings or investments of up to €41,901.35 over and above their pension and still qualify for fuel allowance. Any changes in these limits would have to be considered in the context of the budget and in light of priorities generally.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	986	The person concerned applied for widow's non-contributory pension on 24 October 2002. Her application is with a local officer for investigation of her means. On receipt of the local officer's report her entitlement will be examined and she will be informed of the outcome in due course. She is currently in receipt of disability allowance and receiving the household benefits. She will continue to receive them if she qualifies for a widow's non-contributory pension. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on pension entitlements are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decision.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	987	There is no record of the person concerned having applied for an old age non-contributory pension. She had been in receipt of widow's non-contributory pension at the reduced weekly rate of £59.50, €75.55, until 22 May 2000. Payment of pension was then discontinued, as she failed to substantiate the disposal of significant capital that arose from the sale of her farm and dwelling. An appeals officer subsequently upheld the deciding officer's decision. On foot of the Deputy's earlier representations and following further investigation her application was again disallowed by a deciding officer on 16 October 2002, for the same reason as previously. She was informed of this decision and of her right of appeal. Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in making such decisions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	988	The person concerned applied for retirement pension on 18 January 1999. His claim was disallowed as he did not satisfy the condition requiring him to have commenced paying social insurance in Ireland before reaching age 55. In June 2000, he appealed the decision not to award him a pension. His appeal was disallowed by an appeals officer and he was notified of the position.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	989	Applicants under these pension schemes have been required, since the commencement of these schemes in 1961 and 1970 respectively, to have entered insurance ten years before the relevant date for entitlement to pension. Since Ireland's accession to the EU in 1973, entry into insurance under the legislation of other member states before these ages also satisfies the requirement here for the purpose of a pro-rata pension.Figures are not available to show the numbers who failed to qualify for pensions from my Department under this heading since these schemes commenced. It is possible, however, from the computer system supporting the payment of these pensions since 1985, to identify that a total of 112 applicants to retirement pension and 866 applicants to old age contributory pension failed to satisfy this condition. These figures relate only to people who actually lodged a claim for pension and do not include people who did not claim, knowing that they did not have an entitlement. The figures also do not include people who failed to qualify for standard rate pensions by virtue of not satisfying the entry condition but who subsequently qualified for pro-rata pensions under EU regulations or bilateral agreements. The data available does not give the additional information sought by the Deputy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	990	The living alone allowance is an additional payment of €7.70 per week which is paid to people in receipt of certain social welfare payments and who reside alone. Those covered include old age pensioners and also recipients of disability payments aged under 66 years. The living alone allowance is not a payment which is made in its own right, with its own set of qualifying conditions. Rather, it is an integral part of the relevant social welfare payment. As it is paid as a supplement to the basic rate of social welfare payment, it operates in the same way as increases for qualified adults and children. In the circumstances, the living alone allowance is not payable to people who do not have a social welfare entitlement or whose pension payments are made under the social security regimes of other countries.The only way in which a person in the circumstances outlined would qualify for living alone allowance would be if her or his income were below the threshold for entitlement to a social assistance payment such as, in this case, disability allowance, which would include a living alone allowance. Based on his present level of pension, equivalent to €133, the person concerned is above the income limit for entitlement to disability allowance.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	991	My Department's medical assessors examine recipients of all illness payments to ensure they fulfil the medical conditions for the receipt of these payments. An insured person who is injured at work or who contracts a prescribed occupational disease may be entitled to benefits under the occupational injuries scheme. One of these benefits is disablement benefit in respect of which claimants must be examined to  determine the degree of disablement that has resulted from the occupational injury or disease. The person concerned has been in receipt of disablement benefit following an occupational accident sustained in February 2000 in which she sustained a left forearm fracture. This required operative intervention and the initial disablement assessment of 30%, reflected the situation in the immediate post-operative period.A subsequent award of 20% reflected the improvement which occurred and which would have been reasonably expected in the light of the expert treatment received. An appeal was lodged with the social welfare appeals office against the decision to reduce the degree of disablement award to 20% and an oral hearing took place on 10 July 2002 when an appeals officer decided that the loss of faculty should be increased to 30%. The person was again reviewed in September 2002 when the degree of disablement was assessed at 10% for life which again reflected further improvement. This has now been referred to the social welfare appeals office. In 2001 there were 563 appeals against disablement awards, of which 271, 48.1%, were allowed and 102, 18.1%, were partially allowed. In 2002 to date, 394 appeals were received, of which 185, 47%, were allowed and 92, 23.4%, partially allowed.The nature of the disablement benefit scheme and the circumstances which give rise to claims for benefit are such that reviews of assessment are an inevitable feature of the scheme. Changes to the scheme to streamline would have to take account of this and it is important that claimants would have the right to question or appeal any award made. My Department will continue to keep the scheme under review to ensure that any changes which can be made for the benefit of claimants are taken on board.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	992	The carer's benefit scheme is intended to support people who must leave the workforce temporarily to care for someone who is in need of full-time care and attention. This is a weekly income support payment which is based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer. The maximum duration of the carer's benefit scheme is set at 65 weeks as it is considered that employers would experience difficulties in preserving employee's rights for a longer period. However, it is important to note that each care recipient may receive a total of 65 weeks care. This may be claimed as a single continuous period or in separate time periods. In the event of a person's carer's benefit expiring and the need for income support still existing, the carer may apply  for carer's allowance. The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to carers on low incomes who look after people in need of full-time care and attention. As with all other social assistance schemes, a means test in which the income of both the applicant and his or her partner is assessed applies. The means test has been improved significantly in the past few years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of income from employment and other sources. Provision was made in the 2002 budget to increase the weekly income disregards to €191 for a single person and to €382 for a couple from April 2002. These disregards ensure that a couple with two children, earning a joint income in the region of €22,617, will qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance, or they can earn up to €36,364 and still qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, plus the free schemes and respite care grant.The person concerned was assessed with weekly means of €117.92 which entitles her to a carer's allowance of €10.10, with an additional allowance in respect of two qualified children, giving a total payment of €26.90. She also receives the annual respite care grant and the full range of free schemes. Her weekly means were derived from her spouse's earnings of €34,881 per annum. The question of further improvements in the carer's allowance and carer's benefit scheme is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	993	The purpose of the back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme is to assist families on low incomes who would otherwise face hardship if they had to meet the full cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. The scheme is specifically targeted at families on low incomes. In the case of a couple with two children, the income limit is €334 per week. The purpose of the carer's allowance is to provide income support to full time carers below certain income levels. It recognises and supports the valuable role of these carers in keeping older people and people with disabilities in the community. For this reason, the carer's allowance is not targeted solely at people on low incomes who might otherwise face financial hardship. For example, in cases where the person being cared for lives with a couple, €382 per week is disregarded in full in the means test for the carer's allowance. In the case of a couple with two children, a family can have a gross income of more than double the income limit for the back-to-school clothing and footwear scheme and still qualify for the carer's allowance.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	994	Exceptional needs payments, which can be made by health boards under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, are subject to a means test. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or health board payment. Entitlement to an exceptional needs payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is a matter for the local health board which administers the scheme. The South-Eastern Health Board has advised that a payment was made to the person concerned following the loss of her purse. The board has further advised that it is satisfied that the assistance provided was appropriate to the circumstances of the case.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-19 00:00:00	Prelude	995	The RAPID programme operates under the aegis of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. It is, however, a cross-Department initiative and, while there is no specific funding provided for RAPID projects in my Department, moneys are available through the family services project under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, employment support services under the special projects fund and through the family resource centre programme, which can be applied in RAPID areas.To date, my Department has received a total of 15 requests for funding from nine RAPID areas, and payments totalling of €170,900 to support these initiatives have been allocated or opposed. My Department is represented in the implementation and monitoring committees of the RAPID programme as part of its role in relation to priority and social exclusion. In line with the RAPID programme's objective of using existing structures and resources to progress its aims, the resources available under the services already outlined will continue to form the basis of my Department's contribution to supporting the programme.
