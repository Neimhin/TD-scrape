I raised the issue last week when I used the example of the Curam clinic in Swords in north County Dublin which I visited on 16 November. There are strong rumours abounding that there will be a 10% cut in the budget for adult mental health services. While there is no question but that the Government has tough choices to make we were promised an open and transparent budgetary process. It is important, in advance of the budget, that we have a discussion of our priorities. In Curam 450 people with mental health issues are being counselled. They have been moved out of their offices and shoehorned into the back of a HSE office which has no facilities. For the past four weeks there has been no telephone access for any client who wishes to ring up to ascertain what facilities are available in the whole north County Dublin area. There are no proper nursing facilities and no counselling facilities. It is an absolute outrage in the constituency of the Minister for Health. In broader terms, there is a need for a proper discussion on mental health services and adult mental health services. Rightly so, the issue of suicide is raised regularly in the House and I agree with every contribution that has been made. We have to see what is important in these straitened times and where our resources should go. A proper reasoned debate on that issue is required. As I have done every week for the past eight weeks, I ask where the Government stands on the issue of home help services and home help funding. As everybody is aware home help services were reduced by 500,000 hours earlier in the year and a further 450,000 hours are being cut by the Government to save €8 million. This is contrary to promises given by Fine Gael and the Labour Party prior to the election that not only would the Government retain home help services it would expand them. That was further restated in the programme for Government.In our alternative budget proposal that is fully costed, Fianna Fáil has shown how the cuts can be reversed, yet still achieving the €3.5 billion adjustment needed while protecting mental health services, home helps and carers, and ring-fencing education. Because I am not getting answers from the Government, I propose an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Health come to the House and confirm to us what is happening to home help services. Will the Government reverse the cuts totalling 950,000 hours it implemented this year? Will the Government give a commitment not to make further cuts in the home help service next year? It is a false economy. As many colleagues on the Government side have pointed out, the assessments being carried out are not being made case by case but are being applied across the board. The elderly and the infirm who deserve to be looked after at home will end up in hospitals. Most people agree that, if possible, they should be looked after at home to allow them to retain their dignity and independence. They have had their hours slashed. Despite raising the issue repeatedly, I have not received an answer from the Government as to what the current position is. Therefore, I am proposing an amendment to the Order of Business that the Minister for Health come to the House and reaffirm the Government's commitment in the programme for Government that there would be no cuts to home help services.

Ireland, which has now been published. I welcome its publication yesterday and welcome that chapter 7 of the report clearly indicates that the best option for implementing the European Court of Justice judgment in the case of A, B and C v. Ireland is legislation, with regulation. I welcome that yesterday's Cabinet meeting agreed a clear timeline, with debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas in the next three weeks, a Cabinet decision to be taken before the end of this Dáil term and the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children holding hearings early in January. It is welcome that the Cabinet has expressed the need to move swiftly on this issue. We need to be conscious of how high feelings have been running since the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar. Women are camping outside Leinster House with the slogan of "never again" and making the point that it has been 20 years since the Supreme Court decision in the X case. I believe large numbers of people will appear outside Leinster House tonight to protest against the Government voting down Deputy Clare Daly's Bill. It is very important the Government has indicated it will move swiftly on this issue. I very much welcome the comments of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, in the Dáil last night and again this morning that the Government will act on this issue and that the Government's action will not go anything like as far as many of us would want. The Minister also made it clear that whatever option is taken - I very much hope it will be legislation, which the Labour Party has urged - it cannot leave out suicide risk. The risk to life of a pregnant woman needs to cover both physical risk and risk of suicide, and that will also need to be legislated for. To suggest we could legislate for a bit of the judgment in the X case is like saying a woman could be a little bit pregnant. It is simply not possible. The judgment in the X case has been confirmed by the people in two separate referenda in 1992 and 2002. It is very clear that it is incumbent on the Government to move swiftly and to legislate. I look forward to our debate on the matter in coming weeks.

It is very largely a cosmetic exercise that conceals the reality for many people. Another soup kitchen is opening today. Unemployment is increasing and people are unable to pay their bills. We are all experiencing straitened circumstances. Remarkably we have learned today that children in schools with no heating in the winter are being told by their teachers to jump up and down and to skip. Their parents are receiving texts advising them to put on extra clothes. I find this pretty appalling. It is Dickensian and hits the poorest and neediest sections in the hardest way possible. They are expected to make up the deficit by raising funds themselves. A substantial number of schools are in debt. Therefore, we must ask the Leader to pass the message to the Government that the Taoiseach's leadership of Europe should not be cosmetic in the way the road improvements around Dublin Castle are. The Taoiseach has been awarded European of the year, on which we wish him well. He has become the poster boy of Europe on the cover of Time magazine. We now need to ask him to step up and earn that reputation. As President of Europe he can put Ireland firmly on the agenda and seek to make arrangements and create the context in which the people will no longer suffer with the system put before them. I speak as a man and abortion will not affect me. It is a difficult and complex subject, but we should always attempt to understand the position of the other person, in this case a woman. Some 20 years ago or more I said during a debate in this House I was glad of three things: first, that I was not heterosexual; second, that I was not a woman; and third, that I was not married to any man who would value me at the same level as and on the same terms of equality with the fertilised egg. I ask anybody who feels this to try to reverse the equation and ask how he would feel if his wife, girlfriend or consort placed that kind of value on him after 20 years of bearing his children, feeding them, washing their clothes and loving them. That is the value placed on them at the end of it. Mr. Halappanavar put it very well when he said there was a bigger life involved - the life of a woman who could continue to bear children.

Many horses are not microchipped, even though it has been a requirement since 2009. I will give an example of the mayhem they are causing. In Kilkenny over the weekend horses broke from wherever they were being held, went up a country road and into people's gardens, including the garden of a nursing home that was destroyed. Nobody is taking responsibility. I want the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to come to House and make a statement on whether all horses born after 1 July 2009 are being microchipped. Is the law being enforced whereby a horse caught wandering three times in the previous 12 months may be seized, resulting in the owner not getting the animal back? Another part of the legislation provides that the local authority may decide to dispose of a horse that has been detained on two or more occasions in the previous 12 months. Is that being done? It costs €34.16 to license a horse and a further €16 to microchip it, which comes to €50 or so. Some families have 40 or 50 horses. How can these people afford horses? They are causing mayhem on the roads, with children under 16 years often in charge of horses, which is against the law. People on country roads are in danger owing to people having sulky races on these roads. In the 1930s a person with a pony and trap was required to have a number plate for that trap. I ask the Minister to consider requiring these sulkies to be licensed and carry a number plate. It should cost money for people to own them. The people concerned are not treating the rest of the community with respect and are causing a danger on the roads. Are the laws relating to microchipping, horses wandering and horses that have been detained twice being enforced?
#TerryLeyden	unknown-#TerryLeyden-party	unknown-#TerryLeyden-dob	unknown-#TerryLeyden-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	6	I second Senator Darragh O'Brien's amendment to the Order of Business on the home help service. Most Members of the House have been attending meetings. Senator Kelly and I attended a public meeting on Monday night organised by SIPTU in Hannon's Hotel in Roscommon town. We heard from home help workers who are helping and serving many people in the community. Fianna Fáil has a very proud record in this regard in that we established the home help concept. When I was a member of the health board, being a home help went from being a voluntary part-time job to being a full-time job, albeit not well paid. Although it is one of the least paid jobs in the HSE services, it provides a vital service. It is galling that in the general election campaign Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised to maintain, develop and expand home help services. It is another broken promise, which we know is a regular event. In this regard, there is no reason to cut the amount involved because it is approximately €8 million. The Government is now trying to save another 500,000 hours, which just will not work.One carer was looking after two elderly persons for one and a half hours and had to change and prepare them and do everything else. They outlined the position. It is pretty galling when they know that so many who have received massive handouts in pensions are getting away without bearing the burden. In the circumstances, I strongly recommend to my colleagues on the opposite side that they ensure funding will be restored because they will pay the price at the next general election and local elections. The trouble is that the elderly are paying the price. That is the tragedy of the matter.

We attended a meeting on Monday night last in Roscommon where home helps were reduced to tears trying to explain the bonds that they have created with the elderly with whom they have worked for years, being deprived of hours of home help and how it is affecting the elderly. I appreciate what Senator Leyden stated, namely, that Fianna Fáil has a proud record. I made the point at that meeting that five or six years ago we should have been worried about this issue because we were down to talking about home help minutes when the Senator's party was in government and now the issue has come to a head. We do not have a vote on budgetary matters.

We do not have a vote on budgetary matters, but we are aware that it makes no economic sense whatsoever to take such persons out of their homes and put them into hospital. I need to know whether there are economists advising the Ministers making these decisions on budget day. There are other issues. Children who have ADHD are being deprived domiciliary care allowance because the medical profession does not recognise the disease ADHD, even though, as those who watched "Prime Time" last week will be aware, it is harrowing to see what families are going through to look after children who have this ailment. I ask the Leader to bring to the attention of the Minister, Deputy Reilly, the importance of this issue when it comes to budget day and that there be no cuts. Whereas I support Senator Darragh O'Brien's call on this issue, I do not support his call for an amendment to the Order of Business because he will be aware that the Minister will not come here to discuss budgetary matters with him in advance of the budget.

The reason I bring it up is the Central Bank is moving from its offices in Dame Street to the former Anglo Irish Bank's headquarters on the quays. I do not know whether the Central Bank has a fountain planned for that office; I hope not. However, I was surprised at the number of staff the Central Bank employs. For Ireland alone, it employs 1,500 staff - that is why it is moving - and yet the European Central Bank based in Frankfurt employs only 1,400 for the whole of Europe. It seems there is a danger that we get into the habit of the luxury of too many staff to do a technical job and also of buildings that are far beyond our need. I think of the unfortunate death yesterday of Mr. Hugh O'Regan, a man I did not know well. I met him approximately five years ago. It was a time where this House was going to have to vacate this premises to go somewhere else. There was talk of the Seanad moving to the National History Museum. Mr. O'Regan asked me, "Would you pass on an offer that I would like to make to you of the United Services Club?" That is the club next door to the St. Stephen's Green club that he owned at the time. He said, "I would like to offer it to the nation for a couple of years so that the Seanad could sit there." It was not needed in the end and was not used. I mention it because developers got a bad name in recent years but there were some things we should remember of those who wanted to give back to the nation a great deal of the benefits they had. I remember Mr. O'Regan whom I did not know well in that regard and my sympathy goes to the family. My last point is one I brought up previously, namely, the frustration of getting our Order Paper every day in a sealed envelope. I do not know why we waste so much paper and funding on doing so. I suppose I am a little careful with what I spend my money on. I was going to unseal these envelopes to use them again, except I discovered they have also put my name on the outside as well and I would have to write to myself. I am sure somebody should draw attention to this and ask why there is a need to have the Order Paper sent to everyone in a sealed envelop, with all of that paper, with our name and address, which is Leinster House I assume I am not the only one getting it; everybody else is getting it. Most of us, with the exception of one Senator who corrected me, have an iPad or some means of contact by which to relay information without needing paper. Let us start an anti-paper campaign.

That is the type of timeline and clarity we need. Between this and then, I appeal for cool heads on this issue to give the Minister and the Cabinet the time to make the correct recommendation and to go with the correct option. I request a debate on Shannon Airport at some stage in the near future. The Cabinet discussed the issue of the break-up of Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority and the amalgamation of Shannon Airport with Shannon Development which will happen in the new year. Unfortunately, there has been a slight delay with the announcement of the detail on this issue because there are a couple of small matters that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, needs to clarify. I understand that this delay will be a matter of days as opposed to weeks. I commend the Minister. He is in government 18 months and we now have a firm commitment and clarity on the future of Shannon Airport which is so vital, not only for County Clare but for the mid-west and western regions. For decades it has been a gateway for millions of tourists from America and all over the world and it has the potential of being a gateway to generate and drive, not only tourism development in the west but, with the new entity of Shannon Development combined with it, industrial and economic development and job creation. It is a novel move by the Minister. This agency will have a specific brief to attract aviation industries. Shannon has been synonymous during the years with aviation-related industries and a new emphasis in that area must be welcomed. I also welcome the fact that there are memoranda of understanding already signed with myriad companies that will, in the next couple of years, result in 12,000 new jobs for the Shannon region. It is a good news story. It certainly warrants debate in this House in due course.

In response, the Leader read the qualifying criteria used by the Minister for the selection of primary care centres across the State. What Senator Cummins did not explain, and what he must, is how at the eleventh hour the Minister was able to include areas and sites from his own constituency and that of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan.Any site that was included could fit into the criteria if necessary but in reality the Minister of State resigned because she could not stomach stroke politics. The CEO of the HSE has resigned because he could not work under the Minister for Health either. It is vital that the Government acts on this issue and I support the amendment to the Order of Business to have the Minister come to the House to discuss the cuts to home helps. There is also a major overspend in the hospitals that will have an impact on services when adjustments must be made. I simply do not have faith in the Minister to run the health service. He has the Midas touch in reverse, where everything he touches turns into a complete mess. We see that with hospitals up and down the State, including in the Leader's area in Waterford and the south east, with planned hospital reconfiguration and a possible downgrade of Waterford Regional Hospital. The bigger issue is whether the people trust the Minister and if he is doing what he was elected to do. In my view, he is not and he puts stroke politics front and centre instead of the interests of patients or the people. I reiterate my call, despite the assurances the Leader gave yesterday, which I simply do not accept, for the Minister for Health to resign and if he does not have the stomach or courage to resign himself, he should be sacked by the Taoiseach for his performance as Minister for Health and because he put his own constituency ahead of the wider interests of the people.

Last week I raised the issue of a primary care centre in Cork where it was agreed in 2004 that it would be built. Here we are seven years later and it is still not open. The HSE cannot give a date for when it will be opened, yet it paid €956,000 for it. It was built four years ago and has been vacant since. Perhaps we should look at what was already built before we look at new sites being identified. In fairness to the Minister, he identified two new centres but if we look at the time for this centre, they will not be built for seven years going by the current rate of progress. I wish to raise the issue of care of the elderly and nursing homes. I remind my colleague on the Opposition side of the House that €485 million was wasted when it had to be paid back to people in nursing homes because of the previous Government's failure to put in place proper legislation.

We are not doing that; we approaching this in a hit and miss fashion when we must start planning for the long term. The number of people going into elder care is growing all the time and we must have a strategy for that. I met people from nursing homes this morning and they told me they have never had the chance to sit down with all the other parties to deal with long-term planning. There is a need for that and I ask the Leader to allow a debate on the matter and to invite the Department of Health, the HSE and all other involved parties to sit down around the table as soon as possible.

I am sure, however, many businesses and those of us within the city centre area will bemoan the disruption once construction starts. While that is good news, it is tempered by the statement made earlier this morning at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport and Communications by Mr. Cormac O'Rourke, the chairman designate of the National Roads Authority and Railway Procurement Agency, which are being merged. I raised the issue of ongoing road maintenance requirements on our new national motorways, apart even from the regional and national roads. He has revealed there will be a shortfall of €100 million in the maintenance budget. This is a serious issue if it continues unchecked because that shortfall could rise to €200 million next year. Those of us who have been here long enough know that during the recession in the 1980s, one of the most damaging factors in infrastructural terms was the loss of revenue to local authorities for the maintenance of local and regional roads. It haunted us for the next ten or 15 years across two Administrations. We were all involved. I know the Minister is coming, but I am directing my comments not so much at him through the Leader, but at Government Members of the House in order that they can raise the issue at the meetings of their parliamentary parties. Most of us have been involved in local authorities and know the severe damage as a result of the reduction in the budget for road maintenance. If this is going to happen to a road network we can be proud of, and which is an important link in our trading capacity, the issue must be raised in order that the necessary money is made available to the NRA, despite the current severe difficulties.

Professor Ivan Perry of UCC, in conjunction with safefood launched a report yesterday that gave the cost of obesity in Ireland. We have not discussed obesity in detail but this report is very important. It has found that €1.64 billion is being spent on obesity-related illness per year across the island, with €1.13 billion spent in the State. We are talking about health but money talks. The Minister for Health should come into the Chamber to discuss this report in detail because there is such invaluable information in the report. We have been talking about obesity for years but when this is broken down, we see what we can do with preventive measures. Obesity in children has very much become an issue and we must take it seriously. The Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government must ensure local government plays a part with sports partnerships and the provision of adult exercise facilities and children's playgrounds. I would like to see further funding in local communities on exercise and exercise programmes. There must be community-led sports partnerships to take communities by the hand. This will not cost money; it will save the State €1.3 billion per year. I am asking the Leader, therefore, to ask the Ministers for Health and the Environment, Community and Local Government to come in to discuss this report.

I am sure this will have many desirable effects but the warning from the extension of medical cards to the over 70s should be borne in mind because that cost far more than was expected. The cost per patient varies between 4.4 times and 4.8 times the average when treating an affluent person over 70 who has a medical card in a system that previously dealt with low income clients. There are dangers in proceeding so perhaps this should be done gradually instead of in one fell swoop given our experience with how much it cost last time.Perhaps the measure should be extended gradually rather than implemented in one fell swoop, given our experience of how much it cost the last time.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	23	I join other Senators in calling for a debate on the expert group's report. It is important that the debate take place prior to any decision being taken by the Government, if we are to have any input into it. Once the decision is made, all we will be doing is commenting after the event. It is interesting that the report discusses the role of psychiatrists and mentions that in the case of suicidal ideation there are recognised clinical challenges in correctly diagnosing express suicide intent. The absence of recognised clinical markers makes it a more subjective process. We must bear that in mind. It was interesting for people who took the trouble to go to the address on the paper by Patricia Casey this morning to hear about the research she has carried out. It shows that between 1980 and 2011, a period of 31 years, there were 686,000 births in the three major maternity hospitals in Dublin. Two people died from what are called maternal suicides. Maternal suicide is where the woman dies during the pregnancy or within the six weeks following the birth. Both cases occurred in the six weeks following the birth. In one case, the woman had a history of depression and in the second case the woman had a history of abuse. There were, therefore, other reasons for it. We must have this debate because the guidelines and regulations must be teased out vis-à-vis the option of legislation. The problem with taking the legislative route, according to what I am told by lawyers, is that one must legislate for the X case judgment. That case includes suicide and taking that route means opting for a liberal abortion regime.

Perhaps the Leader might ensure that we keep that dialogue going with the Minister for Education and Skills in order that as soon as the working group has reported we will again consider it. It is a matter of what we will do about this. Doing is what is required, we cannot simply talk about it. Children's lives are being lost. I extend my deep sympathy to Lara's family.

We all appreciate the dangers in that regard. I will bring the matter to the attention of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Perhaps the Senator should raise it as an Adjournment matter also. Senator Quinn raised the issue of the Central Bank and the number of people employed there compared with the European Central Bank. The Cathaoirleach outlined the position on brown envelopes and Order Papers. We have been raising this issue for years and, as the Cathaoirleach mentioned, the Committee on Procedure and Privileges will take it up also. The wheels grind slowly when getting little things like that to happen, but I hope it will happen soon. Senator Cullinane referred to primary care centres and the criteria used, which I outlined yesterday. On the one hand, the Senator is criticising overspending but, on the other, he is looking for more money to be spent on other services. He cannot have his bread buttered on both sides. Again, Sinn Féin is engaging in a cynical exercise in what it is doing with regard to the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly. Senator Colm Burke asked for a debate on the nursing home issue and the plan for care of the elderly. We can arrange that debate early in the new year. Senator Mooney welcomed the proposed linking of the Luas lines, which is long overdue. I note his point on road maintenance, especially in the case of motorways. Senator Keane raised the issue of preventive medicine and referred to a new report published on obesity related illnesses. Again, that is an issue we can discuss early in the new year. I note Senator Barrett's comments on free general practitioner, GP, care and his advice that it be introduced on a gradual basis rather than being implemented straightaway. Other Senators raised the question of the expert group's report. The matter will be addressed in the House the week after next. Senator O'Keeffe also raised the question of the working group on bullying and asked that we act on the report when it is published. We all share her sentiments.

We held an interesting debate on some related matters last week. The Minister of State raised a valuable point about a matter on which he was working, namely, the empty leg of a school bus trip when the driver goes home after delivering the children to school. The Minister of State wondered whether there would be any way to use that leg in rural areas where there was a deficit in formal public transport services. He would like to develop this initiative and I commend him for his idea. I will address the amendments, but the previous way of dealing with this issue was the rural transport initiative, which spent €9 million on 500,000 journeys, amounting to €36 per round trip. The Minister of State's proposal is an advance on this and illustrates that he is thinking outside the system. Having run out of money in the middle of the year and needing an extra €36 million, the company covered by this Bill is seeking more borrowing powers. Two problems inform the amendments that I have tabled, of which monopolistic thinking is first. Since the 1930s, a significant amount of public money has been given to a single company and there has been no competition for those subsidies. A grant was directly awarded, but this is an inefficient system. Much to the annoyance of the then Senator Paschal Donohoe, the 2009 debate on that grant was guillotined. Even the amount of time that the then President had to read the documentation on that uncompetitive way of doing business was curtailed by the invocation of a section of the Constitution. We need more than one instrument to realise what we seek to do in terms of transport. We also need a much higher standard of evaluation of investments. Left to itself, CIE will get into trouble again, the Minister of State and his successors will come to the Seanad looking for more money and the projects will not be evaluated. Amendment No. 1 attempts to address these problems. As proposed by the Minister of State, page 3 of the Bill reads: "the Board may, other than for the purposes of capital expenditure". This relates to non-capital borrowing and should read "other than for the purposes of capital expenditure and the distortion of market competition". I have misgivings about non-capital borrowing. With capital borrowing, there is at least the pretence that an asset is being created. Can we address the underlining productivity problems to which the Minister of State referred last week? There has been a 20% reduction in passenger numbers and an estimated 95% of rail freight has disappeared in a ten or 15-year period. If the lost passenger kilometres and freight tonne kilometres are divided by the number of staff, productivity has declined, despite a considerable programme of capital investment. For what will the money be used? As the Minister of State mentioned, it will be for non-capital purposes, but it should not be used to distort competition further. The October 2011 AECOM-Goodbody review of Iarnród Éireann contained a wealth of evidence. On routes from Dublin to Belfast, Cork, Waterford and, notably, Galway, there is an active, growing, independent bus sector. For example, there are 45 frequences per day to Galway. This expansion in particular has taken approximately 45% of business from trains. The overall decline in train passenger numbers is approximately 20%, but the Galway route has lost approximately 40%. Many customers want to use that route, as the motorway has improved accessibility. They are obviously attracted to this option, as they have diverted to it. For the taxpayer, the attraction is that the companies in question do not ask the Oireachtas for money on a regular basis. Their investments must be in the marketplace and meet the criteria, which is not CIE's record. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport intends these moneys to be used to meet obligations to the National Transport Authority, NTA. The Bill reads: "for meeting its obligations and carrying out its duties". My problem with this is that there was no competitive tendering for those obligations. Through my amendment, I hope to provide the NTA with a say over the €36 million emergency funding. The increased borrowing from €107 million to €300 million should at least be used for purposes that are not decided by CIE, but by the independent NTA and, as I call for in subsequent amendments, the Minister. I fear that this problem will recur. CIE has a record of looking for more money and the Department has a record of not listening to alternative service suppliers, yet those services are being readily availed of in the open market, particularly on the routes to which I referred. Policy is being made in too narrow a circle. The House should not vote money to disadvantage further those people who do not ask us for subsidies and who compete openly in the market. The issue of what the money will be used for is crucial. The Bill specifies that it is not to be used for capital purposes, but I would add that it should not be used to distort competition and drive out of business those companies that pay their way. This has been a problem for many decades. As Mr. Justice Bryan McMahon found in the Swords Express case, the Department doubly disadvantaged the applicant. Galway deregulation occurred because Mr. Pat Nestor took the Department to court. The Department has a bad record of seeking market alternatives. Unless the House and the Minister of State make a stand, this money will likely distort competition further. A company that has received free buses from the taxpayer and more than €500 million in Exchequer grants is competing against companies that pay for their own buses and never seek operating subsidies. We must ensure that this situation does not continue. I appreciate the Minister of State's wish for this money to be used to meet CIE's obligations and to carry out its duties and for them to be independently specified. This is the purpose of amendments Nos. 1 and 2. May I discuss amendment No. 3?

Amendment No. 4 reads: "and not for the purpose of distorting market competition". I have addressed this point and I thank the House for its indulgence. Amendment No. 3 relates to the top of page 4. As I interpret this section, the CIE board establishes the priority of such charges. I hope my interpretation is correct. I am citing the top two lines on page 4, which read: "establishing the priority of such charges among themselves". Does this mean among board members? The board is the problem. The guidance on how the money will be spent should include the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the NTA and involve some independent evaluation of the investments. As such, it should be subject to section 1(1), which specifies that expenditure would be made "with the consent of the Minister and of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform". If I have interpreted the provision correctly, it would be wrong for the board to make this decision without referring to the Ministers.We are trying to correct a problem rather than providing more money for the organisation to continue as it has up to now. Those comments relate to the sections regarding competition. Is this a serious proposal? The Goodbody report from 2005 indicated that the independent bus fleet, with 4,859 vehicles, provided double the capacity of the Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann fleet, with 6,000 employees. They expanded fleets by 91% without subsidy between 1992 and 2003, with an income of €307 million in 2003, some 77% more than Dublin Bus, 41% more than Bus Éireann and 124% more than railway passenger receipts. They are big operators with a remarkable business despite the best efforts of the Department to stop them doing that business. We should bring these operators into play because the country is short of money. If we are to give more money to today's applicant, we need new procedures, a more active Department and the involvement of other Ministers. The National Transport Authority should buy this socially necessary transport on behalf of society as a whole rather than having the strange position of having the decisions made by the board of CIE. Later sections of the Bill also indicate that decisions are to be made by the board of CIE. As the organisation is applying to operate services for the Minister on behalf of the wider society, it is not worth handing over all the sovereignty to the board to decide on what to spend the money. This is an opportunity to act, as there is a difficulty in the public finances in this company which arose after the Dáil and the Seanad adjourned. Did the company not know it was running out of money before July and why could we not have had this discussion in the spring? The Minister of State's suggestions could have been brought forward along with mine at that stage. Much stricter controls are necessary to ensure a proper performance in the market and proper value for public money, which requires safeguards.

I know he has listened very carefully to Senator Barrett's comments in the past and will do so on this occasion as well. I come from a business background where we did not understand the distortion of the market through subsidies to competitors. We can consider the example of air traffic. I have often said how we remember what used to happen with the Dublin-London route. There were two airlines, both owned by governments and subsidised. They were not run in the interests of the customer but rather the interests of the owners. The United Kingdom owned British Airways and Aer Lingus was owned by the Government. I am pleased to say that whether we were forced or encouraged by the European Union to bring it about, we grabbed hold of the issue and put competition in the sector. We can see how dramatic change has occurred, not just with Ryanair and other airlines entering the market but within the airlines that operated on the route, such as Aer Lingus, because they had to adjust to the market in the interests of consumers. It seems we have not come to that point in other transport areas, where competition will solve problems. Senator Barrett has outlined how the market is distorted, when a subsidy is used for the loss-making operation of a State company. The company is not being run in the interests of the consumer or its customers but rather the interest of its owners, the State and the taxpayer. Senator Barrett has made a strong case and it should not be ignored.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	76	I thank the Senators for their comments and appreciate the spirit in which they were made. I will get to amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 4. We are in difficult circumstances. We have had a fairly thorough debate and I hope Senators appreciate the honesty with which I conduct debates every time I come here. I have probably been here on more occasions than most in discussing my areas of responsibility. CIE was caught in a perfect storm. I am not saying that everything done by the company is perfect as I know that is not the case. Passenger numbers declined, which hit revenues, and the company was also severely affected by the necessity to change the public service order subvention. It was affected by the change in the fuel rebate and fluctuation in fuel prices as well. The combination of those factors had a major impact on the company's circumstances. I understand the commentary but we should remember that we have one of the least subsidised public transport systems in the 27 EU countries. I remember noting that when I was an MEP. By and large, public transport does not make money, although it is a necessity for a state for other economic and social reasons. Cherry-picking certain components can lead to them being profitable but we must consider necessary integration. That fact cannot be lost. The Government is in the process of considering bus markets but I challenge anybody to put forward a model that would make competition viable in Irish rail. It would be very challenging to bring about competition and make it profitable. We are in a challenging environment but we must work with what we have. The controls referenced by the Senators, and which are noted in the amendments I will address in a few minutes, are being dealt with by the Department. There is a hands-on relationship between the Department and the company that is necessitated by the current environment. This is relevant to the issues contained in the amendments, although there are practical reasons I will not accept them. I nevertheless accept the spirit in which the amendments have been tabled. The issue is in flux and must be managed. I welcome Senator Barrett's comments on rural transport and the operation of school bus services. I cannot agree to amendment No. 1 as the reference to distortion of market competition is not appropriate to a general provision dealing with shareholder consent for borrowing by CIE. It is implicit that Ministers must have regard to EU state aid rules and competition law requirements, of which I am sure the Senators are well aware in so far as such matters may arise in granting consent to specific borrowing proposals. Amendment No. 3 is not warranted. The intention of subsection (3) is to enable CIE to offer security for its borrowings. The wording is similar to that used in other legislation conferring this power in respect of the granting of security to lenders. Subsection (3)(b), as currently worded, merely provides that the priority of security arrangements may be agreed with lenders. Where such security is required, the current text provides that the terms and conditions of such security for loan finance necessitates ministerial consent under subsection (1). The Minister has the ultimate power in that regard. I do not favour amendment No. 4 as it is not appropriate to a provision dealing with security arrangements for lenders.Coming into this Department I had to assess, with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, many of the options in terms of competition, its impact in regard to Bus Éireann, the Expressway routes, whether some areas have improved and so on.  We also have to examine international comparisons and I will make two general points on that issue because they may shape some of the other comments on the amendments. First, I believe there is no such thing as best practice; there is practice in circumstances. Ireland is different from Britain which is different from France and Germany. One size does not fit all. We can take practice and circumstances and we can learn from what others do but all circumstances are different and we must shape policy in accordance with the requirements of each individual state and its needs for public transport. I would do that in every other area. Second, we must understand that competition imposes other responsibilities in regard to the interoperability and integration of services. I am working hard on many integration services and whether it be the Leap card, which I had to take over to get it over the line, various other national journey planners or integration of timetables across services, they must all be borne in mind to ensure that we do not lose out wherever there is an opening up of markets. There are experiences in other jurisdictions where there are savings to the state and profit making by private operators, and fair play to them, but over the medium to long term we see that in many cases competition deteriorates. I give the example of Sweden in that regard. Those are two points to bear in mind regarding that general topic. I oppose the first three grouped amendments for the reasons stated even though I acknowledge they were tabled because of the sincere wishes of the Senators.

I understand Senator Barrett's concerns that this money may be used to subsidise routes but we must remember the emphasis in terms of this Bill. Twenty-five years ago CIE's borrowing limit was IR£107 million and its borrowing limit now has been increased to €300 million. It is important to remember also that the changes in the Bill remove the possibility of the State guaranteeing these borrowings, in other words, we cannot break European Union law in regard to guaranteeing this and, therefore, CIE must stand on its own feet in that if it borrows this €300 million it must pay it back. CIE is in the business of public transport and as the Minister stated, public transport does not make money. Public transport must be provided for the people but for the best value and to allow the best usage. As I stated on the previous occasion, we cannot allow private companies or CIE to cherry-pick the profitable routes. Public transport is about providing services to all parts of the country - rural and urban. We may say that certain routes are profitable but they still must be provided because people in rural Ireland deserve to be supported. Under the Minister of State CIE will be watched in terms of the way it borrows and spends this money. We must remember that in regard to CIE's many losses in the past three years. Some €113 million was spent in the restructuring of the company and there are 557 fewer employees. The Minister of State, Deputy Kelly, and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, are making CIE a leaner, meaner, better company and I have full confidence in both of them in this matter. I will be opposing the amendments.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	78	We also have commitments to the IMF and reference was made to the rail review and the need not to further distort competition. It is concerned about this area but I will not press the amendment because I am having a dialogue with the Minister and not in a confrontational way. It is documented in the strategic rail review that the independent bus companies have provided a service without subsidy or investment grants. Bus Éireann gets €300,000 to compete with those companies. I always hear the Department saying the position is different in Sweden and the United Kingdom. These are independent Irish companies. They do not get any subsidy, yet they have gone on to dominate most of the routes in terms of frequency. Presumably, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, would welcome people like that in terms of innovation and entrepreneurship. That is what the economy needs. I want the maximum pressure put on CIE not to go to the Department, run out of money half way through the year or try to achieve regulatory capture over the Department, which it has, but to develop much stricter investment appraisals than it has had previously. The Minister referred to some of those on the previous occasion. The more competitive pressure it is put under, the better. Senator Quinn mentioned Aer Lingus, which was always seeking free capital when it was a monopoly. Under the current management and board it has responded better than any other State airline to the Ryanair challenge. In our circumstances feather-bedding by any company, including CIE, is not a good idea. The National Transport Authority, which got off to a bad footing in this House by awarding all the routes through direct award contract without competitive tendering, must act on behalf of the taxpayer. What is the point in subsidising one person with a free bus and an operating subsidy when we have not even asked any other operator? It must step up to the plate in that regard.  I may have misinterpreted but I understand "among themselves" to mean between CIE and its lenders rather than the CIE board. I appreciate what the Minister said about controls. Section 1, which amends section 28(1) of the principal Act, states that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister will be involved because this is not the first time this company has been in crisis. It has a record of seeking supplementary Estimates. The Minister published the supplementary Estimate for €36 million but that money was taken out of other areas in his Department, including road safety, public transport agencies, the smarter travel and carbon reduction programme, the public transport investment programme, the maritime administration and coastguard programme, the sports grants, the national sports campus, and tourism product development. As the Minister stated, that is a lot of money and we must make the company aware that this Parliament, which would be reluctant to take money from all the other areas he mentioned, does not want this to recur. We need an institutional structure that ensures that if it cannot operate a route we immediately have some other operator come in and do so. Perhaps we should take the Minister's idea on the school bus service in that we will be able to accomplish more for less, which is one of the goals of all of us. I thank the Minister for his response. I will not press amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 4.

#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	80	I move amendment No. 5:In page 4, line 20, after “capital” to insert the following:“and where an independent investment appraisal of the capital expenditure has been published”.My amendment seeks to add “and where an independent investment appraisal of the capital expenditure has been published” after "the provision of moneys for meeting any expenses incurred in connection with any permanent work the cost of which is properly chargeable to capital;". I am trying to deal with the capital side. We have dealt with the current side and our concerns about competition. This is a problem the Governor of the Central Bank wrote about in his ESRI days. Far too many capital expenditure appraisals in Ireland are part of the PR industry and are prepared by the promoters of projects. The promoters of the project know very well where the Exchequer is for funding the project but we do not have a guarantee of a return. In respect of the wider problem of the public finances, we do not need just a new Department to deal with public expenditure and reform but a central office of project evaluation that would publish evaluations, leave them for a year and at the end we could see the alternative and examine whether the calculation of costs is rigorous. This was a serious problem with Transport 21. The transport projects within it were not costed and the costings were not published individually. We knew the total bundle amounted to €34 billion. This is public money and the institutional framework to ensure it is spent efficiently is that the Comptroller and Auditor General turns up afterwards when it is all over. He acts as a coroner but we need early warning systems and we need to heed the Honohan caution that too many cost benefit analyses are done by promoters of projects. I saw the cost benefit analysis for the Kildare route project but there are more redactions than pages in the document. With the previous Minister with responsibility for energy, I appeared on a programme with Miriam O'Callaghan on the subject of the metro to Dublin Airport. We called it the Tipp-Ex report because so many numbers were covered by Tipp-Ex. Miriam O'Callaghan felt very strongly about it and I only played only a minor part in the debate. This is not good enough. Too much project appraisal amounts to secret subsidy seeking. Projects are not published upfront. We spend money on enough projects but we do not get good projects. There is a mountain of debt in the Department of Finance, which is why we are in trouble financially. We need stricter criteria for capital expenditure and they should be included in legislation. People ask what Parliament was doing about this but I have tabled an amendment requiring independent appraisal of capital expenditure. According to the IMF last week, even with a reduction, the capital programme remains approximately 4.2% of GDP compared with 2.8% throughout the OECD. It is an extremely large capital programme and has been captured in the past by the construction industry. The beneficiaries think it is wonderful but society as a whole pays the bill. We should be given some undertaking that the benefits exceed the costs and that there is the return from the projects. I support the Minister of State by saying we should have a strict review of capital and a greater role for the Department of Finance before we decide on capital projects such as the Kildare route project. In that case, the number of tracks doubled and the number of passengers decreased. Two additional tracks are not in use. There is a record of investments that do not yield a return and the Department must intervene. I have suggested the form in which it should intervene.

I understand Senator Barrett's sentiments in suggesting an independent investment appraisal of capital expenditure be published but I have the utmost confidence in the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. If CIE and the board want to invest in capital projects, the proposal passes through two Departments. A third body will lead to delays in important decisions on capital investment. I am not saying it would be incorrect but the independent body may decide that key investment should not be made. Where does that leave the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the board of CIE? Where does it go for a decision on whether the money should be spent? I have the utmost confidence and I do not agree with the amendment. The Departments will be heavily involved if there is major investment. I have utmost confidence that departmental officials will take everything into account before decisions are made to agree to capital expenditure proposals.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	82	I appreciate Senator Barrett's strong views on the importance of robust capital appraisal of public transport investment. He has made long-standing commentary on the issue. I am not in favour of the amendment proposing independent appraisal of capital expenditure, even though I have no disagreement with him on the need for projects to be appraised to the required standard by public transport operators. All agencies under the aegis of my Department are required to adhere to the Department's common appraisal framework, which was put in place in June 2009. I am sure Senator Barrett is aware of it. A key element of the framework is guidance on the conduct of cost benefit analysis, which is a requirement for all projects with the capital costs of €30 million or more. Furthermore, the public expenditure code of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, from July 2012, includes a wide range of material on the appraisal of programmes and projects, including a guide to cost benefit analysis. The code brings together all previous advisory material in order that procedures are up to speed with national and international guidelines and practices. The code strengthens procedures in order that citizens can be sure they are getting best value for use of scarce public funds. All public transport agencies will be required to adhere to these updated evaluation processes, with which I am sure the Senator agrees. I oppose the amendment.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	84	I have some sympathy for the Senator's view on this issue. Sections 1(4) and 1(5) restate previous provisions relating to the issuing of stock under section 28 of the Transport Act 1950. There is no current proposal for CIE to acquire any transport undertaking but, on balance, I prefer to retain the section, as it stands. I cannot accept the proposed amendment. The section was included in 1950, in a different world. It has been pulled across to protect against something that may happen in the future, however unlikely. It is not proposed that the section would be used in any way. I do not think the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, is proposing to nationalise the Swords Express.Although the Deputy makes a good point, we will not accept the amendment purely on the basis that there might be some minor reason or requirement in the future to use this provision, and I do not wish to create a situation where that would not be possible and would require other legislation.

We want the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the National Transport Authority. The provision currently provides that the board may lend money to a company - CIE lending to a subsidiary - to defray expenditure incurred by it for such purposes and subject to such terms and conditions as the board thinks fit. The board of CIE acts on our behalf and given the problems that arose in the first half of this year, should the Minister, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and the National Transport Authority not be involved? If it ran out of money in the first half of this year, should there not be stricter controls? That is the purpose of the amendment. On amendment No. 8, line 41 on page 4 states one of the subsidiaries "may, with the consent of the Board (and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board may determine) raise or borrow money...". Is there a case that the Minister should be involved at that stage, given the track record? Amendment No. 9 relates to section 2(3)(b) which states "establishing the priority of such charges among themselves". The Minister said that is the normal format in legislation, but who are "themselves"? Is it just the board or do we have supervision of what it does? That is the purpose of this batch of amendments.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	87	I oppose these amendments. We do not believe it is appropriate to accept amendment No. 7 as there are already sufficient safeguards in the legislation relating to the control of CIE's borrowing. Section 2 updates section 20 of the Transport (Re-Organisation of Córas Iompair Éireann) Act 1986 which deals with the power of the board to lend money to its subsidiaries. It is important that this flexibility is available to the CIE group. In addition, the proposed new subsection (4) provides that the amounts borrowed by the board and the companies cannot exceed the ceiling of €300 million established under the amended section 28(1) of the 1950 Act. This borrowing requires the consent of both Ministers. I do not consider amendment No. 8 appropriate. For corporate governance reasons it is the role of the CIE board to oversee lending within the CIE group, provided the €300 million ceiling for non-capital purposes is not exceeded, as provided for under subsection (4). I am opposed to amendment No. 9 because I do not believe there is a need for additional safeguards for the giving of security for borrowings, as the overall control of the CIE borrowing ceiling is set by both Ministers. Given that the National Transport Authority, NTA, is mentioned in the amendment, it is important to point out that the NTA is a regulator, not a shareholder. Including it in the middle of this legislation would change that role and that is not the role of the NTA. I understand what the Senator is trying to provide for but the checks and balances I have outlined are sufficient.

However, we must oppose the amendments. CIE is really three companies - Bus Éireann, Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann. The Minister cannot micromanage these companies. We must have confidence in the board that is appointed. If it believes it must lend money to any of the CIE subsidiaries, we must accept its judgment in the matter. We cannot have the Minister or the Minister of State micromanaging these companies.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	89	Page 31 of the Aecom report states that the rail safety programme between 1999 and 2013 cost €1.7 billion. Indecon looked at it and found that it had saved 123 animals. They must be the most expensive animals ever. We must see where these programmes yield a return. In comparison, the safety budget of the Road Safety Authority is €18.6 million and the budget for the Health and Safety Authority is under €20 million in a year. We have these clichéd, very expensive programmes but does anybody ever evaluate them? That is my concern. There is an immense task before the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly. The companies just continue on and then get into difficulties in the middle of the year, which is why the Bill is before us. Incidentally, page 93 of that document states that non-stopping private sector services are very competitive with rail in terms of end-to-end journeys. The costs are shown on page 141. It is 12 cent per kilometre by rail and another 12 cent in subsidy, while it is 7 cent by bus, some of which require no subsidy. There are serious resource allocation issues that were not addressed, certainly before the Minister's term of office. While we are under pressure all the time about special needs assistants, home helps and so forth, some of these programmes are apparently being flagged through without question. The Minister mentioned one of them, the Dublin city centre re-signalling project from Lansdowne Road to Malahide. It cost €290 million. That is more than the Luas cost. What type of signals are involved and is there an independent appraisal as to whether that €290 million was a worthwhile investment? What is it supposed to do? Before the Abbeylara judgment limited the power of the Oireachtas there was an investigation by the House of a signalling programme on lightly used main lines which went from €18 million to €63 million. The inquiry had to be dropped because the courts decided the House could not investigate things where people might be found guilty. All of these programmes must be analysed. The maintenance cost for a kilometre of track is €95,000 per annum. That is way in excess of what it costs to maintain the motorways other Senators mentioned. I hope the cost base is being addressed, despite the tradition of what I would see as a total capture of the Department by CIE. That is the spirit in which I put forward the amendments. As William Attley found in a report on behalf of one of the previous Governments, there is a strong tradition of engineer dominance rather than customer service in projects in this company. That issue must be addressed also.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	90	I have outlined the position on the amendments. The Senator makes some very valid points about the evaluation process. There was a different regime in place prior to the current Government taking office and it is probably an area that was not considered enough. There was not enough evaluation. It is a case of needs must now. It is no longer appropriate to just do good projects; we must do the best projects, and we must ensure we get the best value. Those evaluations are required and will be done. With regard to the signalling the Senator mentioned, it is a very comprehensive project. It is about increasing the volume of train paths around Dublin, which is a very important project as regards efficiency, volumes of trains, getting better and more efficient timetabling and so forth. I must admit that when I first took office one of the things that surprised me was the amount of money that has been spent on the railway safety programmes. It is colossal. The Senator's point is valid. Much of it relates to line improvements and issues relating to speed, signalling, gates and their management.However, the Senator needs to bear in mind a number of things. First, we need to meet certain EU standards that affect cost. Second, we are talking about the future of CIE and how to minimise costs. In order to do that it is necessary to make an investment in automation and other areas to minimise future costs. It is not all just going out and not coming in; there is also an improvement in quality. While it might be stating the obvious, safety is clearly paramount. The European Commission is considering a new railway package, which will come up during our Presidency. This may have other impacts on us when it comes to railway safety. That is something we need to monitor quite strictly given that this is an island surrounded by water. While there will be issues with the requirement for the interoperability of trains across Europe, we will not need to address those given that we are isolated. That is a matter I have already started to address in Brussels. I oppose the amendments.

We need to consider whether these investments are worthwhile from the overall national point of view. I appreciate what the Minister of State has said and I support him.

It addresses a discreet issue that has as its basis the High Court decision of Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan in Hussein v. the Labour Court & Anor. [2012] IEHC 364, which was delivered last August. Mr. Justice Hogan is well known to Senators as having been a leading constitutional lawyer prior to his appointment to the Bench. The Bill is designed to amend the Employment Permits Act 2003 to address certain shortcomings highlighted by Mr. Justice Hogan in the Hussein judgment. I will briefly explain the background. For many years, Mr. Mohammad Younis, a restaurant worker, was paid well below the minimum wage by his employer. He was paid 55 cent per hour, worked extremely long hours, had no days off and lived in hostel-type accommodation. He was subjected to threats and was exploited. Due to this, he was awarded €92,000 following an official complaint about alleged breaches of his employment rights. However, Mr. Justice Hogan overturned the determination of the Labour Court to make this award to Mr. Younis, who I hope is present. He is in Leinster House somewhere, but I do not see him right now. The restaurant owner had appealed the determination of the Labour Court on the basis that, as the worker was not employed under a work permit, his contract of employment was illegal and, therefore, the worker had no standing to invoke the protection afforded by the State's employment legislation. In Mr. Justice Hogan's judgment, he found that, under section 2 of the 2003 Act, "the Oireachtas has declared that a contract of employment involving a non-national is substantively illegal in the absence of the appropriate employment permit". As neither the rights commissioner nor the Labour Court could lawfully entertain an application for relief in respect of an employment contract that was substantively illegal in this fashion, Mr. Justice Hogan felt compelled to overturn the award made by the Labour Court. Under existing legislation, a non-national employee who works without a permit automatically commits an offence and his or her contract of employment is void. The Labour Court cannot make awards if a contract is void. However, Mr. Justice Hogan recognised that, on the basis of the restaurant worker's account, "he has been the victim of the most appalling exploitation in respect of which he has no effective recourse" and that this would give rise to "consequences which were not foreseen or envisaged" when the 2003 Act was enacted. Mr. Justice Hogan stated, "It may not have been intended by the Oireachtas that undocumented migrant workers - not least a vulnerable migrant such as Mr. Younis ­ should be effectively deprived of the benefit of all employment legislation by virtue of his illegal status, even though he or she may not be responsible for or even realise the nature of the illegality." He also stated, "The Oireachtas must, of course, regulate the labour market by specifically deterring illegal immigrants from taking up employment" and that legislation, if applied unyieldingly, "might have serious consequences for vulnerable migrants who found themselves exploited by unscrupulous employers." Most interestingly, Mr. Justice Hogan's recognition of the unsatisfactory state of the law in this area is perhaps demonstrated by the fact that he resolved to transmit a copy of his decision to the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation. It falls to us as legislators to remedy this anomalous situation of certain non-national workers. On this basis, the Bill seeks to effect a number of amendments to the 2003 Act and to remedy the position of the identified groups in our law. No more, no less. I will explain the Bill's provisions. Section 1 seeks to amend section 2 of the 2003 Act so as to insert a new subsection (4A) that will provide a defence to a foreign national who is charged with being employed without a valid work permit. The 2003 Act provides for a similar defence in respect of an employer, but no such defence is provided in respect of the employee. Therefore, the purpose of this provision is to place the employer and employee on an equal footing in that regard. This provision seeks to address directly the legislative gap identified at paragraph 15 of Mr. Justice Hogan's judgment. Section 1 also seeks to amend section 2 of the 2003 Act so as to insert a new subsection (4B) to enable an employee who does not hold a valid work permit to seek redress and to enforce his or her employment rights provided that he or she can demonstrate that liability for the failure to secure a work permit does not rest with him or her. This provision seeks to address directly the legislative gap identified at paragraph 20 of the judgment. Section 2 sets out the Short Title to the Bill and provides for a collective citation. I am grateful to the Minister of State and his officials for the assistance they provided while the Bill was being drafted. Dr. Brian Hunt also invested a great deal of effort in helping me. If the Minister of State could see his way towards accepting the Bill, I suggest we take all Stages today, although that is unlikely to happen. If we could manage to get the Bill through-----

Perhaps I could urge with more vigour, but I would have loved it had the Seanad been able to agree the Bill quickly and pass it to the Dáil. I have spoken to members of the Technical Group in the Dáil and they are agreeable to taking over responsibility for the Bill when it is before that House. In this way, Government time might not be required to pass the Bill in the Dáil.I gather there is no enthusiasm on the Government side to do this. I emphasise the urgency of the Bill, as there are so many cases of exploitation that have not yet come to light. This legislation could empower those who have been exploited to come forward. I regret the representatives of the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland are not in the Gallery, although they are visiting the Houses today. The centre has dealt with approximately 169 cases of forced labour over the past six years in Ireland, and it is likely that this is the tip of the iceberg, with many other workers too frightened to come forward. This type of forced labour has been described as modern slavery, with coercion and psychological abuse being used to extract consent in a range of explicit or subtle ways. For example, a person may withhold a passport or legal documents or otherwise threaten a worker's family. These workers mainly operate in non-unionised, unregulated sectors such as private homes, agriculture, the restaurant and entertainment industries and care and construction areas. Ms Gráinne O'Toole of the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland has argued:There is no justice for workers who have been subjected to this severe exploitation and unscrupulous employers continuing to profit from this heinous act. This court ruling is devastating, not only for Mr. Younis but for all undocumented migrants left without protection against exploitation under Irish labour law.She also indicates:[T]he law as it is now interpreted gives a green light to exploitative employers. Other countries have protections in place where undocumented workers who have had their employment rights violated can seek legal redress. The Government must act immediately to guarantee that undocumented workers are protected under employment law.The Bill also aims to ensure protection for those who have been subjected to forced labour, as this protection does not exist. The Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland is supporting the Bill with enthusiasm. I understand the Minister of State is working on a Bill that will introduce comprehensive and much needed reforms to the employment permits regime but it is likely to be some time before that is published. It is on the B list of the Government's legislative programme, and even when it is published, securing parliamentary time for debate may delay passage. If we procrastinate too long, who knows how many more people will suffer as a result? Politicians are often criticised for waiting too long and we have an opportunity to change that perception with this legislation. I appreciate that the Minister of State may argue the Attorney General has not yet formed a view on the best way to solve the issue raised by the Hussein decision. I have had the Bill examined by a number of experts, including an employment law expert who is a partner in a major law firm, and I have been advised that the Bill is watertight. I urge the Minister to consider taking the Bill through the Houses as soon as possible. Even if the Bill passes all Stages today, there would still be time between now and the Bill's initiation in the Dáil for the Attorney General to reach a conclusion. Passing the Bill will not preclude the Attorney General from reaching that conclusion. It is extremely unusual for a judge to forward a copy of his decision to the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad and a Minister. That is what makes this case and the need for this legislation all the more striking. A logical interpretation is that so unhappy was Mr. Justice Hogan at the inherent injustice in the findings he felt compelled to reach that he wanted to flag to us, as legislators, that this is an area of law to which we should turn our attention. This is part of the healthy dialogue between the Legislature and Judiciary which serves the public interest. We are here as legislators and must not forget our primary goal. Our aim must be to improve the lives of citizens through the laws that protect them. The Bill will achieve an aim of improving people's quality of life. We must bear in mind at all times that the people suffering as we speak who are too frightened to come forward are the unknown faces that could be forced to work in a local restaurant in any local town or village or as a cleaner in a neighbour's house. This modern-day slavery so-called is alive and well and we must do more to prevent such forced labour. How does this still happen in 2012? We can do something about it through this Bill and must remember that we can act now. I know the Minister of State has a Bill that will cover this and many other items but it is important to realise that this Bill could be incorporated into that legislation. That may take a year but in that year we could lose the trust and confidence of many people who are being exploited. I urge the Minister of State to accept the Bill.
#SeanDBarrett	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanDBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	105	I welcome the Minister of State. I begin by echoing everything said by Senator Quinn, particularly his commendation of the learned judge for asking us to pay attention to the issue, especially in this House because some people do not believe it has a future. The learned judge clearly does not believe that as he has asked for our views. He has indicated that certain sections of the Employment Permits Act 2003 had perhaps produced consequences unforeseen by the Oireachtas. That seems to be the case. We did not believe the €92,000 award would not be paid. It seemed that a man had been exploited for ten years as an undocumented and illegal immigrant, and there must be redress. Mr. Justice Hogan argued that the Oireachtas, "had to regulate the labour market by specifically deterring illegal immigrants from taking up employment as a failure to do so could have serious implications for both employment and immigration policy". If the legislation is applied in a rigorous and unyielding manner, the judge argued that it may have serious consequences for vulnerable migrants who found themselves exploited by unscrupulous employers. That is precisely what happened in the case in question. This Bill places a burden on the employer. I tend not to like people in this House talking about the so-called undocumented, particularly when the issue arises in the context of the United States. Illegal immigration should not be condoned, particularly in the United States, which is a strong law-abiding country. I wonder how much political capital is wasted on the issue. We should ask people to get their affairs in order before migrating to another jurisdiction instead of always trying to make up for undocumented or illegal migrants. Illegal immigrants depend on employers who operate in an illegal fashion. Senator Quinn's Bill places a burden on such employers, and all the evidence is that such a burden would be right. The judgment modestly calculated the burden at €92,000 for ten years illegal employment and exploitation, and it would gall most Members to think that an illegal employer could get off scot-free in this case. We do not wish to see a repeat of that. I commend Senator Quinn for all the work he has done on the Bill and it is an honour to support it.

It is a timely discussion. I remember hearing on the radio on 31 August news of the judgment of Mr. Justice Hogan, who reversed the decision of the payment to Mr. Younis. I was shocked and wondered how it could happen in this day and age. It is appalling that somebody coming here who felt, in good faith, that he was legally employed could be exploited over ten years. It took some courage for Mr. Younis to bring the issue to the relevant authorities but he was undone legally. Mr. Justice Hogan brought the issue to the attention of the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and the Minister. I raised the matter at a meeting of the committee dealing with employment issues and asked that the Minister be contacted.We said the matter must be rectified. We want to ensure that unscrupulous employers do not benefit from this gap and, therefore, there is a sense of urgency about dealing with the appalling levels of exploitation. The fact that this employer was brazen enough to challenge this speaks volumes about the type of individuals who exploit people from other countries, particularly countries outside the European Union and Switzerland. We all understand that we have controls on employment because there may be people in this country and across the EU who could take up those positions. Members will remember the time when we had full employment - it was a relatively short time ago - and there was a high demand for individuals to work in the catering, domestic and hospitality sectors. There were strict controls in place at that time but nonetheless there was a need to bring people here to work who had the necessary skills. That has changed now and there is an onus on all of us as Members of this House to ensure that workers in such circumstances are not exploited and that their rights are protected. This Bill is important. It is important that having been asked to do so by Mr. Justice Hogan we are at this point where we can discuss this issue. I commend Senator Quinn for drafting such legislation which is timely. I have a concern about sections 1 and 2 which allow a situation to occur whereby a valid work permit would not be available. The contract between the employer and the employee is under discussion but the work permit is granted by the State and we must ensure that every employer and employee would have a respective valid work permit. That is important because we would not like to get to a situation whereby a work permit was deemed not to be necessary when examining the relationship between the two. That balance must be struck. I have not met the individual in this case but I am sure he would have entered into the agreement in good faith and believed he had an agreement with an employer only to find that it was not a permit and he did not have any entitlements to labour protection. We are in a different position today. During a discussion with the Minister in the jobs committee yesterday we asked him to grant work visas, work permits and green cards to people who can fill vacancies, particularly in the IT sector and others. Nonetheless, there is an onus on us to ensure individuals have the necessary protection when the Labour Court agreed that an individual had been unfairly and appallingly exploited, to use its words. I am sure that from a legal point of view it did not give Mr. Justice Hogan any satisfaction to have to reverse that decision. I welcome this legislation and it is important that we have this discussion. I look forward to the Minister's comments as he probably has more expertise in examining the entire area. From speaking to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, I am aware he is looking to bring forward legislation on this area in the new year and that he has a sense of urgency in addressing it. I look forward to his comments on it also. I thank Senator Quinn for allowing us to discuss this issue and express our outrage and a sense of urgency that such a situation would be rectified.

In terms of value per line of legislation it gives better value, like his former business, in that it does a great deal. The Fianna Fáil Party supports the Bill which seeks to address what the judge recognised as unintended anomalies and consequences of the 2003 Act. I note the judge does not make any major criticism of the 2003 Act and I point out that it was the first time legislation on employment permits was put in place in respect of non-nationals working in Ireland and set out in dedicated primary legislation, with penalties for non-compliance. Every country needs that and it was done in that context and in the context particularly of the enlargement of the EU which took place a year later. As other speakers have mentioned, the Migrant Rights Council of Ireland and other organisations in that field have done tremendous work because the facts of this particular case were shocking and outrageous. I wonder about the employment of non-nationals across a range of sectors in Ireland today and whether there is a reason for them being predominant in certain sectors and if that reason is a breach of employment law and of employment protections. Is it easier to get away with breach of employment law and minimum wage rules with foreign nationals? I suspect it is and that many foreign nationals working here are paid below the minimum wage, which is outrageous and shocking. We support the Bill. As Senator Quinn outlined in detail, it seeks to amend the Employment Permits Act 2003 so as to provide a defence for a foreign national who is charged with being employed without a valid work permit as it already provides a similar defence in respect of the employer. The Bill enables an employee who does not have the valid work permit to seek redress and enforce his employment rights provided he or she can demonstrate that liability for failure to secure a work permit does not rest with him or her. It was a welcome decision of Mr. Justice Hogan, who is an innovative man in many ways, to forward this decision to the Oireachtas prompting us to take action if we believed it was necessary. There was no directive from the judge to the Oireachtas to take action on this, rather he said that he was engaging in a conversation between two branches of power in this country. That was innovative and it has prompted Senator Quinn to write this Bill and has prompted a debate in the Seanad on whether we should change the law. It was the right approach by Mr. Justice Hogan in this important case. He was not telling us what to do but merely highlighting an issue to us that is within the domain of this Oireachtas and this Seanad to address.  I object to people talking about an opportunity to debate and to show our outrage. The Seanad is about legislating and changing the law. That is the power that we have. We have a power which is relatively rare in Upper Houses in parliaments across the world in that we have the power to initiate legislation. In many parliaments throughout Europe the Upper House does not have the power to initiate legislation; it is merely a revising Chamber. This is more than a revising Chamber and Senator Quinn has taken the purpose of the Seanad under the Constitution and actioned it in a most important area. We can have all the debates and the talking shops we want but we are not a talking shop. We are a Legislature and we should legislate and come to the best possible view among ourselves in response to this matter. We will support this legislation if Senator Quinn chooses to put it to a vote. He operates in a very friendly manner and tends not to cause offence. He tries to get consensus but the Senator has a great deal of experience and having taken on advice it will be a pity if the Government says that further examination is needed. The only examination needed under law is an examination by the Oireachtas. Senator Quinn has done a significant amount of work on this issue and we will continue that examination in the course of this debate. He calls for all Stages to be taken today. I support that call and applauded him when he said it, but we do not believe in that. Legislation should be examined carefully but that does not mean it should be delayed; rather it should be done as soon as possible and putting this Bill through Committee and Report Stages could be done quickly. It is our opinion that counts, not those of officials in Departments.I understand they were helpful, nonetheless, to Senator Quinn and I hope the Government will support the Bill and allow it to complete Second Stage. That would rectify this wrong, which still places a considerable burden on people. There must be a balance between giving rights and not allowing the flood gates to open. Senator Quinn has very carefully addressed the balance and produced equitable legislation which we should all be able to support.
#JimmyHarte	unknown-#JimmyHarte-party	unknown-#JimmyHarte-dob	unknown-#JimmyHarte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	108	I thank the Minister of State for coming to the Chamber and Senator Quinn for introducing his Bill to the Seanad. It is a very practical Bill. The judge in this court proceeding wrote to the Ceann Comhairle in what may be the first act of its kind. He obviously felt so strongly about this injustice to Mr. Younis that he had no other course of action open to him. There was an anomaly in the system, demonstrating that people will be exploited where there is that possibility. I welcome Senator Byrne's comments about the function of the Seanad and agree completely that the function we have is very important. In this case we can introduce a Bill that would have a practical use for people who could potentially be exploited. It reminds me of Children of the Dead End, the book by Patrick MacGill detailing the Irish going to Scotland as being exploited from the age of 12 by unscrupulous employers. It is not exactly the same but approximately 100 years ago, many young Irish kids were used and abused by employers. That probably happened in other parts of the free world as well. We are now in a position where we can legislate to prevent this happening again in this country. I am sure everyone would agree that Mr. Younis was entitled to the €92,000 award but the legislation did not allow him to collect it. The judge made the correct decision in that respect and there is a chance today to address that issue, although not in monetary terms. For future cases, Mr. Younis has done the State some service. I have never met the gentleman but I am sure he has mixed feelings about the country he has worked in. The message from the Seanad is that there is 100% support from the Government and the Opposition. The case has been highlighted and we hope it will set a precedent for the future. The Minister of State has indicated that the Minister, Deputy Bruton, will make this a priority in the new year. It is important that we debate the issue and get out the message that the future for international workers in this country is safe. This could be my sons or daughters in another country, and we expect other countries to treat people like they would their own population. It is important that as a nation used to emigration, we afford the people coming to this country the same rights we would expect in other countries today. I ask the Minister of State to support the Bill and congratulate Senators Quinn and Barrett for bringing forward the Bill. I hope it makes the news for the right reasons and is highlighted in the media in the next few days. This Bill is important and the Senators have practically moved it along on their own. The issue may be buried in negative comments in the media but it deserves to be front-page news.

I echo the words of Senator Byrne as this debate forms part of the role of this House and we are here to legislate. The debates we have should inform the legislation and today's Bill is a sign we are getting down to business. I wholeheartedly support the Bill and its purpose. Unfortunately, forced labour is alive and well in Ireland, as is clearly demonstrated by the shocking exploitation of Mohammad Younis and our laws, albeit unintentionally, protecting the perpetrators. The High Court was correct in law to overturn the determination of the Labour Court to award over €90,000 to Mr. Mohammad Younis for alleged breaches of his employment rights, including threats, payment "well below" the minimum wage, the imposition of extremely long working hours of 77 hours per week with insufficient breaks and no day off and the failure to renew Mr Younis's work permit, thus rendering him undocumented in the State and extremely vulnerable to the exploitation and mistreatment meted against him. Senator Quinn very clearly elaborated on Mr. Younis's case. The High Court was correct in law because as set out in section 2 of the Employment Permits Act 2003 finds that Mr Younis does not have a valid and legal work permit and as such cannot benefit from relief in respect of an employment contract. It was correct in law but it was not just and right; part of the law should make circumstances just and right. It is clear that Mr. Justice Hogan recognised this, and in overturning the award made by the Labour Court, he stated that Mr Younis "has been the victim of the most appalling exploitation in respect of which he has no effective remedy." As colleagues have noted, Mr. Justice Hogan further felt compelled to send a copy of his decision to the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach and the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton. I appreciate that the Department is currently working with the Office of the Attorney General to examine options to address the lacuna in the Employment Permits Act 2003 arising from the High Court decision. Having carefully considered the Bill, it seems to be a viable and immediate option at our disposal to plug the legislative gap, which in real terms means protecting very vulnerable workers from exploitation by unscrupulous employers. This is not an issue that has the luxury of the time it can often take for the legislative process to deliver. It is an immediate problem. The Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland has 30 cases of exploited workers in precarious positions with work permits at various stages before the Labour Relations Commission. Clarity, certainty and legal protection must be brought as a matter of absolute urgency to these people. I urge all Members to support the Bill before us. Before concluding it would be remiss of me not to point out that while the lacuna in the law to which this amendment purports to remedy was unforeseen or unintentional in its impact, there is no room for suggesting the Government is unaware of the negative and dangerous consequences of its failure to legislate against forced labour either as a solitary offence or by amending the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 to define forced labour. The current legislative protections afforded through ordinary criminal offences such as false imprisonment, blackmail, assault, coercion, or the immigration or health and safety law are not appropriate or sufficient given the profile of the victims and the likelihood that they will have neither the knowledge of nor the confidence to evoke these protections. A law or a clearly defined provision on forced labour in existing legislation would give victims confidence and act as a deterrent to their exploiters, which is increasingly necessary, with anecdotal evidence suggesting that the recession is leading to greater recourse to very cheap or free labour by unscrupulous employers. I use today's debate on this Bill to call on the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, to publish the publish the International Labour Organisation’s report on criminalising forced labour in Ireland, which I understand sought to assess what Ireland would need to do to become fully compliant with, among others, the ILO forced and compulsory labour and abolition of forced labour conventions, the United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery; and Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights.The report is available - let us publish it. With 160 cases of forced labour in the past six years and rising, according to the Migrant Rights Centre, I also call for a wider Seanad debate on forced labour in Ireland. I thank Senator Quinn for introducing the Bill. It is discreet legislation that protects vulnerable workers from exploitation by unscrupulous employers. We need to pass the Bill, but it is only the first step towards ensuring that we send a clear message to the effect that Ireland does not tolerate forced labour. We cannot lecture other countries about forced labour while tolerating it on our own doorstep.

The Bill is a one-page document. Someone once stated that he was a one-page man. However, one page containing valuable information that is succinctly put is better than 10,000 words that say nothing. Will the Minister of State consider the Bill? I do not know what answer he will give, but perhaps he could model any response on the Bill. It covers what needs to be covered in a short, readable way. I was struck by the action taken by Mr. Justice Hogan in his judgment. His hands were tied behind his back. According to my reading of the judgment, had he the power there and then to say that the law was an ass and to change it, he would have done so. However, he does not have that power. As two Senators have stated, the Seanad is privileged, in that it has some power to change legislation, although this may seldom be recognised. Private Members' business is not used or abused in the Seanad for the sake of publicity as may be the case in the Lower House on Friday afternoons. It is used when necessary. The Minister of State might take this point into consideration. As Senator Quinn stated, Mr. Mohammad Younis has been the victim of the most appalling exploitation in respect of which he has no effective recourse. That this can be said of any person in Ireland means that we should all hang our heads in shame. In the past six years, there have been 160 cases, but we cannot even stand over one. I do not know whether the Minister of State has a timeframe for legislation but something must be done. I commend Senator Quinn for introducing the Bill, as Mr. Justice Hogan stated that it fell to the Legislature to remedy this anomalous situation for certain foreign national workers. The judge could not do anything but act in accordance with the law and, has been stated, the judgment is correct in legal terms, but everyone can see that the law needs changing. The Bill places employees on the same footing as employers. Why should each employee not have his or her rights regarded? Much has been stated about the exploitation of workers. We did not need to watch films of slave labour. One need only remember instances of slave labour in any country, including ours. We should be past that day, but we must ensure that there are laws against unscrupulous employers. Good employers of foreign nationals have had their names blackened. Everyone cannot be tarred with the same brush, but some unscrupulous employers will take advantage, and even more so now that they know advantage can be taken. This possibility should urge the Minister of State to prioritise the issue. As Senator Clune mentioned, the employer had the neck to appeal the case to the High Court. In one way it is good that he did, as it showed up the loophole in the legislation. On the other hand, it revealed that loophole to other employers. The quicker it is closed, the better. I commend the migrant rights associations and those individuals who are highlighting this issue and bringing it to the fore for the Oireachtas. No one should be proud of forced labour and we would hate it if any of our citizens was subjected to it abroad.

However, I want to join the growing number of Members who want to do that. There is no great fuss. This is a simple, one-page Bill. It is perfectly obvious and straightforward and nothing should obstruct it. We can put it through if we so decide. The reasons for doing so have been referred to in a glancing way. The situation in question is continuing. Mr. Younis is in the Visitors Gallery. I salute him for the courage and dignity that he and his family have shown. It is not just him, though. There is a backlog of 30 cases. What is extraordinary and bizarre is the affrontery and sheer brass neck of his cousin and other employers who flagrantly break the law yet appeal to the law to protect them. Let us act now. We can do it. Others might suffer in the same way. It is certainly not justice. It may be law, but the law does not always equate to justice. Mr. Justice Hogan is a fine legal mind. I have known him for many years and he is a fine judge. Obviously, he is indignant. I cannot recall another time when a judge directly approached the Oireachtas. I have told the House many times that I wished judges would and that a proper channel would be opened up in order that we could have a dignified debate. It would be a creativity way of dealing with lacunae in the law. Mr. Justice Hogan went as far as he could and made his feelings clear. Solicitors claim that there is a growing body of the people in question. They have scented the blood in the water. This is a human tragedy. Mr. Younis stated: "This is not just money for me, it's for my family. I've lost everything now." He had been living in a hostel on €19.10 per week, the equivalent of the allowance paid to asylum seekers. I wish to clear up a number of matters that may have inadvertently been suggested. He is not an illegal immigrant. He is a migrant worker who was placed in a situation of illegality. This is an important point and his case is representative. A previous case involved Gama workers from Turkey. An Independent Deputy in the Lower House raised the issue and pushed legislation through. The Government tried to take credit for it, but it did not get away with it. I made sure it did not when the legislation reached this House. Mr. Younis's case is typical. A Pakistani national, he was brought to Ireland as a tandoori chef. He did not displace an Irish worker, since he had special and unique talents. He was unable to speak English, which is another characteristic of the cases in question. His employer, his cousin, failed to regularise his tax situation and kept his passport, an act that we have made illegal. The unintended consequences of the 2003 Act are nonsensical, in that the exploitative employer is protected while the employee is not. It is a significant point that Mr. Hussein, in his evidence to the court, stated that he had got a work permit for Mr. Younis for the first year of employment from July 2002 to July 2003. Did he perjure himself in court? If not, is it not a stated fact accepted by the court that Mr. Younis was legally in Ireland and legally employed? I do not know why he did not get at least one year out of this. If the judge had been in a good mood, he could have inflated the amount and fined the restaurant owner.It is a really appalling case, where somebody has been exploited and put in a position equivalent to slavery. As a result of his naïveté, innocence, lack of linguistic skills and understanding of an alien culture, he ended up as a victim who was punished because of the unintended consequences of an Act passed by the Oireachtas in 2003. The judge was right to draw the issue to our attention and I hope the rights of the man in question will be vindicated subsequently. We should act now. The gentleman, who is sitting in the Visitors' Gallery, was grievously treated and put in a position equivalent to slavery, as several people have said. When he sought redress, the Labour Court awarded him €92,000, and an appeal was made. What kind of person would make that appeal? I call shame on that person. We know the victim has nothing. We can apparently and regrettably do very little for Mr. Younis and his family, although I hope something can be done. We can do something for the other 30 people, and it would be a stain on this House if we did not act immediately. The case of Mr. Younis is one too many; we do not want another 30 cases or unscrupulous employers queuing up to use this loophole. After the discovery of the loophole, it is up to us to plug it. I compliment my friends and colleagues, Senators Quinn and Barrett, on their foresight and the brilliant way in which they presented the Bill. As they have both indicated, this is a simple Bill and a small mechanism that would take but a few minutes of the elected representatives of the people of Ireland to address this injustice. It is not acceptable for us to have to wait for the next work permits Bill when we have a solution now. Will the Minister of State ask them, for humanity's sake, to take this Bill? It will not obstruct the next work permits Bill and can wither away when that legislation is introduced, if it contains a section to address the matter. We should act now in order that we will not have to read in the newspapers next week of another such case. I commend the Bill to the House and ask the Minister of State to consider going back to his colleagues and ask those in the Cabinet to consider it. It would not take much time to introduce it, and it could even be done outside Government time. It would be an achievement for democracy that would give hope to workers who currently have their rights trampled.

On behalf of the Government, I acknowledge the presence of Mr. Younis in the Visitors Gallery. I thank each of the speakers who contributed so passionately to the debate on this Bill. I will outline some of the historical aspects of the Bill. On Friday, 31 August 2012, Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan of the High Court reversed a Labour Court award of €92,000 to Mr. Mohammad Younis, a Pakistani chef, despite finding that he might have been "the victim of the most appalling exploitation by his employer". The judge found that the contract of employment was illegal due to the fact that Mr. Younis did not have an employment permit. The judge noted that the Employment Permits Acts made it an offence for certain employees to work without an employment permit. The Acts do not provide for any defence for an employee, which suggested to the judge he could not take into account mitigating circumstances-----

#SeanSherlock	Labour	14602	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	115	-----and had little discretion but to consider the contract of employment as illegal. The result was that, arguably, the employer benefited from the illegal contract. The issue raised by the High Court judgment is one which has important policy and legal implications in the area of employment permits and also in terms of employment rights. As Mr. Justice Hogan noted in his judgment, "the Oireachtas must, of course, regulate the labour market by specifically deterring illegal immigrants from taking up employment, as failure to do so could have serious medium term implications for both employment and immigration policy." The relevant provisions of the Employment Permits Acts of 2003 and 2006 hold that where an employee who was required to hold an employment permit has failed to do so, he or she is guilty of an offence and the Acts do not provide for a defence for an employee in this regard. As I understand it, the judge took the view that this lack of defence affects the court's scope to interpret the statutory provisions and compels the court to hold that the legislation has created an absolute offence in so far as an employee is concerned. Importantly, Mr. Justice Hogan indicated that it must, therefore, be taken that the Oireachtas intended that, as such, a non-national employee automatically commits an offence if he or she does not have a work permit, irrespective of the reasons for that failure, and that this has implications so far as the civil law is concerned in that such a contract of employment must also be taken to be void. The judgment identifies something which appears to be inherently unfair, that an employee who has unwittingly entered into an illegal contract of employment may not assert rights under that contract of employment. That has been acknowledged. I note that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, upon receiving the judgment, quickly stated his aim to ensure an employer should not benefit from using an illegal contract of employment where he or she was a willing party to its creation. I also know that the Minister met Mr Younis and representatives of the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland and repeated his assurance that he would make changes to the legislation. The Senator's Bill is to be welcomed and it should be noted that Senator Quinn has gone to great lengths in bringing forward this legislation. It provides us all with an opportunity to reflect on the judgment and to identify a means of rectifying the legal position. The Senator's Bill makes two proposals. First, it proposes the introduction of a defence for the employee similar to that currently provided for the employer. On the face of it, this seems to be a reasonable proposition. However, a fundamental aspect of the current legislation is that it is generally illegal for third country nationals to be employed in Ireland without an employment permit. Such nationals, therefore, require the State to give its approval to the creation of the contract of employment. Consequently, this proposition may mean, in certain cases, that the State would not have had an opportunity to approve of the employment in advance. This is not a fundamental legal obstacle but requires to be understood and acknowledged. Second, the Bill provides for a foreign national, so long as it is established that the person took all such steps as were reasonably open to ensure compliance, to enforce the contract of employment and any other employment related rights under any other enactment. This may include any employment related right, and not only those rights under what would generally be considered to be employment rights legislation but also those rights under other legislation. Arguably, a wide spectrum of legislation gives rights relating to employment. Again, this requires careful consideration as many rights can be deemed to be employment related.We want to ensure unintended consequences do not arise. The employment permits regime is a managed system in that both third country nationals and their prospective employers must seek permission from the State to work legally in the State and also provide details to the State concerning the proposed work. A key deterrent is the legal assumption, with certain exceptions, that not having an employment permit creates an offence for the employer and the employee. The question that arises for policymakers is the extent to which such workers should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so versus the extent to which certain employment rights should protect vulnerable migrants who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions. I understand my Department is advised that the judgment raises matters that are particularly complex and that these matters are receiving priority attention with a view to identifying the best way in which the legislation may be amended. The challenge is to meet the objectives of the Senator's Bill in a manner which does not affect the careful balance of interests between employers and employees across the employment rights legislation as well as other rights under other Acts. In particular, attention is being given to the way legislation can be drafted to ensure the particular outcome in the case to which the High Court refers can be prevented in future in a manner which does not result in any unintended consequences. Decisions on the legal options will be made in light of further legal advice and in consultation with other Departments. I stress that the judgement relates only to the consideration of an employee's rights. It does not mean that unscrupulous employers can employ unauthorised third country nationals without running the risk of significant legal consequences. I emphasise that an employer who engages in this type of activity is open to prosecution under the employment permits legislation and could be found guilty of an offence, and liable on conviction on indictment to a fine not exceeding €250,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or both.

This would be the most appropriate method of dealing with such a technically specific matter.

I acknowledge and sympathise with the position in which Mohammad Younis found himself in when awarded approximately €92,000 by the Labour Court having been unable to seek redress from his employer. I welcome Senator Quinn's proposals in this Bill to protect all workers rights. Following on from the Hogan judgment in which he reluctantly ruled that the award be overturned due to the fact that the Employment Permits Act 2003 prevents an undocumented worker from seeking redress, it is imperative that we close any loopholes in legislation, and I understand the Attorney General is examining options to do so. I congratulate Mr. Justice Hogan in following through to the end on this issue. The Minister of State said that nobody should benefit from an illegal contract. I hope and trust that illegal contract will be turned back on that employer and that he will be prosecuted for employing somebody under an illegal document. The Minister of State said such people are open to prosecution. Therefore, he should follow that up and prosecute him for doing so. We will certainly get the €92,000 out of him if we follow that line. This issue is much wider than certain people being unable to seek redress from employers. It opens up the debate on the fact that a small element of rogue employers are still willing to exploit workers, and foreign nationals in particular. Unfortunately, many foreign nationals are willing to work for below the minimum wage as many of them come from countries where the deprivation is such that the amount paid is a fortune to them. Thankfully, the employers who operate in such a fashion are in a minority with most employers abiding by the rules and giving their employees due process. Many people in this country fought long and hard for workers' rights going back to the time of Connolly and Larkin. The Labour Relations Commission and the Employment Appeals Tribunal were set up to protect workers and it is a shame that some employers are still willing to take advantage of their workers knowing that undocumented workers do not have any redress to compensation, despite the ruling of the Labour Relations Commission. Employers should check to ensure every employee they take on is properly documented. It is not enough for employers to say it is the worker's responsibility. Employers also have a responsibility. It is the law of the land. If employers are knowingly employing undocumented personnel, the book should be thrown at them. There is too much labour in the black market and while I appreciate that has reduced significantly, unfortunately, it is still going on. Prior to being elected to the Seanad I worked for SIPTU which has fought and continues to fight to stamp out the practice of employers paying below the minimum wage, not paying the joint labour committee, JLC, rates, exploiting workers by not giving them their correct holiday pay, not paying them for extra hours worked and not giving them their bank holiday entitlements. That practice is more widespread than we realise, particularly where foreign nationals are involved. Many employers will not even allow the union represent their members until the case ends up in the Labour Relations Commission and they are left with no choice. I understand that employers are under severe pressure with the high cost of rates and the cost of having an employee but I have found it is not those employers who are operating in the black market who treat their employees in this way. Many, but not all, are small time operators in the services sector who do not have a premises but move around a good deal to work at different locations. Most employers with premises are paying proper wages. Many of us know of relatives and friends who work undocumented in the United States. We know also that there are undocumented workers throughout the world. However, if a relative or friend of ours was being treated badly in another country, we would like to believe the employment law mechanism in that state would protect them. Why not provide the protection in this country? I congratulate Senator Quinn. I am sure he was a marvellous employer to all his employees. Today he is seeking to ensure employees' rights are protected. I congratulate Senator Barrett on seconding the Bill. I urge the Minister of State to accept the Bill and bring it forward as quickly as possible.

Baineann sé seo leis an Gael thar lear freisin. Molaim go mór an Seanadóir Feargal Quinn toisc an taighde a rinne sé agus gur cheap sé go raibh sé tábhachtach an scéal seo a chur amach go poiblí. The Bill is welcome because it gives us an opportunity to express our views not just on the specific case of Mr. Younis but generally on some of the malpractices which apply in this area. It is possible that if Senator Feargal Quinn had not brought forward this Bill, and I am not suggesting any inactivity on the part of the Government because I am sure that is not the case, the opportunity would not have arisen to highlight some of the practices taking place.The only word I can think of in this case is "slavery". In a case in Britain, people ended up in prison because they enslaved people. By virtue of the fact the employer knows the employee had no option but to remain quiet and accept the treatment, this amounts to slavery. There is a gap in the legislative process if this is allowed to happen. We can reflect on the undocumented Irish in America. Many of us visit America from time to time and we meet the undocumented Irish. Our hearts go out to them because they are not just non-entities but non-people to all intents and purposes. The undocumented Irish cannot move where they want to for the simple reason that, if they come back to Ireland, they cannot return. I dealt with one case related to Tipperary, where a married couple returned to Ireland. The lady was American and the man was from Tipperary and when he sought to return to America with his wife he could not do so. I saw the trauma attached to the case. It is no different although it is a separate issue if we discuss the pros and cons of people not having proper work permits. The employer is central to this case because he knew specifically what he was doing. It does not just concern the amount of money, which was a fortune, but the fact he was prepared to engage in something that was virtually an illegal act. He benefited from it to the tune of €91,000, which is a huge amount of money. I agree with my colleague who raised the question of what happens in that case. I am more lenient and my heart goes out to people who find themselves without a proper work permit. We benefited as a race of people throughout the world and if we had not done so, we would not have 70 million people of Irish extraction. When we get wealthy and benefit from the Celtic tiger, we can forget our history and become a little uppity in our attitudes to others. There is no substitute for humanity and if someone has a difficulty it does not just concern the immediate person but the family, the extended family and people at home trying to help him or her. Whatever legislative gap there is, I hope it will be filled. I will be very disappointed if there is no follow-up action where the employer is concerned. I refer to the bodies and organisations looking after what we call the new Irish. If they decide to stay in Ireland, they will marry here and, as we know from Irish history, such people often become more Irish than the Irish themselves. These bodies and organisations should feel secure that the Oireachtas is conscious of the problems and that at any time they can meet Deputies, Senators or Ministers. We are available to meet them and they should not feel that this is not a central issue while there is a recession. We have problems and a recession but, during the Celtic tiger, if many of the new Irish were not available to serve in restaurants and hotels and do other jobs, the Celtic tiger would have died much sooner. They took up the work and worked very hard. They were integrated into communities and brought a richness of culture, heritage and diversity. They should not be considered as a problem but as an asset. In this case, I commend Senator Quinn for what he did because it shows his humanity. As a legislator, he does not miss the opportunity to help those who have nobody else to help them.

We all spoke about the High Court judgment on 31 August in respect of the Labour Court award to Mr. Younis. It represents a worrying development in terms of enforcing employment rights. The Minister of State said Mr. Bruton, "upon receiving the judgement, quickly stated his aim to ensure that an employer should not benefit from using an illegal contract of employment where he or she were a willing party to its creation". I welcome the intention of the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to put forward legislative provisions in this regard when he introduces his employment permits Bill. I understand he intends to bring forward the Bill early in the new year, although the Minister of State qualified this point, and that priority has been given to it. The judgment demonstrates something that appears to be inherently unfair, namely, that an employee who has unwittingly entered in into an illegal contract of employment may not assert rights under the contract of employment. Lest there are unscrupulous employers, thinking they can employ unauthorised third country nationals without legal consequences, it should be emphasised that the judgment does not mean an employer who engages in this activity can get away with it. An employer who employs someone requiring an employment permit is open to prosecution under employment permits legislation. The employment permits regime is a managed system in that a third country national and the prospective employer must both seek permission from the State in order for the third country national to work legally in the State and they must also provide details on the proposed employment. The key deterrent against unauthorised employment is the legal assumption, with certain exceptions, that not having an employment permit creates an offence for the employer and the employee. Third country nationals are citizens of the country that is not a member of the European economic area. This Bill is a welcome contribution to rectifying the situation. I understand there are a number of legislative options in this regard and Senator Quinn's Bill conclusively addresses the options he proposes. Had there been such a provision, the case that is the subject of the High Court judgment would have had an entirely different outcome. I understand the Minister, Deputy Bruton, does not intend to oppose the Bill and intends to allow it to pass Second Stage. He intends to bring forward his own employment permits Bill. I congratulate my colleague, Senator Quinn, on the Bill and Senator Barrett for seconding it.It is a short Bill and says much in few words.
 I encourage the Minister of State to consider the issues Senator Quinn has raised when the Government formulates its own Bill.

I warmly welcome the Bill and congratulate Senator Quinn for drafting the Bill and Senator Barrett for his assistance. Next year will be the 100th anniversary of the 1913 Lockout. I have no doubt the Minister of State's party, my own party and many people in the State will commemorate that event, rightly so. It was a period when leaders stepped forward to protect the rights of workers. While it is important for us to commemorate and pay tribute to people who made sacrifices in the past it is our duty as legislators to ensure that we protect workers as far as possible and ensure that exploitation is not possible in the Republic in which we live and which we all want to see. That is why it is important that this Bill be brought through the correct process and adopted.  I listened to what the Minister of State said about the possibility of bringing forward his own Bill. The enactment of legislation involves several stages in this House and the Dáil. We have Committee Stage and Report Stage. I hope the Minister will accept Senator Quinn's Bill, and amend it if he sees unforeseen consequences in the Bill itself. I hope the Bill will get support from all Members of the House. The lacuna that was identified in the case of Hussein v. the Labour Court & Anor. causes a substantial injustice and creates the possibility of further injustice. In the Hussein case, the High Court ruled that a migrant worker who was exploited by his could not receive €92,000 in compensation as the employer had allowed his permit to run out without renewing it, rendering the worker an illegal worker, a phrase I do not like to use. The case highlights a major flaw in the Employment Permits Act 2003. When that Bill was brought forward my party colleagues raised the issue of employers holding the work permits of migrant workers, saying it was open to abuse and exploitation. Unfortunately, that has been the case. The fact that the worker in question, Mr. Younis, whom I welcome, with his family and members of the Migrants Rights Centre, to the Visitors Gallery, can be denied his compensation on the basis that his employer failed to renew his work employer permit highlights the flaw in the legislation. The Government should act to amend the legislation immediately. Representatives of migrant workers met the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, and the possibility of using the proposed workplace relations Bill was cited as a way of resolving this issue. Whatever the correct procedure, there must be a strong call from this House that something be done as soon as possible to ensure that situations like this do not occur again and that people are not exploited.  I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Younis and representatives of the Migrants' Rights Centre in Leinster House some weeks ago. I offered my full support to him. I support the Bill and hope the Minister will accept it. Sinn Féin will ensure its speedy passage.  I take the opportunity to highlight the case of migrant domestic workers. At a recent conference in University College Cork which was attended by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the issue of migrant domestic workers was raised. The conference, which I attended, was organised by the Irish Human Rights Commission and the Centre for Criminal Justice and Human Rights which was established by the Faculty of Law in UCC. It would be hard not to be affected or angered by some of the accounts the conference heard of abuse and exploitation by domestic workers internationally and in Ireland. We heard the testimony of one former worker who gave an account of her experience of exploitation in an Irish household. This involved underpayment of wages, physical and emotional abuse, refusing permission to leave the house, extra time worked on bank holidays not being paid, overworking, wholly inadequate breaks, threats of being reported to the Garda for being undocumented if she complained and withholding documentation.  There is a catalogue of abuse and mistreatment. It is difficult to come forward if one is undocumented or even if one's status is unclear. Conversely, this makes migrant domestic workers far easier to exploit. There is exploitation when one person has power over another. The courage required to come forward is immense and this highlights the difficulties in protecting such workers. Far too often, when exploitation is hidden from the public view an attitude of out-of-sight, out-of-mind is adopted. That is not good enough. There are steps the Government can take to protect such migrant workers. An obvious step is the ratification of the International Labour Organisation Convention Concerning Decent Work for Domestic Workers. The Government should take that action immediately. There is also a need for legislative and enforcement action. In particular, there is a need for legislation to criminalise forced labour. There is no place for forced labour in Ireland. There is no place for exploitation of workers. We have much work to do. We have come a long way in improving workers' rights but we still hear cases such as the one presented today and Mr. Younis's own account of his experience of injustice. We cannot allow these situations to continue. I appeal to the Minister of State to resolve this issue speedily and deal with the anomaly.

Senators on this side of the House support the principles of the Bill. Until Senator Cullinane referred to him I was not aware that the gentleman concerned in this case was in the Visitors Gallery with his family and advocates of migrants' rights. I welcome them to the House. Anyone who has emigrated from this country will know what Mr. Younis went through and what it is like to be an exploited worker. I was an emigrant. I was not exploited, thanks be to God, but I was in England at a time when the infamous lump system operated in the construction industry. Irish workers were taken on, primarily although not exclusively by Irish owned companies, and paid a lump sum under the counter. They had no rights whatsoever and were completely exploited. Many of the motorways and large buildings of the United Kingdom were built on the back of such exploited labour. It is a credit to the Irish community in Britain that they rose above all of that and continue to make a valuable contribution to their adopted country.  We in Ireland have, in our genes, an understanding of worker exploitation. I am sure Mr. Justice Gerard Hogan was influenced by that instinct as much as by law in requesting that the Oireachtas address the issue. This goes to show that the Oireachtas and the Judiciary can work hand in hand. The Judiciary fulfils an important role in identifying gaps in our legislation, particularly where matters of human rights are concerned. I am glad this matter has come before the House. I know of a worker from a non-EU country who came to this country on a work permit to a specific employer. Within a short time of arriving here he transferred to another employer and remained with that employer for five years, during which time his passport was stamped regularly and annually.There was no indication that there was any difficulty with his work permit until he went to change his employment after five years. At that point, he was deemed to have broken the law, because there was no defence for the employee. The original employer had passed on whatever responsibilities it had to the second employer. As it did not do so formally, in effect it did nothing. It did not inform the second employer that it had to apply for a new work permit and that the work permits are job specific. In other words, when a non-EU national gets a work permit, one must work with the employer who got the work permit. The person was threatened with deportation. It was news to the individual concerned. However, I am glad that common sense prevailed. It was accepted that he was the innocent party in this and was able to have his new work permit documented and released to him. He is now in gainful employment in this country. I appreciate that this is a different issue as it arose out of a claim that was made to the courts for exploitation. That is what opened up this issue. From that point of view, there are elements of this which we cannot gloss over either, notwithstanding that Amjad Hussein's rights were deemed by the court to have been trampled on. In a reply to a parliamentary question the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, said, among other things: "Justice Hogan found that it must therefore be taken that the Oireachtas intended that such a non-national employee automatically commits and offence if he or she does not have a work permit irrespective of the reasons for that failure and that this has implications as far as the civil law is concerned in that such a contract of employment must also be taken to be void." I believe that influenced the Minister about changing the law. The Minister's reply continued: "The question that arises for policy makers is to what extent such non-nationals should be dissuaded from working illegally in Ireland by virtue of there being a statutory offence to do so versus to what extent should certain employment rights protect vulnerable people who find themselves unwittingly in such employment positions." That is the dilemma that has faced both the last Government and this Government since 2004, when we opened our labour market to the new EU states. At the same time, we put in place certain restrictions relating to people from non-EU areas who wished to work in this country. I am a former emigrant and would not wish there to be any barriers put before emigrants leaving their homes to find gainful employment because they could not find it at home. However, there must be a realisation that we are in a severe economic downturn and restrictions must be put in place. I have no difficulty with restrictions that are fair and valid. This case is not about that. This was about somebody who genuinely believed that he was coming to this country with a work permit and was then exploited. What is sad and, incidentally, not unique, given the Irish experience, is that it was a family member who exploited him. I can tell his family that this is not unique. From the perspective of my experience as an Irish emigrant, it was mainly Irish employers and sometimes family-owned Irish companies that exploited both family members and fellow Irish workers. That took place both in England and America. In the few seconds available to me I must, once again, highlight, in the wider context, the need for the Government to continue to press for meaningful immigration reform for undocumented Irish people in the United States. Many of the rights we are discussing in this legislation do not apply to undocumented Irish in the United States. They are treated as illegal and if they contravene domestic law and are discovered as a result, they are immediately deported. These are people who are living, working and have raised families in the United States. I am from Leitrim but the Minister of State, who is from Donegal, is fully aware of this. I believe there is a change of sentiment in the United States as a result of the re-election of President Obama. The Republicans now realise that if they are to have a political future, they cannot continue to alienate ethnic minorities. From that point of view, timing is everything and we should now press ahead with this. I hope the Minister will state in his response that the Government will continue to maintain the momentum that previous Governments adopted to ensure that we look after the human rights of our citizens abroad who were obliged to leave this country, for no reason other than economic circumstances.

Senator Mooney has just spoken in a similar manner. Given that the Irish have had such experience of being exploited in the past, there is a determination that we have legislation in this country that will work well in ensuring that no similar exploitation occurs to foreign nationals coming to our country. The aspect of this that has jolted me - it was mentioned in the debate - is that when Mohammad Younis arrived here, he did so legally. He was legally employed for that first year. It was the action of the employer in not renewing the work permit that made it illegal. Now that this has come to light, the danger is that other employers will see not renewing work permits as a clever way to exploit people. There is an responsibility on us not just to correct this, but to do so immediately. This is a very simple Bill. It is on one page and consists of a couple of paragraphs. The objective is to ensure that the Bill can pass quickly. I hope it can become law. The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, have told us that they intend to introduce a much more extensive Bill next year, but my experience, particularly with the Construction Contracts Bill which is taking so long to become law, is that anything can delay a Bill, particularly an extensive one which I understand might have as many as 60 sections. It is important to pass this Bill, I hope in the next few weeks. It seeks to protect people who might be exploited. It is important to do this. I have some experience with this issue. I introduced a Passports for Sale Bill a number of years ago which sought to ban the sale of passports. The then Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, said he could not object to anything in that short Bill and allowed it to pass Second Stage. However, he said he intended to introduce a wider Bill on passports to cover not just that aspect but also other areas. I achieved what I set out to do. It took a little longer, but it was a wider Bill and incorporated what I was seeking. It is important, therefore, that we pass this legislation on Second Stage today. I hope it will be passed by the Seanad in a short period of time. If we do that, I hope it will be put before the Dáil. A number of Deputies have said they would use their own time to get the Bill through. It just requires the enthusiasm of the Minister to say that while it is not everything, it closes a gap. On that basis, he could incorporate it in the more extensive Bill he will produce later. Mohammad Younis, Siobhán O'Donoghue and Gráinne O'Toole from the Migrant Rights Centre and particularly Dr. Brian Hunt who helped me with the Bill are enthusiastic about and have given their commitment to it and I believe it will achieve what we set out to do. It will not achieve everything on work permits, as the Minister will deal with that issue in the bigger Bill next year. However, it is important that we pass this Bill tonight.On that basis we will do not just Mohammad Younis and his colleagues who are the foreign nationals who are working here a service but will also protect the good name of Ireland in the years ahead. I urge the Minister of State to agree to the Second Reading of the Bill.

I am delighted to hear the good news about Valentia and Malin, which is not related to this subject. The office really condensed the matter I wished to raise. I have always been very concerned about the Kerry red deer. As conservationists in Kerry, we do not shoot them and do not want to see any of them shot. I recognise the national importance of this deer herd and welcome the Minister's recent order taking female Kerry red deer off the open-season list. I acknowledge the work of the NPWS in general in regard to them. In particular, I applaud the NPWS in the south-west region on protecting the red deer in Kerry. I thank all the rangers for the work they do with their patrols, including their night-time work. I look forward to the Minister of State clarifying the situation with regard to the size of the herd. Not many years ago the herd was threatened with extinction, which is no longer the case, I believe, but I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State. We also need to protect the gene pool in case, God forbid, we ever had an outbreak of TB. The deer traverse the same land as cattle, badgers and so on, and, thanks be to God, there has not been an outbreak. In order to protect the gene pool in the past we had Kerry red deer in Letterfrack and Doneraile and on Inishvickillaun. I ask the Minister of State to comment on the protection of the gene pool. I look forward to hearing from him.

The Kerry red deer are a unique feature of our heritage. A recent report discovered that the Kerry red deer are the direct descendants of deer present in Ireland some 5,000 years ago. While the report concluded that these deer species were brought from Britain into the country, the authors of the report believe the unique Kerry red deer population are worthy of special conservation status. The fortunes of this unique species have fluctuated during the years. Prior to 2005 the hunting of Kerry red deer, both male and female, was prohibited. At that time, data indicated that there was an increase in the red deer population in Killarney National Park and the surrounding area. As a result it was decided to allow the hunting of the Kerry female red deer during the open season in the period from November to February. However, the hunting of Kerry male red deer was still prohibited. In the intervening years the monitoring data of the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department recorded a significant decline in red deer density in Killarney National Park. Therefore, in order to conserve the special lineage of red deer in Kerry, the Minister decided last month to prohibit the hunting of the Kerry female red deer. The effect of his decision is that it is now prohibited to hunt both the male and female Kerry red deer species. I am aware that most hunters support this measure given that some hunting organisations had already urged the Minister to take action to address the poor status of the Kerry red deer. My Department will be closely monitoring compliance with this prohibition. There have been a number of recent incidents of illegal killing of red deer in Kerry. It saddens me to think that people would go to the trouble of illegally shooting these beautiful animals. I know that staff from the National Parks and Wildlife Service of my Department have carried out increased patrols in the county in recent months, including patrols at night, with a view to deterring the illegal shooting of deer. I am hopeful that prosecutions will be brought against the people involved in this illegal activity. I also commend the various deer organisations, including the Wild Deer Association of Ireland, for their vigilance in reporting such incidents. Within the boundaries of Killarney National Park, there are some 600 red deer which are of a healthy nature. I hope in the coming years that we will see an increase in the number of red deer in the national park and in the county as a whole following the decision to ban the hunting of the female red deer.

I notice that it did not contain anything about the gene pool, but we can follow up that issue further.  With regard to the illegal shooting of male Kerry red deer, I understand some trophy hunters are prepared to break the law. I again salute the work of the rangers, particularly in their night-time patrols. It is difficult to catch the people concerned on the Kenmare Road because, as the Minister of State knows, the main road from Killarney to Kenmare passes through the national park. The deer tend to come down and the lights seem to attract them. It is very sad that people do this and I hope they are prosecuted. I very much welcome the order protecting the female red deer, as well as the males. I hope to hear further about the protection of the gene pool. I am very satisfied with the answer the Minister of State has given.

Unfortunately, the illegal hunting of deer - red deer or otherwise - is not confined to the Killarney National Park. It seems to be becoming - I will not say a pastime - but an activity in other parts of the country, including in my county. Coincidentally, a number of concerned citizens from my county want to meet me to discuss what can be done to prevent this happening in the area. People in Donegal have welcomed what the Minister did to protect the male and female deer in Kerry. If it is operating successfully in Kerry, they would like to see it employed in other parts of the country where this sort of activity takes place.

Táim thar a bheith buíoch dó as teacht isteach chun an cheist seo a fhreagairt. The Minister of State may be aware that I have raised the direct provision model on a number of occasions. This is an issue of major concern to me. It not appropriate for the long-term housing of refugees seeking asylum in the State. There are major issues concerning the treatment of people in these centres. The Irish Refugee Council has raised very serious issues about the treatment of children in these centres in its recent reports. When one hears the discourse on issues such as this locally or in the media, one gets a sense of the public perception that those seeking asylum are lucky to have a place to stay and are provided with meals. When refugees find they are stuck in the situation for years on end, it is very difficult for them. There is a significant human cost from the social and economic perspectives. People may be held in limbo for up to ten years. I have met and talked to some of the people concerned. When the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, was in opposition, he and the then Labour Party members in opposition raised serious questions about the direct provision model, whether it was economic and if there was a more suitable method of housing people who are seeking asylum and fast-tracking asylum applications. There is a will to try to move the process forward. What is the cost to the State of the direct provision model? There are urban myths that direct provision is a cheaper way to house people than allocating them community housing or providing them with a local authority house in cities and towns. I am sure the Minister of State shares my concern that the direct provision model is a privatised system. We know it is being run by private companies on behalf of the State, with very little oversight. The main goal of these companies is to make a profit. There are questions as to how much of the State money that is paid per capita for persons in this direct provision accommodation is being spent on providing a top quality service? That is the reason I am requesting a breakdown per capita of the cost of keeping somebody seeking asylum in the direct provision model. What payments do the State make to them? We are told that those living in direct provision accommodation are paid €19.10 per week to allow them to buy what they like. Are other payments made in addition to this weekly allowance?  I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, and thank him for coming to the Chamber.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	137	I thank the Senator for raising this issue. I am responding on this subject on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter. It is necessary in the first instance to outline what direct provision means and how we fulfil our obligations to those persons who apply for international protection from the State. The policy of direct provision and dispersal is one of the central features of the State's asylum system. The Minister has recounted in responses to parliamentary questions in the Dáil how the direct provision system was a necessary response to the increasing number of asylum seekers arriving in the State, given the incapacity of the structures dealing with homelessness to cope with the crisis. Direct provision is essentially a cashless system whereby the residents of accommodation centres are provided with food and other services on a full board basis. Residents do not have to pay for rent, electricity, heating, food, maintenance or other costs. Health and education services from mainstream hospitals-clinics and schools are provided in the same way as for Irish citizens. Residents receive a weekly direct provision allowance of €19.10 per adult and €9.60 per child. They are also entitled to supports under the community welfare scheme. There are currently 4,836 persons seeking international protection residing in 35 direct provision accommodation centres across 17 counties under contract to the Reception and Integration Agency, the RIA, an operational unit of the Irish naturalisation and immigration service, INIS, of the Department of Justice and Equality. Three of the 35 centres are State owned, that is to say, the land and buildings are owned by the State but the management of all 35 centres is provided by private companies under contract to the RIA. The RIA does not own, lease or rent premises from commercial contractors, rather it contracts in a comprehensive range of services and facilities which include accommodation, housekeeping and so on for a fixed sum over the period of the contract. The Minister has explained in numerous responses to parliamentary questions that the RIA negotiates separately with each contractor. It is not in the interests of the taxpayer that details of rates paid to individual contractors for current contracts are provided publicly. With reducing numbers and because of significant cost cutting measures put in place by the RIA, the overall cost of the direct provision system is declining. In 2008 the RIA spent €91.5 million and in 2012, the Estimate provision is €63.5 million. This represents a decline of 30% over four years. A breakdown of these expenditure costs are shown in the RIA's annual reports for the years 2007 to 2011, inclusive, which are published on its website. Given that different rates are paid to different contracts and residents receive a range of welfare, medical, legal and educational benefits not covered in the RIA's budget, a note of caution has to be sounded in proving a statistic showing the cost per individual to the State of keeping asylum seekers in the direct provision system. Nonetheless, taking overall RIA expenditure of €69.5 million in 2011 and the number of residents at the midpoint of that year - 5,745, this would represent a cost per RIA resident of just over €12,000 per year. It is worth noting that in 2010 a value for money review of the direct provision system found that, "From comparison with a number of options, including social welfare and self-catering, the chosen policy of direct provision was found to be the best choice for a number of reasons. It is less costly, it is less likely to act as an incentive to new asylum seekers (asylum shopping) and it allows the State to manage the challenge of asylum seekers in a way that reduces pressure on local services". A copy of that report, the value for money review, is on the Oireachtas and RIA websites.

I have read the value for money report but it does not say much about the human element, which is sadly lacking in the direct provision system. The Minister of State has stated residents receive a weekly direct provision allowance of €19.10 per adults. I have a receipt from one of the asylum seekers of his payment from the Department of Social Protection which states his weekly flat payment is €186, of which €166.90 is deducted; therefore, he receives €19.10. Where does the €166.90 from the Department of Social Protection go? Who deducts it and where is it going? It is a significant amount of money. I am not sure if the Minister of State has information on it. Will he request the Minister to revert to me on that question? It appears that we are paying more than €19.10 per individual and that we are paying €186. When I asked a number of people who deal with asylum seekers - I showed some NGOs this slip - it was the first time they had seen one of them and they were as puzzled as I was as to where the money might have gone.

I am not being critical of him, but it is impossible to respond on the hoof to it. Certainly, we will see what we can do and if there is an additional question the Senator would like to have addressed. In fairness, he did say the individual NGOs with whom he shared this information had not seen anything like it before. It does look like that it is an unusual event. Certainly, we will have a look at the issue separately.
#MartinConway	unknown-#MartinConway-party	unknown-#MartinConway-dob	unknown-#MartinConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	140	I welcome the Minister of State back to the House. I feel very strongly about this issue. As in many other countries, smoking in Ireland is a serious public health issue and one that quite often does not attract the attention it deserves. Among the general public it certainly does not receive the respect it should, given the dangers it causes. In addition, the cost to the taxpayer arising from the implications of ill-health from smoking is particularly serious, especially when we are in a troika programme. Having said that, I must commend the former Minister for Health, Deputy Micheál Martin, for introducing the smoking ban in public places, which was a brave move. We were the first in Europe to do so and at this stage our example has been followed by most other European countries. The ban sent out a positive message but we have taken our eye off the ball on this issue somewhat since then. My family runs a shop in County Clare where, unfortunately, we sell quite an amount of cigarettes. Speaking to other retailers in recent times, however, we have noticed that cigarette companies are now pushing out the boundaries concerning what they can or cannot do. We have seen the recent introduction of packs of 23 cigarettes. Smokers now face a choice of packs of 20 or 23. We banned packs of ten in order to reduce the incentive for young people to buy them, but we are now back to having a choice of two packs. We should either ban the 20 pack or the 23 pack, but only one pack should be on sale. Next we will see a pack of 30 cigarettes which will work out cheaper per cigarette than a 23 pack. We could even see the introduction of packs of 50, which would work out cheaper still. The economics of scale are built into the number of cigarettes purchased.  Coupled with this, we have also observed in-store incentives being peddled by cigarette companies. These are to incentivise staff to push cigarettes on the public. Under one scheme being operated in shops around the country, staff members who increase sales of a particular brand of cigarettes will receive a €50 shopping voucher. There is an incentive to partake in such a promotion coming up to Christmas when times are difficult in an expensive period. In addition, glossy and colourful price lists are being produced on the basis that retailers are legally obliged to advertise the price of their products. They are, therefore, taking advantage of that loophole to peddle their brands. I abhor smoking which is one of the greatest curses in the modern world. We have a responsibility to do what we can to curb it. This is a time sensitive subject because the budget is being announced next week. That would be an opportune time to deal with this issue by regulating new methods of in-store promotion of cigarettes. Retailers are permitted to buy tins of cigars, yet they can be sold individually. Thus, people in a difficult economic situation who come from an unprivileged socioeconomic background could, unfortunately, be incentivised to buy single cigars. Tobacco products should be sold as part of a package.  Another element that has crept in recently is the peddling of roll-your-own cigarettes. We will always be fighting this battle against smugglers who are selling tobacco on Henry Street for €5 a pack. We may not have a large amount of control over that but we certainly can control how tobacco products are sold in shops, including the price and packaging. It is a win-win to tackle this problem and the vast majority of the public will be on our side. Statistics show that 18% of the population smoke, while 15% want to quit smoking. Therefore, we will probably have 90% support for any initiative we take to deal with this matter.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	141	I thank the Senator for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to discuss the steps that we at the Department of Health are taking in moving the country towards a tobacco-free society. It is important to take a moment to consider the immense damage that smoking causes to the health of people in this country. It is well documented that smoking is the greatest single cause of preventable illness and premature death in Ireland, killing over 5,200 people each year. Half of all long-term smokers will die from smoking-related diseases. What are we doing to alleviate the societal and economic burden placed on us by smoking? What can we do to discourage people from smoking? Since his appointment as Minister for Health, my colleague, Deputy James Reilly, has been very public about his commitment to tackle the problem of smoking. The tobacco policy review is nearing completion in the Department of Health and will make recommendations aimed at further reducing smoking. No one measure alone can reduce the number of smokers or the number of children who start to smoke. We need a combination of measures which includes, effective legislation, supports for smokers who are trying to quit, and effective media and education campaigns. All these measures have the effect of denormalising tobacco use in our society which is the most effective way to prevent future generations from continuing the habit. In consultation with the HSE, the Department of Health is continuously monitoring the ever-evolving marketing tactics of the tobacco industry which were referred to by the Senator. As these evolve, so too must our legislative and policy framework by way of response. A comprehensive range tobacco control legislation is in place in Ireland which places us in the top rank of countries internationally. Some of these significant initiatives include: successful implementation of the smoke-free initiative in 2004; a ban on the sale of packs of cigarettes of fewer than 20, in 2007; ground-breaking legislation in 2009 that introduced the ban on in-store display and advertising; and the introduction of the retail register. Last December the Minister for Health signed regulations which will place an obligation on tobacco manufacturers to include photographs on cigarette and tobacco packs. These images depict the negative health impacts associated with smoking. These packs will appear in shops from 1 February 2013. This particular measure, together with the 2009 retail measures, will have a positive impact on reducing the numbers of young people starting to smoke. It is heartening to see that in a recent survey the number of children smoking fell from 18% to 12% from 2002 to 2010. The introduction of many of the legislative measures I have mentioned was facilitated by developments at European Union level. It is important that our tobacco policy and legislation framework continues to develop within the context of the European Commission. To this end, I hope to be in a position to progress the revised EU tobacco products directive during the course of the Irish EU Presidency in the first half of next year. I am confident that the outcome of the revision of the directive, together with the implementation of the future recommendations of the report of the tobacco policy review group, will go a significant way to moving us towards a tobacco-free society.

Having said that, however, further regulation is necessary in the immediate term. Such regulation should cover: the sale of single-item tobacco products; the availability of packs of 20 and 23 cigarettes - there should be only one pack; banning cigarette companies from offering financial incentives to retail staff to promote cigarettes - we need to move away from this; and closing the loophole whereby they can provide colourful, eye-catching price lists. Further regulation by the Minister is required on these four important matters. It needs to be done in the interests of public health.

A practical problem is arising in the north west over medical cards, particularly in County Donegal.In other parts of the north west the review letters have gone out. I have been contacted in many cases by people with family members in nursing homes, sometimes over 90 years of age, who are being asked to resubmit the review. Through no fault of their own, they had not been reviewed for ten years. Some families are getting frustrated because some of the information being requested cannot be ascertained and they feel that they are forced to fill in the forms incorrectly. Are allowances being made in cases where information cannot be garnered from individuals? In one case a son asked his father about money and assets because the mother had died some years earlier and she had looked after the family's financial affairs and the father, who is now at an age where he suffers from dementia, did not know. The family do not know the information and feel they are compromising the medical card application. Could the HSE or the Department issue direction for such extreme cases? Others have come to me and the process for replying has been quite straightforward but when a person finds it difficult to reply, there should be some provision made for this.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Business of Seanad	145	I thank the Senator for raising this issue. The Health Service Executive operates under the legislative framework of the Health Act of 1970 as subsequently amended. In the interest of probity, the HSE is obliged, irrespective of the age of the person, to ensure that a person's eligibility is correctly recorded in line with the eligibility legislation and the national guidelines. The HSE aims to ensure that every person who is entitled to the medical card schemes is given the opportunity to avail of their entitlement. The Senator may be aware that the HSE spends in the region of €750 million on medical cards for persons aged over 70 years of age, mainly on prescription drugs and GP care. The HSE is legally obliged by legislation to have regard to the need to secure the most beneficial, effective and efficient use of its resources. However, where an individual requires help or has any questions or difficulties in completing a medical card application or review form, he or she, or a member the family, should contact their local health office, where the staff continue to provide assistance. Medical cards are provided for persons who, under the provisions of the Health Act 1970, are in the opinion of the HSE unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their dependants. Under the legislation, determination of eligibility for a medical card is the responsibility of the HSE. The assessment tor a medical card is determined primarily by reference to the means, including the income and reasonable expenditure, of the applicant and his or her partner and dependants. A new medical card scheme for persons aged 70 years or over was introduced with effect from 1 January 2009. Under this scheme, a person who is ordinarily resident in the State qualifies for a medical card when he has attained the age of 70 years as long as his gross income does not exceed the means test income limit. The income limit for a single person is €700 per week and the relevant income limit for a couple is €1,400 per week. Reviews for medical card holders who are 66 years or over now operate on a self-assessment basis. The length of validity for all standard medical cards for people under 66 is now three years. However, the length of validity for people aged 66 years and over is four years. Any medical card holder undergoing a review to renew a medical card who genuinely engages with the HSE in that review will not have his or her entitlement withdrawn before the review is complete, regardless of the expiry date shown on the medical card. In cases where a decision is made not to grant a medical card, the applicant is informed of the decision and is notified of his or her right to appeal this decision. Contact details for the appeals office are provided for him or her. Where a person submits an appeal to a decision not to renew a medical card within 21 days of that decision, he or she retains his or her medical card or GP visit card until the appeal is decided. All efforts are made by the HSE to deal with the individuals properly, fairly and impartially. In the circumstances outlined by the Senator where it is not possible to ascertain the existence of assets, if that relatively unusual situation is communicated in the course of this exercise, I am sure the HSE and those dealing with this issue will deal with it in a sensitive and pragmatic way. There is a legal responsibility on the HSE to ensure people who are properly entitled to a medical card get one. As far as information on assets or means is concerned, it is usually ascertainable but I accept there may be circumstances where there are difficulties in that regard. I emphasise that the HSE will exercise sensitivity and be pragmatic but people must engage in the fullest way possible with it, rather than, as was suggested by the Senator, feeling reluctant to give information. They should give the information as best they can and if there is a lack of certainty about the information, this should also be outlined. People on both sides will deal with this issue with their eyes wide open.

As it seems to be geographically specific, perhaps there are more medical card reviews in Donegal because of the population profile and the level of unemployment but the local office should contact the families of those in nursing homes. People have to ask their relations in nursing homes about their assets and who are perhaps not compos mentis. The local office should contact the nursing home to inquire about particular difficulties. I know a family who were normally on top of their affairs but in this instance they felt constrained and did not want to provide information about which they were not sure. Families are not always aware of the help that is available because this might be only happening for the first time.
