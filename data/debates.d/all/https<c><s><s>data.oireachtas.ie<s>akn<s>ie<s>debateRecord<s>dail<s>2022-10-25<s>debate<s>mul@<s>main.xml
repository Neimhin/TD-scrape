          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">This week sees yet another disaster in Government housing policy as workers and families across Ireland continue to endure a worsening housing crisis and those fleeing a terrible war in Ukraine were left to sleep in Dublin Airport because there was no accommodation for them. Last March, the Taoiseach said the State would accommodate 200,000 Ukrainian refugees but he had no real plan as to how he would meet that commitment. The Irish people have welcomed some 60,000 refugees from Ukraine and the system is already overwhelmed. On Friday next, the latest homelessness figures are to be published and all indicators suggest that we will see another shameful increase in people in emergency accommodation. Meanwhile an entire generation is locked out of affordable housing and opportunity. They weigh up the prospect of life from Boston, Perth or Toronto.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> All the strands of this social catastrophe are linked by the Government’s failure to plan, organise and ultimately its failure to deliver. There is no doubt that the Government is top of the class at when it comes to announcing big targets that grab the headlines. It gets an A+ on that score. But time and again it falls short when it comes to delivery. This failure to plan and deliver means we now see crisis heaped upon crisis. We see massive pressure heaped onto a housing system that is already broken beyond recognition. And this means that everyone loses. You lose if you have spent years desperately searching for an affordable home and you also lose if you come here to this country fleeing a terrible war in search of shelter and help. So people are now frustrated. They asked how on earth it is that nine months after Russia invaded Ukraine, the Government is now scrambling to put together a plan. How is it that the Government is appealing to the public for help but at the same time, people's offers to accommodate refugees are being ignored? It seems that the Government’s approach was to outsource the State's response, cross its fingers and hope for the best. What people see is the same incompetence and infuriating lack of pace that the Government has brought to addressing the domestic housing crisis. Not content with denying our own people the right to an affordable, secure roof over their heads, the Government now extends its catastrophic failure to those coming to Ireland seeking humanitarian assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">De thairbhe theip an Rialtais tabhairt faoi phleanáil, tá an ghéarchéim tithíochta imithe in olcas agus an Stát faoi bhrú lóistín a sholáthar dóibh siúd atá ag éalú ón chogadh. Cuireann an teip seo géarchéim ar ghéarchéim agus brú ollmhór ar chóras atá briste.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> People are sick of the Government's excuses for its failures in housing. It claims that housing is its number-one priority but it is now time to back up those words with what matters: delivery. We all know there is a housing shortage but what is the Government doing to ensure offers of accommodation for those fleeing war will come on stream quickly? The outsourcing system is not fit for purpose. When will we see a change in Government housing policy to ensure members of the locked-out generation can finally put an affordable and secure roof over their heads?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_2">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_5">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue. Her commentary and some of the debate on this issue in recent days has become somewhat detached from the reality we find ourselves confronted with. We need to be very clear about what this is all about, what has happened, where we are and where we go from here. The first thing that has to be done is to acknowledge and pay tribute to the extraordinary Irish national effort in response to Putin's illegal and immoral invasion of his neighbour, Ukraine. We have all watched in horror as this man has ordered ruthless attacks on civilians by air, land and sea, displacing up to 7.2 million people all over Europe. He is doing it with greater intensity now by raining down drones on the people of Ukraine and their energy infrastructure. We have responded to that terror with unprecedented warmth, generosity and support. More than 55,000 Ukrainians have sought and received refuge in our country, one of the highest figures within the EU, which the Deputy does not acknowledge. She calls it a disaster, which is extraordinary language to be using. Approximately 43,000 of those are being accommodated by the State in various ways. In addition, we have accommodated 9,000 seeking international protection. This number will rise to about 14,000 by the end of the year. That is not a story of failure; it is a story of families in every corner of this country and communities across this country opening their homes and hearts to people who are fleeing war. That is the story of Ireland's response to the war in Ukraine. The Deputy should not try to have it both ways and try to play crude domestic politics. It is a story of a massive effort by our public servants across the board, across Government and across the country. It is a story about people understanding how much it means to help people fleeing war in another land.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> We need to be careful of the implications of how this gets articulated. The only person I see who would get solace from what the Deputy said and the manner in which she said it is Putin himself. That is what Putin wants to do. He wants to create the impression across Europe that Europe cannot cope with or manage this. That is why the Iranian drones are being dropped all over Ukraine right now, destroying energy infrastructure. It is because Putin wants to make life unbearable for Ukrainians and the country and uninhabitable. Therefore, we have to make sure that he does not succeed with that agenda. Right across the board, we have provided a range of accommodation options, not just one, and we will continue to do so. We will continue to work in solidarity with our EU colleagues in terms of the directive to protect and do everything we can to help Ukrainians fleeing war. That will be achieved through a range of options, including procuring accommodation, building fresh accommodation and reconfiguring buildings. There will be challenges along the way and there will be ups and downs and bumps along the road. Of that, let there be no doubt. This will be the case throughout Europe; it is not an Irish phenomenon. Many other capital cities and countries are challenged by this unprecedented humanitarian crisis, brought about by the war in Ukraine. It is unprecedented since the Second World War to have millions of people displaced and forced out of their homes by a war. That is the context. I do not accept the Deputy's analysis of it at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">In some respects as well, I note that the Deputy has intertwined this issue with the housing crisis. The only incompetent thing I saw in recent weeks was a suggestion that we should do what the former UK Government did in regard to energy.</p>

          <p eId="para_8">There is no need to convince anyone of either the vile criminal actions of Vladimir Putin or the incredible generosity and warmth that has been displayed by the Irish people. Those are objective matters of fact. The difficulty is that the Taoiseach has not matched the effort by the Irish people with Government action.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">That is the reality here. The facts, as reported and acknowledged by everyone bar the Taoiseach, are that people fleeing from Ukraine arrived and there was nowhere for them to go. They slept in the airport. There was talk of some perhaps being left homeless and having to sleep on the streets. We can all agree that is not an acceptable situation. I have asked the Taoiseach to set out for us what the Government response will be to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> People are well used to the Government and the housing crisis that people have lived through for a decade and longer, and now we have crisis upon crisis. What is the Taoiseach's answer in respect of these individuals arriving?</p>

          <p eId="para_41">It is unedifying to see any attempt being made in the House to engage in political point scoring on both sides on such a serious issue. It is fair to say that across Ireland, communities have been dismayed to see people fleeing the brutal war in Ukraine having to sleep on the floor in Dublin Airport. That is a matter of grave concern, dismay and distress to communities across Ireland that have been so generous in offering refuge to the thousands of people who have had to come here because of the brutal invasion of their democratic, sovereign homeland by Russia; by Putin and his brutal army.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> It is disappointing that there was not engagement back in the spring or earlier in the summer by the Government to ensure that we would have short-term, medium-term and long-term planning in place in order that this would not happen. Back in July, I hosted a briefing here in the Oireachtas with members of the Ukraine Civil Society Forum at which they called for that level of planning to be put in place, and at which they and members of the Ukrainian community here called for a co-ordinated whole-of-government response led by the Taoiseach. That is what is needed now.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">For too long, it seems, the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has been left to bear almost full responsibility for the housing of and provision of support to those who come here fleeing war and to the communities here who are supporting them so generously and ably. That has not been good enough and that is why we are in the position we are in now.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> We in the Labour Party want to offer constructive support and engagement with the Taoiseach and the Government and that is why I wrote to him yesterday seeking that he would provide all Opposition leaders and spokespersons with a briefing on the current status of accommodation for those fleeing war in Ukraine and, indeed, those seeking international protection. I sought that briefing on the current situation but also sought a briefing on future planning. In the spring, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage wrote to us in the Opposition and asked us to supply him with details on vacant properties in our areas, and we sent details to his office. Through our party’s housing spokesperson, Senator Moynihan, we put forward a range of properties in our constituencies, including Baggot Street hospital in my area and other properties too. I have been engaging with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman's, Department, as have other colleagues. We have not heard back with updates on the properties we have proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> We want to see local communities and local authorities be far more strongly engaged in this process. We want to see a whole-of-government approach and a ramping-up of efforts to unlock the capacity we know is here in this country. We have been very generous in our approach but across Europe we have seen generosity. The Czech Republic has taken in four times as many refugees from Ukraine per head of population as we have. We are seeing enormous efforts across Europe because European democracy is under threat. The Taoiseach is absolutely correct; Putin is weaponising refugee flows and we cannot let him win. That is why we need to ensure the Opposition and the Government are engaged together in this collective effort.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">First, I accept the Deputy’s bona fides. I received her letter yesterday and we will set in train that briefing she requested.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> Those countries closest to Ukraine have the highest numbers of Ukrainians coming in, namely, Czechia, Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, Bulgaria and Latvia. Then you have Cyprus, Slovakia and Germany and then you have Ireland. We are taking the equivalent of about 1.2% of our population. Ireland is ahead of Austria, Finland, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Denmark, Norway, Slovenia, Belgium, Portugal, the Netherlands, Croatia, Sweden, Romania, Hungary, Italy, Spain, Malta, Greece and France in terms of the numbers we have taken in. We need perspective on it. It is challenging for all countries and, to be fair to the other countries I mentioned, they have challenges on international protection as well as the situation in Ukraine.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> As for the approach being taken, I chair a Cabinet committee on this. A group of senior officials meets every week, and has been meeting every week, on this issue to try to identify new opportunities, Baggot Street hospital being one. That is being developed but it is going to be take time in terms of the physical work that has to go into getting it ready. Moreover, the reconfiguration of public and private buildings is under way across the country to create additional capacity. There is rapid-build housing and while concerns have been expressed in communities, with some public representatives against it, it will have to be a feature of housing generally into the future. These are good-quality houses that can be built much faster. We have already started with 500 units but that will have to go to a much higher level. I foresee a significant ramping up of rapid-build houses to respond to the general housing issue and to help with the emergency created by those fleeing war in Ukraine and with emergency housing more generally. Overall, about 55,000 people have come in from Ukraine and we are looking at about 14,000 individuals this year seeking international protection. We have other pressures within Europe relating to emergency housing, whereby people who present as homeless come in looking for emergency housing. There is a general increase in the numbers who are seeking fairly quick access to housing, in addition to the general housing situation. </p>
          <p eId="para_49"> Those are the plans that are under way and they involve a lot of Departments, such as the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence, which are represented on that committee. For example, a number of barracks and other Army facilities that were formerly used for other purposes are being reconfigured with a view to providing accommodation and so on. The Department of Foreign Affairs co-ordinates the issue and keeps the rest of the Cabinet abreast on what is happening in other countries within Europe and the pressures they are under. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, obviously, is a key part of it and the local authorities have been doing a lot of work in respect of this issue. They will continue to do so and will do even more, along with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, of course, which has been the lead Department in respect of the broader issue of migration and integration into the country.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">I thank the Taoiseach for indicating that he will engage formally with Opposition leaders and spokespersons on this. I welcome that. It is very important that we ensure the strong political support is there across the spectrum and across Opposition and the Government. We have seen divisions being sewn in other countries over this issue and it is really important we do not allow that to happen here. That is really commendable.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> I also thank the Taoiseach for engaging with me on the Baggot Street hospital site. I have also put forward other properties, however, as have my Labour Party colleagues. We await a Government response on that. It would be very welcome to have a process where we can feed in constructive proposals to address this, including the ramping up of modular housing. As the Taoiseach said, that does offer a way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> It is good to hear about vacant State-owned properties that are being repurposed, which is very welcome. The Ukraine Civil Society Forum asked for better management and co-ordination, however, including communication with local authorities and communities and a proper structure to manage the response, monitor standards in welfare and facilitate all the offers of pledged accommodation. This should offer clear communication from the centre of Government and as the Taoiseach said, a clear sense that this issue is being addressed across all Departments to the same degree. That does not appear to be the case in the public perception. It is very important that we see leadership from the centre of Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">I want to confirm the Deputy's points about those displaced over the weekend. That was disappointing. We do not want that situation to happen. All Ukrainian displaced persons and international protection, IP, applicants who were not accommodated over the weekend have now been contacted and offered accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> On the co-ordination front, I am aware of the issue because we met with the various groups over the summer. In my view, it has to be a cross-departmental and multi-departmental approach. That is why at Government level, having a Cabinet subcommittee and a senior official group is the best structure to do that. There were some suggestions early on that one would appoint an individual from outside the system who would endeavour to co-ordinate it. In essence, however, it has to be done across the Departments and the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_55"> A second call will be initiated through the local authority system with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage having an oversight view to make that stronger and more streamlined into the future. As I said, work on the reconfiguration of existing buildings and other buildings is also on the way. We will seek and need the co-operation of everybody when we start doing things expeditiously in terms of procurement and value for money. All of that will have to be put to one side as we move ahead in this.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peadar Tóibín<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_56">A figure of 357 homeless people have died in the last five years in Dublin. That is the equivalent loss of life of a transatlantic flight falling from the sky. It is a catastrophe that is happening silently and invisibly every other day on the streets in which we live. There were 47 deaths across homeless services in Dublin in 2018, 49 in 2019 and 76 in 2020. Last year, in 2021, incredibly, 115 people died in homeless services. So far this year, 70 people are recorded to have lost their lives in the Dublin homeless services. It does not bear thinking about but those figures are set to increase due to the fact that the weather is going to get colder and more severe over the next number of months.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> These figures were released to Aontú by Dublin City Council under the Freedom of Information Act. If we were to submit the same question to any other local authority in Ireland right now, however, we would be met with stoney silence because no other local authority actually records the number of people who die in homelessness around the country. It is an incredible thing that the vast majority of local authorities are not even recording this. It is an absolute scandal. If we are not even measuring this incredible situation, how will we ever get to a situation where we are finding solutions to it?</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> I have been raising this issue of homeless deaths for the last number of years and different Ministers with responsibility for housing have tried to explain it away. Some said these deaths are just part of a natural attrition that happens. Others said these are the results of car accidents etc. The truth be told, however, and the Taoiseach should know this, homelessness is a direct cause of death. People who are homeless for longer than 18 months are eight times more likely to die than a person who is homeless for less than six months. Right now, on the streets of our capital city, people are dying directly as a result of homelessness.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">When I raised this matter previously, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage commissioned Dr. Austin O'Carroll, a north inner city GP, to research the causes of these deaths and propose solutions. I welcome the fact that this happened. If the Taoiseach looks at the figures, he will see that there is little evidence we are getting to grips with this crisis. The Government is missing all of its housing targets. The Dublin Housing Delivery Group submitted a report to the Minister recently indicating that there is evidence of a slow-down in social housing projects and that work has ceased on some sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> This is a record-breaking Government for all the wrong reasons. There are record numbers of people accessing emergency accommodation. There are record numbers of children accessing emergency accommodation. House prices are at record levels. Rents are at record levels and last year we had a record for the number of people who died in homelessness in our capital city. All of these indicators are going the wrong way under Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party in government. Will the Taoiseach commit to recording the number of deaths of homeless people in every county and will he detail the progress so far on the implementation of the recommendations made in the Interim Report on Mortality in the Single Homeless Population 2020?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_39">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T14:25:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_61">The death of anyone who is homeless is a tragedy. We extend our sympathies to the families concerned. I refer, in particular, to the deaths of people availing of homeless services. That matter is taken very seriously. The Deputy made a fairly bald statement in the context of offering an almost a direct juxtaposition between the numbers who have died and the position regarding homelessness. I do not think the figures bear that out. The Deputy quoted the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE records. That organisation records death notifications from all of its funded residential and outreach services in line with a procedural agreement with the Health Service Executive. These services include support for people in permanent tenancy - people who have been taken out of homelessness but are in permanent tenancies - including Housing First, for example, long-term supported accommodation and people receiving tenancy support who are not counted in the Department's homeless figures. We have to be very careful. Is the Deputy saying that all of those deaths occurred because people were homeless? Not necessarily; that is the point. Also, homelessness is a complex issue and we must take into account the range of issues that can lead to someone becoming homeless. Some 37 of the 70 deaths the Deputy identified were in the categories I have just mentioned. In other words, they related to people in permanent tenancies and not in a state of homelessness. Nonetheless, it is still extremely sad and tragic that anyone would lose their life but I do not have the specific causes of death for those 37 people . To be fair to everyone, perhaps more research is required in respect of those figures before we draw the conclusions the Deputy seems to be drawing in respect of the figures he articulated.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> I believe all local authorities should follow the example of the DRHE in how it records people within its homeless services. As the Deputy knows, we are moving much more towards the Housing First approach to homelessness which is actually giving people a permanent tenancy almost from day one if that is possible. We just need to be very careful in terms of how we describe this and how we analyse and research it. That is all I would say in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> There is a pilot study on data collection of homeless deaths nationally which has been undertaken by the Health Research Board on behalf of the Department of Health. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is liaising with the Department of Health and the Health Research Board on this study. I will talk to the Ministers for Health and Housing, Local Government and Heritage to see if anything more needs to be added to that research in order to get as complete a picture as we possibly can. The research is very important because it can inform policy. We saw during Covid how a strong synergy between those two Departments on homelessness reaped significant dividends for the homeless in the context of a positive response on the Covid issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I am surprised at the Taoiseach. These figures are very stark and real. There are direct correlations between being homeless and losing one's life. Equivocating or fudging at this point in 2022, after years of this, is simply not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">Ten or 15 years ago, the Government might have had an excuse for doing so. However, equivocating on these figures, the direct correlation and the cause and effect that is happening on the streets of Dublin is wrong at this point. If that is the stage the Government is at, it surely will be a problem in terms of urgently putting resources in place to fix the situation. Dr. O'Carroll, who was commissioned by the Minister, said that the length of time for which a person is homeless leads directly to an increased chance of mortality. We know the number of people dying correlates exactly with the number who are homeless. The truth is that people do not have access to primary care, mental health services and dual diagnosis services. They are living in conditions where they are exposed to the weather, to violence on the streets, alcoholism, etc. All of those issues are contributing factors to the deaths that are occurring.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">The Deputy introduced politics into this at the beginning, which is fine. I am just making the point that there is a multiplicity of reasons someone ends up homeless. We cannot generalise to the degree he is perhaps doing. Some, without doubt, have significant challenges as they become homeless, which can lead to increased morbidity and mortality. The point I am trying to make is that we have to bring the services to the homeless. That is what we need to do as a State, by intervening in a positive way in a person's mental health and medical issues, and we need to do that by proper integration of services on the front line.</p>
          <p eId="para_76"> The Deputy referred to primary care. It was explained to me by homeless services a long time ago that many people who are homeless do not bother getting the medical card and do not have GPs.</p>

          <p eId="para_78">What do we do? We bring the GP and the primary care service to the homeless centre or we at least provides it in an accessible way.

It was done very well during the Covid period, and we want to try to maintain that.</p>

          <p eId="para_79">I want to discuss the growing disconnect between the Government's stated aspirations on energy and the reality on the ground. This week, the Government is asking the Dáil to vote for the provision of emergency generators that will run on liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, and, crucially, will also have the capacity to run on green hydrogen, if and when it becomes available. One of the Government's first acts was to announce an exploration ban on the extraction of oil or gas in Irish waters. I am told there are people in the energy sector who wish to explore for gas, particularly off the west coast, where there is infrastructure. The crucial difference between the gas coming in from the west of Ireland and LPG is that the carbon footprint of LPG is far higher because not alone do we burn it, there is also the energy used to transport it here. The Taoiseach could not have predicted the energy crisis when the Government announced the ban on exploration. Will he revisit it in light of what we know now?</p>
          <p eId="para_80"> One of the rationales posited for the ban at the time was that by keeping fossil fuels in the ground, we will incentivise the use of sustainable alternatives, but that did not happen. The European Commission has said Ireland and Denmark are the two countries most suitable for the production of biomethane. Denmark now meets one quarter of its gas needs by way of biomethane and it is saying it will meet 100% of its needs in this way by 2034. We do not produce any biomethane of any significance. An EU scheme was announced whereby billions of euro were made available for countries to develop their biomethane sectors to meet the energy crisis. When I asked the Taoiseach about this before, he said I would get a direct reply from the Minister. Only after I asked the latter about it did I find out we did not even apply for that scheme. Italy is getting almost €5 billion to develop its biomethane sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_82">It is money that can be used to provide an alternative to carbon, which is the Government's stated intention. However, what is happening on the ground is that there are farmers groups across the country that are willing to develop the biomethane sector. They are begging for support. There was an opportunity to get it from the European Commission and the Government did not avail of it. We are told that wind, particularly offshore wind, is the answer. Ireland is the country in Europe that is most suitable for producing wind energy. At the moment, we produce 24 MW of offshore energy. Scotland, by comparison, produces 1.9 GW - or 1,900 MW - and is hoping to increase that to 11 GW by 2030. We have recently upped our 2030 target from 5 GW to 7 GW. Any international investor is going to look at our track record to date in determining whether to invest. Our track record does not match our rhetoric.</p>

          <p eId="para_86">The previous Oireachtas committee on climate decided, by majority vote if I am correct, that we would ban oil and gas exploration. Why? Because we wanted to reduce our dependency on fossil fuels. Why? Because we wanted to deal with the issue of climate change, because climate change is existential and we have to start. The danger was that if we kept on doing oil and gas exploration, we would reduce any incentives to move towards renewables. That has been the challenge. No one saw the war in Ukraine coming and the degree to which Europe would have to reduce, very rapidly, its dependence on Russian gas and oil, with countries scrambling all over looking for LNG across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_87"> We import the majority of our gas from the UK, which also take supplies from Norway. Some 75% of our gas from the UK and 25% comes from Corrib. We have developed well in terms of onshore wind. We are now on the cusp of a significant development in the context of offshore wind. Consents have been activated in respect of the east coast. Auctions will take place, and we will see the first phase of a significant offshore wind energy project getting under way. That has been assisted by the fact that the legislation around maritime permits and so on was brought through the House last year. The Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, has been legislated for, and advertisements for positions in MARA are now under way. It is envisaged that MARA will be established early next year. There is a genuine desire, which the Deputy articulated, to move faster in respect of this. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is off that view also. The EU is of the view that we need to fast-track the permit system. It is introducing a regulation that will provide for an overwhelming public interest clause. The latter will override other objections to offshore wind in the interest of the public good in order to get as much offshore wind energy in place so as to permanently reduce and eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels. All of that is accelerating across Europe because of the war in Ukraine. People want to reduce, very quickly, their dependence on Russian gas and oil.</p>
          <p eId="para_88"> Recent developments have been extraordinary. Russian gas accounts for something close to 10% of requirements compared with what the position was at the beginning of the year. It has been an extraordinary achievement by the EU. Gas storage is at 80% or 90% across Europe. This just shows what can be done out of necessity. That is the agenda ahead of us in terms of our security of supply.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">The reality is that people who want to invest in the biomethane sector in Europe are not coming to Ireland to invest. They are going elsewhere, because we do not have the structures within which they can invest. We did not even apply to the EU for that money. The reality is that Moneypoint is gearing up production at a time when we are saying that we are bringing in green energy, that we are going to create green hydrogen and that we will bring offhsore energy ashore at Moneypoint. That reality is further away than ever because the investors who were bringing both the money and the technology to bear on this matter are walking away from Ireland shaking their heads.</p>
          <p eId="para_90">Those investors are going to Scotland. I do not know why they are moving away but I am told they are doing so because of Ireland's inability to put frameworks in place to allow them to invest money. They are going to Scotland instead. We are producing 24 MW of offshore energy while Scotland is producing 1,900 MW.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> The Taoiseach is correct that consents are only now being given out for phase 1. Phase 2 will be the stage when floating energy will be able to develop green hydrogen that might some day fuel emergency generators. <b>
						</b>People need to know now whether power-to-X will be included. We have data centres that can take power directly from offshore generation if they are allowed to do so. Will they be allowed to do so? What will be the relevant criteria?</p>
          <p eId="para_92"> We are hopelessly behind. We will not attract international investment without certainty.</p>

          <p eId="para_93">The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, with the Commission for the Regulation of Utilities, EirGrid and the Department, form a board to try to accelerate the offshore wind initiative. The desire of the State is to do this in a controlled and organised way, not in a wild west sort of way. It is a natural resource. It is a national resource that belongs to the Irish people. This must be done in a programmed way.</p>

We have already increased our target in respect of offshore wind, hydrogen and so on for the end of the decade. Be in no doubt of the Government's commitment in respect of the funding. I think the Deputy is talking about loan facilities. Given the interest rates at which we were borrowing, if that is the same scheme, we did not need to borrow from the European Union facility when we could borrow at a cheaper rate ourselves. In some instances, we do not need to borrow, given the surpluses we have had.</p>

          <p eId="para_146">It is not agreed. For the last number of weeks, we have sought answers from the Government, including the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in respect of households that rely on prepaid meters. We have asked about a moratorium or ban on disconnection. We have offered a solution to Government which amounts to simply extending across the board a current ban that many companies operate in respect of weekends and some public holidays. We have asked, advised and insisted that happens immediately and have had no clear response. In fact, we have heard different responses from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who we were advised was doing a round of meetings and is putting some class of a plan together, and yet here we are. The weather will get colder. We will head into the Dáil recess next week and we still have had no answer. It is wholly unacceptable to all of us in this House. More importantly, it is unacceptable for those households that rely on prepaid meters. I ask the Minister to present himself and set out the plan precisely to ensure there is an immediate ban on disconnection for households that are reliant on prepaid meters.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">The Government was under pressure and was belatedly forced to bring in a ban on evictions, and I am glad that was the case. As I pointed out in the past week, it now transpires from the legislation that any person whose termination date on a notice to quit came before the date of the emergency period commencing will not be protected from eviction. If you have already passed your termination date and you are overholding, as many people are advised to do by the councils and local authorities, you will not be protected. I hope that is an oversight. We have an amendment submitted to the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022 tomorrow but we only have 60 minutes for the Committee and remaining Stages. I want clarification from the Government on this or, alternatively, the time to take the amendments tomorrow for the Committee and remaining Stages so that the Bill can be amended.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">There will be a rolling closure of early childhood care and education, ECCE, and childcare services starting in November. Five hundred small businesses with close their services. It will affect approximately 20,000 parents and will be the first of many. It will go on for months and months. The reason for this is that some of these small businesses are simply being closed down by the core funding plan of the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. This core funding plan does not adequately cover the costs of these businesses to allow them to function. This will have a devastating effect on parents’ ability to access childcare. It is a car crash happening in slow motion and nothing is being done about it. We need to have debate on this issue.</p>

The whole system as it is currently operating is a disaster. It is a time-consuming financial headache. It is therefore little surprise that only 89 homes have been retrofitted out of a Government target of 500,000. We were supposed to see 62,500 homes retrofitted this year but only a fraction of a fraction have been completed. It is now very clear that the whole scheme and system need to be completely overhauled. Those on middle and low incomes must be allowed to access this scheme, which they are currently locked out of. This means more public funding for the scheme. I ask the Taoiseach and Government to respond to the clear failure of this scheme and to change it.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">The Deputy should do a bit more homework than just one article because articles can get things wrong from time to time. My understanding is that the article in today's <i>Irish Examiner</i> that was critical of the level of delivery against our national retrofit targets incorrectly referred to a target of 62,500 retrofits in 2022 when the actual target was 27,000. The latest projections from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, indicate that we are on track to achieve our target of 27,000 home energy upgrades this year. This compares to 15,500 upgrades last year. Of course, we need to ramp up delivery significantly in the coming years to an average of 75,000 B2-equivalent home upgrades per year from 2026 to 2030. The national retrofit plan is our roadmap to doing this. The article refers to just 89 homes being completed. This figure relates to output under just one of the SEAI schemes, which was only launched in February of this year and which is currently in the start-up stage. The reality is that demand and delivery across the range of SEAI retrofit schemes has been exceptionally high this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I thank Deputy Bacik for raising this issue. Uisce Éireann, or Irish Water, now has an unprecedented capital budget that is on a multi-annual basis. That will include some very important infrastructural upgrades that pertain directly to the Deputy's area and the quality of water in Dublin Bay, such as the second wastewater treatment plant at Ringsend, which will be fully commissioned shortly. Regarding water testing and water quality, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, and I have engaged with groups such as SOS Dublin Bay. I do not see any reason the testing of water cannot be done and published on a year-round basis. We are working towards that. We have engaged with the three coastal Dublin local authorities in that space. The Minister of State and I continue to engage and we would like to see that done quite quickly.</p>

          <p eId="para_192">I raise the matter of a young girl from Greystones in County Wicklow. Her name is Miley McKee. She is 12 years old. She has a smile that would light up this entire Chamber. She is profoundly disabled and has had scoliosis for eight years now. She has been on the waiting list for an operation for two years. Her spine has a curvature of more than 100 degrees, which according to some experts is very rarely seen in the developed world, except for people in Ireland who have scoliosis, unfortunately. Everyone is ready to go to do Miley's operation. A year of work has been done on her. She has had anaesthetics done. She has had spinal X-rays and a full blood work-up. She has done sleep studies and has had meetings with all her consultants. They are all ready to go except they do not have access to a tracheostomy nurse. That is the only thing between Miley and getting this operation done. Her parents have written to the Taoiseach. They have explained that she is in constant pain. They described it as child abuse and I absolutely agree with them. Will the Taoiseach please look into this?</p>

          <p eId="para_193">I thank the Deputy for raising this case. It is a case I am familiar with and it is a case on which I have engaged with both the Department and the HSE. As the Deputy will be aware, we allocated €19 million this year specifically to deal with paediatric orthopaedics, including very complex cases, scoliosis and spina bifida. I met with Children's Health Ireland, CHI, and the National Orthopaedic Hospital Cappagh just yesterday. They have reported nearly a 50% reduction in the number of children waiting more than a year to date, which is very encouraging. There is about a 25% reduction in the number of children waiting in excess of four months. Our absolute goal and determination, and we are on track to meet it, is to bring the number of children waiting more than four months down to zero. I am meeting the Scoliosis Advocacy Network tomorrow. Everything that can be done for the young girl in our town will be done.</p>

          <p eId="para_195">The Department of Health announced six specialist menopause clinics in recent weeks. This is very welcome in standardising women's health in Ireland. There is an issue with staffing but it is to be hoped that can be overcome. The issue I have been contacted about by a number of women in my constituency is in regard to the price. If a person does not have a medical card, he or she will have to pay an initial charge of €150 and €75 thereafter. We have been speaking about universal healthcare and about Sláintecare. People who do not have a medical card are burdened with that price. Can this be reviewed in the future in order that people can access this healthcare for free?</p>

          <p eId="para_196">We will have the six menopause clinics up and running this year. I opened the one in the Rotunda just last week. The feedback we are getting from patients and practitioners is incredibly positive. Specifically on the specialist clinics, those services are free for everybody. Whether someone has a medical card, a GP card or nothing, the specialist clinic is free. Where there is a charge is for women who are engaging with their GP. Some of the GPs are charging more because they say it is an extended consultation. It is something I am aware of. It has been brought to my attention in recent weeks and it is something I would like to see explored.</p>

          <p eId="para_197">Yesterday I visited one of my local secondary schools, the Good Counsel College, New Ross, where a young man called Adam asked me about the rail review and where that currently stood. He wanted to know will a future Ireland for him consist of a high-speed rail network connecting Ireland's major cities.</p>
          <p eId="para_198"> It must also be noted that while we await the review, there are significant projects in Wexford that have been completely shelved, namely the proposed greenway that would connect Rosslare to Waterford on the current out-of-service rail corridor, which would potentially be transformative for tourism and flagship villages in County Wexford. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, launched a pathfinder programme of 35 transport projects to be delivered within the next three years with zero mention of Wexford. Will the Taoiseach clarify today what is the further timeframe on the publication of the rail review?</p>

          <p eId="para_199">I understand that the all-island rail review is close to completion. The problem now is that the Executive is not up and running in Northern Ireland. The review is a joint initiative that is funded under the shared island unit in the Department of the Taoiseach. At the time that the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the then Minister for Infrastructure, Nichola Mallon, launched the all-island rail network review the idea was to dramatically transform our rail speed in this country. Hopefully, if we can get positive outcomes to potential discussions between the EU and the UK on the protocol, and if we can get the Executive back up and running, we could publish the rail review and get working on it then.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> With regard to the Deputy's query on the greenway, I will talk to the Minister. There are many greenways going on between councils that do not necessarily have to be on the pathfinder programme list.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">Many Irish Water workers, and Tipperary County Council workers in the water services section, and Waterford City and County Council water workers - my parish is divided into both - have raised huge concerns and angst with me and with many other Deputies about what is going on and the transfer of their jobs and careers into Uisce Éireann or Ervia or whatever you want to call it now. There is huge concern and angst. I hate to call it a basket case but that is what Irish Water is. Níl aon phingin acu. They have no money. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien is chomping at the bit to stand up and say that they have. They have not. The workers there have served the county council and have served the people in the water services sections. These are plumbers and caretakers. Many of them have served the country well and have done some service to the State. In many cases they are being forced to go fully into Irish Water and leave their jobs that they took on as gainful employment as workers with Tipperary and Waterford councils and all of the other councils. It is unfair to them. I do not believe the unions are doing an awful lot for them. They are very concerned.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">I thank the Deputy. The week after next we will have a full debate on Irish Water. I wish to inform the Deputy, as he might not be aware, that we have given a commitment as part of the framework agreement that there is no compulsory transfer of any council staff in any local authority to Irish Water. We are creating a single, publicly owned utility. We have had very good engagement with all of the unions. I met them again last week. We are advancing on that. Any worker who does not wish to transfer will not be transferred. There will be many opportunities for job advancement, career advancement and training within Irish Water as well. The week after next, however, we will have that full debate. It is important that the Deputy is aware, and for his own constituents and for anyone working in water services in the local authority, that if for whatever reason it does not suit them or they do not wish to transfer, there will be no compulsory transfers. That is actually in the framework agreement, which has been published.</p>

          <p eId="para_203">Last week saw the Donegal Rape Crisis Centre report that it had 38 teenagers use its services in 2022, which is the highest level anywhere in the country. The manager of the centre has said that the level of physical violence accompanying the sexual violence is really very frightening. The manager went on to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_204">Each month now we can't keep up with the number of referrals both under and over 18. The number of under 18s [reporting] at the moment is just staggering, it really, really is.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">One of the issues highlighted is the lack of proper education for children in this area. We need real sexual awareness teaching. I would suggest that this must start for all children in primary school, at this stage. The Donegal Rape Crisis Centre has reduced to the age of 12 for the children who can access its services. I believe it is young men and boys who are in most need of support and who need to be taught about proper sexual behaviour. Now, however, they will be left behind. Will the Taoiseach tell the House if the Government provide adequate funding and reduce the age at which young people can receive sexual education in order to try to stem the tide of this abuse?</p>

          <p eId="para_206">Relationship and sexuality education is available at primary level and post-primary level.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">The reports the Deputy has received from the Donegal Rape Crisis Centre are very worrying. The Minister, through the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, has been undertaking a fundamental review of the junior certificate syllabus in respect of relationships and sexuality education, as well as at senior level. The work at junior level is complete. In addition to changing and broadening the curriculum, it is important to strengthen capacity through continuing professional development of teachers and to help and support teachers in the delivery of the programme at primary and senior cycle level. Regarding the combination of relationships and sexuality education, RSE, with social, personal and health education, SPHE, it is important to make sure to strengthen capacity in the delivery of those programmes in primary and second level education. I agree with the points the Deputy has made. </p>

          <p eId="para_208">Ireland has a very high level of unaddressed hearing loss. Almost one in ten of the adult population has significant hearing loss and needs audiology intervention. In 2021, the World Health Organization recommended that national governments in each country establish a national hearing plan for their populations and demonstrated in its report that this would represent excellent value for money. Does the Government intend to accept that recommendation and put a plan in place for the audiology service which is cohesive, efficient and caring, and which would save the health service an awful lot of money in years to come? What steps does the Government intend to take to reduce the waiting list for audiology services, which at present stands at 20,000, half children and half adults?</p>

          <p eId="para_209">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. The Minister for Health is alongside me. He also heard the Deputy and would be responsive to the idea and to the recommendation of the national hearing plan. I will ask the Minister to pursue that. There have been many initiatives across the broad spectrum of health services but audiology services need attention, particularly at child level, where early intervention can be key to the child's developmental potential. Substantial funding has been allocated for reducing waiting lists. Perhaps a useful discussion could take place as to the best means of deploying that funding in respect of audiology to get the list down as quickly as possible, utilising all resources that could potentially be available.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">I raise the issue of private nursing homes and the challenges they are facing. Sixteen private nursing homes have closed in recent months and a number of others are considering closing. That is because of what they are allowed. There was a comment recently to the effect that a nursing home that closed was getting €950 per week per bed under the fair deal scheme, while a public nursing home up the road was costing €1,900 per bed per week. What will be done? I understand further funding is available from the Department of Health but there is no engagement with the nursing home sector. This is what they are advising me. I have been speaking to representatives of a number of nursing homes in recent days. We want to make sure there are no further closures. It costs over €8,000 per bed per week in a hospital. We need these nursing home beds kept in place.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">I thank the Deputy for his question. I know he has raised it several times. To say there has been no engagement with the sector is completely untrue. I was in engagement with it this morning, and so have been my officials in the Department. We engage with Nursing Homes Ireland on a daily basis, never mind a weekly basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Concerns have been raised about 17 nursing homes that have either closed this year or given notice that they will close. Thankfully, some nursing homes have opened this year so we have not seen a net loss of beds. Notwithstanding that, I am acutely aware of the challenges for small family-run nursing homes and especially the voluntary sector. </p>
          <p eId="para_213"> It is interesting to note that 15 nursing home organisations in Ireland control or own 10,700 beds. We have quite a differential between one side of the nursing home equation and the other but the good news is I will be announcing supports for the nursing home sector tomorrow.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">Many of my constituents and of the Taoiseach were devastated to hear the news that the new elective hospital in Cork will not be operational until 2028. Last September, promises were made that that hospital would be open in 2024. Hospitals in Cork are in crisis right now. Tens of thousands are on waiting lists. People wait days on trolleys. To wait another six years is not feasible. We need a hospital and we need it open now. I will give the Taoiseach one fact: last month, in September, one person waited 88 hours on a trolley in Cork. We need a hospital now and not in six years' time.</p>

Many commitments were made to Waterford and the south east in that time but one is paramount, namely, 24-7 cardiac care. We are just weeks away from a formal handover of the second cath lab in Waterford and we have no bed allocation other than the existing allocation within the hospital to service that cath lab. In essence, we are getting a Rolls-Royce with no engine. A 12-bed day ward was promised. I have engaged with the HSE for almost two years. We have spoken about modular space, capital remediation and moving out community services but we have done nothing in that time to deliver these beds and we cannot open the cath lab without having beds. In these remaining days, will the Taoiseach give a commitment through the Department of the Taoiseach to expedite some framework that we can get beds allocated to this unit?</p>

Students at Maynooth University have been unable to get to their lectures in time. Young people appeared before the climate committee last Friday from all across the country. All spoke about public transport in their area. I asked them if they intended to get a car and all said they did not but would need the public transport system to run. What is the Government's plan?

At one end of my constituency, in Dublin 8, four community Garda sergeants and 25 Garda officers has become one sergeant and four Garda officers. At the other end, in Cherry Orchard, members of the Garda have made very clear what they need to keep that community safe, which is something we have all been talking about.

In my constituency, dozens of people have just received a demand for €8,500 within 30 days and yet here we are, in the middle of a cost of living crisis. The Government gives people a little bit here and a little bit there but what is it going to do to address the question of defective apartments and duplexes and to give these people 100% redress? After all, it was the Taoiseach's party which gave <i>carte blanche</i> to those in the Galway tent back during the Celtic tiger era.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">On transport, unfortunately the services being delivered by Go-Ahead Ireland include late buses, no shows, overcrowding and general poor standards of service. People are being left at the side of the street. The 270 bus in Dublin 15 did not arrive again yesterday. One student was forced to return home after it failed to turn up. Again Go-Ahead Ireland said that the driver was sick. This is the same stock answer we have heard for months. Go-Ahead's Irish subsidiary made €2.6 million in profit last year. It is really hard for commuters to stomach hearing the profits from this company when they are letting so many people down.</p>

          <p eId="para_262">Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan asked about support for the fisheries sector to deal with the increase in price of fuel. It is something he has been raising with me and keeping on the agenda. I did step in and put in place an extra month of a tie-up option being available, which invested €12 million specifically to support the sector to deal with the fuel crisis at the request of the fisher representatives themselves. That runs up to the end of November. It started in June. I have been monitoring prices very closely. They have increased again in the past two or three weeks. I met fishing representatives last week and am meeting again fishing co-ops this afternoon. I am reassessing the situation and will be looking at what additional support may be necessary there.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">Deputies Cronin and Paul Donnelly raised public transport services and Go-Ahead Ireland. It is a very serious issue. The National Transport Authority, NTA, has advised the Department of Transport in respect of this. The performance of all public transport operators is closely monitored as part of the contractual arrangements that are in place. Go-Ahead Ireland is not alone in experiencing service reliability issues. The public transport sector has been particularly hard hit by driver shortages as operators attempt to return to the pre-pandemic level of activity, as well as delivering intended service improvements. The NTA formally meets Go-Ahead Ireland on a weekly basis to review performance-associated customer feedback and driver recovery plans and will continue to closely monitor the situation. It continues to apply deductions performance payments as part of contracts. Due to the poor performance during the first half of 2022, the deductions applied were substantial. Penalties were previously applied to Go-Ahead Ireland in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022 amounting to approximately €266,000 and €209,000, respectively. These are issues with the NTA. The Deputies could communicate with the NTA in respect of specific services.</p>
          <p eId="para_264"> Deputy Costello raised Garda numbers. There are 14,300 members of An Garda Síochána and there will be a further 1,000. The next cohort of trainees is being taken in this month, and they will be followed by another 200 every 11 weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">That is the background. It is an operational matter for the Commissioner to appoint personnel to the various areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_266"> Deputy Bríd Smith raised the issue of the apartment defects. I said to the House last week that the Minister responsible intends to bring forward a scheme towards the end of the year in respect of defective apartments.</p>
          <p eId="para_267"> Deputy Stanton might have heard my reply earlier to Deputy McNamara on the need to accelerate all this. I will ask the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to examine the foreshore licences issue. Perhaps Deputy Stanton will communicate with him on that.</p>

          <p eId="para_276">Bunreacht Shaorstát Éireann, the Constitution of the Irish Free State, was adopted by an Act of Dáil Éireann sitting as a constituent assembly on this day 100 years ago. The 1922 Constitution is considered to be one of the foundation documents of the Irish State. It was born out of and shaped by the needs of the Treaty and was our first written Constitution. It established the system of parliamentary government more or less as we would recognise it today and guaranteed certain fundamental rights, such as freedom of speech and worship. The Constitution came into effect on 6 December 1922 following the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922 in Westminster and the issuing of the royal proclamation. It was a notable achievement of the nascent Irish State.</p>

            <p eId="para_285">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_286"> I visited New York for UN high-level week from 21 September to 23 September. While there, in addition to delivering Ireland's national statement, I had the opportunity to engage with a number of other leaders in round-table discussions, at bilateral meetings and in the margins. I had formal bilateral meetings with the Secretary-General of the UN, António Guterres; the President of the UN General Assembly, Csaba Kõrösi; the President of Nigeria; the Vice President of Uganda; and the Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands.</p>
            <p eId="para_287"> I participated in a round-table discussion on prospects for the Sahel region, convened by the UN Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, and attended by regional states and organisations, as well as by members of the UN Security Council. I also participated in a sustainable development goals-related event on the implementation of the UN global accelerator on jobs and social protection, convened by Mr. Guterres and the Prime Minister of Belgium, Mr. Alexander De Croo. I took part in a panel discussion on jobs and social protection to recover from overlapping crises. This was alongside Vice President Alupo and facilitated by Mr. Achim Steiner of the UN Development Programme, who delivered a keynote address. I also attended a forum of small states reception, hosted by Singapore.</p>
            <p eId="para_288"> In my statement to the General Assembly, I said that all countries, no matter how small, have a contribution to make to international peace and security and to economic and social development and that all people have the right to live in dignity and have their human rights and fundamental freedoms respected. I noted, however, that this is not the case for those currently facing hunger and food insecurity, nor is it the case for those in Ukraine who are being bombarded by Russian missiles and for many people in Syria, Afghanistan or Palestine. I spoke also of the devastating impacts of climate change, which often affects most those who bear least responsibility for its causes. I cautioned that despite these challenges and their scale, we must not lose faith in the UN or protections that a rules-based international order, for all its shortcomings, provides. I highlighted the successes that Ireland has achieved working with partners during its current term on the Security Council – for instance, in terms of humanitarian access to Syria and on ensuring the role of women as peace-builders and agents of change is at the heart of UN peacekeeping and political missions across the globe.</p>

            <p eId="para_289">When speaking at last month's General Assembly, the Taoiseach acknowledged in his remarks that Israeli settlements are a clear violation of international law, that the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory is untenable and that the global community cannot become inured to it. At least five Palestinians were killed yesterday and 21 wounded in the occupied West Bank after a wave of Israeli forces entered Nablus. Civilians have described the city as a scene from hell. Last week, a dozen Israeli soldiers raided a Palestinian home in East Jerusalem to arrest a 16-year-old child, Shadi Khoury. The soldiers beat him so badly that there was a trail of blood left outside the family home as they dragged him from it blindfolded and barefoot. He continues to be held without charge. Shadi's classmates held a vigil for him yesterday, calling for his release. As Ms Diana Buttu has observed, the international community seems to have a fiction that there is somehow Israel and also the settlements, as though they were separate one another. In reality, they are one. This week, a committed settler was appointed army chief in the occupied West Bank, which will serve only to underpin the long-voiced concerns about collaboration between the Israeli army and settlers in attacks against Palestinians. The normal rhetoric and controlled condemnation of this has to stop. There has to be robust action to hold Israel to account. What is the Government going to do to support and champion the occupied territories Bill?</p>

            <p eId="para_290">The world is in a very difficult and dangerous place at this time. There are numerous conflicts taking place, including the war in Ukraine. Climate change is now a reality in many countries. Conflict and climate change together have brought about famines and droughts, unprecedented world hunger and food insecurity. As if these were not enough, we are now witnessing the decline in democratic values throughout the world. During our two years on the UN Security Council, we rightly kept the focus on the effects of global warming on developing countries and how it creates even more conflict. The Taoiseach said as much in his address to the UN last month. He also correctly labelled Russia as a rogue state. In his contribution just now, he said we cannot lose faith in the UN. He referred to perceived shortcomings. How does he perceive the UN to be working in 2022? Is Russia's ability to veto UN resolutions a serious weakness? Is the UN, therefore, in need of reform to protect the rules-based international order? What else can be done to support the UN in its important work?</p>

            <p eId="para_291">This morning Israeli forces raided several areas in the occupied West Bank. Six more Palestinians were killed and 21 were wounded. This is just a small part of a much more general escalation by Israel, with raids in Jenin and Nablus and blockades of whole communities. Many young people have been shot. There is also an ongoing attempt at ethnic cleansing in Sheikh Jarrah, East Jerusalem. Amnesty International produced a report this week that accuses Israel of having committed war crimes earlier this year in Gaza. The Taoiseach did mention these incidents in his UN Assembly speech but without making the assertive calls for action or sanctions that he directs towards Putin's bloody invasion of Ukraine. Can he possibly explain the inconsistency in standards and approach when it comes to the ongoing crimes against humanity, war crimes, illegal occupation, ethnic cleansing and apartheid practices that Israel perpetrates day in, day out, blatantly unapologetically and in respect of which no action is ever taken by the EU?</p>

            <p eId="para_292">I met with aid agencies recently, who are warning that a devastating famine on a scale not seen since Somalia in 1992 when up to 300,000 people died is now imminent in the Horn of Africa. Already, hundreds of thousands of women and children have been forced from their homes and are gathering in large camps where supplies, including water, are expensive and increasingly scarce. These are climate refugee camps. The coming famine is almost entirely caused by climate change, with rains failing for the fifth season in a row and the sixth rainy season not looking much better. When is Ireland finally going to take meaningful action on climate at home and to push for other countries to do so abroad? Will the Irish Government push for a meaningful fund for finance for loss and damage for developing countries to be included in the final agreement at COP27? That will be 31 years after such a fund was first promised by rich countries during the Paris negotiations. Will Ireland join Scotland, Denmark and Wallonia in beginning to pay for loss and damage?</p>
            <p eId="para_293"> Research by Oxfam has shown that the profits of just six fossil fuel companies in the first six months of this year would more than cover the cost of major extreme weather and climate-related events in developing countries and still leave them with $70 billion in profits, yet they are being asked to pay nothing for loss and damage they are causing to the 40% of humanity living in the global south.</p>

            <p eId="para_294">There are 60,000 political prisoners behind bars in Egypt. One of them, Abd el-Fattah, whose collection of prison writings was published earlier this year, has been on a 100 calories per day hunger strike since the start of April. The Egyptian dictatorship, having organised a military coup in 2013, now wants to organise a greenwashing publicity coup in 2022 by hosting the United Nations climate change conference, COP27. It is due to start on 6 November. Egyptian NGOs that have criticised the regime's record on the environment have been harassed, spied on and filtered out of the conference. Has the Government raised any objections to the location for COP27, and has it made the release of Egypt's political prisoners a serious issue in any fashion in the run-up to this conference? If not, why not?</p>

            <p eId="para_295">I thank the Taoiseach for updating us on his speech to the UN General Assembly. I know he raised the plight of Palestine. I also want to raise with him the ongoing situation in Palestine where we are seeing a very serious escalation of violence by Israel as part of a month-long military campaign in the northern part of the West Bank with more than 100 Palestinians killed so far this year. This intensification of violence is deeply distressing to see. Does Ireland intend to raise this further at the Security Council? I know the Taoiseach raised it at the UN, but how can we use our position on the UN Security Council to highlight and put the spotlight on the appalling treatment of Palestinians by Israel?</p>

            <p eId="para_296">Deputy Brady raised the issue of Palestine, as did a number of Deputies. Deputy Boyd Barrett said that I mentioned Palestine. I did more than mention it. I did not pull any punches in respect of Palestine in my speech, and I laid the blame where it clearly lay. I stated unequivocally the illegal nature of the settlements. I was very clear about it in my speech, as I was in condemning Russia. I am not into whataboutery. I will say if something is wrong in any given location. What is going on in Palestine is wrong. I have said this repeatedly. The Irish Government has said that a two-state solution is the only solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_297"> I know Deputy Brady's party has had a lot of engagement in America. The party has visited Senator Schumer and others and it has a lot of connections with influential congressmen. I do not know if they have ever raised the Palestinian issue with their American interlocutors, but I think they should.

            <p eId="para_303">We are one of the largest contributors to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, on a repeated basis, which assists both Gaza and Palestine. We have raised it. UN Secretary General Guterres has praised Ireland. He pulled me aside at a European Council meeting to thank Ireland for its assertiveness on the Security Council in respect of the Middle East and Palestine. It is very easy to come in here and throw cheap shots at the Government's position. We have been very consistent over the last number of decades. We are one of the few countries in the European Union that has asserted itself in respect of this issue and taken a lot of criticism for so doing, might I add, from different quarters. That is the reason I put the point to the Deputy. He needs to let us know what feedback his party is getting from the people they are meeting with and if they raise it with them at all. I never get any feedback on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_304"> Deputy Boyd Barrett raised that issue as well, including Nablus and so forth. I met with Mahmoud Abbas recently. I also met with the Palestinian Prime Minister in London, coincidentally, as we were going to the Queen's funeral. In my view there is an absolute need to stop the settlements and for a genuine peace process between Israel and Palestine but there is a need for reform within Palestine as well. We need elections within the West Bank and Gaza. There has not been an election to the authority in 15 years or more. That is not satisfactory either. We made these points. We need to continue to support the Palestinian Authority, resource-wise, so that it can administer services to its people. Ultimately, the only way out of this endless saga is to try to get a two-state solution in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_305"> I do not think that in any way invalidates our condemnation of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Deputy Boyd Barrett seemed to suggest. What is going on in Ukraine is beyond condemnation at this stage. It is incredible inhumanity, in particular the drone attacks on civilian targets and energy security. Putin basically wants to make life in Ukraine uninhabitable. I have not seen the scale of what he is doing anywhere in modern times, bar what happened in Syria and, again, he himself did that.</p>

            <p eId="para_312">Deputy Murphy raised the financing of climate change. Again, Ireland has been to the fore in respect of the global financing of countries in particular those that need supports. We have been very strong on helping small island states, for example, and their need for adaptation in respect of climate change and how it will impact on them immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_313"> We pushed very strongly at COP26 for an agreement and we increased our own contribution to global financing in respect of climate change. Again at the Security Council, in relation to famine, I reference the work of our diplomats. They are a young team but they are an exceptional team representing our country. They were instrumental in maintaining the humanitarian corridor in Syria, which we got passed at the Security Council, despite Russia's reluctance. That ensures food for millions of people in Syria. In Ethiopia, the government reduced the number of our diplomats at the embassy in Addis Ababa because of our stance at the Security Council in respect of the war in Ethiopia. They did not like Ireland standing up and assertively saying what should happen. We called for a proper peace process and we called for engagement, but that was frowned upon, with the result that our embassy was reduced in numbers. Ireland has been very effective at the Security Council and we have taken strong stances from a humanitarian perspective. During our term, in particular, we pushed the role of women in conflict in all of the areas such as Afghanistan and right around the world. We pointed to the example of significant women involved in reconciliation in Colombia and elsewhere. We invited them before the Security Council to make presentations.</p>
            <p eId="para_314"> Deputy Haughey raised the important issue of reform. In my view, the United Nations does need reform. The fact that one of the five members that hold the veto could engage in this kind of wanton destruction of a neighbouring state calls into question the membership of the Security Council, particularly the permanent five, and it injures and undermines the effectiveness and the capacity of the council. It is in need of urgent reform, and we consistently work on that in terms of broadening the Security Council and its membership into the future. It should reflect modern-day realities in terms of demographics and how the world has evolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_315"> Meanwhile, we continue to work with the UN Secretary General. It should be recognised that he has been effective in the work he did on the Black Sea grain initiative, which has done a lot of work to prevent hunger and famine in Africa and the Middle East. It is imperative that that Black Sea grain initiative is renewed to prevent further hunger across the board.</p>

            <p eId="para_323">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 to 15, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_324"> The well-being framework is a programme for Government commitment to measure how we are doing overall as a country and improve our understanding of quality of life in Ireland. It does this by bringing economic, societal and environmental impacts together under one framework. It also places a particular focus on equality and sustaining well-being into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_325"> In June, the Government published a second report on Ireland's well-being framework, Understanding Life in Ireland: A Well-being Framework. This report outlines the longer term approach for integrating the framework into the Irish policymaking system over time. Alongside the second report, a high-level analysis of the well-being dashboard, which is hosted by the Central Statistics Office, was also published. This provides a medium-term, holistic view of quality of life in Ireland. Overall, the dashboard provides a positive picture of the country, as Ireland performs well in 21 of the 35 indicators. Only one dimension reveals a negative overall picture, namely, the environment, climate and biodiversity dimension.</p>
            <p eId="para_326"> This year, the well-being framework and the high-level analysis fed into the budgetary process. It was a theme at the national economic dialogue in June, and the analysis featured in the summer economic statement and as part of budget day documents. This will now be an annual contribution to the budgetary process that will support a broader discussion of the impacts of budgetary decisions. Work is ongoing in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on how to further integrate the framework into policymaking and expenditure decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_327"> It is important that further integration is progressed in a measured and coherent way and implemented gradually. Over time, the framework can help inform policymakers take a more rounded view, based on evidence, of what determines quality of life in Ireland beyond just economic growth.</p>

            <p eId="para_328">Ireland's well-being framework is a laudable initiative. The limitations of GDP as a measurement of a country's progress has long been acknowledged. As with any initiative, it can be judged only by the positive outcomes it delivers for society. Like equity budgeting, we have yet to see what tangible benefits and realisation of rights it will deliver. What impact, for example, will the framework have for people living in residential services for people with disabilities, who contributed to the HIQA report on resident forums published today? HIQA's report includes the distressing confirmation that residents want to get out of the residential settings and live in the community but there is nowhere for them to live on their own.</p>
            <p eId="para_329"> On Sunday, my party leader, Deputy McDonald, met Geraldine Lavelle, who, as a result of collision when out cycling nine years ago, suffered a spinal fracture that left her paralysed from the chest down. After her rehabilitation, Geraldine moved into a congregated setting for what she thought would be a number of months in order to adjust to life with her injury. Eight years later, she is still there, with no indication of when appropriate social housing will be provided for her. She rightly believes that everybody needs a place to call home and that segregated settings do not feel like a home.</p>
            <p eId="para_330"> Frameworks are not worth the paper they are written on if people's lived experiences are not front and centre and if the State's failure to provide for them is not addressed. How will the framework deliver for Geraldine and the contributors to HIQA's resident forums?</p>

            <p eId="para_331">The Taoiseach will agree that access to women's reproductive healthcare is essential to well-being, in particular that of women and girls. I say this as we mark this week the tenth anniversary of the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar. Of course, since then, we have seen the repeal of the eighth amendment and the introduction of very welcome abortion legislation in this jurisdiction. The announcement yesterday by the UK's Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that the British Government would commission abortion services is welcome but also long overdue because women have for so long been denied access to basic healthcare.</p>
            <p eId="para_332"> I was glad to attend today the timely launch by the National Women's Council of Ireland of the new report Every Woman, setting out an overview of access to reproductive healthcare and choice for all. This report highlights the continued gaps in abortion healthcare, even in this jurisdiction. We in the Labour Party put forward a submission to the public consultation on the review of our abortion laws in March, calling for the repeal of the three-day waiting period and for better geographic coverage so that women in all counties can access services.</p>
            <p eId="para_333"> I was glad to launch the conference of the Southern Taskgroup on Abortion and Reproductive Topics, START, on 1 October. START is a group of doctors providing front-line services that was initiated by Cork-based GPs, obstetricians and gynaecologists. Doctors are seeking to ensure there is a stronger network across the country, and we are seeking to ensure strengthened access to reproductive healthcare once the review has concluded. Given that the consultation closed on 1 April, can the Taoiseach say when we will see progress on the reform of our abortion law to ensure greater access for women?</p>

            <p eId="para_334">Fail to prepare, prepare to fail. The Government's target is to retrofit 500,000 homes by 2030, or 62,500 homes a year, but so far this year only 681 homes have been approved and only 89 retrofits completed. It is safe to say the Government is about a million miles off target at this point and that is no surprise. If people are asked under the scheme to fork out €10,000, €20,000, €30,000 or €40,000 upfront in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, this is what the Government is going to get. There should be no upfront charges. The cost should be covered by the State, with people paying back a portion, based on ability to pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_335"> Someone once said the definition of insanity was doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. When is the Government going to change its policy on this issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_336">The well-being framework rightly points to access to housing as a key component of well-being. For the more than 100 residents of Tathony House, an apartment complex in Dublin 8 with 35 households of workers, families and many children, their well-being was seriously shattered by an eviction notice from their landlord threatening the mass eviction of the entire block. Shockingly, the person who owns this property, who the residents estimate is probably making an annual income of about €700,000 a year, is trying to claim financial hardship as a justification for a mass eviction, which just tells us about some of the landlord class in this country.</p>
            <p eId="para_337"> The residents - I put this to the Taoiseach, as we have done with St. Helen's Court in Dún Laoghaire and other cases where tenants have faced eviction through no fault of their own - are asking that the State step in and buy that block to ensure there is no mass eviction of these tenants. That should be a systematic policy pursued by the Government. We just cannot have a situation where, again and again, ruthless, profit-hungry landlords, just to make money, can threaten people with mass eviction into homelessness, with all the suffering, hardship and trauma that involves. I hope the Taoiseach will take seriously that request.</p>

            <p eId="para_338">On Sunday, I joined workers protesting outside Liffey Valley Shopping Centre. They have been protesting over the last few weeks about the implementation of parking charges for them.</p>
            <p eId="para_339">The cost will amount to at least €600 annually for many of the workers, which they will have to pay just to come to their place of work. If they cannot find a space in the limited staff car park and have to use the customer car park, this could rise to more than €2,000. Effectively, this a pay cut for these workers. They are 100% right to campaign and fight against it. Liffey Valley should be forced to offer free parking for its staff, as it has up until now. If it wants to encourage workers to take public transport, it should be covering public travel passes. Does the Taoiseach agree that it is disgusting that Hines, the real estate investment trust that owns Liffey Valley and that has more than €3.7 billion worth of assets in management in Ireland, is trying to squeeze even more profit out of these workers?</p>

            <p eId="para_340">Deputy Brady raised the specific case of Ms Geraldine Lavelle. I am not familiar with the case in its entirety. I agree, however, that the more independent living services and facilities we can provide, the better. As the Deputy knows, we have different opinions from time to time in terms of closing residential care or evolving people from a residential care environment or integrated care setting to a home care setting. This approach has often created challenges for the services, particularly in terms of chronically sick young people or young people who, for a variety of reasons, have disabilities arising from accidents and so forth. There was a need for a resourced home care-based approach or independent living-based approach, which has been developed over a long period. I do not have the specifics of the case but the principle of facilitating independent living is accepted. Resources have been allocated on an annual and incremental basis. I am not familiar with this individual case. The Deputy stated that eight years have passed and that an appropriate setting has still not been provided, which is not satisfactory for that person.</p>
            <p eId="para_341"> Deputy Bacik raised the issue of access to woman's reproductive services and the work of the National Women's Council of Ireland, which published a report earlier. I outlined previously in the House, in the past week or so, where we are on that in terms of the Minister's various initiatives from a research strand to a consultation strand. That is nearing completion. I will voice the opinion in the interim that there is an obligation on the HSE and all maternity hospitals to provide access under the Act. I am concerned that some hospitals have still not done that. I accept that there can be individual conscientious objections, but it is then a matter for the hospital or the HSE to provide enough resources to accommodate this in given situations in order that there is a maximum of access to legally available services in the State. I will raise the issues raised by the Deputy with the Minister for Health. However, I did outline to Deputy Bacik last week the exact timelines for the review of the legislation that is under way and that will come to finality fairly soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_342"> Deputy Barry raised the issue of retrofitting. I do not know if the Deputy was in the Chamber during the Order of Business. I am told that the article is not correct. I have been informed by the Department that 29,000 have actually been completed. They are on target in terms of the retrofitting of homes. The article's reference to a figure of 89 related to a specific scheme involving the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, which was only started in February. It is achieving its targets, however. In fact, applications were up 150% this year after the announcement of the new scheme. It is very much on target. We must accelerates the numbers even further in order to meet the 2026 target, which is very high indeed. I will get those figures for the Deputy as they were presented to me. The note I received indicates that the article was mistaken and incorrect. It is certainly not reflective of the progress that has been made. I also heard it being quoted this morning on radio. Apparently, it is an incorrect article based on incorrect information. I stand to be corrected if that is the case but I think we need to bring clarity to it. The Department gave me that information. This is difficult for the Deputy; he made a presentation based on the article. I am told it is not grounded in the reality of what is happening, however.</p>

In the first instance, the local authority has to respond if it feels it is the right approach and, indeed, the Minister as well. There are various frameworks to try to get issues like this resolved. I do not know what the situation is respect of the owner. I do not know the background at all, but I will raise the matter with the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_350"> Deputy Paul Murphy referred to Liffey Valley employees and the car park. This matter has been raised consistently in the House. These issues should be resolved through the normal employer-employee labour relations mechanisms. It does seem to be a very odd dispute. In my view, both sides should take steps to resolve this in the interests of all concerned. The public will be somewhat taken aback by what is occurring. Again, I do not have the full detailed background to the matter. I urge both sides to get into a process to get it resolved.</p>

            <p eId="para_359">I propose to take questions Nos. 16 to 23, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_360"> The international section of the Department supports my work at an international level, beyond Europe, to promote Ireland's foreign and economic policy objectives and develop and maintain strong bilateral and multilateral relations. Working closely with other Departments, especially the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence, the section provides me with advice and briefings on bilateral relations and international issues generally, including international peace and security, overseas development assistance and international human rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_361"> The section also oversees the implementation of the Government's Global Ireland: Ireland’s Global Footprint to 2025 strategy, including its renewal. The section chairs a senior officials' group on the sustainable development goals, SDGs, which provides strategic overview and monitors overall performance, supporting the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications, which has overall responsibility for overseeing coherent implementation across government.</p>
            <p eId="para_362"> The section co-ordinates my international travel as well as my engagements with visiting Heads of State and Government and with other international figures and organisations. Recent outbound visits include my visits to Japan and Singapore in July and my attendance at the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September.</p>
            <p eId="para_363"> In my political meetings in Japan and Singapore with Prime Ministers Kishida and Lee, respectively, we discussed Russia's war on Ukraine, the impact of which is being felt all around the world. We also discussed a number of global topics of shared concern, including how to restore broken supply chains in the wake of the pandemic and how we can all act together on climate. Japan continues to be the largest source of inward investment into Ireland from the Asia-Pacific region, and I was pleased to meet with a number of industry representatives and Irish State agency clients while there. While in Tokyo, I was also pleased to turn the sod on a new Ireland House, which will bring our embassy and State agencies under one roof in this critical overseas market in order to ensure a joined-up team Ireland approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_364"> Approximately 5,000 Irish citizens call Singapore home, living and working there and making significant contributions. In my meeting with Prime Minister Lee, we also discussed economic and social changes in each of our countries. In particular, I set out the positive impacts the marriage equality referendum has had on Irish society. I welcome the decision taken since in August by Prime Minister Lee to repeal the law which had criminalised sex between men in that country.</p>
            <p eId="para_365"> At the United Nations General Assembly in New York in September, I delivered Ireland's national statement. I also engaged with a number of other leaders in round-table discussions, bilateral meetings and in the margins, including with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Mr. Antonio Guterres, the President of the UN General Assembly, the President of Nigeria, the Vice-President of Uganda and the Prime Minister of the Faroe Islands. I participated in a round table discussion on the Sahel region, as I said earlier, attended by regional states and organisations as well as by members of the Security Council. I participated in a SDG-related event on jobs and social protection, delivering a keynote address. I also attended a Forum of Small States reception hosted by Singapore.</p>

            <p eId="para_367">Iranian protests following the death of Mahsa Amini are now in their sixth week.</p>
            <p eId="para_368">Support for the country's women is growing but so is the regime's brutality against its own citizens. Mahsa was arrested in Tehran by Iran's so-called morality police and taken to a re-education centre for lessons in modesty, where she later died. Earlier this month, Iran's revolutionary guard went into a girls' secondary school and forced the children to sing a pro-regime song. The girls refused and were beaten. Seven were arrested, ten hospitalised and 16 year-old Asra Panahi died. The country's military and police continue violently to raid homes, workplaces and education settings. Protesters are beaten and killed and jails are now overflowing with increasing numbers under house arrest.</p>
            <p eId="para_369"> The Minister for Foreign Affairs summoned the Iranian ambassador last week to raise the case of Mahsa Amini's death and the disproportionate response of the country's security forces to the protesters. What were the outcomes of this meeting? Did the ambassador confirm that Iranian climber Elnaz Rekabi is currently under house arrest? What engagement have the Taoiseach and Minister had with their European counterparts? What further actions will Government and the EU take if the additional targeted sanctions against Iranian individuals do not deliver the intended results?</p>

Our dealings with the European Union are more important than ever as are bilateral relations, particularly with the United States, while they are absolutely necessary in respect of our nearest neighbour. Has the Taoiseach spoken with or has he plans to speak with Rishi Sunak?

            <p eId="para_371">To return to what the Taoiseach said about Palestine and his uncritical commitment to the so-called two-state solution, the entire history of the State of Israel has been 70 years of relentless ethnic cleansing and displacement of Palestinian people. The two-state solution is a mirage and a ploy promoted by Israel and the United States, behind which they continue the relentless campaign of ethnic cleansing, colonisation of Palestinian territory and the permanent displacement of about 9 million Palestinians around the world. Instead of repeating that meaningless mantra, should we not call out the apartheid, ethnic cleansing, illegal occupation, war crimes and crimes against humanity and insist that the world isolates a regime perpetrating those kind of crimes? We should insist on equality, self-determination and freedom for the oppressed Palestinian people.</p>

            <p eId="para_372">The Government has very cynically used Putin's imperialist and brutal invasion of Ukraine to drive a coach and horses through what is left of the idea of neutrality. Last week the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said that Ireland will participate in the EU's training mission for the Ukrainian army expected to get under way in mid-November. It is very clear that this is the next step in the Government's determined effort to involve Ireland in European and eventually NATO military undertakings. It comes alongside the fact that the Irish Government has now participated in five meetings of the Ukraine contact defence group, a group described by the US Secretary of Defence as a NATO alliance, a body which meets at the NATO headquarters at the US air base of Rammstein in Germany. It comes alongside the escalation of Ireland's involvement in PESCO and the provision of military equipment to Ukraine. The Government is doing all of this in open defiance of the wish of an overwhelming majority of people to remain neutral from all of the imperialist military blocs that are a scourge on the people of the world. It is also doing it without any vote under Article 28 of the Constitution which states clearly that the State shall not participate in any war save with the assent of Dáil Éireann. Will the Government stop this attack on neutrality and instead focus on real solidarity with Ukrainian people, call for cancellation of the debt, shut down the shadow banking system here and provide housing for Ukrainians and all refugees and homeless people here?</p>

            <p eId="para_373">I want to condemn in the strongest terms the vicious attacks on the right to strike being carried out in France by the Macron Government. The notorious CRS riot police have been unleashed against striking workers who have been threatened with six months in prison or €10,000 fines if they do not return to work. These are workers at TotalEnergies and Exxon Mobil who dared to strike for 10% wage increases after TotalEnergies gave a €2.6 billion dividend to shareholders and Exxon recorded its largest quarterly profits ever. Incredibly, Macron presided over this repression while heaping praise on the Iranian oil workers who have rightly chosen to strike against the repressive Iranian regime. Will the Taoiseach condemn the actions of the Macron Government and the repression of the French State against workers fighting for fair play and social justice?</p>

            <p eId="para_374">I raised the situation in Iran with the Taoiseach last week and condemned the brutality of the Iranian regime against women and girls who have been asserting their rights. I received an extraordinary letter today from the Iranian ambassador suggesting there was exaggeration in my "emotive expressions", that I had been making loaded comments and that my contribution was characterised by misinformation. I take huge issue with the response of the Iranian ambassador and renew my call on the Taoiseach. How can we maintain relations with a country that treats its own people in such a way, and that is so intent on spreading misinformation about what is going on in Iran? We know that there have been protestors who have died. We understand some 244 protestors have died including 32 children. We have seen reports of arrests of so many people for protesting for basic rights and women and girls that Iran has run out of jail cells. We are seeing of course also Iran continuing to provide kamikaze drones to Russia that are being used to bomb civilian infrastructure in Ukraine. I am renewing my call on the Taoiseach to end diplomatic ties with Iran given all of the terrible brutality the Iranian regime is perpetrating on its own citizens and others.</p>

            <from>Deputy Seán Haughey<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_375">The international unit in the Department of the Taoiseach gives the Taoiseach advice on international issues including peace and security, overseas development assistance and fundamental human rights. It also monitors progress on the implementation of the UN strategic development goals. I welcome the recent launch of the new national implementation plan for these goals. As regards fundamental rights, like Deputies Bacik and Brady, I also wish to ask the Taoiseach about the current situation in Iran. The death of Mahsa Amini following her detention for failing to wear a hijab has sparked widespread protests. There has been a disproportionate response to these protests and a number of protestors have been killed, as we have heard. There are also concerns about the safety and wellbeing of the Iranian athlete climber Elnaz Rekabi. Now it appears that Iran is supplying drone weaponry to Russia for deployment in Ukraine. Will the Taoiseach continue to raise at EU level the need to impose additional sanctions on Iran in response to these ongoing abuses of fundamental human rights?</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_376">A number of Deputies including Deputies Haughey, Brady and Bacik have raised the Iranian situation. The death of a number of women and girls and the underlying human rights situation for women and girls in Iran stand to be condemned. It is of deep concern. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has twice raised the specific case of Mahsa Amini and the unjustified response to peaceful protestors directly with the Iranian Foreign Minister and has called in the Iranian ambassador. He has also raised with the Iranian ambassador concerns for the safety and welfare of Elnaz Rekabi, the Iranian rock climber who could face charges in Iran for not wearing a head scarf while competing at an event in South Korea. Iran's supply of weaponry to Russia, which Deputy Haughey referenced, is directly contributing to violations of international law. Last Thursday the European Union adopted additional targeted sanctions to add three Iranian individuals and one entity involved in the development and delivery of drones to Russia.</p>
            <p eId="para_377">More will be added in the coming days.</p>
            <p eId="para_378"> The fundamental question of diplomatic relations applies to many states that engage in practices we do not approve of, but diplomacy is the last channel remaining to try to persuade people to do differently and to articulate our concerns, consistently raise issues and, into the future, try to develop channels to get a change in how people practise. It is a matter of the gravest of considerations to end diplomatic relations, particularly in a context where we decided only in more recent times to restore diplomatic relations with Iran and given we are working in the context of the UN Security Council on the nuclear file, endeavouring to get the six-party treaty in place, and get Iran, the US, the EU and so on involved in denuclearising any potential for nuclear weapons in Iran. Keeping our diplomatic channels open is very important to the realisation of our goals as members of the UN Security Council, especially since we were responsible for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, file at the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_379"> I must take issue with Deputy Murphy's point. He said we are cynically using Putin's war to drive a coach-and-four through our neutrality. One might imagine we had contrived the war to enable us to do this. It is a shocking thing to say.</p>

            <p eId="para_388">The point is the Deputy spent the past three or four minutes saying the Government is trying to breach neutrality. That was of more concern to him than the fact Iranian drones are raining down on Ukrainian civilians. Why did the Ukrainian Government ask us for help in regard to training? I met the Prime Minister the week before last at a meeting of the European Political Community. What did he ask me? He asked for help with demining. Why did he ask for help with demining? He did so because there are mines all over Ukraine.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Paschal Donohoe)<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_407">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> We are here today to begin our consideration of the Finance Bill 2022, which will give the necessary legal basis to the decisions announced in the budget and make a number of other necessary changes to tax legislation. This year's Bill sets out the legislative provisions to bring effect to the tax measures announced in budget 2023, which is a cost-of living budget that underlines the Government's commitment to help individuals, families and businesses to deal with the challenge of rising prices. The Bill implements a range of targeted tax changes, including specific measures to support families and businesses and to address the many challenges facing our society, including housing and climate change. It also contains a number of administrative changes to the tax code, reflects recent international developments and seeks to protect and enhance the integrity of our code of taxation. I look forward to bringing this important legislative instrument through the Oireachtas over the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> To help families, individuals and businesses deal with the rising cost of living, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy McGrath, and I have announced a package of one-off measures worth €4.1 billion. They are accompanied by additional budgetary measures for 2023 worth €6.9 billion. This brings the total size of budget 2023 to €11 billion. In addition, there is a further €300 million in public service support measures funded from the National Surplus (Exceptional Contingencies) Reserve Fund. I appreciate these are very significant figures. However, I also appreciate the needs of families and businesses are very significant. The strength in tax revenues, particularly domestic tax revenues, has provided us with the additional means to undertake such a response.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> One of the core objective in budget 2023 is to ensure workers do not find themselves in a position where they pay more income tax solely because of inflation. There are many people who work hard but whose earnings push them outside of access to any additional support from the State. We need to help them too. We need to put money back into their pockets. On budget day, therefore, I announced an income tax package to the value of more than €1.1 billion. I am increasing the standard rate cut-off point by €3,200 to €40,000, with proportionate increases for married couples and civil partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_411"> I am also increasing the main tax credits for personal, employee and earned income credit by €75. I am increasing the home carer tax credit by €100 to support stay-at-home parents. The basic personal tax credit available to married persons and civil partners who are jointly assessed to tax will increase from €3,400 to €3,550. In all other cases, the value of the tax credit will increase from €1,700 to €1,775. The value of the home carer tax credit will be increased from €1,600 to €1,700. The value of both the employee tax credit and earned income tax credit will also increase from €1,700 to €1,775. Where an individual is entitled to both the employee tax credit and the earned income tax credit in the same year of assessment, the aggregate of credits available to him or her under the two provisions will not exceed €1,775. Furthermore, I am increasing the second universal social charge, USC, rate band of 2% from €21,295 to €22,920 in line with the 80 cent per hour increase in the national minimum wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Housing continues to be one of the biggest challenges facing the country and a whole-of-government approach is being taken to address this challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">In the Finance Bill, a number of provisions will make their contribution to this challenge, including the rental tax credit of €500, changes to the help-to-buy scheme, and changes to the pre-letting expenses regime to assist landlords preparing properties for rent. The introduction of the vacant homes tax and changes to the residential zoned land tax aim to increase the supply of homes for rent and purchase.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> Also in the property sector, I am providing for a defective concrete blocks levy to raise some of the funding required for the defective concrete blocks grant scheme. Following the announcement of this levy on budget day and in light of subsequent comment on the measure, I have determined that the rate at which the levy will apply will be halved from the planned 10% to 5%. The move will come into effect on 1 September 2023 as opposed to 3 April 2023. This will allow all parties more time to prepare for its introduction. I have also reduced the range of products to which the levy will apply. This Finance Bill provides that the levy will apply to pouring concrete and concrete blocks under two harmonised EU standards. It will not apply to precast concrete products.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> As I have said, the Government appreciates the challenges that businesses are facing with significant increases in electricity and gas costs. These challenges come on top of Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic with the necessary public health restrictions and closed premises. Therefore, I am introducing a temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, to provide appropriate support to businesses during the winter months. When I announced the scheme on budget day, it was to apply, at that point, to tax compliant businesses carrying out a case I trade. This has been extended and the Bill provides that it will also apply to those carrying out a case II profession. The scheme will also apply to new businesses, and eligibility for relief in such cases will be calculated using a deemed unit price provided by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI. This will be based on data provided by suppliers and the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU. A monthly cap of €10,000 per trade or profession will be applied. However, in certain circumstances qualifying businesses that operate across more than one location and that have multiple meter point reference numbers may qualify for increased relief. In such cases, the monthly cap of €10,000 may be increased to a maximum of €30,000. The scheme falls under the European Commission temporary crisis framework, TCF, and is subject to state aid approval. As I announced on budget day, it is intended the scheme will operate in respect of energy costs relating to the period 1 September 2022 to 28 February 2023. However, pending revision of the TCF, which is expected to occur by the end of this month, it was not possible to provide for an end date to the scheme beyond 31 December 2022. I hope to amend the legislation on Committee Stage to include the 28 February end date after the anticipated amendment of the TCF.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Another regulation under discussion at European level is the agricultural block exemption regulation, ABER. There are a number of budget proposals that are dependent on the outcome of these negotiations. These include the introduction of the provision for accelerated capital allowances for the construction of slurry storage, and the extension of a number of agricultural tax measures due to expire at the end of December 2022. Again, and subject to the outcome of negotiations, I would hope these can be addressed by Committee Stage amendments. The provisions relating to the key employee engagement programme, KEEP, will also be addressed during the passage of the Bill. As I indicated at budget time, the clear intention remains to legislate, through amendments introduced on Committee Stage, so as to provide for the buy-back of KEEP shares by the company from the relevant employee and to raise the lifetime company limit for KEEP shares from €3 million to €6 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> I now turn to the contents of the Bill itself. It is a substantial Bill, running to more than 200 pages. The first sections deal with income tax items, some of which I discussed earlier. I draw Members’ attention to section 6, which provides for the increase in the small benefit exemption to €1,000 and the increase in the number of vouchers from one to two. Members will recall this measure was introduced by financial resolution on budget night and therefore takes effect in the current tax year.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> Section 4 deals with the Covid-19 related lay-off payment. This payment is intended to plug the gap for employees who lost the opportunity to accrue reckonable service due to lay-offs caused by the Covid-19 public health restrictions. Statutory redundancy payments are exempt from income tax, and therefore these Covid-19 related lay-off payments will also be exempt from income tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> Section 7 extends the benefit-in-kind exemption to cargo bicycles and e-cargo bicycles by increasing the threshold to €3,000. This is a further fulfilment of a commitment in the Programme for Government: Our Shared Future to provide an increased proportionate allowance for e-bikes and cargo bikes. The changes will apply from 1 January 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> Deputies will recall that a number of tax exemptions are not currently reported to Revenue. Section 8 provides for the automatic reporting to Revenue in respect of three specific measures that are made without the deduction of tax. These are the remote working daily allowance of €3.20, travel and subsistence expenses and the small benefit exemption to which I referred earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> Section 9 gives effect to the budget announcement to increase the standard rate band and a number of tax credits from 1 January 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> Section 12 introduces a new €500 tax credit for renters, with each tax-paying tenant in a particular property being eligible for the credit in their own right. The credit is aimed at, and will be only available to, renters who do not receive State housing supports. The credit will also be available in certain circumstances to parents who pay rent on behalf of their student child who is in third level education.</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> Sections 16 and 17 provide for the taxation and relief rules for the pan-European personal pension product, PEPP, which has been introduced as required under Regulation (EU) 2019/1238 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> Section 20 provides for an exemption of up to €20,000 from income tax for certain profits arising from the production, maintenance and repair of certain musical instruments. These instruments are early Irish harps, Irish lever harps and uilleann pipes.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> Section 25 increases the cap on allowable pre-letting expenses from €5,000 to €10,000, and reduces the minimum period for which a property must be vacant from 12 months to 6 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_426"> Section 34 extends the final date when films can be certified as qualifying for the film corporation tax credit from 31 December 2024 to 31 December 2028. This amendment will be commenced at a future date, subject to EU state aid approval.</p>
          <p eId="para_427"> Section 37 confirms the budget changes to mineral oil tax rates to come into effect from 12 October 2022, and provides for further rate changes to come into effect from 1 March 2023. The section provides for the extension of reductions in certain mineral oil tax rates which were introduced earlier in 2022. Provision was made in the Finance (Covid-19 and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2022 for these rate reductions to be reversed from 12 October 2022. The reversal of these reductions will now be implemented from 1 March 2023.The section also provides for increases in mineral oil tax rates, as set out in Schedule 2 of Finance Act 1999, on auto fuels, effective from 12 October 2022. These rate changes arise from increases in carbon charge rates, as set out in Schedule 2A of Finance Act 1999, which came into effect on 12 October 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Section 38 provides for the budget increases in the rates of tobacco products tax of 50 cent on a pack of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category, on a VAT-inclusive basis, with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Section 44 provides for the extension of the 9% VAT rate on the supply of electricity and gas until 28 February 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">Section 47 provides for the reduction of the flat rate addition for farmers to 5%.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> Section 55 provides for the zero rating of VAT on newspapers, including e-newspapers, certain period products, non-oral hormone replacement therapy medicines, non-oral nicotine replacement therapy medicine and automated external defibrillators.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The Bill makes a number of amendments in respect of stamp duty, including clarifying aspects of the higher stamp duty rate of 10% charged where a person acquires 10 or more residential units in any 12-month period.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> As I announced in the budget, the bank levy will be extended for a further year and will only apply to those banks that will continue to operate in the Irish market, going forward. This means that the levy is expected to generate in the region of €87 million in 2023.</p>
          <p eId="para_434"> With regard to capital acquisitions tax, section 65 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to the Act of 2003 to take account of recent amendments to the Succession Act 1965 made by the Birth Information and Tracing Act 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> Section 67 provides an exemption from tax for any payments made under the Covid-19 death in service scheme for healthcare workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> In the miscellaneous provision section of the Bill, section 84 provides for a new vacant home tax, VHT, to be introduced in 2023. The measure aims to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase, rather than raise revenue. The VHT will be self-assessed and administered by the Revenue Commissioners and will apply to long-term habitable vacant residential property that is subject to local property tax, LPT. The bill will be paid by property owners. A property will be considered vacant for the purposes of the tax if it is occupied for fewer than 30 days in a 12-month period. The first chargeable period will commence on 1 November 2022 and the owners of vacant properties will be required to file a return in November 2023. Payment of the tax will be due on 1 January 2024 at a rate equal to three times the property's base LPT rate. It will be in addition to LPT.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> The Bill also provides for a number of exemptions to ensure property owners are not unfairly charged for temporary vacancy arising from genuine reasons. This will include properties recently sold or currently listed for sale or rent, properties vacant due to the occupier's illness or long-term care and properties vacant as a result of significant refurbishment work. The measure seeks to achieve an appropriate balance between incentivising owners of vacant homes to bring their properties back into use and not penalising homeowners for normal, temporary vacancy, with the primary objective of the tax being to change behaviour rather than raise revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> Section 86 provides for the defective concrete block levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> Sections 87 to 90 deal with the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, and there are the usual technical amendments and care and management sections.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> The Bill sets out the legislative provisions to bring effect to the tax measures announced in the budget. It is a cost-of-living budget that underlines, as I said, the Government's commitment to helping individuals, families and businesses to deal with the rising cost of living and the rising cost of doing business. The Bill implements a range of targeted tax changes, including specific measures to support individuals, families and business. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T16:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_441">Táim buíoch as an deis seo labhairt ar an Bhille Airgeadais, 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> There is no doubt but that our economy and society are faced with another crisis. Following on from the financial crisis, Brexit and a global pandemic, we have been thrust into an energy crisis that threatens living standards and will test the resilience of our economy and society. This is all set against a backdrop of failures in housing and healthcare that continue to test the patience of households, their security and hopes for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> Households have seen the largest income shock fuelled by inflation in a generation, resulting in the biggest fall in living standards since the financial crash. While a squeeze on living standards driven by high housing and other costs predated the war in Ukraine, Russia's illegal invasion turbocharged inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> The Department of Finance has outlined its expectation that inflation will reach 8.5% this year and 7.1% next year. In real terms, that means that somebody earning a €35,000 salary will see his or her purchasing power drop by more than €5,000 next year compared to last year. That is a significant drop in living standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> Inflation has been driven by rising energy prices with households having faced a wave of price hikes in the past year and the most recent round of price hikes effective from this month. Sinn Féin argued for a time limited price reduction and cap on household electricity bills for the winter months until February to provide certainty and relief to households. Unfortunately, the Government rejected this proposal, a measure that has been introduced in several other European countries in recent months.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> The centrepiece of this Finance Bill to address the cost-of-living crisis is an increase in the entry point to the higher rate of income tax, bringing it to €40,000. A key issue at the heart of any budget decision is whether it is fair and whether it is the best use of taxpayers' money. Sinn Féin called for an income tax package that would cut the lower rates of USC, ensuring the benefit was spread fairly and evenly across households so that high income earners did not benefit more than those on middle and low incomes, as they will do under the Government's proposal. That is the path that was pursued by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Section 9 of this Bill provides for an increase in the entry point to the higher rate of tax, which will cost more than €800 million but leave more than 2.2 million income earners out in the cold. Some 77% of income earners will not benefit from this measure. Someone with an income of €35,000 will benefit by €191 from changes to income tax and USC while someone with an income of €100,000 will benefit by €831. This, by any measure, is an unfair use of public resources because there was, and is, a fairer way which Sinn Féin has outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> I welcome a number of provisions in this Bill. The recent changes made to annex 3 of the VAT directive expanded the list of goods and services which could be reduced to zero rates of VAT from now on. I welcome a number of the provisions in Part 3 of this Bill that will zero rate a number of goods from next year, including automated external defibrillators, certain non-oral medicines and menstrual products. Section 44 extends the reduced 9% rate of VAT applied to electricity and gas from the end of October this year to the end of February next year. This is a measure that Sinn Féin has called for since last year and I welcome the extension.</p>
          <p eId="para_449"> As households are all too aware, the cost of running a car, travelling to work, visiting sick relatives or filling the tank with home heating oil has risen sharply in recent times. The price of diesel has again shot up to over €2 per litre, while the price of petrol is now over 40% higher than it was last year. Section 37 of this Bill provides for further reduced rates of excise applied to petrol and diesel until the end of February but the Government opposed Sinn Féin's amendments that would have reduced the price of petrol at the pump by a further 15 cent per litre and the price of diesel by 12 cent per litre, bringing it back below the €2 per litre mark. The Government voted against that amendment, denying households much-needed relief in their transport costs and we will again, through this Finance Bill, encourage the Government to do the right thing and reduce the cost of petrol and diesel by the maximum amount allowable under the EU rules, with the suspension of the fuel rebate alongside it.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> It is unfortunate that the Government has once again ignored the concern of the one third of households that use home heating oil and have seen its cost increase by 84% in the past year. Instead of using this opportunity to provide these households with relief by reducing the rate of excise which applies to home heating oil, the Government will instead increase the rate again from May, according to this Bill. This is part of the Government's continued drive to increase the cost for households in heating their homes and running their cars through further hikes in carbon taxes, which are regressive and hit those on lower incomes hardest, lone parents and those in rural households. In an era of high inflation, now is the wrong time to increase costs to households and the focus must turn to delivering on the alternatives and supply-side investment that households need.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> Turning attention to housing, it is clear that the Government's housing plan is failing dramatically. Housing commencements are again beginning to fall. House prices have smashed the Celtic tiger peak. They rose by more than 12% in the past year, while supply of rental accommodation has collapsed, with rents spiralling and increasing by 12% in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">The average rent right across the State now is nearly €1,500 and in Dublin it is €2,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> The human reality behind these numbers is one of insecurity, homelessness, desperation and of emigration. Renters hand more of their hard-earned pay packet over to their landlords each year under this Government. College students are sleeping in cars, on sofas, commuting long journeys or deferring their courses because they cannot find accommodation under this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> The number of people in homelessness has reached record levels under this Government, while homebuyers continue to be locked out of home ownership.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> It is now performing screeching U-turns to contain the fallout of their abject failure by adopting measures that Sinn Féin has been calling for for years and one of them is contained within this Bill. The Government’s U-turn on an eviction ban is a case in point but this measure is needed, and needed now, and should have been introduced quite some time ago. </p>
          <p eId="para_456"> Having opposed Sinn Féin’s proposal for a tax credit for struggling renters for years on the grounds that it would be a transfer of public money into the pockets of landlords, which are the words of the Minister for Finance, and where the Taoiseach said it would increase rent prices; section 2 of this Bill crafted by the Minister for Finance indeed contains a rent tax credit. I am glad that the Minister is seeing sense but, unfortunately, he is making a balls of it because instead of just doing a U-turn, he is doing what he warned about in the first place, which is putting money into the landlords’ pockets. We needed not just a renters’ tax credit but a ban on rent increases. That was the crucial point in a two-part proposal by Sinn Féin, that is, a renters’ tax credit which would have put a month’s rent back into renters’ pockets - as opposed to the €500 proposed - but ensuring also that landlords would not just jack up prices by having a ban on rent increases. </p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Perhaps in the future, just like the Government is seeing the light in the ban on evictions and a renters’ tax credit, in a couple of months’ time the Minister might come around to the sensible idea that he also has to have a ban on further rent increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> The housing crisis is first and foremost driven by the failures to deliver social and affordable housing at scale. Instead, the Government has implemented measures which increase demand, when the demand is already white hot and supply stone cold. As a result of affordability issues in the mortgage and housing market as a result of Government failure, the Central Bank has responded by loosening lending rules, which it admits will pump up further credit into the market, will increase house prices and will risk undermining the resilience of borrowers. It is doing that because of the affordability issues resulting from Government failure.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Section 5 of this Bill provides for an extension of the help-to-buy scheme in its current form for another two years. There are no amendments at all to the scheme, despite warnings from a Department-commissioned report that over half of the successful applicants already had the 10% deposit, and with the level of dead weight associated with this relief averaging 48% since its introduction. </p>
          <p eId="para_460"> Sinn Féin has called for years for the introduction of a vacant property tax to end the scourge of vacancy and dereliction in the face of an acute housing shortage. Section 48 provides for the long-overdue introduction of a vacant homes tax and while I welcome this U-turn from the Government, it took long enough for it to get here, I have concerns regarding its design and what it omits. By restricting it to properties with a local property tax liability, the Government excludes derelict properties entirely. </p>
          <p eId="para_461"> The Minister may refer to the derelict site levy but this levy is not working and everybody knows that. In many instances, it is not even being collected and is an issue to which my colleague, Deputy Gould, has brought repeated attention in this Chamber and outside of it. If the vacant homes tax is to bring properties back into use, derelict properties must be addressed. The tax proposed remains unchanged in its rate of charge, regardless of how long the property remains vacant, be it one year, two years or indeed ten years, and I believe there is scope to increase the rate, as the length of time that the property remains vacant increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Section 86 of the Bill reaffirms the Government’s plan to press ahead with a flawed and counter-productive defective concrete products levy. In the context of hard costs making up 48% overall of the cost of housing delivery, where the cost of concrete has increased by almost 40% in the past year and with the need to drive down construction costs to accelerate delivery; this levy as designed will directly increase building costs and house prices, which is something, in fairness, the Minister does not deny. This will push up prices for homebuyers, rather than putting the cost on to the profits of the industry itself and on the banks, which will also benefit from the redress scheme. It is time to drop this levy and to go back to the drawing board.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Our domestic exporters and SMEs who provide employment and opportunity across the State face energy costs that threaten their very viability. In advance of the budget, Sinn Féin proposed a suite of measures which would provide them with support, including a scheme which would cover a portion of the increase in their energy bills, with appropriate limits and safeguards in place. Sections 88 to 90, inclusive, provide a temporary business energy support scheme and I welcome the Government's introduction of this scheme to support businesses with rising energy costs. For many, however, this support will not be enough to offset the very significant increases they are seeing.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> Having gone through the experience of State supports during the pandemic, there must be a better way to provide enhanced, targeted and tailored support to those who need it most. This scheme as drafted takes no account of profitability or revenue. For instance, the same criteria and limits are applied to the local restaurant or butcher as apply to a highly profitable business with large cash reserves. We need to revisit these sections on Committee Stage to safeguard the viability of our small firms.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> I also urge the Minister to learn the lessons from the pandemic to ensure that safeguards are in place in order that highly profitable companies, for example, do not avail of taxpayers’ money by distributing dividends to shareholders. </p>
          <p eId="para_466"> As my time is up, I will give way now to my colleagues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaireadFarrell" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Deputy Mairéad Farrell<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_467">As I only have four minutes, I will only focus on one particular measure but I look forward to engagement on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> I want to focus, therefore, on the vacant homes tax. It is something which we have long been calling for and is something which, on the face of it, most people would probably welcome. We know that we have a significant stock of vacant homes, which we can see from just going through our towns, cities and rural areas. These number 166,000 according to the recent census. We know this adds to scarcity but also creates an artificial scarcity of supply, which helps to drive high prices and rents. </p>
          <p eId="para_469"> We also know that tax schemes for vacant homes has worked well in other countries. It has brought stock back into use while generating revenue to re-invest in vacancy and dereliction. On the face of it then, this measure should be welcome but unfortunately, here the devil is again in the detail. The Government's stated intention is to incentivise those with idle property to bring it into use. But if that is the intention, then why design it in such a way as to make it so avoidable?</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Two legal experts have described this tax as “significantly compromised, to the point it could be considered virtue-signalling.” If we have a quick look at it, we can see that the tax is done on a self-assessed basis and that it would not apply to residential properties occupied for more than 30 days in a 12-month period. </p>
          <p eId="para_471"> But whether this is 30 consecutive days or not is not clear. Would it not be easy for the owner of this property to just say it is a holiday home, that they come and go for more than 30 days of the year, and then, hey presto, the owner is not liable for this tax? By remaining silent, would this still permit a situation where short-term letting could occur and then with the right planning, would the property still not fall liable for this tax? Again, that is not clear.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> Nor is it clear how Revenue will be checking tax compliance. Will it use the GeoDirectory data, the latest census or some other method? If we were serious, the first thing I would have expected to see was some big anti-avoidance clause jumping out at me from this particular measure, that is, some big deterrent that said to those thinking of deliberately dodging their tax obligations that there would be serious consequences</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> There is also the fact that the charge itself is too low and does not increase with each subsequent year. The levy will be approximately 0.3% of the value of the property and does not automatically increase every subsequent year. In France, for example, the rate is 12.5%, which then doubles the following year. When the French introduced their tax in 1998, vacancy fell by 13% over the next four years leading to a significant increase in supply. We should contrast that with what we see here. Accountancy firm Deloitte recently noted that the impact of the Minister's tax measure on increasing supply would at best be "modest” and from looking at this, I can easily see why. We can see from the Revenue forecasts how much tax it expects to generate from this and it is estimating that around €3 million to €4 million will be brought in over the year. If one considers that an average-priced house would pay around €945 per annum, then at the lowest bands of the Revenue's estimate of €3 million raised, this would equate to around 3,200 liable homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">That is simply not good enough. If this tax was a boat, it would have so many holes in it that it would not be able to sail from Malin Head to Mizen Head. I will seek to thrash that out on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LouiseOReilly" eId="spk_254">
          <from>Deputy Louise O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_475">I thank the Cathaoirleach Gníomhach for the opportunity to say a few words. I only have a few minutes so I will focus on supports for businesses in the face of the energy and cost-of-doing-business crisis. The difficulties Irish businesses are currently facing are felt most acutely by SMEs and family businesses, those that were that were hardest hit during the Covid pandemic. In the main, these are businesses that have really been through the mill over recent years. Their costs have risen across the board. This is for a variety of reasons but is mainly due to increasing energy costs and the impact these have had on inflation. Businesses have tried to remain agile. If the Minister speaks with business owners, he will know, as I do, that many of them are doing their very best. They are trying to adapt to the changes, in some instances by absorbing the increased costs to try to remain competitive. Naturally, this has an impact on SMEs and family businesses whose margins are often very tight. However, in the long run, this may prove to be unsustainable for many.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> The temporary business energy support scheme announced on budget day and legislated for here is welcome. Businesses eagerly await its introduction. The legislation indicates that the scheme will go further than was announced on budget day and will include tax-compliant businesses that carry on a trade or profession chargeable under case I or case II of Schedule D, including self-employed individuals, companies and partnerships. The explanatory memorandum says that "Charities and sporting bodies who carry on certain activities which would be chargeable to tax under Case I or II of Schedule D but for an available exemption are also included in the scheme." On this point, will approved housing bodies be eligible to apply for supports? Clarification from the Minister would be very much appreciated. Will energy supports for senior citizens' organisations or other such charities come through the Minister's Department or will they be delivered through another mechanism or Department? </p>
          <p eId="para_477"> Has the Minister engaged directly with small businesses that are concerned the new scheme will not be enough to help them with their energy costs? Did the Government give any consideration to a targeted scheme to support the maintenance of the employment relationship between worker and employer as a means of supporting affected businesses or is it the case that this move would be beyond the scope of the flexibility that currently exists under EU state aid rules? I ask because many businesses and stakeholders have indicated that in addition to energy costs, costs that have increased due to inflation, including the cost of transport, fuel, stock and insurance, are also causing difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> I thank the Acting Chair for allowing me time to speak on this. If the Minister cannot answer my question, I hope he will be in a position to provide me with a written response. Like me and many others, I believe the Minister was angered to see those companies that came through the Covid pandemic while in receipt of substantial supports to keep them afloat during that crisis subsequently paying out dividends to their shareholders and reporting significant profits. This underlines the need for serious targeted measures to be introduced. Everybody is being impacted to some degree by the cost-of-living and cost-of-doing-business crisis. No household is insulated from it. However, some people will experience it to a different degree than others. There are some businesses that, while viable, are now vulnerable and concerned about having to compete for supports with businesses that are well able to absorb some of those costs. I ask that the Minister give consideration to the amendments that will be put forward on Committee Stage to include more targeted measures.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GeraldNash" eId="spk_255">
          <from>Deputy Ged Nash<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_479">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill. This legislation gives effect to many of the substantial proposals announced in budget 2023 in late September. This summer saw the longest run-in to a budget in many years at a time of great uncertainty and anxiety. In many ways, budget 2023 flattered to deceive. It is worth remembering that, even with the expenditure of an additional €11 billion between this month and 31 December 2023, this Government will have managed to widen the gap between the rich and the poor by €199. That is not my analysis but the analysis of Social Justice Ireland. We are dealing exclusively with the Finance Bill today but, for completeness, we must look at all of the budget measures in the round.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> This is the time of the year when we get to see the political colour of a government's money. It is true that, with €4.1 billion to be spent between now and the end of the year in addition to the resources already committed, many of those who rely upon the State will receive significant once-off cash support to help them through to the end of the year. A lump sum and double payments are a good way of using our social protection system to target money where it is needed most. However, when these once-off measures are gone, they are gone. In early January, when the sugar rush wears off, budget 2023 proper will reveal itself to be what I and independent commentators know it to be, a conservative budget. As the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has said "Compared to indexing tax and welfare policies in line with inflation since 2020, Budget 2023 leaves households worse off on average." Increases to tax credits and welfare payments that are below forecasted inflation will see many lower-income households experience real-term cuts to their living standards unless there is a repeat of the lump sum, double week and energy credit payments, poorly targeted as they are, in the middle of next year. </p>
          <p eId="para_481"> These are the facts. In other words, if you are poor today, you are going to be poor this time next year. Budget 2023 is merely designed to get people through the next few months and we will see where we are then. There is no vision as to how to make the structural changes to our economic and welfare model that we need to take as many as possible of the 600,000 people experiencing poverty in this country out of that serious situation. Nobody is claiming that that any budget or government can completely insulate all of our citizens from the worst effects of the cost-of-living crisis but we can do better than budget 2023 has managed. </p>
          <p eId="para_482"> We are living through an unprecedented time and the only thing of which we are certain is uncertainty. Our best guess is that our economy will continue to grow next year, albeit at a slower rate. Inflation is likely to be at approximately 8% next year. Tax revenues will continue to roll in at high rates, although we cannot and should not take anything for granted. Wages will rise but for lower and middle-income earners in the everyday economy, those wage rises will not come anywhere close to matching the rising costs of energy, rents, mortgage interest rates, transport and food. Against this backdrop, it is frankly inexcusable that core weekly social welfare rates will not go up by the €20 they need to if they are to beat or at least match inflation. The purchasing power of those who are most in need will fall off a cliff. It is absolutely inevitable that we will be back here in February or, more likely, March to debate new spending measures to address these issues. Mark my words; that is going to happen. </p>
          <p eId="para_483"> When I speak of those most in need, I do not only mean those on social welfare but also those who get up early in the morning and work hard all week. The Finance Bill gives effect to the personal tax changes announced in the budget. Some 67% of the €1.26 billion allocated for personal taxation measures will benefit higher earners only. In order for the proposed tax changes to even have the appearance of being more fair, a decision could have been taken, for example, to taper off credits for those earning in excess of €100,000, clawing back some of the benefit for higher earners. What is the practical effect of these tax changes? Someone with an income of €100,000 will gain approximately €900 a year. However, people earning between €25,000 and €35,000 will gain less than €200. By no definition is that fair. To put this in clear terms, the budget and, by extension, this Bill provide the least for the very large cohort of workers earning between €15 and €20 per hour. That is a fact and it is very hard to reconcile with the rhetoric we often hear from the Tánaiste and others about supporting the squeezed middle. These workers are the very definition of the squeezed middle. I note the changes made with regard to the application of the 2% rate of USC for those on the national minimum wage, which are a good thing, but we should note that PRSI thresholds remain unchanged. This has the effect of slightly increasing the PRSI burden on a full-time minimum wage worker as the reduced rate threshold for those earning less than €424 is not changing. The Labour Party's own analysis shows that, in a worst-case scenario, many minimum wage workers could immediately lose 30% of their increase while those on a full-time wage of €19,000 per annum may lose 35%.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">This is simply scandalous. It is unconscionable that the Government, which put so much stock in raising the tax bands for higher earners in budget 2023, could simply disregard this cohort of workers. I ask that the Minister and the Minister for Social Protection take a closer look at that issue in the context of this Bill and the Social Welfare Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> On the matter of personal taxation, I again ask the Minister to re-examine the question of tax liabilities for PAYE workers who enjoyed the benefit of the pandemic unemployment payment and the temporary wage subsidy scheme, TWSS. The demands are coming through the door. This could not come at a worse time for working people. It is jarring that the Finance Bill proposes to extend the special assignee relief programme for high rollers moving to Ireland to work with foreign direct investment firms, but someone whose industry was out of action during the first wave of the pandemic or whose employer had to claim the TWSS is left with a tax bill. These earners are likely to be on lower incomes and they are the most exposed to the cost-of-living crisis. I ask the Minister to look again at writing this liability off and absorbing that, especially given the current climate. Approximately 300,000 workers have yet to file tax returns. This amounts to a total of €219 million. Some TWSS beneficiaries are on the hook for up to €2,500. This bill would more than wipe out any benefits they might get from this year's budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> We very much welcome the expansion of the special benefits exemption scheme. It is positive that, as a result of a resolution in the Dáil on budget night, workers can benefit from that expansion this year. That is covered in section 6.</p>
          <p eId="para_487"> The next section relates to the benefit-in-kind arrangements for cargo bikes. That is a welcome measure. When considering the question of benefit-in-kind, I ask the Minister to reflect on the timing of imminent changes to the application of benefit-in-kind to company cars. I have received a lot of contact on this matter, as have many Deputies over the last few weeks. If that change proceeds as planned, it will have a very serious impact on the incomes of those who have company cars for their work.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> The energy crisis dominates everything these days. It is more than evident that businesses require assistance with their energy costs in order to keep operating and to maintain employment. Section 88 of the Bill provides for the introduction of the TBESS. The State will spend up to €1.2 billion between now and the end of February on the scheme, and it will inevitably have to be extended. In some ways, its poorly targeted nature reminds me of the way in which the domestic energy credit was designed. The local Centra that needs the support will get it but the Facebook data centre is also eligible. That may not happen. It may not be applied for. It would be quite perverse if it was. However I, note that all case I and case II businesses will qualify for the TBESS. If it is legally tricky to exclude energy-hungry data centres from the scheme, for example, then the Government should impose an extra levy of €10 per megawatt hour on their unit cost for electricity. This would more than claw back any benefit gained by any errant data centre that did apply for the scheme. The very idea that they are capable of applying and will be permitted to apply for the scheme does not sit well with people. This is a sector where electricity demand has tripled since 2015. Figures provided to me by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications show that the levy of €10 per megawatt hour could see us claw back €40 million in revenue, which could be used to help domestic businesses and users across the economy and society who need additional support.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> While we understand the need for short-term cash injections to help businesses with their energy costs, I have two fears about the operation of the scheme. The TBESS does nothing to help control the overall cost of energy. That is why the Government should push at EU level to cap the price of wholesale gas used to produce electricity. It should use the example provided by Spain, Portugal and elsewhere that appears to be working quite well. The second concern is this. One Louth retailer told me last week that even with the TBESS he is still having to pay €90,000 more this year in energy costs. Jobs will be lost. That €90,000 is the equivalent of three to four full-time jobs in the retail sector. That is why we need also need an energy wage subsidy scheme to keep people in work as the energy crisis hits. It is inevitable that jobs will be lost in the teeth of this crisis. I repeat my consistent appeal for the creation of a new German-style short-time working scheme to address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> As we all know, housing is the single biggest social, and arguably economic, issue facing our country. Housing for All is a failing policy and no amount of spin will change this. It will not meet its targets this year on social housing, affordable housing or even in the development of private housing. There are a combination of housing-related measures in the Bill, all of them well-intentioned on an individual basis. However, they are piecemeal given the extent of the supply problem and the fact that the housing budget announced on budget day will go up by only 1% next year from a capital point of view. Construction inflation has gone up 14% in the past year. This is a real-terms cut in the capacity of the system to build more social and affordable homes. As a result of the very modest measures on the capital side in this budget, fewer public and affordable homes will be built than even under the Minister's inadequate plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> The vacant homes tax has all the hallmarks of a token tax. In the end it will only apply to a small minority of vacant homes, maybe about 4,000, and the rate at which it is set means it will be relatively easily absorbed. On that basis, it simply will not disincentivise vacancy. A tax of €300 or so a year will not put too many people who have vacant homes off, especially as prices continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate. Let us be honest about that. The most efficient and sustainable way of providing decent housing quickly, addressing the scourge of dereliction and reviving town centres is to bring vacant homes and derelict sites back into use. As a start, the Labour Party proposed in our costed alternative budget a new vacant homes tax, initially set at €500 per unit. That would be open to reconsideration every six months based on how the market responds. This rate and the operation of the system should be kept under frequent review as regards its performance in bringing homes back into use.</p>
          <p eId="para_492"> The resources generated by the kind of tax the Labour Party is proposing and a new vacant sites levy, coupled with better enforcement of existing derelict sites powers, could then be ring-fenced to allow local authorities to do the job they need to do in maximising their capacity to inspect vacant homes, register vacant sites, compulsorily purchase and transform those properties into habitable homes. Louth County Council did very good job a couple of years ago in bringing many vacant homes into use by using existing powers under its compulsory purchase order capacity, as provided for in law. That can be done but it is not done to a sufficient degree across the country. This is the low-hanging fruit. We should be bringing these homes back into use to ensure people who need homes are housed in an efficient and sustainable way. Sadly, there is no such ambition, or that level of ambition, from the Government to get the simple things on vacancy and dereliction right. All we need to know about that lack of ambition is reflected in this tokenistic vacant homes levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> Section 6 extends the help to buy relief for a further two years. This is a temporary relief that is starting to look a lot more permanent. We are well aware of the assessments made by independent commentators and analysts, and even by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, on the effect of the relief on the market. We are also aware of the view of the ESRI and others that the help to buy scheme has had an inflationary effect on the price of housing. This is not the smartest public policy tool ever invented by any Government but clearly the Government is intent on sticking with it. It is undoubtedly a popular incentive and it is being used. All of the evidence shows that. The Minister is sticking with this proposition and that is reflected in the Bill. It will again be extended. As a critic of the scheme, I will be so bold as to make a suggestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Would the Minister consider extending eligibility, with conditions, for access to the scheme for those who may be divorced or who are legally separated? This matter is been raised with me on a number of occasions in recent weeks. In cases of a relationship legally ending, court orders will in many instances have required the sale of a family home. I am sure that conditions could be attached, or the level of aid permitted under the relief scheme could be adapted, to take any financial settlement into account. I have no doubt that the scheme could be altered to take account of this very human reality for many thousands of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> As the Minister is aware, the new mortgage rules announced last week by the Central Bank have acknowledged this situation. Those who are divorced or legally separated will, from 1 January, now be considered first-time buyers. This is the right thing to do. Perhaps other policies and initiatives could take inspiration from this socially just move that was made by the Central Bank last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> There are a couple of other issues I would like to cover. The Minister has reviewed his position on the concrete levy. This is a good thing. We are aware that any levy to be introduced in respect of poured concrete will inevitably be added to the price of homes. The Labour Party has argued - and costed in our alternative budget - that we should be examining instead the idea of a 2% tax on the profits of the construction sector. This would minimise the risk of any levy being passed on to first-time buyers. As we understand it, a measure like this has been deployed in the UK. For those construction industry operators who resisted it, restrictions were placed on their ability to trade and obtain planning permission. We need to look at something similar.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> Inevitably, there is going to have to be a contribution by the construction sector to deal with the mica redress scheme and the construction defects in people's apartments. We are aware that up to 100,000 apartments are affected. As part of its alternative budget, the Labour Party would have provided €500 million to get a start on the mica redress scheme and on assisting those people who are living in defective apartments to address their needs and begin the resolution works that need to be undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> It is good that the Minister has decided to abolish VAT on newspapers. This is a critical measure to protect the media and the critical role they play in our democracy. The abolition of VAT will help. Unfortunately, however, for many newspaper groups across the country, it may be too little too late. As we speak, local newspaper groups are making staff redundant. This is the case with the predominant newspaper group in my constituency, namely, that which publishes the <i>Drogheda Independent</i>. There are also issues for local radio broadcasters. It is not a matter for the Finance Bill but is strictly a matter for the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin. I hope this is something the Minister will consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> I will make a narrow, parochial appeal. The living city initiative has been in place for several years. It is working reasonably well. It covers the main cities, and it covers Kilkenny also. It continues to exclude larger towns in the country such as Drogheda and Dundalk. Drogheda is an especially historic town with an architectural heritage that needs to be protected. If we are to deal with dereliction and vacancy, the living cities initiative should be extended to towns that are larger than Kilkenny and equally as historic. I hope this is something the Minister will consider in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> I look forward to working with the Minister on Committee and Report Stages to enhance and amend the Bill.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pádraig O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_501">I thank the Minister for coming to the House today. I was listening to this debate upstairs before I came down to the Chamber. Over the past few weeks, post budget, there has been a lot of commentary in respect of the decisions that were taken in advance of this Bill. I ask Members to think back 12 or even 24 months and consider the position we were in and the uncertainty presented by Covid. Pre pandemic, we were concerned at what might be happen post Covid. It exemplifies the position of the Government and the decisions that have been taken over the past few years and how difficult they were for taxpayers, for businesses, for employees and for the country. In these debates, we sometimes lose sight of that. To be fair to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and to the Minister for Finance, the budget presented a number of weeks ago surpassed many people's expectations, if we take into account the past 24 months of Covid and the pandemic.</p>
          <p eId="para_502"> I will just raise a couple of issues that are close to my heart. The VAT exemption on defibrillators, which will come into effect from 1 January 2023, is an issue on which I campaigned for a long time, even before I came to Dáil Éireann. I lost count of the number of motions I put down at various county council meetings over the years on this matter. I welcome this development. I am aware that a number of community and sporting groups across the State will welcome this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> I must also mention the temporary business energy support scheme. I have listened to the debates on this, and for certain people this scheme will not go far enough. I have listened to those people suggest that it is not going to go far enough, but then they paused and did not progress on to what they would do. While the temporary business energy support scheme might not be enough, and particularly for larger businesses or for larger consumers of energy, I still believe it is an initiative to be welcomed. Once it is up and running it will give some kind of certainty to businesses and give them some clarity as to what they can expect in Government support.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> The third issue I wish to mention is the benefit-in-kind. The Minister will be aware that I have been beating the drum about this for a number of weeks now. I am like a broken record. For me, this benefit-in-kind initiative, albeit legislated in the Finance Act 2019, comes down to an issue of timing. When people are facing increasing costs as regards energy and travelling to and from work, I am not sure that early 2023 is the time to be putting it in place. I hope this will be reviewed again in the new year. I will make that call again.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> I must also mention the defective concrete products levy. Again, this is an initiative that I had spoken out against over the past number of weeks. I welcome the compromises that have been reached, and I welcome that the levy will be reduced from 10% to 5%. I also welcome the various exemptions that are being considered. Ultimately, however, this is again about timing. We are facing a budgetary surplus this year. I ask the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to question the timing of this measure. A recent meeting of backbenchers of my party agreed that we understand and agree with the principle behind it. We are not arguing against that, but again it comes down to the crucial aspect of timing.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_506">I congratulate the Minister on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill. The recent budget is very important when we look at the context, as my colleague has said. Twelve months ago, we never imagined that we would be in a position of this kind, whereby not only would we not have a deficit but that we would have a surplus leading into next year. This has given great scope to be able to respond to the challenges that exist. Times are really tough and people need more money in their pockets. The budget will enable us to provide them with that through reductions in tax, increasing the national minimum wage and, where we can, increasing public sector wages. This will give people more money when they need it in order to be able to deal with the increases in their energy bills that are a consequence of the war in Ukraine. It is a significant intervention.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> I have heard calls for more to be done. Of course, everybody wants more to be done because we are politicians representing our constituents and this is what we do. If we look at the UK and the installation of yet another new Cabinet, we have learned and seen very clearly the consequences of a different budgetary approach. I refer to a reckless budgetary approach that has no regard for sustainability and that cannot be relied upon by the citizens of that country. Those mistakes have to be fixed very quickly. Although I am sure they will be fixed quickly, they come with huge reputational cost to a country that had built up such a strong reputation over time, notwithstanding our disagreement with it about Brexit. The UK had a strong reputation over time for being a stable political entity and a stable political institution. There is a valid salutary lesson for us in managing our budgetary processes as we have done and in being able to provide for people when they need it, as happened during Covid and as I hope will happen, insofar as is possible, in the context of the rising costs of energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> I commend the significant tax policy changes. They constitute an important step to give people more of their own money back at this time in an inflationary cycle. It is an important measure to set a tone that we want to do that. We have not been able to do that for many years. It is important that people have discretion about how to spend their money and, particularly at this time, it was important to take a step towards giving more people control over their spending and more tax back. I would like to see that continued into next year, where possible, because people need discretion over their money, particularly middle income workers, who have been hardest hit in many respects. I congratulate the Minister on the Finance Bill.</p>

        <speech by="#PaDaly" eId="spk_258">
          <from>Deputy Pa Daly<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_509">The test of any budget is whether the lives of the people of the State will be improved as a result. In the context of tax measures, there was a need for a reduction in USC but that was not delivered. We see zero-rating of certain VAT products. That is welcome. Hopefully, the savings will be passed on, most crucially, to workers and to the guests staying there.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> In terms of transport, the measures are unfair on those under financial pressure. A further tax increase will affect Kerry residents who have to drive to work or use solid fuel for heating and does little for those least able to pay. Now is not the time to increase costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> In housing and facilities, we see an increase of 7% in the amount allocated to water services and capital spend is up from €876 million to €932 million. The Right2Water movement was clear on the need to pay for water services from general taxation, something the Government was eventually forced to accept. However, the Government is being dragged kicking and screaming towards Sinn Féin housing policy in circumstances where rents, house prices and homelessness are increasing. The eviction ban is welcome but belated. There is a type of rent tax credit, but we needed a rent increase ban. We also need more social housing to combat the years of austerity.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Some of the programmes behind the overall spending allocation are incredibly important to Kerry's future. One of those is the rural water programme. According to the budget, this additional funding is being made available to support a new programme for water services for villages not on the public network. This is a massive issue in Kerry because many parishes do not enjoy proper wastewater services, access to a public water network or properly treated drinking water. Places like Glenbeigh, Castlegregory, Annascaul and Abbeydorney will not see any new developments of housing - affordable, social or otherwise. An extra €5 million is simply not enough under the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> In addition, there are bodies of water in Kerry suffering from discharges. A recent Environmental Protection Agency report stated that a number of waterways in Kerry face a severe biodiversity challenge, with one third above moderate levels of pollution. This is not good enough and I have called for Irish Water to carry out assessments in Cromane, the Maherees, Tralee Bay, Valentia and the Kenmare River. I welcome the €3 million provided to meet requirements under EU water quality directives but it is not enough. Major capital investment is needed to solve the issue, especially in water treatment plants. I call on the Government to ensure this is completed in Kerry as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I had a conversation with a butcher from Kerry today who said he paid 11 cent per unit of electricity in 2019, 19 cent in 2020 and is currently paying 40 cent per unit. He is paying €4,000 per month and has a skeleton crew working six days per week. Every customer is affected, as are the 30 butchers in his craft butchers' section. What he wants, has asked for and needs is a cap on energy prices. He does not want the type of smart answers we got from the Taoiseach today during Leaders' Questions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_259">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_515">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill. It is always good to have time and space between the announcement of the budget and the consideration of the Finance Bill because it gives an opportunity to clear away some of the fog and spin and to understand exactly the impact of the budget provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> One of the most disappointing aspects of budget 2023 is its permanent distributional effects. I have heard more than a few Government Deputies and a couple of Ministers say this is a progressive budget rather than a regressive one. I do not accept that, though there may be enough one-off payments to create the impression that the most vulnerable are being taken care of. There is €500 here and €200 there for certain groups. That is welcome and all very well but one thing is for sure: the permanent effects of budget 2023 will not be progressive. How can they be? An increase of €12 per week for those on social welfare, including pensioners, is about €624 per year for some of the most vulnerable in our society. They are the people who, as the CSO has pointed out, are being worst hit by the cost of living crisis. Contrast that with the benefit of €830 per year for someone earning €100,000 once all the income tax and USC changes are taken into account. How is that progressive? How is it progressive to give energy credits to everyone regardless of housing income or to give an effective double payment of energy credits to anyone sufficiently well-off to own a holiday home?</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> This budget could have done so much more to target its benefits. There is €500 for recipients of disability loans but no permanent cost of disability payments, something for which people with disabilities have been calling for years. There is a €400 payment for fuel allowance recipients but no permanent increase to the payment, leaving them with great uncertainty for the year ahead. There is €500 for recipients of the working family payment, which is all very well, but there is no extension of the fuel allowance to that group.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> These supports are all very well but will not help people in the medium to long term or provide certainty for those who need long-term supports the most. They will not provide sustainable relief to those who can no longer afford the soaring prices for necessities like food, fuel, energy and rent. There are a number of one-off payments for many of those reliant on social welfare but the only people with any certainty for the future are those in the upper income brackets, who can be sure their tax cuts will be there in future years. Apparently, the Government plans to give them even more.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> One of the things I found most notable about budget 2023 is the extent to which the Government's income tax cuts went so far beyond what had been flagged in the lead-up. The increase in the standard rate cut-off point is so out of proportion to what current circumstances justify that it can only be explained by ideology. Eight hundred million euro in 2023 on a tax cut that will be of no benefit to anyone earning less than €37,000 per year. This cut will cost more than €1 billion in a full year: this is a change that will only benefit approximately 20% of workers. How can that be fair?</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> I accept that some indexation of tax bands is warranted to keep the portion of income taxed at the higher rate roughly consistent, but there is little justification for the kind of indexation seen in the previous two budgets. That does not stop Government Deputies trying. In his budget speech, I heard the Minister again pushing the misleading idea that inflation leads to people paying more income tax. It does no such thing. People pay additional tax when they get salary increases. Wage growth has been far lower than general inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">How the Government can justify indexation of nearly 9% this year and of more than 13% over the last two budgets when the latest available numbers from the CSO suggest average weekly wages are only increasing at less than 2.5% a year is really beyond me. The Social Democrats proposed a third rate of tax of 43% on incomes above €100,000 but there is no interest from this Government in making any effort to claw back any of that gain from those at the very top. I cannot understand how any Government Deputy can justify a situation, particularly in the present circumstances when so many people are in crisis situations, that there is that level of tax break for the best earning people in this country, that is people earning €100,000. How can there be any justification for giving them a tax break and no effort whatever to create a sense of fairness and to achieve fairness by introducing any kind of clawback?</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> On energy supports, a failure to target supports is a recurring theme with this Government. Budget 2023's energy supports for households are a further example of this. More than €1 billion in supports has been pledged but households with large incomes will get just as much support as those with small, inadequate incomes. The excuse that it is too complicated to target low and middle income earners just does not wash. What has the Government been doing in almost one year since this kind of energy credit scheme was first proposed? Maybe it could have been excused to have a universal approach at the outset because the priority was to get money to people quickly. But to repeat the same exercise after so much time has passed where a more targeted approach could have been worked out is simply not good enough. If you are earning the minimum wage, you get €600. If you are earning €100,000 you get €600. If you happen to own two homes you get €1,200. The Social Democrats alternative budget proposed a system based on the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme, TWSS, used during Covid which would have allowed targeted payments to be processed in an efficient manner. It is very disappointing that the Government did not seem to pay any attention to taking this kind of fairer approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Another issue around energy is the failure to realise the potential of solar energy. The Government is way behind the curve on this. The grants are much too small and the impact of VAT on solar panels needs to be examined. I will request that a report is commissioned on this and I will move an amendment to that effect on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> On business supports, at least it has been figured out how to target resources at the small and medium sized companies that need support to pay their energy bills. The proposed scheme mirrors proposals that my party made in its alternative budget which provided €1 billion for an energy crisis support scheme for business. It is important to remember that unlike the Covid crisis when wages needed to be supported the current crisis necessitates viable but vulnerable businesses being supported in paying their energy bills. The Government must learn the lessons of the mistakes it made in its Covid response to business. It must ensure that companies that avail of this support do not pay dividends to shareholders, do not make staff redundant and if it transpires that they did not need state support to remain profitable, there should be a clawback option. The purpose of this support is job protection. We want to ensure that businesses remain viable and trading. We do not want to inflate profit margins or waste money by handing it to businesses that are clearly unviable.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> Turning to housing, as I said some weeks ago immediately after the Ministers’ budget speeches, it is deeply concerning that the Government thinks that its tax on vacant homes is anything close to sufficient. It is, in fact, pathetically low. Three times the level of the local property tax may sound like a serious move until you realise that it amounts to 0.3% of the value of the property. How is that supposed to act as a disincentive to vacancy or dereliction when property prices are rising at multiples of that rate? It reads to me as an astounding statement of indifference to the problem of vacancy and a determination to maintain the status quo. The Social Democrats proposed a 10% tax on vacant homes with exemptions, of course, to be fair to people who have legitimate reasons to have their home empty, such as care or health reasons. We will submit an amendment to this effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> If the Government is serious about tackling the issue of vacancy it must do much better than this. It needs a penal tax on vacant homes in order to unlock the huge potential that is there, particularly in the context of the housing crisis that we have at the moment. Consider all the commentary on vacancy and dereliction impacting the centre of Dublin and the Dublin Central constituency, the O'Connell Street general area and stretching into the north inner city. The same points apply to the centre of Cork. I had the opportunity to travel around the centre of Cork and see the extent of vacant homes. It is actually immoral at this stage to allow a situation like that in the context of a housing crisis where people are sitting on properties waiting for them to disintegrate and waiting for an opportunity to knock them and replace them with whatever commercial development. It should not be allowed. We need a penal tax that would stop that continuing.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> While Fianna Fáil holds the housing brief, recent news that Fine Gael TDs are holding meetings to brainstorm on the housing disaster is surely further evidence of the desperation within the Government and the lack of confidence that even Government TDs have in the Housing for All policy which is dismally failing to meet even its own very anaemic targets. The rhetoric suggests that the Government is taking it seriously; the output does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> It would be unfair not to acknowledge that there are a number of welcome moves in budget 2023 which will help to reduce the cost of living for those who are struggling. The reductions in childcare fees, the free provision of schoolbooks for primary school pupils and the abolition of inpatient charges in public hospitals our chief among those measures that have to be warmly welcomed, but the overall trend of investment in public services is worrying. As the Social Democrats constantly points out, if you really want to reduce the cost of living and give working people and families, particularly those with young children a break, it makes more sense to use the majority of available resources to invest in better quality public services and social infrastructure. This also requires that investment in public services at the very least keeps up with inflation. However, the Parliamentary Budget Office and the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council have calculated that about an extra €7 billion per year is needed to meet inflationary costs and to allow public services just to stand still. As far as I can see, this budget allocates less than half of that figure. This has huge implications for public services in 2023 and beyond and the impacts will be felt in the further erosion in the availability of vital supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> It says a lot about this Government's priorities when you consider three key points. First, that the Government was so determined that income tax be indexed in line with inflation, despite there being absolutely no justification for that. Second, that those dependent on social welfare must accept increases well below the level of inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">Third, public services will be very negatively impacted because their funding increase is well below inflation also. In fact, as I said a month ago, it seems the overall theme of this budget is erosion of the tax base, with a consequent reduction in the money available for public services over the medium to long term. This just cannot continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> The Government must chart a course towards the sustainable funding of our public services. We know this country needs more revenue to improve service delivery, look after an ageing population and meet its environmental targets. That is why the Government set up the Commission on Taxation and Welfare. However, having outsourced the job of finding the revenue, we all acknowledge we need to have an independent commission made up of experts from all fields of society. The immediate response from some Ministers to findings that do not fit their ideology has been to politicise and dismiss this work before giving it any proper consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> The reason the commission was necessary in the first place was that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, in government, have for so long refused to accept the need for revenue to increase as a proportion of national income. Those same parties like to poke fun at the supposedly unsound policies of the left, but independent expert groups, from the Commission on Taxation and Welfare to the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, have consistently pointed out how these parties are asleep at the wheel when it comes to accepting fiscal realities and future-proofing our finances. Budget 2023 continues this trend. There is no concrete plan to reduce increasing overreliance on corporation tax receipts. There have been no updated costings for Sláintecare in the past five years, despite the inflation in that period. There are no proper costings of planned climate measures and no real ambition in this area. With windfalls being used to fund current spending, this Government has no overall financial plan and, it has to be said, not much credibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> I have a point on the minimum wage. The Technical Group recommended that the living wage be increased to €13.85 to achieve a socially acceptable standard of living. The poor increase in the budget is widening the gap between what the minimum wage is now and what the living wage needs to be. Again, that is a very regressive move. It is widening the gap between the better-off and those on low pay and dependent on the living wage or minimum wage. The Government is not setting out a clear path to introducing a realistic living wage.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> This point also applies to the difficulty we have in recruiting key staff, particularly in home care. The strong recommendation in the report of the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, on this matter is that, at a minimum, the living wage be the standard one. If we are serious about ensuring we have enough home care staff to meet the substantial care needs, we need to include the living wage in the tendering process for home care services.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The budget sounded very good in that it seemed to entail Government largesse. However, when we examine its detail, we see those most in need got least whereas those who are most comfortable and earning the most got long-term, secure increases in their incomes. That is simply not progressive and it certainly is not fair.</p>

          <from>Deputy Neale Richmond<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_536">I thank the House for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. I look forward to contributing at more length when the Bill is before the finance committee next month. I welcome the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_537"> When we had statements on the budget, I said it was progressive and welcome. There are many areas in the Bill that will genuinely be of benefit to so many around the country as they face extremely worrying challenges due to the difficult global circumstances, be they associated with Putin’s war in Ukraine, rising energy costs or the many other factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> There are one or two aspects of the Bill I would like to highlight and on which I ask the Minister to reflect. We might see a little more clarity in the latter Stages before the Bill is finally enacted. The first issue, which has been raised with me quite a number of times by constituents in recent weeks, concerns benefit-in-kind tax on company cars. There may be a discrepancy in this regard. We need to differentiate between those who receive a company car as a gift or bonus, or as recognition in lieu of further payment, and those who receive one because it is an integral part of their job. The latter do not necessarily drive commercial vehicles, vans or jeeps but are on the road. My late father was a rep on the road for 35 years. His car was not a luxury car; it was his office. It was where the old-fashioned car phone was, and the samples were in the boot. It contained the files, contact directory and old-fashioned Filofax that were brought around when meeting customers and clients across all 32 counties of this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> Regarding those who receive a car as a gift from their employer, there needs to be differentiation. The increase in the tax such people pay on their vehicles is making a huge difference to their bottom line. It is completely undermining any benefits from the budget. A rep I spoke to, who lives in Ballinteer in my constituency, said that to compensate for the tax increase, his salary would need to go up by 15%. That is the difference it makes. Those who travel longer distances, whose area may be all of Leinster, or Dublin and south Leinster, are suffering a lot more than those who may cover only the Dublin metropolitan region or some such region. Their cars are as essential to their jobs as their laptops or desks. Is there some way in the application of the new benefit-in-kind tax that was announced to distinguish between company cars given as perks and cars used for work?</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> There is another small issue I would like to raise. I do not have a direct ask but want to raise this in the brief amount of speaking time I have because it merits serious consideration. It relates to the proposed changes regarding a benefits tax, including the working from home daily allowance and the payment of travel expenses. Small businesses across the country have raised serious concerns regarding why they were not consulted on these changes. I urge the Minister to see what can be done to engage directly with small businesses and their representative bodies before this Bill is enacted. We all know about the need to support small businesses. In parallel with meeting this need through the Finance Bill, we need to meet it by opening up the training opportunities of our SMEs.</p>

          <from>Deputy Steven Matthews<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_541">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill, which underpins many of the budget announcements made last month. It is a progressive budget, despite what some commentators would say. It is wide-ranging and well thought out, and it provides immediate support to many people throughout the country when they need it most. It also offers core support for the future. It exemplifies the Government’s approach to how we dealt with the Covid crisis over two years. We support businesses and people in a crisis. We are in a cost-of-living crisis at the moment, and this budget deals with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> We have a steady and stable Government comprising the only three parties that were willing to form a Government at a most difficult time, during a pandemic, when others ran around the country telling people in Trump-type rallies that they had actually won the election. We resisted the reactionary call from across the benches. The Members opposite wanted us to react with an uncosted and ill-thought-out mini-budget and then try to apply an uncosted energy cap.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">We have seen the dire results of that across the water. It just goes to show that it is good to have three parties that work well together and a Minister for Finance and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform who are willing to take their time and to deliver a budget that will deliver and is delivering for people out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> I spoke about examples like the lump sum for the fuel allowance, the living alone allowance, the working family payment and the carer’s allowance, the double payment for child benefit and the weekly welfare schemes, and the assistance for students and for their parents. Other items were able to continue through this budget as well, such as the very substantial and significant cuts to transport fares. They are real cost-of-living benefits that accrue to students, younger people and to their parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> The Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, introduced a 25% reduction in childcare costs. It is the most significant State intervention in childcare costs in the history of the State, and we will go further next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> I hear many people across the House criticising the retrofitting scheme. I refer to the comments today of Adrian Joyce, the secretary general of EuroACE and campaign director for Renovate Europe. He described Ireland as Europe's best designed energy renovation programme. The scheme is just starting so I ask members of the Opposition to give it some time because there is an energy crisis and we are delivering. We will roll out the retrofitting scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> I will speak briefly on section 84 - the vacant homes tax. I welcome its introduction. It is the first time ever we have had a tax on vacancy, and it is something we must do. We have a lot of vacant houses. The commentary ranges from somewhere between 160,000 to a much lower figure. It is not that simple, clear or straightforward to bring those vacant homes into use. They are not all suitable for accommodation. There are many reasons for vacancy in this country. This is the start of it. I do not think the figure for the vacant homes tax is high enough, but I will seek to introduce amendments on Committee Stage to try to increase it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasGould" eId="spk_262">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Gould<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_548">There are 166,000 vacant homes in the State. The Government’s plan to tackle this is to bring in a levy of 0.3%. It looks like a joke, but it is so serious that it would be wrong to do so. The Minister has completely failed to tackle vacancy. Once again, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and now their partners, the Green Party, cosy up to the vulture funds, the land hoarders and the people who are sitting on homes where people should be living.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> In France, for instance, a phased vacant homes tax was introduced, starting at 10% and ending at 15% of the potential annual rent. It resulted in a 13% reduction in vacancy rates in four years. If we were to follow the French example, that would mean more than 21,000 vacant homes would come back into use.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> In my constituency of Cork North-Central, there are areas where vacancy is so high that one in 15 homes is vacant. These are homes in the heart of the city and there should be families and people living in them. Now, we are talking about some of these homes being left empty. Some of the homes are owned by local authorities. I know of a family who left a home last December and the house was boarded up this week, ten months later. I knew that house. I was in it. It was a perfect home that a family should have been living in for the past ten months.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> I have heard about the vacant homes tax and the Government’s plan in that regard. Does the Minister sincerely think a vacant homes levy of 0.3% will work? It cannot work. It makes no sense. How can we compare that with the 7% derelict sites levy? Less than 0.5% tax is paid for a vacant site but a derelict site is set at 7%. It just shows the complete lack of understanding about it. We need a proper vacant homes tax. We need a carrot-and-stick approach. We must encourage landlords to get those houses into use, and where they do not, we must penalise them to get them to do that. It is being said this is a progressive budget, but there is virtually nothing in the budget when it comes to solving the housing crisis and the homelessness crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> The Glashaboy flood relief scheme is ongoing. It has been promised for the past ten years. Glanmire flooded again last weekend, ten years after this was promised. The problem is that when it comes to construction inflation and tendering increases, it has to go back out for tender again. Last year, funds of €14 million were put in place, but because of inflation, the cost has gone up to €17 million. Once again, the scheme has not been delivered. For years this Government has promised flood protection for Glanmire.</p>

          <p eId="para_555">There is a lot of stuff to deal with in the Finance Bill. It is a big document. We will no doubt tease through a lot of it in more detail on Committee Stage. It is a telling fact that, faced with an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis and a shocking, disastrous, catastrophic – you just run out of adjectives to describe how bad the housing crisis is – housing crisis, the ESRI and Social Justice Ireland were before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member, and they stated unequivocally that if we strip out the once-off measures of cash payments, which occur primarily before Christmas, and some of the other once-off measures, the budget is regressive. That is not the left saying that; it is the ESRI and Social Justice Ireland. They were very clear. In real income terms, people on social welfare payments, pensions, students, and workers on average pay and low pay are going to be considerably worse off next year than they were this year. That is the simple inescapable fact. Insofar as the Government responded to that unprecedented cost-of-living and housing crisis, the measures it took – setting aside the once-off measures – were more favourable to the better off. That is the truth about the budget. Most people will be worse off next year. They are paying the price and the Government’s response was to favour the better off on an ongoing basis. It is true that some of the once-off measures will blunt, for a few months, the crippling impact of the energy price hikes and the general rise in inflation. They will blunt it, but overall, they will not compensate for the scale of inflation and the broader rise in the cost of living.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> That is happening at the same time when big business is enjoying an absolute bonanza in profits. I do not know if the Minister can give us an update, for example, on corporate profits, because as we know, we do not get the full details of corporate profits until a couple of years after those profits are recorded, but the trajectory on corporate profits is unmistakable and quite frankly staggering in recent years. In 2012, corporate profits were €74 billion. By 2020, corporate profits were €193 billion. That is a staggering increase. Corporate profits have almost trebled. Although we do not have the figures for 2021 and 2022 yet, it would seem clear from the Government’s own projections on corporate tax receipts that this year they will be €20 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">In 2020, they were €11 billion. The corporation tax that is coming in is almost doubling, and that can only happen if there has been a further staggering increase in the profits made by corporations. As we know, the bulk of those profits is being made by a few hundred incredibly, staggeringly, obscenely profitable corporations. The 2020 figures show €193 billion in total pre-tax profits and €11 billion paid, which works out at about 6.1% tax paid on their gross, pre-tax trading profits. If we extrapolate from the €20 billion we are estimated to get in receipts this year, that suggests extraordinary increases in profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_558"> Of course, we know all this. They are the broad, macro figures on dizzying increases in profits but there is a lot of other evidence from particular sectors. In the energy sector, the large energy producers and companies have witnessed staggering profits over the past two years in particular, at precisely the same time when people are being crushed with energy price hikes on an unprecedented scale and when people are experiencing increases in their bills at an unaffordable level. There has been nothing yet, although there have been promises, in terms of windfall taxes to be imposed on the profits of these companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> I was looking at the figures for Cement Roadstone Holdings. The Government has this misguided notion of bringing in the concrete levy, which will increase the cost of homes for people, instead of taxing the profits of people who are really profiting in the area of concrete, cement, construction materials and so on. I was leafing through CRH's accounts for 2021 and, again, they are just staggering. The earnings per share for 2021 at CRH increased in one year by 130%. There is no cost-of-living crisis for those who own lots of shares in CRH or for the people who own shares in private energy companies. There is no cost-of-living crisis for people who own substantial shares in those corporations that are seeing staggering increases in profits. Other people's misery is generating additional income, profits and dividends for the rich. That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> In property, again, it is self-evident. I mentioned earlier the Tathony House situation unfolding in Dublin 8. A landlord who inherited from a family member, as I understand it, a 35-unit apartment complex is now evicting all the people in the complex, who received notices to quit last week. Imagine the shock and fear that induces in those families. One person is a nurse in St. James's Hospital, while another happens to be a People Before Profit councillor. They are ordinary working people, now faced with eviction by a landlord who, they have worked out, based on the average rents in that apartment block, must have a rent roll of about €700,000 a year on that property alone, for which one of the residents went so far as to check with the Companies Registration Office the taxes paid and it is recorded that about €69,000 is paid in tax. That is €69,000 on a rent roll of about €700,000. That landlord is doing pretty well but not well enough, it seems, because he now wants to cash in on the increased value of property. As property prices go through the roof, is there a windfall tax, that is, an increased capital gains tax, for all those who bought property from the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, at the bottom of the market, the sorts of people who are trying to cash in on the extortionate value of property at the moment? No, there was no such tax in the budget, although there should have been because these people have made a stunning fortune from the terrible decisions of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government of 2011-2016 to unload property assets at a nominal value of about €42 billion, which must be worth three or four times that now, as these people cash in - or cash out - on the enormous capital gains they have accrued, where they have paid little or no tax on the rents they have received. The large, international investors will pay little on their capital gains but they can cash out tax free, with no serious measures to capture some of those incredible windfall gains these people have made.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> That is the reality of the inflation, cost-of-living and housing crises. A relatively small cohort of supremely wealthy individuals and corporations are making shocking, obscene profits, that is, a bonanza like we have never seen before, while ordinary people are crushed to the point where they do not how they will pay their bills. They simply cannot sustain the levels of rent being charged, but there are winners in all of this. They are the broad facts and the Government’s budget against that background is, even by the assessment of the ESRI, regressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> I might outline some of the specific measures in the Bill. I do not support the renter’s tax credit at all, and while I accept Sinn Féin believes in a higher renter’s tax credit, I am afraid I just do not believe in renters’ tax credits as a way to address this problem, whether it is €500, €1,000 or whatever it is, because it is chasing rents that are off the Richter scale. I am sure people will be glad of the €500 or €1,000 but it is a drop in the ocean, it is not dealing with the problem and it is public money ultimately going into the pockets of private landlords. What we need is not something one could include in a Finance Bill but it would be a better way to deal with the problem. As the Minister knows, we have advocated that we introduce proper rent controls whereby we actually control rents and ensure they are set at affordable levels. We believe, and we have put forward a Bill to this effect, that rents should, as a matter of law, amount to no more on average than about 25% of anybody's income. I was reading an interesting paper, of which the Minister might be aware, relating to the income thresholds and the review he carried out. It is incredible. The review he carried out estimates that people in Dublin, for example, are paying about 60% of their income on rent. It is absolutely shocking stuff. Many of those people are not even entitled to social housing or housing assistance payment, HAP, support for the extortionate rents they are paying. Against that background, the €500 renter's tax credit is a joke. It is not going to make any difference and it will be money into the pockets of landlords who are making an absolute fortune.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> The only response the Government gives when we suggest serious rent controls that would reduce the cost of rent is to say landlords will exit the market. If that is the case, good. We should take the properties off them. The properties do not have to exit. If landlords want to exit because they want only to follow maximum profit, just buy the properties off them. We have a lot of money, which the Minister has I think mistakenly put into the rainy day fund, totalling €6 billion. Why would we not use that money to expand dramatically the State's stock of public and affordable housing? If we do not do that, we will end up just making cash payments to landlords, whether through the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, HAP, leasing arrangements or renters' credits. We will end up just subsidising extortionate rents and pouring well in excess of €1 billion a year in current expenditure when this credit is added.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">That is the thing we cannot afford. When talking about our debt position and our financial position, we cannot afford to allow current expenditure to grow exponentially. The way to deal with that is for the State to have its own social and affordable housing stock on a much better scale than we have now. That capital investment is expensive at the outset but it saves billions over the medium to long term. It begins to generate revenue to the State and, of course, not least, ensures that people who are in what is essentially publicly subsidised housing - the HAP, the RAS and all these things are publicly subsidised - will have security and will not be facing the prospect of eviction but will have affordable housing and social housing. That is the alternative. We will get there eventually.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> The Minister should have a read about what they do Finland. In Helsinki, 70% of all the building land is in the hands of the city. They have their own state construction company and 55% of everything that is built is social and affordable housing. What is the point in building stuff that nobody can afford? The State ends up paying for it anyway through RAS, HAP and leasing. It is absolute insanity but it suits the institutional investors, vulture funds, corporate landlords and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> The vacant property tax is similarly a joke. It is three times the rate of the LPT. It is not going to disincentivise these people. It is just not enough. The capital gains they are making by sitting on empty property is multiples of that. It is still profitable for these people to sit on an empty property. I have been going on about St. Helen's Court in my area for four years. It is right across the road from me. It literally stares me in the face every day in my office. A vulture fund from the North - not even an international fund - bought it and has, essentially, intimidated three quarters of the tenants out. It has been sitting on 15 empty apartments for three years now and is trying to evict the rest of the tenants. It is profitable for it to do that. We allow and facilitate that. We do not make it absolutely illegal. We do not take the properties off it and house the people on the housing list. We let it do this. It will walk away with massive capital gains when it finally sells that property. It is quite honestly beyond belief.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> I want to mention the USC and changes around the minimum wage to ensure this tiny pathetic increase in the minimum wage will not accrue an extra USC. That is fine but the problem is that the level of the minimum wage increase at 80 cent is an absolute joke. I have raised the plight of a fantastic group of workers, that is, private security workers, a number of times. Currently, their employment regulation order, ERO, means their minimum pay is €11.65 per hour. Top Security, which is a company that gets public contracts, is resisting that moving up to €12.50. This is a company that gets public contracts and is making an absolute fortune. We do not do anything about that. The way the Government can cut across that is by increasing the minimum wage to something decent or at least to the level of the minimum wage. The minimum wage now is under €13. In our view, it should be as high as €15 per hour.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> I will cover other stuff on Committee Stage but I want to signal to the Minister an issue we have discussed many times, namely, the need to further amend the legislation around section 481 regarding the film tax film tax credit. The various stakeholders of the film industry appeared before the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, of which I am a member. Of course, we had the usual chorus of film producers, contractors, guilds, Screen Ireland and so on saying everything is wonderful and rosy in the garden and we should keep it the way it is. Then, we had representatives from Equity, performers, artists and representatives from the Irish Film Workers Association. The picture they presented was not so rosy. To cut a long story short, Equity said that its members' intellectual property rights, and the equitable remuneration they are supposed to get for the ongoing use of their intellectual property on further performances of movies and so on, are essentially being taken off them by the producers. They are forced into signing contracts where, essentially, they waive the rights to proper remuneration on that. They are getting contracts that are far inferior to what actors and performers get in the UK. Similarly, we heard testimonies from crew who said they had been blacklisted. Dozens of workers were blacklisted out of the industry. They take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, about unfair dismissal but the designated activity company, DAC, is the employer, and that DAC no longer exists by the time people get a case to the WRC. The recipients of section 481 who set up the DAC, where the DAC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of those producer companies, say they have nothing to do with those employees. It is an absolute scam. The Minister needs to amend section 481 to make it absolutely clear that the producer company that is the recipient of section 481 is responsible for the employees and is the employer. He needs to make sure there is not a situation where artists, performers and so on are essentially being forced to sign inferior contracts where their rights to their intellectual property, royalties and residuals are essentially being taken off them by producer companies.</p>

          <p eId="para_571">I may take advantage of the time. I listened to much of the debate and I think it is important for us to remember what happened on budget day. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, put forward an €11 billion package to try to alleviate what we know to be an incredibly difficult period for people in Ireland. We had that €11 billion. That was not borrowed money; that was money that was created by the Irish people. We have used that to protect people as much as is possible from external forces outside of Ireland in terms of inflation and growing energy costs. That situation of €11 billion is very different from many other countries. We should only look across the water where politicians are talking about spending cuts whereas we in this House are talking about an €11 billion package to protect workers and families and their jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> We need to draw a line under that because we know populist politics has a cost. By the way, populist politics is not something only used by those on the left - I am not suggesting that it is. However, populist politics across the political spectrum has a cost and when the maths are added up at the end, that cost often falls on ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> We are talking today about the Finance Bill. We do not talk about much of what was in the Social Welfare Bill. I want to reflect on what the ESRI, said about the budget, however It said many things but, of course, I will pick the quote that is of most advantage. We cannot forget what it said, however. It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_574">The government's approach to insulating households from the rise in energy prices has been effective. Targeted welfare measures combined with universal household energy credits will do more for most households ... than had welfare payments risen in line with inflation this year and next [year].</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> To me, that says this is a Government that wants to protect people, not a Government that somehow wants to unprogressively punish people. Yes, there are many measures in here for social welfare recipients but there are also measures for working people. I have no shame in defending the increase in the standard tax rates. I would say particularly to employers who are struggling to recruit people that there are measures in this Bill, including one-off special payments that avoid tax, which employers should be applying to workers. There is the increase in bonus payments from one to two and from €500 to €1,000. I will let Deputy Alan Farrell take over the remainder of the time.</p>

          <p eId="para_577">Okay, excellent. I could go on but we will discuss it on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_578"> I want to talk about housing. I wish many of the Deputies who talk about housing actually attended the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage because when they say there is nothing in this budget for housing, they are ignoring a €4 billion and a €20 billion package. They are ignoring new models of housing like cost rental, affordable purchase and the rapid increase in social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Many of the things we are doing in housing are being done outside of this budget. We have put in place multi-annual budgets and policies that will extend not just over years but over a decade to the benefit of people who will avail of those homes. </p>

          <p eId="para_580">The Deputy was on a roll and I did not want to stop him. I would like to echo what Deputy McAuliffe said. This budget is putting money back into people's pockets through decreases in taxation, the one-off measures and the substantial social welfare increases across the board. It is only possible because of prudent financial management over the last decade and of course, the extraordinary response of the Irish people in jobs and companies up and down the country during the course of the pandemic. That only happened because of the level of support that was provided by the Government over the past three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_581"> One of the most important aspects of the budget is the elements that have been put in place for one-off supports because of the cost-of-living crisis, such as the €600 being provided over three payments to households for the purposes of supporting them because of rising inflationary elements in energy costs. There is also recognition that those payments will not cover all of the energy increases and that is why the social welfare budget has been increased to include one-off payments, double payments and additional supports. In January of next year, we will see the ninth increase in the minimum wage take effect. That is the ninth increase since my party entered government in March 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_582"> We will further invest in An Garda Síochána, keeping our streets safe and following up on commitments we gave to adequately resource our Defence Forces in line with the Commission on the Defence Forces. This is extremely important not just because of the current global environment but also because we want to honour the men and women in uniform and ensure they have the appropriate equipment to deal with the task we set out before them.</p>
          <p eId="para_583"> In just three minutes it is hard to cover all of the territory but I will focus on three important areas. First is the investment in housing that Deputy McAuliffe closed his contribution on. I echo his remarks about those making comments on housing while ignoring the work that is going on in the background and the increased budget that Department has been given. I note both education Departments and the likes of free school books at primary level, the reduction in and rebate on third level fees, and the increase in the numbers of those who will eligible for the Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, grant. Lowering income tax for middle-income workers is a very important aspect of this budget. Whether it is the average, mean or median wage level in the State, the taxation measures will actually support them. Finally, I refer to the importance of the State running a budget surplus when so many around us are not. Investing for the future and ensuring that if there is another hiccup along the road, we are adequately resourced to respond to it is almost as important as the €11 billion in this budget.</p>

          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_584">The number of vacant homes in this city is really depressing. According to new data from the Central Statistics Office there are 37,000 vacant homes in Dublin alone. That does not count Dublin City Council vacant homes. Within a short distance from here, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I could bring you to 50 empty flats that could be used if they were brought back to life. It is painfully clear to all who live in the city and those commuting in and out that many of these homes have been left empty for years. Those years of neglect are dragging back the city and communities they are built in. These vacant and neglected homes are being left empty amid the worst housing crisis the State has ever faced. There are thousands upon thousands of people crying out for the chance to have a home in their community, where they grew up and among their family and friends. Sinn Féin has long called for a vacant homes tax in the face of Government opposition. A vacant homes tax must not exclude derelict property and must apply a rate for long-term vacancy. We need an effective vacant homes tax that will push vacant homes back onto the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> The Minister with responsibility for sports also announced a €35 million package to help sports clubs over this winter. That is absolutely welcome. It is really important that clubs are supported through this crisis. However, over a month has passed. Clubs are really struggling and waiting for clarity and communication about how this payment will be distributed. One issue that many small local sports clubs, which we all know about, have raised with me is concern around how the scheme will be rolled out. They are concerned that many of the bigger clubs, which are well resourced in terms of professional supports and professional members, will get the bulk of the funds and the smaller, less well resourced clubs will get the crumbs. That is a real worry for a lot of small clubs. Bill are mounting fast for clubs. I understand many clubs are reducing the number of nights they train in order to cut the cost of floodlighting and to reduce their energy bills. I seek clarification on how long it will be before there is communication with the clubs on this fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_586"> Also connected, last week the heavy rainfall affected many of the grass pitches across the country. Particularly in Dublin, the parks authorities called off a lot of pitches, which means they cannot be played on. That really highlights the under-investment in all-weather sports facilities. We need to ensure investment in them. We need all-weather sports facilities and they are not there. We have grass pitches and all they do is cut the grass on them. They do not manage those pitches.</p>

        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_273">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_587">The Finance Bill, which gives effect to some of the measures arising from the recent budget, is being considered in a number of particular contexts, including the cost-of-living crisis and electricity supply crisis. This year, a huge increase in the cost of energy is an additional cost for those who are already struggling to get by. Even before the recent spike in inflation, Ireland was the one of the most expensive countries in the EU in which to live. Our housing costs are the highest in the EU while the price of goods and services is 40% higher than the average across the EU. Generally speaking, the budget was welcomed by most people and businesses. In my speech on budget day, I acknowledged the Government's efforts to improve the circumstances of the public and the business community.</p>
          <p eId="para_588"> I wish to raise a number of items specifically relating to sections 84, 86 and 88 of the Bill. First and foremost, section 88 makes provision for the €1.25 billion temporary business energy support scheme, which was originally planned to cover just case I businesses, such as those involved in trade such as shops, hotels and restaurants. I welcome the announcement that the Finance Bill will extend this scope to cover case II businesses also. The fund aims to help mainly small businesses, covering up to 40% of the increase in energy bills, up to €10,000 per month until February. However, the Government has also decided that where a business operates from more than one location, the cap will be increased to a maximum of €30,000 per month. This is good news for some, but not for all. Although these measures are welcome, there are serious concerns being brought to me by businesses in Dundalk that are experiencing sky-rocketing electricity bills. The issue with the new energy support is that it only runs until February, and that date is even subject to EU approval. We are ending our energy support in February and then increasing VAT to 13.5% on the hospitality sector on 1 March. Are we trying to close businesses? This is disappointing and does not give certainty to business owners, especially if they have a hard winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> Ireland Active; the representative body for leisure centres, gyms, swimming pools and commercial sports facilities in Ireland has stated that the cost of heating pools is resulting in very high bills. In Dundalk alone there are three leisure centres. On top of this, we have some of the biggest call centres that, during Covid, complied with the remote working model. Now, many employees who have been working from home since the pandemic are weighing up their options coming into winter. Many consider it more costly to work from home with the price of oil and gas on the rise, and are considering returning to the office. This is going to cause a lot of problems for the businesses. Some are experiencing a 300% to 400% increase in utility costs. This is going to cause lay-offs in businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">When the temporary business energy support scheme is found not to help that much, there will be serious problems. I agree that the electricity measures have provided relief for many households but the hospitality sector is again suffering. This shows the Government is out of touch with hardworking business owners who, after surviving the Covid crisis, are now being crippled by the cost of living. This is the main message I am getting from people in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_591"> Homelessness is at record levels. People are queuing on the streets for a room. They are being priced out of buying a home and they are paying nearly half their wages in rent. The housing crisis is felt in every part of the country. In my constituency of Louth and in east Meath, there is a severe housing shortage and spiralling rental costs. The latest figures from Daft.ie show the cost of renting in Louth has risen by more than 8% in the past year, with the average rent now at €1,420. Letting agencies have painted a devastating picture of the current rental market, with the shortage of supply hitting people of all ages and walks of life. In Louth and east Meath, the rental crisis is catastrophic, with thousands of people viewing a handful of homes.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> I have raised the issue of vacant homes numerous times in the House. I welcome section 84 of the Bill, which introduces a vacant homes tax in order to increase the supply of homes for rent or purchase. The provision will, I hope, encourage the owners of long-term vacant properties that are habitable and are subject to local property tax to bring them back into use. However, it will not apply to derelict or uninhabitable properties. In this time of crisis, we must ensure all houses are fully utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> Section 86 introduces provision for a defective concrete product levy, with the intention of raising revenue to contribute towards mica reliefs. Although section 5 extends and enhances the help-to-buy relief for a further two years, this levy will penalise young people trying to build or buy their first home, as well as local authorities trying to build social housing. The burden of the new levy is likely to fall on the residents of new-build homes rather than on the building industry. The Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland calculates it will add approximately €4,000 to the cost of an average three-bedroom semi-detached house. We need to assess fully the cost implications of this new levy and how it will affect the most vulnerable in our society. As I have mentioned previously, it will have an all-encompassing effect on our economy, including on construction and housing, infrastructure and right across the board to our farming industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> The Finance Bill and budget are two sides of the same coin. The real test will be their ability to have an impact on people's lives. There are many aspects of the Bill that we must praise. The increase in tax credits, the increase in inclusivity and other aspects need to be acknowledged. However, we are entering into a very volatile period in respect of living costs. The Bill has been neither future-proofed nor rural-proofed. The cost of most items is rising far too quickly. The cost of building homes is increasing swiftly. The cost of lighting and heating homes is rising rapidly. Any benefits people will get from this Bill and the budget will quickly be absorbed by those rising costs. I fear the real danger will be inflation. It is important that the Government recognises this and takes whatever action needs to be taken.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#VeronaMurphy" eId="spk_274">
          <from>Deputy Verona Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T18:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_595">I have several points to make. First, a number of constituents have raised with me the issue of benefit-in-kind adjustments. The writer of one email on the subject said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_596"> Dear Verona, I am writing to you about an issue which is going to affect my ability to feasibly do my job and whether or not I can continue in it. I am a sales rep. In the recent budget, the Government has proposed changes to be made on benefit-in-kind for those with a car provided by their employer. I cannot use a commercial van, so I am going to see a rise of nearly 50% in benefit-in-kind payments annually.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_597"> This measure is to incentivise people to use electric cars. I understand that. However, this is currently not practical for a sales rep as I cover a large geographical area and I travel into rural areas where electric vehicle charging points are not available. Additionally, I am under time pressure and do not have the luxury of waiting an hour to charge a vehicle. My car is my office and it is as important and crucial to me as your phone and laptop are to you. It is not a luxury that the company give me and for that reason I strongly urge that you ask the Government to offer a tiered system for those people who use the car in this way, or I will most likely be joining the social welfare system.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> My constituents raise some very valid concerns and I urge the Minister to make allowances for them in the implementation of the new policy. I ask that the proposed timelines be delayed or scrapped now that he is aware of the unintended consequences and difficulties they present. Thousands of workers will be hit by a massively increased tax bill as a result of the measure. It does not seem at all fair or equitable. Again, it is the squeezed middle being squeezed to death. Constituents frequently say there seems to be no area of society where the Government is not trying to make life worse for the ordinary working people who are just trying to make ends meet. How can there be such a disconnect?</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> After a few weeks of a drop, we see fuel prices creeping up again, with diesel currently costing well over €2 per litre at the pumps. Fuel is the common denominator in this crisis. It is responsible for the biggest increase in the cost of living and is, in turn, driving up inflation. Yet, the Government has decided only public service workers will be recognised as incurring cost rises. They are being given a 6.5% pay increase, leaving low- and middle-income earners to suffer on. The Government must remove excise duties on fuel, as I proposed almost a year ago, and it needs to do so now. The Exchequer can afford, on a trial basis, to remove all excise on fuels. It will enable people to afford to do their jobs, particularly in rural Ireland, where there is no meaningful public transport and people have to use their cars. The question for most of those people is not how they will get to work but whether they will go to work. For them, work does not pay and that has to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_600"> Carers, to give just one example, are leaving their jobs. They get a measly 15 cent per kilometre. It does not pay them to use their car and nor do they receive a stamp towards a pension entitlement. Family carers continue to be means tested for the fuel allowance, which is just cruel. Those in charge and earning a much greater salary failed to comprehend the recruitment and retention crisis in the sector. Being unable to recruit and retain carers means the budget announcement of €11 billion in spending, which Deputy McAuliffe tried to impress upon us, will not be used. There are announcements about increased funding for home care support schemes but that money just does not get spent. Those announcements, like so many others, are just spin announcements.</p>
          <p eId="para_601"> I asked during my budget speech on housing earlier in the month whether the concrete levy will be applied to the price of concrete inclusive of VAT. That question went unanswered and is still unanswered even though the levy has been halved. The levy should be abandoned, not diminished. It is a sticking plaster being applied to a massive wound. The truth about mica is that those culpable went unregulated. The innocent paid and the Government continues to make them pay with a lifelong levy, just like the one introduced in response to the PMPA insurance crisis more than 40 years ago. It did nothing for insurance only make it more expensive. The competition regulator failed to investigate the insurance market's gouging of customers for years. That gouging continues and, 40 years later, so does the levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> It is unbelievable that in the middle of possibly the worst housing crisis in the history of the State, the Government decided to increase taxes on house-building. The world looks on in disbelief not because we cannot house our homeless but because this is being done at a time when we are exclaiming to the world that we can take in and house more than 200,000 unfortunate Ukrainian refugees, not having even considered the 10,000 homeless people we had before the war broke out. It would be funny if it were not so tragic. For the sake of our people who are in need of housing supply, will the Minister please rethink raising the money on the mica scheme? Will he try cutting wasteful expenditure on lawsuits arising from incompetent semi-State bodies? An Bord Pleanála would be a good place to start.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> There must be further discussion as to the behaviour of the Central Bank in relaxing lending rules by increasing the multiple that may be borrowed to four times applicant's earnings. It is very strange to see lending rules relaxed at a time when the cost of borrowing has increased and people's ability to pay has reduced due to increased costs in so many other areas. It raises the question as to why on earth this move was not made three years ago when houses were more affordable and the ability to make repayments was greater. Relaxing the rules at that time would have helped a lot of people to get on the housing ladder.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">Remaining prudent was the excuse used back then, when housing was available at a more affordable price. These policies must have potential first-time buyers tearing their hair out. Everywhere they turn, the arms of the State have conspired to put barriers in their way. Now, when the cost of living is a crisis point, their spending is reduced, and as interest rates rise at a rocketing pace, the regulator sees fit to say "Tally-ho" to prudence, but "buyer beware". I am afraid that that is just another regulator that is about as useful as an ashtray on a motorbike.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCanney" eId="spk_275">
          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_605">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2022 and to address some of the queries that have been raised since the budget was announced. The energy supports for households are to be welcomed, but the problem is that there are anomalies in the whole process, and pay-as-you-go customers are not sure how they are going to get the credits or how it is going to work. That must be clarified, as a matter of urgency, in order to ensure that it is clear how people who need the support most can get it. I understand that the changes to the fuel allowance are going to come into effect on 1 January. The problem is that the application process will not begin until after that. There will be people in February, March and April completing their applications for the fuel allowance, and payments will be backdated to January. People are under financial strain and do not need to be waiting for backdated payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Another issue that I want to raise concerns students and part-time students who do not qualify for the €1,000 reduction in their fees. It is a mistake to do that. These are young people who have been working or continue to work, are trying to improve their lives, and are paying a lot of money to be educated. We should recognise that they are doing something that is right and correct, and we should encourage them by including them in the scheme for the rebate for students.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> On benefit-in-kind, there is a false impression that when a person has a company car or vehicle, he or she is on the gravy train. When I worked in private industry and had a company car, it was a necessity. It was my office. I had my files and everything else in it to allow me to deal with my day-to-day work. I was in different parts of the country, whether Dublin, Galway or wherever, and I needed the car. The problem now is that the Government is trying to differentiate between those with electric cars and those with fossil fuel cars. The Minister of State knows, as he heard last Saturday, that we do not have the infrastructure in this country to support electric cars, particularly in the regions and the west of Ireland. Why are we trying to penalise people who have petrol or diesel cars when they cannot viably operate electric cars because they cannot be confident that they will get them charged when they need to? These are people who are tied to timeframes. It is important that we look at this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> Another issue that arises concerns once-off payments. I feel very strongly about the €500 payment that is being made to people with disabilities. Not everybody who has a disability will get the payment. People who were on disability payments and moved over to the old-age pension when they reached the age of 66 will not get this €500. They still have the disability, but because they changed from one category of payment to another because of their age and entitlement to old-age pension, they are going to be excluded from this particular payment. That is wrong. More importantly, the €500 should not be a once-off payment to people with disabilities; it should be the start of a process by which people with disabilities are given enough money to be able to live. Back in 2019, the Government commissioned a report from Indecon. That report pointed out that it cost between €7,800 and €12,000 for people to live with disabilities at that time. The cost of disability was that much. The €500 payment is welcome, but it should be made an annual payment that is increased year on year over the next five to six years in recognition of the fact that people with disabilities have additional costs. It is very important that we look at that. It would make a difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> There is a lot of talk about housing. I have mentioned the issue previously. The day after the budget, I questioned the concrete block levy. Changes have been made in the sense that the levy has been reduced and the introduction of the levy will be deferred until September. The timing is wrong. It is ill-judged to be even talking about adding more to the cost of construction at this stage. What we should be doing is concentrating on schemes that we have announced that have not actually come into effect. The Croí Cónaithe fund scheme for rural houses was announced at the ploughing championships, but no local authority can deal with it yet because they do not have the paperwork or a directive from a Minister to do so. Let us get real. If we are saying that schemes are in place, let us make sure they are operating from the date on which they are announced, and that the spade work is done on them so we can actually put them into place.</p>
          <p eId="para_610"> In the north and western region areas there are thousands of houses that are vacant. People are coming to me who want to apply for funding to bring them back into use. All I can tell them is that they will have to wait until the ministerial direction is issued to the local authorities. I also wish to point out that the local authorities may not have the necessary resources and staff to deal with all this additional stuff that is coming into play for them. They need to be supported with additional resources to make sure that these schemes can work. It cannot be like the retrofitting scheme, which was introduced and announced with a fanfare a number of months ago. To date, 69 houses have been retrofitted out of a target of thousands. There is something fundamentally wrong when we have schemes like that. We are not going through the process of thinking these schemes out, putting a plan in place for their implementation and actually testing them to make sure that they will work. There is something amiss. Sometimes what happens is that people have a good idea and it is just put out there. The school transport programme is one such example. We must ensure that whatever we are doing is tried and tested before it is introduced.</p>

        <speech by="#AlanDillon" eId="spk_276">
          <from>Deputy Alan Dillon<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T18:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_611">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Finance Bill 2022. I acknowledge the Minister's continued management of our economy, especially in challenging times, which has enabled us to make an €11 billion intervention without borrowing - a substantial achievement - while also placing an additional €2 billion aside this year and a further €4 billion next year in a reserve fund to protect Ireland from shocks in the future. Given the difficult winter that is facing us all, I welcome the progressive measures contained within this Bill, which are designed to ensure that those in society who are most impacted by rising bills and inflationary pressures, along with the squeezed middle, are supported in what is an enormous cost-of-living budget. This Bill has Fine Gael's fingerprints all over it. I also welcome the contributions of the coalition Government partners.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> No one across our society has avoided the difficulties posed by rising costs. The Government cannot insulate everyone fully from them. Those difficulties are set to get more acute as we approach the end of the year and the start of the new one. However, €1.2 billion has been allocated for supports to help consumers over this year and next year, which is a hugely important step. Chapter 3 will give rise to a reduction in the amount of tax that workers pay, putting more hard-earned money back into people's pockets, with a fairer income tax package for all. The increase in the standard rate of cut-off for a single person, from €36,800 to €40,000, will certainly assist middle-income workers across the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> Section 12 sets out a really positive measure that introduces a new tax credit for renters that is worth €500 per renter, and €1,000 for couples. Thankfully, the €500 tax credit will also be extended to parents who pay rent on behalf of their sons and daughters attending third level education, which will also ease their burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> Section 5 supports our housing policy to extend the help-to-buy scheme for a further two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">It is an essential step that has already helped over 36,000 householders to date. Of those, 728 have availed of the scheme in Mayo alone, which has assisted those who were finding it difficult to get onto the property ladder.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> The announcement of the extension of the tax incentive under section 481 until 2028 is very welcome but there is no extension of the regional uplift programme, which proved valuable in bringing productions outside of the Dublin and Wicklow hubs. The uplift has seen considerable production activities across the country, from Kerry to Donegal. I continue to advocate for its return in some form, especially as my county has an opportunity to benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> I join colleagues in asking for further consideration to be given to the impending changes to benefit-in-kind calculations on company vehicles due to come into effect at the start of 2023. Many constituents have contacted me and outlined that the timing and justification for this measure are completely inappropriate, given the cost-of-living pressures through which we are currently going.</p>

          <p eId="para_618">This is substantial legislation. I welcome the Finance Bill, of course, which is a detailed and substantial piece of legislation. I will not get to say much about it in my allotted three minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> I am sympathetic to the remarks made on various sides of the House about the benefit-in-kind scheme. I do not know if that has been properly thought through. I urge the Minister to look at it again while there is still an opportunity to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_620"> I welcome the improvements in the employment incentive investment scheme and the entrepreneur's relief scheme, not because of any desire I might have to make the rich richer but because it is important that we strengthen the indigenous sector. Foreign direct investment has proved a tremendous boon to this country but in view of the uncertain world we now live in, it is very important to build up the indigenous sector, particularly SMEs, so that our tax yields can be future-proofed against whatever is coming down the track.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> I welcome the Government's decision to extend the threshold for the higher rate of income tax to €40,000. People in other countries to whom I have spoken are amazed that we come into the highest tax rate at such an early stage. The Irish income tax system has rightly been described as the most progressive in the world. However, I wonder whether, wittingly or unwittingly, we make it a little less progressive through this decision. The difficulty if the threshold is raised from €36,800 to €40,000 is that working people who earn up to €36,800 do not get that particular benefit. I know that some misleading figures have been put around here because many of those people qualify for the working family payment, if they meet the various criteria. Some qualify for more than others. Nevertheless, I am a bit mystified as to why something could not have been done, for example, with USC, to at least narrow the advantage it has given to people who earn a multiple of others who earn less than €36,800 per annum. That should have been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> I also welcome the extension of the TBESS to professionals. That was a good move. However, I am somewhat amazed it has not been extended to charities. Charities are facing increasing demand, decreasing contributions and increasing costs. Their reserves are depleted after the pandemic. The charity sector is very important. It does an enormous amount of work, particularly in the areas of mental health and disabilities. They assist people with housing, etc. They are also businesses, albeit not for profit. They are facing a perfect storm. Even at this late stage, the Government should look at the notion of extending this particular concession to charities. I do not know how much it would cost. Perhaps the Minister could examine that. I would appreciate it if he would respond specifically to that point when he is replying to this debate.</p>

        <speech by="#RoseConwayWalsh" eId="spk_279">
          <from>Deputy Rose Conway-Walsh<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_625">The Finance Bill includes an income tax package that is clearly designed to give more to higher income earners. When one strips back the temporary but absolutely necessary interventions in this Finance Bill, the stark reality is laid bare. It abysmally fails to address the growing inequality that is crippling our society. It is not only me and Sinn Féin saying that. Social Justice Ireland estimates that this Finance Bill will widen the gap between rich and poor by €199 next year. It has stated that Ireland's poorest will be worse off when the one-off measures in budget 2023 are discontinued. The change to the highest income tax rate is the most expensive measure in the Bill but despite the cost to the public finances, 2.2 million workers will not benefit at all. This is unfair and economically reckless.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> Low-income families spend heavily within the local economy, thereby supporting indigenous business and jobs. Businesses in small towns are now hibernating or getting ready to hibernate for the winter months because that is the only way that many of them will be able to survive. The reduced footfall and escalating costs combine to a reality where debts accumulate. Every choice made by the Government in this Finance Bill will have a knock-on effect on local economies. When we tally all the tax measures, people earning €100,000 will benefit four times as much as those earning €35,000. It is a measure designed to benefit high earners and leave low- and middle-income earners to face into the winter and a cost-of-living crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> The Government plans to push house prices up through the badly designed defective blocks levy. There are elements of the Government housing policy that can be tracked back to Sinn Féin, for instance, the tax back for renters and the ban on evictions. I welcome those measures. They are watered-down versions of our policies but at least they are a step in the right direction. The tax rebate will only work if there is ban on increases and we need to end the rip-off rents.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> We need to delay the introduction of the new benefit-in-kind regime until some form of distinction can be made between a company car as a perk and company vehicles that are essential for work-related activity. That is important. I ask the Minister to look again at that measure to see how we can introduce some fairness.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> I welcome the fact that student accommodation is now included in the tax rebate but there are still too many people paying rent who are excluded. I am concerned because the tax rebate will only extend to renters in accommodation registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. We know that many students will not meet that criterion. I ask the Minister to consider that matter and see how all people who are paying rent can be accommodated.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T18:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_630">I am pleased to speak. In the short time available for me to speak on the Finance Bill, I am only going to be able to cover a fraction of the issues. I will certainly address the concrete levy because this is a farce. It is showing the white flag to the real perpetrators of that awful mica and pyrite crisis. Those perpetrators were the quarries. The Minister obviously has no appetite to touch big business. We see that across the country. He has decided to put the problem onto the building of every house. The levy will add at least €4,000 to the cost of building even a modest 2,000 sq. ft house. Under pressure, the Minister has backtracked and halved the levy. It is still the wrong way to go, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">The sacred cows and the windfall profits of Cement Roadstone plc, which owns 99.9% of the quarries - if not in name it owns them indirectly - should be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> The same applies to carers. While there are welcome increases in the threshold, there was nothing meaningful done for the carers, such as having their pay linked to issues like the fuel allowance or the plethora of other payments there are. They do an enormous amount of work and keep people out of hospital. Now we have the problem where we cannot get home helps. The Government certainly had an opportunity to do something here.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> The announcement in respect of the Croí Cónaithe scheme was made at the ploughing championships. The Government is wonderful with announcements but it does not even consult any of the agencies which deliver this. That is why we have blunder and bluff.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> The Government also announced funding for the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which I welcome for businesses but in the Finance Bill we now see that the number of businesses which this scheme is covering has multiplied. The amount of money for the scheme was inadequate in the first place because shops and businesses I have quoted here have contacted me and they are still going to be paying €7,000 a month extra for their ESB bills compared with last year, and that is after having received the support from that scheme of up to 40%. Now if the number of people getting a slice of the cake grows in number, this sum will be totally inadequate. The Government is playing with people with these figures and giving them out in a spin.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> This Finance Bill lacks any vision or any kind of imagination or understanding of why the people are hurting so much. This budget and this Finance Bill is the biggest con job that has ever been perpetrated on the people because the Government is taking the money. The price of diesel now at the pumps has gone up to €2.02, and I saw €2.079 yesterday in Mullingar, or somewhere in the midlands, on Sunday. Half of that is tax. The more the price goes up, the more the Government is reaping in. The price of fuel or oil is the common denominator whether it is social activity, at work, agriculture or industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> Also, agus is mór an trua é an rud sin, benefit-in-kind was a good scheme which got people up early in the morning, out to work to travel the roads, and I had many such people on to me. These are excellent people who worked so hard and who want to work and pay their way. They were turning over, getting business and generating money for their companies and this was a savage attack.</p>
          <p eId="para_637"> Every aspect of this budget has the Minister, Deputy Ryan's fingerprints all over it, even on the bikes scheme. There is extra relief to get some kind of a cargo bike. Everywhere you go, you see footpaths and roads being dug up and being narrowed to crucify the motorists and to make lanes for bicycles and so forth. I am not anti such developments but common sense must prevail. Every aspect of this budget has been drawn in green ink and I was going to say red ink. It is a green document. It is not looking after the business people, the people on the housing list or anyone in that category. It is just looking after itself, to keep Government bums on those seats there and to ensure the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and his party will not pull out of Government.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Collins<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_638">The budget was a missed opportunity for many young people who are in a middle road-type situation. Fuel is hitting them very hard. They will see very little increases after the budget, only certain pain. When the Minister was announcing the budget here in the House and when I first looked at the document, to the naked eye the Minister was going to give a decrease in the cost of fuel, but all he did was to continue something he had done earlier. The pain has grown and grown and, like previous speakers have said, the cost of fuel has gone crazy, at more than €2 a litre for a litre of diesel. It is an insane situation and people are feeling that very hard.</p>
          <p eId="para_639"> Agriculture is facing a crisis. I was speaking to some of the organisations during the week with the fall in the price of cattle and there is a serious worry out there. Bills are rising, as are fertiliser bills and costs. These are out of control, especially for agri-fuel. It would have been especially welcomed if the Minister had lowered the tax take. It was a greedy tax take by this Government but, of course, it is the only way it can get its hands on as much money as possible so that it can cycle out great amount of grants for this, that and the other thing to see if it can get its senior politicians elected again.</p>
          <p eId="para_640"> Moving to the fishing situation in this country, I would love to ask the Minister what fishermen ever did to him in school. I suppose he never saw a fisherman in his life in school because he certainly has something terrible against them. The Minister gave them nothing, absolute zilch, in this budget. They exist and are a great part of this country. They look at being completely whacked left, right and centre. The best the Government can come up with for them is decommissioning and tying up boats with money from Europe. Looking at them there, the French and Spanish Governments have given their fishermen fuel subsidies. What have our fishermen been given? Zero. The Government has announced an energy rebate which businesses get, which is fair enough, but the fishermen ask me if they are going to get an energy rebate because they are using very significant amounts of energy. Where are they going to get a rebate in this? I hope the Minister will address that when he speaks in a minute because they certainly deserve to survive, the same as anybody else. I know the Government has almost wiped them out but they certainly deserve to live as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_641"> People talk to me about the carer’s allowance and I ask that perhaps, in time, the Minister might look at the situation where people who genuinely care for their loved ones are being means-tested. It should not matter a damn if someone spends so many hours every day caring for either a neighbour or a loved one, but they cannot get that money if their husband or wife or whichever way it is is earning a little bit more than they should. Here is a person who is basically caring for someone and paying for it out of their own pocket.</p>
          <p eId="para_642"> I have serious worries about the tourism industry VAT going, perhaps, from 9% upwards. We cannot accept that could happen and I believe the Minister will need to clarify that. We certainly know the hotel industry, and have met quite a number of its representatives, has not been fleecing the people in west Cork. I accept some hotels have been. Those in west Cork have been very fair to the people. The one thing they told me is that some family members of these family-run hotels will be working for nothing if these hotels are to keep their doors open. This is a very serious issue and is one area where, if the VAT rises, it will have serious consequences. I have very little time left but I need to know about the VAT.</p>
          <p eId="para_643"> I know money was given for school transport but the school bus tickets issue is still a fiasco. The Government made a complete mess of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> There is also the blocks issue, and while I am aware the percentage of the levy has been dropped and the Government has accepted it is to go from 10% to 5%, it was not good enough in the first place.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T19:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_645">I am glad to get the opportunity to raise issues about this budget. All we ever ask in a budget is that the Minister and the Government be fair with all sectors of the people. That has not happened in this budget. Sadly, people depending on diesel and petrol-fuelled cars, where they have no other option, together with lorry men who are on the road day after day, were promised throughout the summer that the Government would help them in the budget and it did nothing at all for them. The Government is saying that whatever few pence it did give them off the cost of fuel last May or June will end at the end of February and the first day of March next year. The Minister is saying he is managing the finances well and that is how he has the €11 billion, but I say to him that most of that €11 billion is money he collected off people on the road. Four years ago the barrel of oil was cheaper then than it is now. At the same time, everyone is paying double except the farmers who are paying a great deal more. The Minister gave them two cents off. They are paying €1.50 a litre now, which is almost three quarters the cost of white diesel. Heretofore, they were only paying a third of the cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_646"> I told the Minister to reconsider the concrete levy. He considered it a bit all right but he is still leaving it at 5% and that is too much because, like I said, people who are buying materials to buy house are paying extra VAT and tax on these materials already. They are paying extra for concrete already, which has gone up from €80 to €115 a cubic metre. These people are paying extra VAT and tax to the Government already.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> On housing, the Government makes such a hullabaloo and acclaim about the housing policy it has. We see, however, where in Kerry there are 171 vacant houses and the Government will not provide the funding to put both houses or voids back into production. What is wrong with the Minister?</p>
          <p eId="para_648">Would it not be very easy to do that? These 171 houses have been vacant for three or four years. What is wrong with the Government that it will not deal with that?</p>
          <p eId="para_649"> On the cost of electricity, there is no account of the regulator at all. The electricity companies are allowed to double and triple their profits. We would not mind paying more for electricity if it cost them more to generate it. We see how hard it is for some people to get social welfare payments. Many pensioners will not receive the €500 bonus because they do not get fuel allowance or the living alone allowance. Despite this, there are Ukrainian men of fighting age here getting the same dole and supports as others even though they are being housed, fed and every other thing. All I am asking for is fair play across the board. Irish people who have been here all of their lives are not getting that fair play. I ask the Minister to look at those things and to review some of the decisions the Government has made because they are very unfair.</p>

          <p eId="para_650">I am glad to speak on the Finance Bill and on the budget the Minister introduced on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan. I will first talk about the 9% rate of VAT. As a representative of the tourism capital of the western world, Killarney in County Kerry, I believe it is wrong for the Minister to allow uncertainty on this matter until February of next year. Having met with hoteliers last weekend, I know they are certainly not happy with what the Minister is doing or, as should I say, what he is not doing. With regard to the benefit-in-kind scheme, I also met with representatives of a number of businesses last weekend and they are extremely upset at what the Minister has done to that scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> With regard to the temporary business energy support scheme, which is very important, I welcome the extra relief to be given to dentists, doctors, solicitors, accountants and others in non-incorporated enterprises. That is very important because they were being left out.</p>
          <p eId="para_652"> With regard to the concrete levy, I was the first person to stand up in this House on behalf of the concrete providers in Kerry and those who export concrete products into the North and abroad who were extremely upset at what the Minister was doing. The Minister has created uncertainty and upset the system. He has upset the tendering process and shot our local authorities in his own foot in doing what he did. The half of a U-turn he has done shows he made a mistake. If he had not made a mistake, he would not have done what he has now done. All he has proved is that we were right to say he was wrong in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_653"> With regard to the retrofitting scheme, of the 65,000 houses the Minister, Deputy Ryan, was blowing about being retrofitted, 80 have been completed, including fewer than eight in County Kerry. I do not know whether Deputy Ryan or the Minister for Finance are proud of that fact. They can blow all they like about retrofitting but the proof of the pudding is in the eating and only 80 of 65,000 have been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> With regard to solar panels, what did the Minister do in the budget to encourage people to install them? Nothing. The mantra among businesses that want to install solar panels is not to apply for the grant because the assistance available is difficult to apply for and will amount to nothing at the end of the day. Anybody in business who is going ahead with solar panels is doing so without the grant. So much for what the Government is doing for those people.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> The small businesses that are being affected by the massive increase in costs, the microenterprises that employ up to nine people, employ more than 400,000 people, nearly half a million. The people running such businesses in County Kerry and who are really struggling with the increased cost of electricity, diesel, fuel and everything else are saying the budget did nothing for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> This budget failed to give our farmers a break from the crippling cost of inputs. For example, the hiking of the carbon tax represents a major blow to hard-pressed farm families. To take the people now putting cattle in for the winter, for example, they endured the cost of feed and the costs accrued during the year to grow the grass to make silage for the winter, including fertiliser costs. These people are really worried. This is going to affect the beef sector after Christmas because there will be no profit to be made because of the high input costs that are putting people under tremendous pressure. I have a lot more to say but I cannot say it in the time I have.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">Does the Minister have any idea of the number of businesses around the country that were awaiting the details of this Finance Bill today? My God, were they surprised. A great many of them will not qualify for the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, as Revenue will need to see an increase of 40% or more in electricity or gas bills compared with bills for this time last year. Deputy Micheál Martin has, in the past, accused us of not understanding the consequences of the war between Russia and Ukraine but we seem to understand a lot more than the Government. The Finance Bill is of the Government's own making and, through the restrictions it has placed on this scheme it introduced in the budget, it has missed an opportunity to help businesses around the country. These restrictions will prevent many businesses from availing of the TBESS. Does the Minister know why? It is because, six or seven months ago, many businesses decided to take the Government's advice and try to save on energy. What did they do? They borrowed money to put in solar panels to reduce their energy costs. They bought generators to reduce their energy costs and now find out that, after making all of these investments, they do not qualify for this scheme. Many of these businesses have seen increases in energy costs of 25% and 35% but will not get any financial reward from the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> I spoke to a quarry owner today. The U-turn the Government has done on the block levy is amazing. I myself highlighted to Government the lunacy of bringing in a concrete levy in the first place because it was targeting every person in the country building a house, renovating one, doing up a garden or replacing a driveway. The Government did not think it through and has now had to do a U-turn. Its backbenchers finally found a small bit of backbone and threatened it so it did a U-turn, although it only reduced the levy to 5% and delayed it until September of next year. If that goes ahead, Government backbenchers will come under far more pressure than they did this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> What is the crux of this? How does the Government help people in an energy crisis? The price of fuel goes up and this Government's taxation system takes 50% on diesel and almost the same percentage on petrol. For every euro spent at the fuel pump, the Government takes 50%. What is used to manufacture food in this country? Fossil fuel-powered vehicles. Tractors set the seeds and bring in the silage to feed the cattle whose milk is then brought to the creamery by fossil fuel-powered trucks. Food is brought to your premises for you to eat by fossil fuel-powered vehicles. The Government levies taxes totalling 50% on these fuels. How many billions of euro has it taken in tax? Today, the Minister has said that the Government has managed to put together an €11 billion package for the country and did not have to borrow a cent, but that is because it robbed that money off the country in the first place. It robbed it off the squeezed middle. It robbed the entrepreneurs of this country who are trying to stay in business. When the Minister sees sorrow on the faces of children and people who can barely put food on the table this Christmas, I hope he will know that he was the cause of a lot of it. All he does is introduce tax after tax. If he is not taxing fuel, he is putting 23% on everything else and his Government is backing him. Shame on them.</p>

          <p eId="para_660">I welcome the Bill. Last week, we had the very welcome news that the bike-to-work scheme is to be extended to €3,000 to enable people to purchase cargo bikes. There is empirical evidence that cargo bikes give at least some families the option to get rid of their car or second car.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Many short trips that would be taken by car can and will be taken by bike or cargo bike with this measure, as well as others the Government has introduced. It is worth noting that nearly 40% of our transport emissions are caused by cars travelling short journeys. These are journeys in both urban and rural areas. These journeys, which are currently made by private car, are within the range of bike, electric bike and cargo bike.</p>
          <p eId="para_662"> With respect to cargo bikes, the opportunity is not just for families. There is enormous potential for last-mile delivery. Cargo bikes come into their own in this area because they are energy efficient, they are light and nimble and they can avoid congestion. There are negligible fuel costs. They do not require tax or insurance and they give business owners faced with a driver shortage an opportunity to move their goods cheaply and efficiently around urban areas. Additionally, they are a very good thing from the State's point of view because they do not cause costly wear and tear damage to road surfaces. They improve public health and reduce congestion. Whether it is cargo bikes, electric bikes or traditional pushbikes, and whether we are thinking of people living in Ballinamore or Ballybunion, measures to get people onto bikes, e-bikes and cargo bikes effectively reduce emissions. I repeat what I said earlier. Nearly 40% of all transport-related greenhouse gas emissions are caused by cars taking short journeys. For climate reasons alone, and irrespective of the evidence that it is good for our economy, for public health, for creating better, more attractive and safer urban and rural environments, and for reducing the cost to the State in multiple ways, we should be doing everything we can to get people onto these modes of transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_663"> The positive measures in this Bill should be just the beginning. We have to curb drastically the sale of new fossil fuel vehicles on our roads. Every new fossil fuel vehicle sold makes it harder for our State to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I do not believe we went far enough in the budget. Electric vehicles cannot be the primary solution to the challenge we face. The OECD report released just two weeks ago stated that with regard to our transport emissions policy, we are off track and we are not doing enough to bring about system change. Only system change can deliver the reductions in emissions that we have set ourselves as a target. System change sounds idealistic and unattainable but as somebody who is passionate about transport planning and urbanism, I strongly believe it is very doable and not at all as difficult as many people in this House believe. I encourage the Minister, in all his future endeavours, to embrace system change for the benefit of our communities, our economy, our country and our environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_664">I welcome this Finance Bill. In the limited time I have, I will deal with one or two items. I welcome the broad thrust of the measures that have been put in place to ensure people can deal with their energy costs. I welcome the living city initiative from the Minister for Finance. It is hugely important to us in Limerick. The Minister has agreed to ensure security for the scheme and it is now extended up to December 2027. It was due to finish this year. That is five years of certainty for the scheme. The write-off can now be over seven years rather than ten and the relief can be carried forward from year to year. That is hugely important, along with the Croí Cónaithe scheme, which will have a huge benefit for the rejuvenation of Limerick city.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> I also welcome the measures around pre-letting expenses for landlords. I just want to put that in context. I also welcome the certainty for tenants. Some 86% of all our landlords have one or two properties. They are leaving the sector and we have to ask why that is. We need them to stay in the sector. I hope the Government will look at this in the round and give serious consideration to what can be done to ensure these small landlords stay in the sector. They are part of the system. As I have said many times, there are rogue landlords and rogue tenants but there are also decent landlords and decent tenants. What we want is a system where there is a balance. I ask the Government to look at this in the round and to find out why small landlords are leaving the sector so we can give security to both the tenant and the landlord.</p>

          <p eId="para_666">With 200 pages to cover in two minutes, I do not think the Minister can expect an in-depth analysis of the budget from me, unfortunately. It is very much a cost-of-living budget and this Bill underpins that. It was a response to an unprecedented level of crisis. Despite what Deputies across the House have asserted, I will reassert that this is progressive. It is the third such budget passed by this Government. The impact of the three budgets considered together is also progressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_667"> I will quickly acknowledge the changes made in it in the benefit-in-kind treatment of cargo bikes, which Deputy Leddin referenced. The Acting Chairman seemed unsure what a cargo bike is. I have had one for six years in Waterford. It has been a great workhorse for the family. If I can get it up Gallwey's Hill in Tramore, I think it would be suitable for Tipperary town or Clonmel as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> There are changes to the taxation rules for traditional instruments. There is nothing quite like hearing the uilleann pipes played well. There is nothing quite like hearing them played badly either. I have somebody learning to play the violin at home. If he decides to take up the uilleann pipes, I will be holding the Minister personally responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> In my remaining few seconds I will focus on the 50% limitation on the amount of land that can be used when establishing a solar farm without losing capital gains tax retirement relief or agricultural relief from capital acquisitions tax. That should be looked at again. I have read the Minister's response to Deputy Richmond's parliamentary question on this matter in November 2021. I accept what he is saying about wanting to keep agricultural land active as we hand it over from one generation to another. However, that misses the fact that these farms can still have an agricultural use through running sheep underneath the solar panels. They can also have a biodiversity pay-off with wildflower meadows etc. It is something we should look at in order to activate as much land as we possibly can for the use of solar farms.</p>

          <p eId="para_670">Workers and families face a cost-of-living crisis that the Government has failed to respond to adequately, a reality that will become clearer in the winter months ahead. I feel like an extra in "Game of Thrones" from repeating this but the reality is that for many workers and families, winter is coming. They simply do not know how they are going to get through this winter.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> This Bill includes several so-called climate-related measures, including an increase in carbon tax on petrol and diesel. Petrol prices have increased and diesel prices have increased. The Government states that the cause of this is outside of its control and that international factors are contributing to the increase in petrol and diesel. We are not disputing this. It is how the Government responds and the measures it takes to tackle the cost-of-living crisis that are open to criticism. Carbon Taxes are a Government policy. Introducing carbon taxes is not a reaction to international conflicts; it is a Government decision. Taking what we know about the price of petrol and diesel rising and workers and families being pushed to the pin of their collars, the Government decided to increase the cost of petrol and diesel by introducing carbon taxes. Sinn Féin would not have penalised households with further tax hikes for heating their homes or running their cars. Instead, we would have focused on the alternatives that people need to move towards in a low-carbon economy, such as delivering on retrofits that are affordable and accessible. Carbon tax, lauded as an incentive for people to reduce carbon emissions, fails to recognise that most of those impacted have no credible alternative to their current car or heating system. The carbon tax is simply a charge for them going about their daily business.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> The housing crisis is still the biggest issue facing people in my constituency. Ordinary workers and families are locked out of the housing market. Rents are through the roof in my area. There are thousands of workers and families on never-ending waiting lists for public homes. Homelessness and child homelessness is at an all-time high. One of the things that really galls people in my area is seeing vacant homes on a daily basis. These are homes that have been empty for long periods of time. These vacant homes, which could become a home for a family, are being left empty and idle. Sinn Féin has called for a vacant homes tax for years in the face of Government opposition. In fairness, this Finance Bill introduces one, but it excludes derelict properties and the rate being applied for long-term vacancy calls into question how effective it will be in putting vacant housing back into use for workers and families. Again, the Government's measures have failed to address this problem.</p>

        <speech by="#ThomasPringle" eId="spk_289">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_673">I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity to speak on this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">It struck me while reading this legislation that despite Ireland being ranked as one of the wealthiest countries in the world, with a relatively strong economy, this is in no way reflected on the ground in our cities, towns or rural communities. When I make my way to work in the morning, whether it be to Leinster House or my constituency office in Killybegs, I see no indications of living in a wealthy country or even a functioning one. A functioning country looks after its citizens. A functioning country does not leave its citizens cold, hungry or struggling to make ends meet. It does not leave them abandoned in tents and crumbling houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> This Government has failed its citizens time and time again and one only has to step outside this Chamber to see it. Every local closure, every tent and every single one of the 3,071 homeless children, is a stark and daily reminder of the failures of this State. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party have had an opportunity here to do something and I believe they failed yet again.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> I see nothing of substance in this Bill. There is nothing but temporary scheme after temporary scheme, putting a plaster on a bullet wound. It does nothing to address the systemic change this country desperately needs but is temporarily covering up and facilitating the issues we are experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> Section 88, for example, introduces the temporary business energy support scheme. On the surface, this scheme is welcome for small businesses that need urgent assistance with energy bills but unfortunately, this has come far too late. I have been contacted by a shop owner in my constituency of Donegal who has seen an incredible 118.8% increase in their energy bill, working out at an additional cost of €160,000 per year. When factoring in the increased costs in packaging and insurance, they were looking at a reduction of approximately €220,000 per year in their bottom line. This is completely unsustainable and without a doubt will force the closure of a number of local businesses in my town, throughout my constituency, and throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> The TBESS introduced in this Bill is too little too late. I put it to the Minister that it is not enough to help businesses in our rural communities get by this winter. It will however, go a long way to help big businesses and tech companies pay their bills, which will obviously be significantly higher. That data centres, which currently account for 14% of Ireland’s electricity usage, could be eligible for this scheme is outrageous. It is predicted that they will account for about 28% of Ireland’s electricity usage within the next ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> Temporary schemes, such as the TBESS and the help-to-buy scheme introduced and extended in this Bill, will only serve the system that is already failing the people of this country and will do nothing to address the energy crisis or the housing crisis that this Government is forcing its citizens to face alone. We need targeted supports that will directly assist the people who need it most. We need to start building more affordable homes and create incentives for landlords to prioritise long-term rentals by increasing taxation on short-term rentals such as Airbnb, and by giving them a <i>quid pro quo</i> for long-term rentals, perhaps by making them tax free of something like that.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> With regard to mica, I do not see why we cannot tax the profits of the concrete industry rather than having the defective concrete blocks levy, which the Minister has now changed to 5%. This will do little to help with funding the mica redress scheme but will drive up exponentially the cost of building during a housing crisis. Where does the Government expect these families to live while their houses are being demolished and rebuilt? Unless the Government is planning to take over Airbnb, there is simply nowhere for these people to go in Donegal.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> All in all, this Bill does nothing for most in this country. I am thinking particularly of student nurses, most of whom are just waiting for the day they get their nursing degree, leave this country and never come back. I was in contact today with a second-year student nurse from Donegal who is studying in Trinity. She can no longer afford to travel home to see her family due to high fuel costs and very high Dublin rent. She works extremely long days and has very little in the way of a life outside of her work. She is struggling with knee pain and says that most of her fellow student nurses struggle with back pain. I must stress that these are young people in their early 20s. She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_682">If this was any other workplace, that would be enough to bring a problem of this extent to the eyes of our Government, which is supposedly looking out for the good of this country. I have yet to have a conversation with another student who isn't planning on leaving after college to work elsewhere. Nursing is a profession built off of caring for people, yet we students do not feel cared for. We feel hurt, and betrayed and we are exhausted. We do not deserve this, the nurses before us did not deserve this and the nurses coming after us do not deserve this. There needs to be a change in how student nurses are accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> I reiterate the point that Ireland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and if we choose not to help the people who need it, it is a choice. It is not because we could not if we wanted to, it is a choice that we make every day.</p>

        <speech by="#MarianHarkinIND" eId="spk_290">
          <from>Deputy Marian Harkin<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T19:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_684">While the budget sets out the fiscal parameters for next year, it is much more than that. It also provides the framework that finances the delivery of Government policy. This is what I want to focus on in my short contribution, namely, how this budget shaped the delivery of Government policy. Given that my time is limited, I will concentrate on the impact of this budget on people with disabilities and on families affected by disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> Internationally, Ireland is seen as one of the better countries when it comes to the distributional impacts of our budgets. If we strip out all government support and look at just wages income, Ireland is quite high on the inequality spectrum. When we factor in our social welfare and Government supports, our levels of inequality diminish. A central question for me in any budget, and this budget in particular, is whether this budget continued with that trend. When one takes the once-off payments into consideration and looks at the budget in the microcosm of this one year, the answer is largely, "Yes". Every budget, however, must be assessed in context. The context is that this year's budget builds on last year's budget, and crucially, it provides the foundation for next year's budget. Once-off payments are not part of that foundation, however. While they are most welcome and badly needed, they are temporary. The tax changes that will benefit the better off more than those on lower incomes are locked in but the once-off measures that provide the safety net needed by many families and individuals will be long gone by next summer. That is not progressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_686"> With regard to disability, the ESRI has conducted an analysis of the impact on disability budgeting. The ESRI findings are clear. Compared to inflation-proofed 2022 policies, households affected by disability will be slightly worse off in 2023. That is the finding of the ESRI. This includes the once-off payments. When those payments end, the picture will be grimmer. Those are the findings from the ESRI. It is important also to state that the number of households affected by disability has grown by 50% since 2007. More families are negatively impacted. This does not take into consideration the cost of disability, which as the Minister will be aware, is hugely significant. The Minister's own report in 2021 found that the additional cost of disability ranged from €9,000 to €12,500 per annum. I note that estimate was made before the current spike in the cost of energy and the runaway inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> Staying with the issues for people who have a disability, in an important point raised by one or two colleagues, when people with a disability reach the pension age, they automatically go onto the old age pension and they will be excluded from the €500 payment. The disability remains, in fact a disability often worsens as people get older, but yet they cannot access this once-off payment. The Minister should try to see if he can find a way to change this. Given that it is a once-off payment, the cost would not be that significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_688"> In the same arena, I just want to say a few words about family carers. Some aspects of this budget were good and one really positive aspect was that most family carers, not just those on carer's allowance, could access the once-off payment. Yet, carer's allowance is still means tested and is still not a qualifying payment for fuel allowance. Those two changes would make a huge difference.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I have two small final points to make. For third level students, the €1,000 rebate is not available to graduate entry students, for example, if a student is studying medicine. The Minister will be aware these students are already paying the full fees. At the very least they should be able to avail of this rebate. We need to train as many doctors as possible. Is there any way that the Minister could look at this?</p>
          <p eId="para_690">Finally, many people are now really interested in renovating old or derelict homes. Croí Conaithe is a good scheme, especially since its extension to rural areas, but it is crucial that local authorities are adequately resourced in terms of finance and personnel to support the scheme.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Connolly<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T19:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_691">I thank the Minister for remaining for the whole length of the debate. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the amount of work that has gone into a Finance Bill that runs to 93 sections and approximately 215 pages. I recognise that some good steps have been taken in relation to the temporary business energy support scheme, which needs to be closely monitored, the extension of the 9% VAT for gas and electricity and the welcome move to reduce VAT on newspapers to zero, as well as many other good things in relation to once-off payments.</p>
          <p eId="para_692"> However, notwithstanding that there has been a boast of €11 billion, I have been in the Dáil since 2016 and have been desperately waiting, campaigning and working for a transformative budget, one which recognises that we can never go back. Covid told us that, as did climate change and biodiversity. I have read some of the speeches made on biodiversity on the Government side. They are wonderful and acknowledge the seriousness of it. That is not captured at all in the budget. That is my difficulty with once-off payments. The Government had to give those payments, given rising energy costs and the spiral we are caught in, but at no stage since I came in in 2016 have I seen transformative change. I have seen the Minister's words to the effect that the planet is burning, or perhaps it was his colleague. That was welcome in the speech last year but was not repeated this year, though the planet is burning even more. We need transformative change; there is no going on in the same way. When we pass a budget like this with piecemeal measures, some of which are very welcome, it is ignoring the elephant in the room, which is that we have to change whether we like it or not. </p>
          <p eId="para_693"> I can pick out anything but will pick out the help-to-buy scheme. I have raised it many times. I have a file here. I have read all the reports. The Minister has in section 5 extended it for another two years. He has not taken on any of the recommendations in the Mazars report. If it captures anything, it captures the language used in relation to change and then there is absolutely no change. That is what has happened here. We have had report after report. It was introduced and mentioned in 2016 and came into the budget via the Finance Act in operation in 2017. In each budget it has been extended. The estimated cost, originally, as the Minister knows much better than I, was €40 million. It looks like it will cost over €1 billion by next year. The Minister can tell me if I am wrong about the figures but I have looked at and read all of the reports.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> I thank the Parliamentary Budget Office, which did a brilliant report. I would love to know what the contracting out of reports costs us and what the Parliamentary Budget Office gets to do its very good reports. Key messages are:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_695">By the end of 2021, the estimated total cost of approved HTB claims was €559.7 million, [at that stage it was] 43% above cost estimates. ... A third of recipients did not need HTB to meet the 10% deposit ... and could instead use the scheme to create larger deposits. This could be described as “deadweight loss”, which means activity which would have taken place [anyway] without the tax incentive.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">There is much more in that but I will go to the most recent report. I would love if the Minister had the cost of it for me.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> I will refer to the executive summary of the Mazars report, though I have read more than that. It is interesting that part of the logic for introducing this scheme was that the Central Bank was so strict in the criteria it laid down for what one could borrow. It was to step into the vacuum caused by the prudence of the Central Bank. Now we will face the situation in January where the Central Bank has altered its rules and we can borrow up to four times a salary to buy a house that none of us can afford really. It does not make sense that we persist with the scheme for another two years at a time when the Central Bank says we can borrow away. </p>

          <p eId="para_701">I see. Maybe the Minister could address the point I am making, which is that the Central Bank at that time was extremely prudent and this was one of the main justifications for this scheme. The Central Bank no longer advises prudence but says one can borrow up to four times, yet we are extending this. When we are extending it, we are saying it had "two key objectives", namely, "to increase supply" and "to improve affordability". It did neither, mind you. The summary states "The rationale for introducing [the] scheme [was] that [it] would boost demand", some latent demand that was not spelled out. It goes on to give the finding that "The scheme promotes demand for new housing in a market where the problems that exist are unequivocally supply constraints." It continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_702">There were also concerns expressed when it was introduced that it can be difficult to remove schemes such as this once they have become [embedded]. This has clearly been the case [because it has] been extended a number of times ... This was not foreseen in appraisals of the scheme previously undertaken. </p>
          <p eId="para_703">We do not have financial expertise here and have to use whatever wit we have to read these reports. Here we have a complete failure to analyse this scheme at the time and make proper predictions. The summary continues, "Expenditure on the scheme has far surpassed projected values and is rising rapidly." As I understand, it would be over €1 billion at the extension time, and possibly more. The report states, "This trend appears likely to continue and may accelerate." It is extremely relevant that it states "The scheme is poorly targeted with respect to incomes, location, house prices and other socioeconomic factors ... it has socially regressive impacts, there is a considerable deadweight associated with the expenditure, and it is poorly aligned with spatial policy." The Green Party might listen to that point of being "poorly aligned with spatial policy'" and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> I am grateful for the time I have had that allowed me to do that because I have wanted to do it for some time. I advise all Deputies to read it. The summary continues:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_705">The issues that were to be addressed, including the shortage of housing output and affordability ... have intensified since it was introduced with increasing deficits and higher prices [and so on]. ... The research indicates that many of the risks that were perceived... have not come to pass. </p>
          <p eId="para_706">The conclusion states, "There are weaknesses in the Help to Buy Scheme and it cannot be concluded that it is sufficiently efficient to represent good value for money." That is some understatement, after that report. After reading out all of that, that is the strongest that Mazars can come up with. The final part I will read out states, "A rational approach would not design the scheme as it currently exists".</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> That is the report on the help-to-buy scheme that the Minister held onto for a few months. He has not told us its cost. He published it on the day of the budget when we had little chance to read it. I tried to read it quickly that day and have read it since. All the reports to date have said it was poorly targeted. The jury is out on whether it led to an increase in prices but that is because the market was rising so much anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> That is one scheme this Bill is copper-fastening for another two years without any logic behind it except it is now too big to fail, a phrase which resonates with me from the banks. The scheme is now embedded. It is not a rational or good one but it is embedded in Government policies. There is the key: Government policy, which is to feed the market at all times rather than to provide public housing on public land. We have this help-to-buy scheme, HAP, RAS, long-term leasing and all the other schemes and all the time in Galway, we have a task force that has sat for three years and should be abandoned. I was thrilled when it came to look at the housing crisis in Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">We have no overall vision and no city architect. We have lands in the docks that are being dealt with by a company to maximise the price for the sale of lands there for housing that should be public housing on public land. It is the exact same across the city and a mantra that this is good.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> I will finish. I will not go over my time. I have a great difficulty with the cognitive dissonance that happens all the time between something that is said and something that is not done.</p>

          <p eId="para_711">I thank all Deputies who participated in what has been a very lengthy and substantial debate reflecting the importance of the Finance Bill, which is central to the management of our economy and which responds to the many pressing needs in our society of which I and the Government are so well aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_712"> In the time available to me I will respond to the five key themes that have been raised with me: the role of fairness; the role of middle income workers; the concrete levy; one-off measures and where we are with regard to taxation and the energy sector. As I respond to each of these themes, I want to frame where the budget stands overall. It is important, as some Deputies on the Government side indicated, that we make the case for the fact that our country and economy can bring forward an €11 billion budget without having to borrow for it so soon after dealing with the extraordinary cost of Covid and the impact that pandemic had on our country.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> I remember in the early days of bringing in the first set of economic supports that were needed to help our country deal with the impact of Covid in 2020. At that time in the debate the question that I had to face again and again was whether austerity was coming. Analysts, the media and the Opposition made the case that in the aftermath of Covid the first response would be the need for austerity. I cannot predict what the future will bring or the circumstances that could yet happen as a result of what this war may make our economy and that of Europe confront. What I can say is that so soon after having to deal with the need to support our country in dealing with a pandemic, to be able to bring forward a €11 billion budget and respond to the array of needs that our country has at a time when prices are going up so sharply does demonstrate the need to be careful with public finances and does demonstrate the value of there being resilience within our economy. The key thing that has enabled us to do that is that at a time when corporate tax receipts went up again, from approximately €11 billion in 2020 to over probably €20 billion this year, the Government did not use those additional revenues to fund permanent increases in expenditure or taxation. When it comes to spending, there was not a day that I walked into the Dáil Chamber that I was not called on to do that but we did not do that. What the Government did was that we used the increase in corporate tax revenue to fund the emergency supports that we needed to deal with the impact of Covid. Those supports were then withdrawn as the impact of Covid on our society withdrew. That led to our country having a surplus, which is a rare thing across Europe at the moment, and that will allow us to fund what we need to do now.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> That leads on to some of the criticisms that have been made of the budget, first, that it is not fair. The ESRI’s analysis and the distributional analysis of the Department of Finance on budget day showed clearly, objectively and based on evidence that those who have the least got the most in this budget as a combination of the taxation changes and particularly the social welfare changes that were brought in by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, and the one-off measures that have been brought in by various Departments mean that those on the lowest income and those who are most vulnerable received the most support from this budget. This is a fair budget and a progressive budget and is shown to be in any independent analysis since.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> The second theme was continued criticism on the taxation changes brought in. It makes me wonder what the Opposition has against someone earning around €40,000. What is it that drives the tone that the Opposition has to changes in taxation when it is continually against any kind of changes that mean someone earning €40,000 or €45,000, a Garda or a plumber or someone working in any part of our economy who sees their wages go above €38,000, €39,000 or €40,000 and that they do not deserve recognition in this budget? Because they do. They absolutely do. All those workers who make such a critical contribution to our country, economy and society need recognition at a time when the cost of living is going up. I heard the point made that a person earning €140,000 gets a gain but nowhere in that analysis was it said that someone earning €140,000 is getting the same cash gain in the budget as someone who is earning €40,000 which means that the percentage gain to someone earning €40,000 is more than someone earning €140,000. This is a budget that has a particular focus in our tax code and in our tax changes on those on a middle income. I do not believe it is appropriate, and it is something that I have wanted to change in budget after budget, that someone who is on a normal average wage in Ireland is already on the higher rate of income tax. I believe that is worthy of change. It is what this budget does. The Opposition, particularly Sinn Féin, appears to be against this at every corner.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> I refer to the changes I made in the concrete levy. Of course I was aware of the debate that happened in the aftermath of budget day. If happens with every budget. There is always a reaction to a particular measure, some of which deserves a response and some of which does not. Those who are against the specifics of a concrete levy are for the generality of spending billions of euro all the time. I remember being in this Chamber over many years and hearing debates on the need to spend more money to help those who need help; the poor families and poor property owners who have been afflicted by mica. Those making the case for more to be spent are against any effort to look at how it could be funded. What is as dangerous as any trade offs that can be created by a specific measure such as this is the idea that our country can spend billions of euro in the future and we need never find a way by which some of that cost can be funded. On the trade offs behind this measure and the impact it could have on construction costs are 0.2% to 0.3% for a house and 0.15% and 0.2% for an apartment. That is the actual change that it could deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> That leads to the fourth area. Some of the debate I heard particularly from Independent TDs and the Social Democrats suggested that all was well and good but we should really exclude the one-off measures when evaluating the budget. I want to tease out that logic. They say that first, we should exclude €4 billion from evaluating the budget. Second, a point made most clearly by the Independents at the end of the debate, they say that in the analysis for next year we should either say that the one-off measures should be made permanent, the very thing the think tanks and the independent institutes they quote warn us against doing - they say they should be temporary and appropriate to where the economy is at any time - or are they suggesting we do not do this at all?</p>
          <p eId="para_718">What is the argument they are making? Is it to exclude €4 billion from a budget or make the measures permanent, which is the very thing the bodies they quote would warn against?</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> On the charge that the State is in some way profiting from the change in energy prices, which charge has been made by the Rural Independent Deputies, in particular, it is the case that as the price of something goes up, the VAT we collect on it does too; however, the other part of the story, which the Deputies did not go into, is that as the citizens to whom they referred spend less in our shops and economy, we collect less VAT.</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_746">— the 20 per cent public transport fare reduction to be extended to commercial bus operators;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_747">— the timeline for the delivery of the Connecting Ireland Rural Mobility Plan to be accelerated;</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_749">— the establishment of a dedicated public transport policing unit;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_750">— the Public Transport Accessibility Retrofit Programme budget to be increased, to ensure accessibility at all train stations, platforms and bus stops;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_751">— the National Transport Authority (NTA) to exercise their regulatory powers to ensure punctuality, reliability and customer service standards are met by all public transport providers;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_752">— the Minister for Transport to mandate the NTA to ensure that the current contractual agreement between the NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland will not be extended beyond its current contractual timeframe, and that the 10 per cent of previously privatised services would be brought back under public or State-owned control; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_753">— the extension of the Short Hop Zones, in order to reduce the cost of travel for commuters currently excluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">Expanding our public transport network across the State can deliver environmental, social and economic benefits to all regions. Unfortunately, due to decades of neglect by successive Governments, large swaths remain without quality public transport links, while some regions remain entirely cut off from our rail network. People in rural Ireland are punished by a punitive carbon tax for having to use their car, despite the Government putting no alternatives in place for them. The rail network we have today is a skeleton of what we had 100 years ago. This has resulted in communities being isolated and has contributed to the stagnation of economic growth in some regions. Sinn Féin wants to change this. We want to see an accessible, affordable, reliable all-Ireland transport system that enables the movement of people and goods locally, regionally and nationally at the least environmental, social and financial cost. That is at the heart of our motion tonight. This plan could and should be implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_755"> The motion contains a number of measures that I have raised with the Minister before and all of which are contained in our alternative budget, which we believe should be acted on. We want to see the 20% public transport fare reduction made permanent, not just extended until the end of next year, and extended to commercial bus operators. The latter were responsible for in the region of 30.5 million trips in 2019. They fill a gap that the State has left open. They provide a very important service.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> We want to see the timeline for the delivery of the Connecting Ireland rural bus plan accelerated. I have raised this with the Minister on numerous occasions. I am referring to the €5 million allocated in 2022 and to a €56 million plan that would deliver significantly for communities if invested in and rolled out on time. Sinn Féin would invest €25 million in that plan next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> We want to see funding allocated to kick-start the delivery of the western rail corridor project and expedite the delivery of the Navan rail line. Between these two important regional projects, in the region of 2.375 million passenger journeys could be made every year, taking people out of their cars and putting them on public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> We want to see a dedicated public transport and policing unit established. We have had much discussion on this topic. It has included backbenchers and various Ministers and Ministers of State but we have had no progress on it. We are aware that anti-social behaviour and crime on public transport are increasing, putting workers, including drivers, and passengers at risk. We know the unit would be a deterrent. According to research carried out by Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, just 15% of women in Dublin felt safe on a train and just 24%, or almost one in four, felt safe on the bus network. This should be a genuine concern. It needs to be addressed. The establishment of a dedicated public transport policing unit, as called for by several unions, should be part of the solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> We want to see the public transport accessibility retrofit programme budget increased year on year to bring it, in five years, to the €137.5 million that is said to be needed to deliver a fully accessible public transport network with buses, coaches, light and heavy rail, and, importantly, stops, stations and platforms. That needs to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> We want the short-hop zones extended to reduce the cost of travel for commuters who are currently excluded. My colleague, Deputy Munster, has been particularly vocal about the anomaly that exists between Balbriggan, Gormanston, Laytown and Drogheda. This is but one of several examples in Meath, Louth, Kildare and Wicklow. These need to be addressed. Sinn Féin would do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> My last point, on which some of my colleagues will pick up, is that we need to see the Fine Gael agenda to privatise 10% of Dublin Bus routes to be scrapped and reversed. The Go-Ahead experiment has failed miserably; it needs to be reversed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pearse Doherty<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T20:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_762">I thank Deputy O'Rourke for introducing this motion. I call on all Deputies to support it. The lack of reliable public transport in the north west means that households have fewer options for travel and are more dependent on their cars in order to access basic services and commute to and from work and school. This is even more stark now as the cost of running a car has shot up. This reflects the real cost of Government underinvestment in the north west, including my county, Donegal. The people of the north west need to see a public transport system that delivers for our communities, one that is affordable and reliable.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">This is a chance to make inroads towards environmental sustainability. That is why the Connecting Ireland plan must be accelerated. In Sinn Féin's alternative budget, we proposed an additional €195 million for the public transport system in the next year: to reduce fares, invest in new rail infrastructure, accelerate the roll-out of rural bus services and to ensure citizens have the access they deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> There are issues specific to the north west and to Donegal that must be addressed. Due to the lack of investment, our people are more reliant on commercial bus operators to travel, yet the 20% fare reduction that came into effect in April does not apply to commercial operators, an oversight that is clearly unfair. Sinn Féin has been calling on the Government to extend the fare reduction to commercial operators to ensure that citizens in Donegal benefit equally.</p>
          <p eId="para_765"> When it comes to students, we see the Government has introduced a 50% discount to young adults and student holders of Leap cards, but the discount does not apply to young people in Donegal who study or work in Derry or Belfast who go to Queens or to Coleraine, Jordanstown, Magee or elsewhere in the North. They are being discriminated against by the Government. The Government will tell us that the cross-Border trips cannot be included, yet a senior citizen going to Belfast is able to avail of the free travel pass. The Government must get its act together. This can be resolved by extending the scheme to commercial operators that provide routes to destinations in the North, and it should be done as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> One of the first questions I was asked by a fellow Senator when I was elected to the Seanad many years ago was if I got the train up. I told him that the last time a train rolled out of Donegal was in the early 1960s. That must be addressed, especially in light of the climate emergency. The new all-island strategic rail review that is currently under way must have the north west at its centre. Extending access to rail services in Donegal is crucial to empowering communities and to unlocking the potential for the people of the north west.</p>

          <p eId="para_767">Accessible, reliable, affordable and safe travel is what commuters want and need in north Kildare. Instead, we have workers from Prosperous and Clane receiving late warnings from work, with one constituent receiving a final late warning. Parents must take time off work to get their children to Maynooth University for lectures or laboratory work. Mothers - it is always mothers - in Straffan and Celbridge - say they are worried that they will have to give up work because there is no place on the school bus. Even after all the free places were announced, it turned out there were no bus places for their children at all. Commuters are either left on the side of the road in Leixlip or Maynooth when the bus grinds past full, or else it does not turn up at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> A few weeks ago, I raised public transport with the Minister for Transport at the climate committee. I also discussed a Topical Issue with the Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, a few weeks ago. I raised the issue at the Joint Committee on Gender Equality. I also raised it with the Taoiseach again this morning. The reason for that is because public transport affects all aspects of our lives: how we get to work, how we get to school and how we get to health appointments. It affects people's job opportunities. It also affects every Department, yet there is no overall vision of how the Departments should work together to make people's lives easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> We had youth leaders from across the State at a climate committee meeting last Friday in the Seanad. All of them mentioned the lack of public transport in their area. I asked them if they intended to buy a car in the next ten years or if they thought they would need a car. None of them said they would want a car, but that is not the way it goes if public transport is not up to the job. In contrast, our plan would make public transport the no-brainer option because it would make public transport accessible, affordable, reliable and safe. We simply cannot depend on the private sector to deliver a public transport system. We are in a climate emergency and the State must step up. Public transport is where it is at.</p>

          <p eId="para_770">Is léir go bhfuil an-dúil ag daoine ina bheith ag úsáid iompair phoiblí ach caithfidh an t-infheistiú a bheith ann chun gur féidir le daoine a bheith ag súil leis go rithfidh seirbhísí in am agus go mbeidh na feithiclí sábháilte agus glan.</p>
          <p eId="para_771"> I commend the work my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, has done in this area. The motion is testament to the ambition that this party has for the public transport investment that is necessary for recruitment and the scale that is there. People will take public transport. They will choose it over the car if they are confident that it is reliable, safe, clean, comfortable; that it gets them where they need to go, and that it serves their community in the way that is necessary. That is not just what people say; that is the reality, and it is what we have seen on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> In Cork in recent years, we have seen an expansion of the public transport system in a number of localities. Where we put in the routes and services people will use them, provided they are of an adequate quality. Bus Éireann has expanded significantly in Cork. At this point, however, it does not have anywhere near the staff capacity needed to meet the objectives that are being set out for it in terms of BusConnects and the additional routes. Without additional recruitment, the State could end up looking at private contractors and tenders and all the kind of messing that we have seen in other places that we do not want to see in Cork. There is no reason that there should not be the required recruitment in Bus Éireann. It can and should happen, provided the Minister signs off on it. Bus Éireann should be running the additional routes and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> I also urge the Minister of State and the NTA to be flexible and to engage meaningfully with local communities on BusConnects. I believe it can be a success, but in order for that to happen it must bring communities with it. It must make clear the benefits that can accrue and come to reasonable accommodations with communities. I urge that would happen, and it can be successful provided that is done.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> The final point I want to make relates to school transport. It is the no-brainer to end all no-brainers. It reduces traffic at the busiest times. It also reduces emissions, and it reduces costs for parents. Whatever about what happened this year - there was good and bad in it in terms of costs, but the planning was inadequate - there needs to be a long-term objective of providing free school transport for everyone that wants a place. That is not just some kind of frivolous throwaway commitment. It makes financial, environmental and transport sense in the long run. That should be the objective. That is our objective, and it should be the objective of the Minister of State as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_775">I thank Deputy O'Rourke for the opportunity to speak on public transport. In my area we have seen the privatisation of some of our bus routes. Go-Ahead operates the 76, the 18, the L51 and the L52 routes in Clondalkin, Palmerstown and Lucan. This has been an abject failure. As we approach Hallowe'en, we have ghost buses in our area. Buses that are on the schedule mysteriously disappear and leave passengers stranded. These buses are important for getting people to work and children to school. The 76 is also the only bus in my area that goes to Tallaght Hospital. Someone contacted me tonight on Facebook to say they have been missing appointments because the bus has not been turning up.</p>
          <p eId="para_776"> The privatisation of public transport has failed, and it must be reversed. While there have been some improvements from Dublin Bus with the BusConnects programme, it still has its problems. Residents in Dodsborough in Lucan, for example, feel abandoned. Other residents in my area watch helplessly as full bus after full bus passes them by, leaving them stranded. There also seems to be a problem at peak times, as there do not seem to be enough buses. Since the change from the 40 to the G2, one young woman says she has been left in town for more than 40 minutes waiting on a bus at peak times. That did not happen previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_777"> I am all in favour of encouraging people out of the car and onto public transport, but there needs to be a just transition. We have an unjust situation in Liffey Valley shopping centre, where car parking charges are being imposed on workers. Charges of more than €600 per year are being placed on workers just to go to work. Liffey Valley is not served by the Luas or train and the bus routes do not cater for everyone. The proper public transport infrastructure is not in place to warrant these car parking charges. Shopping centres usually have a Santa Claus visit in the run-up to Christmas. Liffey Valley has the Grinch, and much like the Grinch, these policies are green too. I have stood on the picket line in solidarity with workers in recent weeks. So far, there has been no direct engagement between management and the staff or their unions. This needs to happen. I publicly call on Liffey Valley management to meet with staff and the unions to resolve the problems that they have created.</p>

          <p eId="para_778">Sinn Féin will deliver affordable, reliable and safe public transport. The reason we will do so is that we understand the necessity of affordable and accessible public transport in addressing social exclusion and climate change and to facilitate economic growth, in particular in the regions. That was nowhere more evident than last Saturday when West On Track organised a conference for the delivery of the western rail corridor and the development of the Atlantic economic corridor as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Sixty towns from throughout the region were represented at that conference and there were public representatives from right across the political divide. The western rail corridor has the potential to revitalise these western communities, provide alternative transport options for people and deliver the much-needed regional connectivity. It has been estimated that if the line is reactivated, 575,000 passengers could travel on it each year by 2030. The western rail corridor has become a byword for regional development and investment in the west, and it is a significant source of frustration given the repeated failures to progress the project. For Mayo regional development, it is no longer an option but an urgent necessity. The Minister of State knows this, as does the Minister for Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> As was noted last week, when Jim Fahy interviewed Monsignor Horan in Knock, he asked the priest what all the people were doing there. Monsignor Horan explained that they were building an airport but warned him not to tell the Department of Transport because if people with centralised and institutionalised thinking had had their way, Knock Airport would never have been built. We want the same to be done for the western rail corridor. We want it to be delivered on. It is a modest sum we are talking about and it will be a game changer for the entire region, as I know the Minister of State, coming from the region, understands. When will the all-island rail review be made available to us?</p>

          <p eId="para_781">For public transport to work, it needs to be accessible, affordable and reliable. However, under existing Government policy and the previous Government's policy of privatisation, that simply is not happening. Four years ago, 10% of the Dublin Bus fleet was privatised and handed over to a private operator, Go-Ahead Ireland. Since that time, it has been a disaster. I have stood here in this House many a time, in front of the Minister of State and her departmental colleague, raising the serious issues relating to Go-Ahead, which has left communities completely isolated, abandoned and simply forgotten.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> In Wicklow, three routes were privatised, namely, the 45A, the 185 and the 184. Not a day goes by when somebody is not in touch with me to complain that the bus simply did not show up or was cancelled or that the driver had changed the route, with the passengers on board, because it was running behind schedule and had to make up time. It simply is not working. Yesterday evening, for example, on one of those routes, the 45A, seven buses were cancelled. That was on just one bus route in Wicklow, but it is a daily occurrence. Privatisation simply has not worked; it has failed. I ask the Minister of State and her colleague the Minister for Transport to act now, revoke the licence that was issued to Go-Ahead, take it back under public control and ownership and let Dublin Bus do what it does best, namely, run the bus service that is fit for purpose and will serve the communities it is supposed to serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> Wicklow is also a constituency that has been failed by the extension of the short-hop zone. The short-hop zone goes as far as Kilcoole. I have raised continuously the need to extend it as far as Arklow but the answer I get back from the NTA and the Minister is that it will not be considered because too many people would use it. That is absolutely crazy given people are sitting in their cars on the N11 in congestion. They should be incentivised to use public transport and the trains but, again, the failure of the Government will ensure they are confined to traffic in their cars.</p>

        <speech by="#HildegardeNaughton" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_310">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Deputy Hildegarde Naughton)<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T20:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_784">I am taking this motion on behalf of the Minister for Transport. I thank Deputies for the opportunity to speak to the House about the importance of accessible, affordable and reliable public transport. I am confident we can all agree it is essential that the Government continue to invest in our public transport network and that we are supportive of the Government’s commitment to delivering an accessible, affordable and reliable public transport network throughout the country. While the Government will not oppose the motion and its overall objective is broadly in line with the principles of the Government, it contains some issues that require clarification and they will be highlighted in the ministerial contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_785"> It is a key Government objective to provide all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options and public transport plays a key role in delivering that. To support this objective, in budget 2022, the Department of Transport secured €538 million in funding for public service obligation, PSO, and Local Link services provided by State operators and under contract by the NTA this year. More recently, €563 million has been secured as part of the budget 2023 negotiations for the continuation of these services. To incentivise young people to use public transport, the Minister for Transport secured funding for the introduction of a young adult card, which allows anyone nationwide between the ages of 19 and 23 to avail of a 50% discount on all PSO services and since September, also on participating commercial services. This initiative was recently widened to allow 16- to 18-year-old third level students to apply for the student Leap card in order that they too can avail of the discount. Furthermore, to combat the rising cost of living being experienced throughout the country, the Government introduced fare reductions of 20% on average on PSO services. Funding has been secured in budget 2023 for the continuation of the young adult card on PSO and commercial services, as well as retaining the 20% average fare discount on PSO services. These fare initiatives are making a significant positive difference to people’s lives throughout the country and their continuation in 2023 represents a significant investment by the taxpayer in public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> With regard to short-hop zones, given the current cost-of-living crisis and various pressures on the Exchequer throughout the system, budget 2023 is focused on delivering the maximum benefit for all passengers. Funding was directed, therefore, towards the fare initiatives I outlined rather than any narrow application to specific issues that can arise with some fares at the edges of the current short-hop zones. These issues are acknowledged, however, and the NTA is examining what needs to be done to ensure the distance-based fare outside the short-hop zone is in line with the distance-based fare inside the short-hop zone to ensure the fares will be more equitable. This work is ongoing as part of a national fares review for rail and bus services.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> The Government is committed to providing a comprehensive national transport network that connects our people and places throughout Ireland. For this reason, the Government has an ambitious vision to transform transport services and infrastructure nationwide, with one of the key priorities for public transport being the roll-out of the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan. The House will be aware that Connecting Ireland will significantly increase both the number of routes and the frequency of existing services throughout the country. It aims to enhance existing services and introduce new public transport services. On 19 July, the NTA announced the Connecting Ireland programme’s phase 1 implementation plan, which has delivered a mix of new and enhanced bus services on routes and services serving areas in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Donegal, Clare, Sligo, Kildare, Offaly, Mayo, Laois, Limerick, Tipperary, Louth and Wexford. Over the coming weeks, the NTA plans to implement improvements to levels of service on a further 14 services throughout the State. Implementation of the programme at the pace outlined by the Government and in line with the funding and operational resources available.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> Regarding our rail network, the strategic rail review being undertaken in co-operation with the Department for Infrastructure in Northern Ireland will inform the development of interurban, interregional rail on the island of Ireland over the coming decades. The review will set the type of strategic backdrop to rail investment in our regions and on our mainline network and is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">This review will also consider the potential scope for improved rail services along the various existing or future potential corridors of the network. That scope will include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines. It will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years and will provide a framework to develop a much-improved rail network in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> With regard to the Navan rail line, the NTA's draft transport strategy for the greater Dublin area is recommending the development of a rail link to Navan by 2042. This project will require significant planning and design before construction can commence. As it stands, the draft strategy proposes delivery of the Navan rail line in the latter half of the strategy period between 2031 and 2042.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> With regard to the issue of establishing a dedicated public transport policing unit, as this House will be aware, antisocial behaviour is a broad societal issue we are currently facing to which public transport is not immune. The safety and security of both public transport passengers and staff, including arrangements to deal with antisocial behaviour, are important matters that first and foremost must be managed by every public transport company in conjunction with An Garda Síochána, where appropriate. It is important to note that any decisions regarding the establishment of a transport police unit and the allocation of Garda resources are matters for the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner. That said, the NTA regularly engages with public transport operators on the issue of antisocial behaviour and has established a working group on antisocial behaviour that meets monthly to discuss any developing trends among public transport operators and to share best practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_792"> The Minister for Transport is fully committed to strengthening our public transport offerings and progressively making them accessible for all. This requires a whole-journey approach, which refers to all elements that constitute a journey from the starting point to destination. It also means applying the principles of universal design. As the House will be aware, the Department of Transport and its agencies are progressively making public transport accessible for disabled people by ensuring new infrastructure and services are accessible from the start and by retrofitting older infrastructure and facilities to make them accessible. Accessibility features such as wheelchair accessibility and audiovisual aids are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage. Newer systems such as the Luas are fully accessible, as are all new buses purchased by the NTA.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> The public transport accessibility retrofit programme has increased from an average of €7 million over the past four years to €15.3 million for 2022. This will be used to ensure continued works to improve accessibility at train stations, bus stations and stops. A sum of €18 million has been invested over four years to replace or renovate the lifts at the train stations. All of the major public transport companies consult persons with disabilities, individuals and representative organisations through the companies' disability user groups. The user groups provide a forum for operators to consult and update disability organisations on accessibility proposals and developments and for disability organisations to raise operational and other accessibility issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> With regard to the call for the NTA to exercise its regulatory powers to ensure punctuality, reliability and customer service standards are met by all public transport operators and providers, I would like to clarify that the NTA uses all the contractual and regulatory powers available to it to measure, report on and seek to maintain and improve standards across public service obligation, PSO, transport services. In instances where performance drops, financial penalties are rigorously applied unless the cause of the loss of performance is outside of the control of the operator, for example, high levels of Covid sickness absence. In recent months, all bus operators have faced challenges in maintaining adequate staff numbers to cover all requirements. The NTA has worked collaboratively with all operators to try to mitigate the impact of these staff shortages. However, the summer months were challenging, with performance deductions applied to a number of operators, as per all PSO contracts. In recent weeks, performance standards have improved although there remains a shortage of driving and maintenance staff, which will take some time to resolve fully. With regard to PSO contractual arrangements between the NTA and Go-Ahead Ireland, the current contracts with Go-Ahead are regularly reviewed by the NTA, as with all PSO contracts. Whether tendered or directly awarded, all decisions relating to contract extensions or renewals will be made following a detailed assessment of a number of factors, including the performance of the operator over the duration of the contract in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> On behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, this motion is generally in line with the principles of this Government in terms of prioritising investment in the public transport network. As I outlined, however, some elements of the motion do not properly reflect the progress to date in this area, the work currently underway or the Government's future plans for public transport.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_796">The proposals Sinn Féin have are for a detailed plan for a reliable public transport service. If we want people to use public transport, however, we first need to provide the proper infrastructure. I have raised the issue of bus shelters many times. Borris-in-Ossory and Castletown on the R445 need bus shelters. I raised this issue numerous times with the NTA and the Department. They are also needed at Ballyline, Newtown and Crettyard on the N77. In weather like we had over the past week or so, people have been standing in spilling rain waiting for a bus, which does not entice people onto public transport. It is an issue that needs to be addressed. Funding was approved earlier this year for five bus shelters at Ballybrittas in County Laois, Kilminchy in Portlaoise and two more at Mountrath. Laois County Council is ready to proceed but the NTA needs to engage with the council to get those shelters in place. I spoke to the council again about this no later than this morning. Funding has been approved. The NTA needs to engage with the council. This is fundamental infrastructure. Local authorities do not have the authority to procure and install it. I want the Minister of State to take this back. Under the local government legislation that was brought forward by the Minister at the time, Mr. Phil Hogan, that power was to be devolved down, not just to designate bus stops but actually to put bus shelters in place. It can be devolved down. It needs the Minister with responsibility for local government to act on it. It is too slow and cumbersome when a local authority has to go through the NTA to get a bus stop erected, which the Minister of State will appreciate. It is one of the things we can do.</p>
          <p eId="para_797"> We want to extend the 20% public transport fare reduction, which I welcome, to all commercial bus operators. That is not the case that the moment. This is important on rural and regional routes such as those to and from Laois-Offaly. Many people have to use the private operators, as I have done. People should not be denied the 20% reduction. That needs to be spread out across all providers. We are proposing that the Connecting Ireland scheme is provided with an additional €25 million to deliver the roll-out to rural areas. This will mean a reliable transport service for workers in counties Laois and Offaly. It is needed in the morning and evening to get people to and from work and to connect the smaller towns and villages with larger towns like Tullamore and Portlaoise.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> Finally, we need a safe public transport system. We are calling for the establishment of a dedicated public transport policing unit. A recent report found that 77% of women outside of Dublin felt it was unsafe to use the train. The Portlaoise to Ballybrophy line to Dublin has been identified as having recurring problems. The security guards do not have the powers to arrest. We need gardaí. We need special dedicated Garda units with powers of arrest on those lines to make our public transport safe.</p>

          <p eId="para_799">I commend my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, on bringing forward this motion. Public transport needs to be accessible, reliable and safe for people. Accessibility is certainly one of the issues raised in this motion with regard to the western rail corridor for people living in my region in the west and in the Minister of State's region. It is one of the big factors that could be a game changer for that part of the country. If it were complete, it would revolutionise the whole system across the west and north west to be able to provide public transport in that region.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> A big issue we have, which we come across regularly, is the reliability of bus services, particularly the Bus Éireann service. People have to book online to get on the bus and then, because the bus is booked up, they arrive at a bus stop and wait. The bus comes driving up and they discover there are ten or 20 empty seats, but the bus driver says, "Sorry, those seats are already booked". The bus has to drive on and leave them on the side of the road. That is happening regularly throughout the country. That is a real problem that needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> With regard to the issue of safety, numerous people in my area have contacted me about problems on the train going from Sligo to Dublin. On other train services, especially here in the city of Dublin, there is the whole issue of what is often termed "antisocial behaviour". It is much more serious than that, however. It is not antisocial behaviour. These are actually attacks. It is brutality that is happening to people. We have had issues of bus drivers being attacked. The real problem is we need to accept that if we are going to make public transport one of the main facets of our society, we have to make it safe for people. The only way that can be done is to have a dedicated public transport police service in place throughout the State, but particularly in our urban areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">That needs to happen as a matter of urgency. I note the Minister of State mentioned this in her speech and said it is a matter for the Minister for Justice and the Garda Commissioner. The reality is it is past the stage of considering this now. We need to put that provision in place and do it as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <from>Deputy Johnny Guirke<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_803">I thank my colleague Deputy O'Rourke for bringing this very important motion to the Dáil floor. Our island's public transport system is staffed by tens of thousands of hard-working men and women and I acknowledge that. The 2016 census recorded 13.5% of the population as having a disability. People with a disability or those with mobility challenges all too often face barriers using public transport such as broken lifts in train stations, limited wheelchair spaces or having to give 24 hours' notice to have a ramp in place. We need investment to make sure we have wheelchair access at all train stations, platforms and bus stops. This must be a priority for us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> The transport sector accounted for 17.7% of our greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 and this must fall by 50% over the next eight years from the 2018 baseline if we are to meet our overall reduction target of 51% by 2030. About half of all transport emissions originate from the passenger car fleet, highlighting the urgent need to invest in public transport. In my own county of Meath we have the NX bus service covering Navan and Johnstown. Commuters who rely on these services are fed up to the teeth of the poor services being delivered. Late buses, no-shows, overcrowding, antisocial behaviour and generally poor service are commonplace on these routes. This is causing serious problems for people who rely on these buses and very little is being done to fix it. These ongoing issues, if not fixed, will drive people away from using public transport. Schoolchildren also struggle to get to their destinations as many have been left behind in the issuing of concessionary tickets. Bus Éireann has received more than 50 emails from me but only one has been answered. Mostly it sends automated responses. It is a joke.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> Our motion also calls for the delivery of the Navan rail line. Re-establishing the rail connection to Navan will benefit commuters, businesses, tourism and the environment, ending the commuting nightmare for many, and will take thousands of cars off our roads each day. It has been estimated this line has the potential to facilitate up to 1.8 million passenger journeys per year. The Minister of State needs to come to Navan and meet me and Deputy O'Rourke. We will meet with commuters who cannot wait until 2031 for this project to start. Planning must start today, as we have allowed for in our alternative budget. A Sinn Féin Government would deliver the Navan rail line starting today.</p>

          <from>Deputy Pauline Tully<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T20:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_806">Many people from rural communities such as my own constituency of Cavan-Monaghan who, through necessity, commute to the large urban centres such as Dublin, are heavily reliant on private cars due to the lack of public transport options in rural Ireland. Where they do exist, they can often be very unreliable, leaving commuters stranded in the rain and cold waiting for the next bus, hoping it will not be full. There is an hourly bus service from Cavan to Dublin but the issue is capacity, especially with the evening services. Regularly buses are at capacity when they reach the last stop out of Dublin at Blanchardstown and they have to leave people behind to wait an hour for the next bus, which often is also at capacity. People have told me they sometimes end up getting home two to three hours later than anticipated. There is a clear need for an additional service on that route. There is no proper shelter at that location either.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> People living in more rural areas depend on the Local Link to provide public transport. It can be very sketchy across Cavan and Monaghan. I will acknowledge there are some areas well serviced by it. In my own area of Kilnaleck and Ballyjamesduff there are people constantly looking for a service into the county town. We have two services, one on a Thursday and one on a Saturday. It is not sufficient. Cavan-Monaghan Local Link has applied for resources to activate new routes from those areas but they have not yet been approved by Transport for Ireland. I am hoping they will be approved in the very near future. If affordable, accessible and reliable public transport infrastructure were expanded across the island, it would deliver social and economic benefits to all our cities, town and regions and would also meet our obligations in reducing our carbon emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> These issues are worse still for people with disabilities who face multiple barriers to using public transport such as broken lifts, having to give notice before their journeys so that a ramp is put in place, and limited wheelchair places on buses. For the State to align the public transport system with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, UNCRPD, there is a need to make it universally accessible. To this end, the public transport accessibility retrofit programme budget needs to be increased to ensure accessibility at all train stations, platforms and bus stops. There need to be annual targets for retrofitting of older public transport infrastructure with reports measuring progress against these targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> My colleague Deputy Pearse Doherty referred to a rail system in Donegal and said the last train to leave Donegal was in the early 1960s. The same applies to Cavan. It was probably the same train service that used to go through Cavan and on to Donegal. Those counties are now all left without a train service for that length of time. The Minister of State said the Navan railway line would be extended in 20 years' time. That needs to be addressed in a much shorter period.</p>

          <p eId="para_810">I am delighted to speak on the motion, which has many wonderful and admirable asks which we have all been hearing from our constituents throughout the country, be it the western rail link to Donegal or rural transport in general. One thing I would like to focus on is the issue of security on our transport services. On social media in recent days we have seen an incident that took place on Amiens Street outside Connolly station or at the Amiens Street bus stops at the intersection with the Luas. It is a very busy transport node. There was an incident of what seemed like young men having a running fight. The video is 20 or 30 seconds long. It is another in a long line of videos that are quite disturbing and show a level of violence that would make anyone in the vicinity feel very frightened. I saw one of the videos was shot from a bus. People who were on public transport would have felt paralysed and, if these people had forced their way onto the bus, they would have been in a difficult situation. We have had calls for transport policing and the motion contains a call for a transport policing unit. We need to tease that out. What does it look like? Is this a unit of An Garda Síochána? If transport policing is to be part of the overall solution, it should be part of An Garda Síochána. On the Luas, for example, we have private security operators who are dressed like Robocop, as I would describe it. They do not add overall to a degree of security. They look quite militarised and like they are tooled up and generally I feel they add to feeling unsafe.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> What I would like to see in the first instance all across our transport sector is an increase in ordinary transport workers, be they workers at train stations or inspectors on buses, which we used to have. They were good, well-paid, traditional transport jobs with good conditions. That is something we have seen shrink over the years. We have gone from stations that had staff to making a virtue out of staffless stations with an electronic unit where people can swipe their cards and all that. We need to get back to having staffed stations and transport nodes and having inspectors on buses before we get to the stage of having a tooled-up transport policing unit. Overall that leads to an increase of securitisation in our transport infrastructure when we should be looking at attracting workers to the traditional roles across Irish Rail, Dublin Bus and all our transport operators. Ultimately, if we have a transport policing solution, we will not be able to have security guards on every bus in every town and city in Ireland. It is a deeper problem. It is an easy thing to say we need a transport police and maybe there does have to be a role for An Garda Síochána and some kind of multidepartmental or cross-sectoral approach in terms of security.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> We should start with hiring back staff and having better staff levels, having people working on our platforms who are able to assist those with disabilities when they find themselves, as they all too often do, unable to access trains or to get on buses. Another part of this motion is something my party and many other Opposition parties have called for, which is ensuring people with disabilities are prioritised in our transport system. Buses that are being purchased into our fleets now are required to have proper accessibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">However, I have spoken to wheelchair users who still have difficulties accessing these modern buses. In some cases, their wheelchairs are so big and difficult to manoeuvre that, even if they can get onto a bus, it means that bus is full from another disabled person's point of view. We are getting fleets of buses that may be accessible for many people with disabilities but only for one of them at a time. If someone is waiting further down the line, that bus will drive past. There is much more to be done before we have a truly accessible public transport service.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> Previous contributors spoke about the western rail corridor and the rail link to Donegal. I will speak about something a little closer to home, namely, the MetroLink project. I am delighted the railway order has gone to An Bord Pleanála and is out for public consultation. I have spoken many times about why this project is important and that point has been well made. I want to focus on another element, which is how these big projects are important, not just in and of themselves and not just to meet our climate targets but also in how they impact on the delivery of other projects. In the case of MetroLink - the same thing is played out in other parts of the country - the ramifications of a project that is so long in the pipeline is that other projects, including accessibility measures, transport measures and other things local authorities should be doing, are put on hold indefinitely.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> Such projects include micro-local issues like the Pinnock Hill roundabout in Swords, which has no safe crossing such as a bridge over it like there is on other roundabouts, traffic lights or a pedestrian junction. There is a hole in the bush in the middle of the dual carriageway through which commuters trying to get from Swords village, where they have been left off by the bus, must make their way to get to work in Airside Retail Park. They have to dash across two lanes of traffic to get to the median and the hole in the bush. Coming from the other way, there are school-goers travelling from the Holywell estate, which has more than 2,500 houses and apartments, trying to get to the school on Main Street. Fingal County Council refuses to invest in Pinnock Hill roundabout because it is waiting for MetroLink to be delivered. It does not want to have to rip up infrastructure at a cost of a couple of hundred thousand euro, €1 million or however much it will be because it is waiting for the €1 billion project to come down the stream. Fingallians GAA Club is located a couple of roundabouts up from Pinnock Hill roundabout but it cannot expand its pitch because it is waiting for the distributor road for Swords. I know roads are very unfashionable at the moment but the need for a distributor relief road is part of the long-term planning for Swords. Again, that project cannot proceed until the big MetroLink project is delivered. These projects are important. It is not all about the statement projects on which a Taoiseach, Tánaiste or Minister for Transport will cut the ribbon down the line. They are holding up other, smaller but very important projects that are necessary to deliver accessibility, active travel and good community infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> The issues relating to Go-Ahead Ireland and the privatisation of our transport system, which affect commuters in Dublin, Kildare and north Wicklow, are something we have raised a number of times over recent months. They have been raised countless times by my colleague, Corina Johnston, our representative in Donabate-Portrane. Councillor Robert O'Donoghue, too, has raised the issues with the services in our area. I met with people from Go-Ahead Ireland a couple of weeks ago in Ballymount and expressed to them in person our utter dissatisfaction with the service that is currently being provided. They made their case in regard to staffing issues and all the rest but the fact is there are staff in businesses all over the greater Dublin area who are unable to make it to work on time because this service is failing at such a level.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> As the Minister of State mentioned, the fines are large, they have been applied and the companies are paying them, but they seem to be able to afford to do so. They are not going any way to improving their services. In fact, the services seem to have deteriorated. All across public transport, in State companies, private companies and school transport providers, there is a difficulty in hiring and retaining workers, including drivers. Many issues are at play but one that is a common undercurrent to all of this, in transport, the health service and elsewhere, is that the ability to afford to live in and around Dublin and other major cities - indeed, anywhere in the country - is becoming so difficult because of the price of housing that people are unable to afford to take a job as a bus driver, whether for Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann, Go-Ahead Ireland or any other transport company. That is where we are at this point. What was traditionally a good, secure, well-paid job with good conditions, which enabled people to have a family, take a holiday, enjoy Christmas and run a home, no longer exists as a result of the suppression of wages and conditions. If we really are to improve our public transport system and our transport system in general, we need to value those workers and the jobs they do and pay them accordingly.</p>

          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_818">I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this motion. It is not possible to separate land use from transport planning and we must look over a long horizon to see what the trends are. In the mid-1990s, there was scenario testing for how the greater Dublin area was going to develop. It was intended that there would be a greater concentration of development in the city centre and, further out, there would be balanced regional development. In 1996, Dublin city accounted for 13% of the national population. The combined populations of the Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire areas accounted for 15% of the population, while the combination of Kildare, Meath and Wicklow accounted for 9% of the national total.</p>
          <p eId="para_819"> That combination largely makes up the greater Dublin area and we can see how it has changed if we look at the 2022 figures. Dublin city has reduced its share of the national population from 13% to 11% over those 25 years. Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire make up 16% of the total, up from 15% in 1996, albeit it is now a much larger population. The three outer counties of Meath, Kildare and Wicklow make up 12% of the national population in 2022. That is an increase from 9% in 1996, which is the converse of what was planned for from a transport perspective. This is what has happened following the big investments that were made over that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_820"> We are dealing now with the reality rather than the ideal. The reality is that housing policy is responsible for the change that has occurred. Unfortunately, we are seeing that some of the investments being made do not really recognise that reality. Some of that failure is operational and some is on the design side but largely it is about how we match land use and transportation planning. Major investments have been made in BusConnects, for example, with three spines rolled out so far. The second, the C spine, runs along the N4 and into north Kildare. While that works for some people, it certainly does not work for others. There are a lot of people back in their cars and very frustrated with what has been provided. This is not just a bedding-in issue. It is the situation almost a year after the project was delivered. I reiterate that it works well for some commuters but it is most definitely not working for others. The NTA does not want to hear that.</p>
          <p eId="para_821"> Other speakers referred to the services provided by Go-Ahead Ireland. That company got the contract in Kildare for the first group of Bus Éireann services that were privatised. There has been nothing but complaints since that happened. We have seen people have to change their jobs, be forced back into their cars and miss medical appointments and we have seen students miss examinations. I acknowledge there were problems with all the providers, with fines being issued across the board, but the worst offender by far was Go-Ahead Ireland. While the service was less than perfect before, the unreliability since that company took over has been absolutely disgraceful. The service has improved in Kildare in recent weeks following constant complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">We are nearly afraid to even mention it because it has been a constant problem. It is the same in parts of County Wicklow. Places like Enniskerry and Newtownmountkennedy need to be linked to the larger urban areas like Bray and Dún Laoghaire if public transport is to be viable. If the links do not work, public transport does not work. I do not know what kind of assessment was done in advance of that service being privatised. A capacity review certainly seems to be lacking. I do not know what the NTA was thinking about. From the complaints I have received, I know that it has been a huge source of frustration. It is going to be very difficult for people to ever trust that service. When people go back to using their cars, it is hard to get them on public transport again.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> It was reported last week that 30% of students arriving to UCD from within 6 km are arriving by car. Why might that be? I met with representatives of the Union of Students in Ireland and the welfare officer on the day that report was published in the media, and I specifically sought to talk to them about public transport. One of the key issues raised was the unreliability of bus services, including the number 17 service, which is provided by Go-Ahead. I was told that it is a service that is there in theory, but is so unreliable that students have given up on it or they are taking a much more circuitous route to college, and perhaps driving there. We have got to look at what is not working there. Due to the housing crisis, students are often travelling form further afield to all colleges, so the availability and reliability of public transport has become a key issue. It has even become a welfare issue. While the 20% reduction in fares and an even greater reduction for the under 25s is very welcome, it is not much use if it cannot be used. </p>
          <p eId="para_824"> I return to the C spine issue. When delivering a spine on the BusConnects network, we must get it right before rolling out the next one. We decided to do a survey in north Kildare to see if the complaints we were getting were representative. Some 1,200 people took part in the survey, online and in-person. The in-person aspect was interesting because quite a few people politely refused to take part because they said the bus service no longer met their needs. We submitted the results to the NTA, but I do not believe it has the inclination to change anything, given the reply it sent to me. More than 100 people turned to a public meeting a few weeks ago, and I received dozens of apologies. We would really rather not be doing this, but we have another public meeting planned for the anniversary of the introduction of the C spine, to which the NTA and Dublin Bus have been invited. One of the key issues to be raised is that the peak time services, both morning and evening, need to be expanded. The evening peak ends too early and the morning peak does not start early enough. There are capacity and reliability issues, with people being left at bus stops, real-time information does not reflect the reality, and some buses do not show up at all. The real-time information is provided from Broadstone, the link buses are provided from Phibsborough, and the spine services are provided from Ringsend. They are not talking to each other. They do not match up. The bus stop on Wellington Quay is regarded as unsafe. People are not using the bus services because of that safety issue. There are also other bus stop safety issues. Buses are very overcrowded at peak times, with limited space. The fact that train times are not linked with bus times and are not synchronised makes public transport unattractive. The alternative services that were there previously were meeting requirements, but some of them are not currently. I accept that there are plenty of people that the services work well for, but they have to work well for people in general. We cannot have locations where they do not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_825"> I reiterate the points that have been made in relation to disability access to public transport. There is a real challenge for people, particularly on rail services, where the lifts are frequently out of order. Safety on public transport has to be assured. Otherwise, people will not use it. On the services that are currently provided through the NTA, a desktop exercise is done in relation to the service provision, where previously, the likes of Dublin Bus used to go out once a year and count the number of people who were left at the bus stops. That does not happen now. It is a desktop exercise. Counting the number of tickets does not provide the other information about who is not getting on the bus. There is also a need to look at how many people are getting back in their cars as a consequence of issues with the public transport services provided. I must say that some of the things that I would have expected to be improvements have not been improvements. It is a huge disappointment to someone like me, who is very pro public transport. </p>

          <from>Deputy Bríd Smith<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T21:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_826">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_827">To insert the following after "reduce the cost of travel for commuters currently excluded":</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_828">"— public transport fares to be abolished from the start of 2023, including for commercial bus and rail operators, and investment to ensure free public transport is also fast and frequent".</p>
          <p eId="para_829">I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this motion. It is good to have the opportunity to talk about this hugely important issue. It is evident, from the contributions of all of the Deputies who have spoken, that we have a problem with the delivery of public transport. People do not make up these stories and moan about the NTA, the BusConnects or the trains just for the sake of it. These are real issues for the people that we represent in our constituencies. The first issue that I want to address from the motion is access and disability access. As has been said by many here, it is a hugely important issue. We have seen many people facing barriers to access to public transport, including broken lifts at DART stations, limited wheelchair spaces on buses, trains, and on the DART and the Luas, and the requirement to give 24 hours' notice before a journey in order for a ramp to be put in place. These are real live issues for people who struggle at the best of times with their mobility. I must congratulate the Access for All campaigners, many of whom I know. They are people with disabilities and the parents of people with disabilities, who are doing their utmost to shine a light on this very important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> The second issue I wish to raise, which is not really explicitly mentioned in the motion but is hinted at, and has been hinted at throughout the debate, is the role of the NTA itself. I worked for Dublin Bus. I remember that there were constant attempts by the State and the governments of the day to privatise the public transport system. It was a mantra of Fine Gael, in particular. It really wanted to see privatisation in public transport. It was met with huge resistance, mainly from workers like me and the good strong trade unions that we had. The NTA was brought in specifically to privatise public transport. That is the only role it has ever played. It had an elaborate structure of competitive tendering, just like we have for offshore energy for renewables, for our hospitals and for everything we do. It is a very neo-liberal idea that the only way we can deliver services is by privatising some of them and looking for the lowest tenderer. When you get the lowest tenderer, you get a company like Go-Ahead, a British company that is renowned over there for treating and paying its workers poorly. If the NTA had only done its research, it would have found that out. Stories have been told all around this Chamber today about what is wrong with Go-Ahead. There is a lot wrong with the NTA. What it has done with BusConnects is very interesting. From the time BusConnects was announced, as a councillor, along with other People Before Profit councillors, I engaged very strongly with the organisation. BusConnects will confirm that we had the representatives driven mad. We went to all the public consultations, met with representatives and had Zoom conferences with them. They produced very elaborate and beautiful documents, maps and files that could be plugged into a computer. There were interactive maps that showed us how BusConnects would work. I would say that millions of euro were spent on that. In fact, I think I put in a parliamentary question on the millions of euro that were spent on just planning the BusConnects network. Now that we have it, I welcome 24-hour transport and many of the spines that bring more frequency on the principal routes, for example, from west Dublin into the city. That is all very good.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">However, those routes bypass large working class areas such as lower Ballyfermot. For years, the No. 79 bus would pass through the area frequently, every 15 to 20 minutes, picking up mothers, babies, people in wheelchairs, grannies and all sorts of people who needed the service. Those are genuine working class people who depend on public transport because they do not have the option of using cars and do not have sufficient mobility to walk for 15 minutes to the main road to catch the G1 or G2 buses. This new route is wrecking some of their lives. I have heard reports of women who have struggled to make it into work on time because of the bottleneck created by the No. 60 route which replaced the No. 79. They are delayed in waiting for the bus to come and also by the bottleneck that is created in Kilmainham, which adds 45 or 50 minutes to the journey. Many of those women are arriving into work so late that their wages are being docked. It is unacceptable. I would like the Ministers and those sitting on the Government benches to provide instruction to the National Transport Authority to the effect that where the system is not working, it must try to fix it. Trying to fix it means consulting local people and their representatives, including Deputies. The NTA must try to fix the problems and it must listen.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> When I worked in Dublin Bus, workers were consulted regularly about how the routes should work. We knew what time the factories and schools emptied. We knew what time the women came out to go into town and clean the offices. We knew when old folks would need buses to get to hospitals. There is no longer any consultation with local people on these issues. There is a plan in the heads of these people, a layer of whom come to those Zoom meetings. Loads of different people attend. They are well-paid experts who can tell us about this route which runs however many kilometres. The talk about this, that and the other, and all the computerised technology they have. However, delivering a proper transport service requires listening to local people.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> I have moved the People Before Profit amendment to provide for free public transport. For years, People Before Profit has championed the idea of free frequent public transport. I hope Sinn Féin will accept our amendment and vote with us on it because free public transport is not only people asking for more stuff for free, as some neoliberals would say. They would say it is just the socialists again for whom everything must be free and ask who will pay for it. Free public transport is a modern, global and well caught-on concept. Where it has been introduced, the intention is to reduce emissions, improve air quality and get cars off the road. It is a crucial tool for reducing CO2 greenhouse gas emissions. We must think long and hard about such a measure. We are pushing for that. It would not cost a fortune to introduce. We have priced it and included it in our alternative budget several times. To introduce it now for the current level of transport would require an additional amount of approximately €600 million in the budget. Of course, transport must be more frequent, timely and accessible. It must be democratised in consultation with local communities and responsive to their needs. It should not only be a matter for what is in the heads of bureaucrats with good jobs in the NTA or Transport for Ireland. There is a problem here and I hope the Minister acknowledges that.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_318">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_834">I welcome many aspects of this motion, in particular the call for privatised routes to be renationalised. This should start immediately with the pathetic excuse for a service being inflicted on ordinary people by Go-Ahead Ireland. I have been inundated with complaints from people who have been stranded as a result of the No. 175 bus not turning up. Go-Ahead Ireland was recently fined €500,000 by the NTA for failing to put on bus services at all - not because its services were late but because they did not turn up. These are services paid for by the State and advertised to people who rely on them to get to work, school and hospital appointments. The problem is that I doubt Go-Ahead is very bothered, given that its Irish subsidiary made €2.6 million in profit last year. Even after the fines, Go-Ahead Ireland is still raking it in at our expense.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> Why is this taking place at Go-Ahead Ireland? I was talking to a worker only last night. He told me that the fundamental issue is that the company is skimping on staff. That is the logic of privatisation. It is a race to the bottom. The company is not investing properly in staff and, therefore, we are left with the problems we have. That worker told me the situation is due to get even worse with the new rosters that are being introduced. It will be even worse for the workers. He told me that the workers are describing the new roster as the divorce roster because it means that many workers will not be home for three or four weekends in a row to spend time with their families. Those rosters should be withdrawn. Go-Ahead Ireland should be put out of business, its routes renationalised and all its workers transferred to Dublin Bus.</p>
          <p eId="para_836"> We should not stop there. We need a properly integrated, planned out public transport system and not a hodgepodge of disconnected privatised services that do not join up with each other. We need massive State investment to extend public transport to the very many parts of the country that have no usable service. Not just the western rail corridor and the Navan line but the whole country needs a vastly improved public transport system.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> I have a question as to why Sinn Féin did not call for free public transport in this motion. Three weeks ago, Malta became the second EU country, after Luxembourg, to make public transport free. Scotland brought in free bus travel for everyone under the age of 22 last January. More than 100 cities around the world already offer some form of free public transport. All the evidence shows that abolishing fares significantly increases public transport use, thereby reducing carbon emissions. Ask the pensioners in Ireland who avail of the free travel scheme if they would still use public transport to the same extent if it was not free or if instead they would drive more. We must get people out of cars and that means free, frequent, expanded and accessible public transport. I hope our amendment will be supported.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCanney" eId="spk_319">
          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T21:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_838">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion. I welcome its introduction. As the Minister knows, public transport is a rare species in the west of Ireland. We know all about it. I listened to some of Deputy Bríd Smith's comments about a 24-hour service and thought how happy people in parts of rural Ireland would be with a five-hour service.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> There are many things I could say about the rights and wrongs of public transport. In my constituency, many people travel from the east and north of the county to work in the city. Every day, approximately 40,000 cars pass through Claregalway, trying to get into the city. As we know, the situation in respect of the city's outer ring road has now gone back in time. We have spent more than €32 million doing nothing other than creating paperwork. We have to ask what in the name of God we are doing about transport in our own areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> I will give the Minister a small example. Back in 2007, the then Minister for Transport, Noel Dempsey, opened a bus lane between Loughgeorge and Claregalway. The plan was to build a bus lane from there into the city. The bus lane did not require the acquisition of any land. The space is there between the two walls and the road. Everything is fine. Lo and behold, we are almost into 2023 and we still do not have a word as to when this bus lane will be provided. The NTA has not got on with the job in all those years. Private bus operators are trying to get people into work but the buses are sitting in the same traffic as the cars. There is no real incentive for commuters to get out of a car and into a bus if they are left sitting in the same traffic. I do not know why that bus lane has not been provided. We get reports, research, feasibility studies and everything, but we get nothing at the end of the day.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> There is much to be done for public transport in rural Ireland. There is an enormous amount of work to be done with Local Link, creating services that connect to the bigger operators and connecting them in a timely way so the Local Link bus can meet the bus going into Galway, or wherever else, and so the buses going into towns will meet the trains.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> Speaking of trains, the Minister knows that we had a great conference in Tuam on Saturday at which we discussed investment in the west of Ireland. The conference was organised by West-On-Track. We have a campaign to reopen the line on the western rail corridor, under phases 2 and 3, to join Claremorris to Tuam and on to Athenry. The intention is to create a corridor of rail infrastructure that will help us deliver our carbon targets in respect of rail freight and passengers. We know that the line from Galway to Limerick is the fastest growing passenger line in Ireland. At the conference on Saturday, people were talking about crowded trains with people sitting on the floors of carriages. It is working, despite the fact that Irish Rail has not put on the proper schedules that were intended for phase 1 of the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> I welcome the fact that we are putting in a passing loop in Oranmore to create more opportunities to get trains in and out of the city. Galway station is right in the heart of the city. It is well located to be of help to the city but we seem to be dithering about it and I am not sure why. If we are going to change the transport landscape from a political point of view, we have to start with the jobs we can do. Phase 2 and 3 of the western rail corridor is a project that is shovel-ready. It is ready to go. I know that the Minister of State and many of his colleagues support it. In fact, 110 Deputies and Senators in these Houses support the project so we will continue to work on it . We need to ensure that we do not leave anything to chance and that we get these projects delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> While I am talking about the rail service, I must note that there are bus services which are being cut out, for example between Gort and Limerick. Bus services were taken out of Kilreekill and the bus stop was removed from there. There are many mixed messages being delivered at the moment with public transport in Galway and further afield. If we are going to make life easier for people who are travelling to work in Galway, we need to grasp this nettle. We must ensure we provide a form of public transport which people can and will use, and provide the frequency it deserves and the people in the west of Ireland also deserve.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_320">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T21:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_845">Due to the lack of public transport options, the current system has been orientated towards car ownership and use. Many workers and families, especially in rural Ireland, are completely reliant on private car use for education, work and leisure. The transport sector accounts for 17.7% of our total greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, investment in public transport can play a central role in helping to reduce our carbon emissions. While it must be acknowledged that the Government is now acting to reduce emissions and deliver environmental, social and economic benefits to all cities, towns and regions, it must also be said that we have not invested enough in public travel and active travel in the last decade. I wish to raise a number of items specifically related to disability access, the lack of public transport in rural parts of Louth and east Meath, and the affordability and reliability of existing services.</p>
          <p eId="para_846"> When the 2007-13 national development plan, Transforming Ireland - A Better Quality of Life For All, was launched, it provided for investment in infrastructure and social inclusion measures. Its key objective was to tackle structural and infrastructural barriers which impact on regional development and the quality of life of the older and disabled population. In 2021, this Government launched the renewed national development plan, which covers the 2021-30 period and places a particular focus on a cleaner, greener, connected Ireland. Now there is no question of a lack of investment in this renewed plan, but it is imperative that the Minister for Transport monitors and periodically audits progress on improving accessibility for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_847"> With regard to disability access, we need to consider the challenges faced daily by people with disabilities, the visually impaired, our senior citizens and those with mobility issues. Some 13.5% of the population have a disability, so ensuring universal access for all on public transport must be a priority. A constituent recently visited my office in Dundalk to complain that only one taxi is kitted out for wheelchair access in that town. The same man faced barriers in accessing public transport to get to the airport, even after making contact prior to his journey to ensure there was an access ramp and sufficient wheelchair space. This is unacceptable and is resulting in exclusion. Are our disabled constituents to stay at home? Transport solutions and mobility supports for those with a disability must be targeted immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_848"> I agree with the motion that the timeline for the delivery of the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan must be accelerated. Connectivity through rural connected hubs, as well as connecting rural communities through transport services, is crucial to keeping our rural communities alive. While it must be acknowledged that the newly announced Pathfinder programme will provide critical links for cyclists commuting to work and schools in my constituency of Louth and Meath, it will only benefit those living in close proximity to work or college who can cycle or walk. </p>
          <p eId="para_849"> Because Louth is located along the commuter belt, I welcome the new regional connections between the midlands and north-east regions linking Dundalk and Ardee, Drogheda and Trim, and Athlone and Longford. However, it must also be acknowledged that there is a lack of public transport infrastructure and public transport routes from rural parts of the constituency to larger areas, such as Dublin, with a high reliance on private commercial bus operators or cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> With regard to the affordability and reliability of services, while the commute for those using public transport is perhaps more affordable than before due to the Taxsaver ticket price reduction, commuters in Dundalk and Drogheda are heavily dependent on commercial bus operators to provide these necessary routes to work or college in Dublin. The Government's failure to extend the 20% public transport fare reduction to commercial operators means that this initiative does not provide any relief to commuter costs amid this cost-of-living crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> Spain has recently implemented measures offering free travel on state-owned suburban and regional public transport from 1 September to 31 December 2022, thanks to a windfall tax. Germany introduced a nationwide ticket costing €9 a month offering unlimited travel on most public transport, apart from express intercity trains. Such initiatives will provide relief to commuter costs amid the cost-of-living crisis, while encouraging less car use and a reduction in fuel emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> The solution to transport emissions, which relates to cities as well as transport between cities, is to change our system to encourage public transport and active travel. It is not against motorists and does not say that we will not have or need additional roads, as we will need them, but that must be part of an overall plan that sees us meeting our emissions reduction targets. We need to ensure rural and urban transport is completely frequent, flexible, reliable and accessible. If we create that system, more and more people will use it and there will be less and less demand for people to have a car.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> I am one of the lucky people who invested in an electric car two years ago. I have to be honest when I say it is by far the best car we have ever had. The simple reason is that I have electric charging points in my home and when I have to go to work I can charge it. I know many people who want to buy electric cars and cannot do so because of this. Electric cars are expensive. I know there are grants but it is a win-win for everybody if we can get the proper services for electric cars.</p>

          <p eId="para_857"> I compliment Sinn Féin on this motion. It is very important one because of people with disabilities and people who are unable to access transport. When we talk about equal access and opportunities, we must bear in mind that these people are completely hindered. I support the bones of the motion from that point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> As a Deputy for rural Ireland, I want to say that we have no services. Fares have been reduced since Covid for all of the urban services and for the few services we have in the country. However, those who have no services cannot get a reduced rate. It is as simple as that. If services were not being provided by companies like Kavanaghs of Urlingford, Lamberts of Ardfinnan, McCarras and O'Donoghues of Clonmel, we would be in a bad way. Another issue is that the town transport bus in Clonmel was taken away because of Covid and it has never come back. It is like the snow up in the Nire; it went after the winter and we have not seen it since.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> There are many things to be made up and restored here, but having to book a train or a bus 24 hours in advance is an insult to the person in a wheelchair or whatever situation the person is in. That is scandalous.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> I want to salute the voluntary boards up and down the country. I was a member of the board of Ring a Link, which provided an excellent service in Kilkenny, Carlow and south Tipperary. We were the motivators and initiators, as these boards were in many counties. TII has now taken them over. I know that the services are running well and we welcome them, but obviously we want more. We have tried to run night links and different things, but they do not actually work.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> The Taoiseach is claiming today that people who cannot get a house can stay in a pub drinking all night. They will have heat and light inside in the pub and will have a roof over their head. Is opening pubs and bars in the middle of this deep recession all that the Cabinet has to discuss? Thank God the Minister of State is not part of the Cabinet, and I do not mean that comment in a bad way. I believe he would have been a voice of reason. It seems that this nonsense is all the Cabinet has to discuss now. I do not know who it is playing to. Who wants to be inside a pub at 5 o’clock or 6 o’clock in the morning? I heard a publican this morning saying that people could have two nights' enjoyment in one night. Did one ever hear such talk when people cannot get a house, public transport or access to these services? Of course it is different for Ukrainians or some other non-nationals. When Irish people ask for more from the national budget, the answer is "No". We have to go back to the end of the queue. The Government has gone from the ridiculous to the sublime and back again to the ridiculous. I think it is a shameful situation.</p>

          <p eId="para_862">I thank Sinn Féin for this important motion but there are many parts of rural Kerry that do not have public transport at all. If we are honest, there is not enough money in the Central Bank to service all of rural County Kerry with public transport because it is so expansive and places are so remote. However, we want people to live there and we want to assist in whatever way we can. There is certainly a problem with hackneys and taxis in rural towns and villages during the week and even at weekends because, if drivers are busy in the likes of Killarney or Kenmare, smaller places like Kilgarvan and other rural places have a problem getting public transport. I honestly believe that taxis and hackneys should be subsidised during the day. There are no taxis or hackneys working during the day in many parts of rural Kerry. We appreciate the Local Link service, which does wonderful work, but it does not catch everyone. In that regard, there should be some scheme to facilitate taxis and hackneys to help rural people do their shopping or other things they need to do to take the monotony out of their lives. When the Government brought in the most recent drink-driving laws, which affected many rural people in many ways, it said that it would find a way to transport them to and from the local pub. However, I am sad that the only place you would see a queue or crowd that has anything to do with drink is at a bottle bank because most drinking is now done at home. You may not be sure of meeting many people in the pub but you will meet them around the bottle bank. That is the effect of the Government's laws. It is now talking about opening pubs or discos later.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">The Local Link service has been a help with regard to local transport issues. Its remit within the national bus service is to provide links from west to east County Limerick through Castlemahon, Kilteely, Feenagh, Dromcolliher, Foynes and Glin. I am delighted to work with it to provide the bus for rural areas from stop to stop. It also provides pick-up at the door for people who need it for different services. A route was recently approved from Granagh to Limerick. This will provide for second and third level students who cannot get accommodation around their institutions and who are staying at home and need transport. The issue we are having is that it can often take three or four connections to get to the likes of Limerick Institute of Technology and the University of Limerick. The Local Link has also done well in organising a route from Croom to Tarbert, which is also welcome. This also brings in my own local area of Ballingarry, Foynes and Glin. As a result of a recent campaign, there is a new bus coming from Charleville. We will welcome something from Cork because it comes through Limerick and gets students to the bus station. That routes starts at 7.30 a.m., which means students can get to their colleges on time. That will again feed into places like Bruree, Feenagh and Kilmeedy as people can get to the likes of O'Rourke's Cross and other areas that are approved for pick-up. They can then at least get to school even if they cannot afford a car or the insurance on one. That, at least, is helping.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> There is an issue in Dromcolliher. The Government is talking about free buses for students to go to school. In Dromcolliher, 50 students require a bus. We have been on to Bus Éireann, which has told us that, if we can provide a bus driver, it will provide a bus. We have provided five, six or seven bus drivers. We have even provided a bus company but Bus Éireann will not come back to us and provide a business plan. We could get 50 students to school, which would stop at least 30 cars driving to school, which would help the environment. Will the Minister of State please intervene?</p>

          <p eId="para_865">Affordable and reliable public transport is a lovely idea and a lovely dream but it is not happening in rural Ireland. I have had many debates with the Minister for Transport as to why it is not and he says that he does not have the money but suggests that something from Castletownbere into Bantry and Kilcrohane in west Cork might be possible. It is a matter of kicking the can down the road. I keep pushing for that to happen and I hope it will happen along the Durrus line. He is also talking about services from Skibbereen to Killarney but there is nothing there. He has been in office for two and half years and has not delivered. I ask him what he is doing with the carbon tax money. I do not begrudge that but if you go down to Wicklow or anywhere around here, you will see a bus every five minutes. However, in west Cork, a bus leaves Goleen at 7.30 a.m. and returns at 6 p.m. and that is it. That is the service. If I need to use public transport to come to Dáil Éireann I have to plan two days ahead. It might get me here at some time in the evening but it will not get me here on time. It is simply not good enough for the people of Kinsale, Belgooly and Riverstick who have no proper continuous bus service to and from Cork. It is not good enough that a company like West Cork Connect that wants to provide a service on the hour every hour is being blocked from doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> I commend the likes of Cork Local Link. I have a conflict of interest in that I am on the board but I am proud that I am a volunteer and have never taken a brown cent in expenses or anything else to attend my meetings. I drive down from Dublin especially to be at those meetings because, with the little money it has, the Local Link service delivers to as many people as it can. It is a fantastic company, as are all Local Link companies. Regardless of who funds them, they are not funded enough to deliver. Why are people from Dunmanway to Clonakilty not being looked after? Why is there no service there? Why are we in west Cork treated as second-class citizens when the people of this country can get a fantastic service because of the carbon tax and whatever else? We in rural Ireland pay for it but it is delivered everywhere else. </p>
          <p eId="para_867"> In the little bit of time I have left, I will commend the people behind Cancer Connect. It is a fabulous service set up under Local Link a number of years ago. It is a voluntarily-delivered bus service but it needs funding from the State. It is a fabulous service but it is being funded by the people of west Cork when it needs to be funded by the State as well. It is a disgrace that has not happened. Promises have been made and need to be delivered upon.</p>
          <p eId="para_868"> If we are paying the most in carbon tax, we need a proper public transport service to be delivered. It is only fair.</p>

          <p eId="para_870">This Independent is entirely on her own for ten minutes. I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward the motion and giving us an opportunity to put the spotlight on public transport. I welcome the amendment proposed by Solidarity-People Before Profit. I hope Sinn Féin will consider it. I will come back to the western rail corridor, which is given the thumbs-up in the motion, and that is welcome. I did not see the motion in time to propose an amendment regarding light rail for Galway and a feasibility study in that regard. I am sure Sinn Féin would have no difficulty with that but, unfortunately, I did not table it in time.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> I will preface my remarks by quoting a Minister who said: "We are losing biodiversity around the globe at a rate unprecedented in human history." Those are not my words or those of somebody on the radical left but those of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, on 29 May 2019. She also said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_872">We are losing biodiversity around the globe at a rate unprecedented in human history. The number of plants, insects, mammals and birds that are threatened or endangered grows every year, while the land, ocean and atmosphere are being altered to an unparalleled degree. </p>
          <p eId="para_873">That is a Fine Gael Minister of State talking about what is happening with our world and biodiversity is just one aspect of it. It seems that we have no choice but to embrace public transport as only one of the significant aspects of dealing with our obligations in respect of climate change. I find the manner in which, here in the Dáil, we regularly demonise people who take court cases disturbing. I will refer to two court cases taken by Friends of the Irish Environment. We have no choice. Notwithstanding those wonderful words from the Minister of State or the Minister for Finance's earlier acknowledgement when I said the planet was burning - he nodded his head having said that himself in his budget speech last year - we are utterly dependent on these people. What do we do if the planet is burning?</p>
          <p eId="para_874">We want to take what the children told us. They embarrassed us into declaring a climate and biodiversity emergency. I welcome that. I welcome what the Government did there but really we were forced into it. We repeatedly ignored all of the reports, going back to Rio de Janeiro. We have persisted with development that is completely out of keeping with our obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> Deputy O'Connor had some words about the recent decision on the outer bypass with which I do not agree. I was elected in 1999. Since 1999, I and a number of other voices, including the now President of Ireland, were part of a group called Hands across the Corrib. It was not NIMBYism or anything like that but because the bypass was wrong. This outer bypass is wrong. We knew it was wrong but even worse was the fact that it was the only egg in the basket, as it were. It was the only thing the city and county councils pursued and it precluded any other solution. Since 1999, I have continuously lost votes on this issue. I am not going to change. I fundamentally believe that that road and the N6 are wrong. It is completely out of keeping with the type of development we need. Both routes have now gone down a cul-de-sac. We choose to demonise as opposed to grasping the opportunity that has been given to us now. The decision by An Bord Pleanála to agree with Friends of the Irish Environment that the board's decision should be quashed is a wonderful opportunity. That is what it agreed. We should embrace that and the Government should take a hands-on approach to what is needed in Galway city.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> The Minister of State has been in Galway many times and been subjected to traffic congestion. We have no park-and-ride services, as he well knows. I am repeating myself at the risk of boring people. In 2005, when I was mayor, the council and I led in putting in park-and-ride objectives. That has remained in the city development plan and never been rolled out. The NTA is now telling us that it is looking at it. Imagine that. Some 17 years later it is going to look at park-and-ride services on the east side of the city. Quite incredibly, it is telling us that they are not needed on the west side of the city. That is what it told us. It is not looking at any site on the west side of the city, notwithstanding the traffic coming in from Connemara. Somebody who works in my office has to come in in that traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> There was the decision from An Bord Pleanála. I made a submission so we all got copies. There were three sets of precedents but I am focusing on the Friends of the Irish Environment. The letter from the solicitor tells us, "The board held five meetings to consider the application before making its decision at its fifth and final meeting on November 8th, 2021". Quite incredibly, the board granted planning permission even though it was not aware that the new climate action plan had been adopted four days previously. It went on to say it had not been informed. One wonders what world the board members are living in. The Government itself promoted the climate action plan way back in March of that year. It set out clearly what it intended to do in the climate action plan, which An Bord Pleanála was simply unaware of. It is quite incredible. Add to that the response of the two local authorities, which once again put their heads in the sand and said they were disappointed that the decision to quash the consent for the N6 project was done on narrow grounds. Can the Minister of State imagine that? They say it was done on a very limited ground, that is, their utter failure to consider the climate action plan. I am going around in a circle to come back and say our words mean nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> An Bord Pleanála and the two local authorities are now interpreting that decision, saying it was narrow grounds when they utterly failed to consider the climate action plan. Prior to that, An Bord Pleanála must have been completely asleep because back in 2020 the Friends of the Irish Environment brought a case to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court held that the national mitigation plan for climate change was too vague. It quashed that plan. That is what led to us having a new plan. It said citizens were entitled to know what was in a plan and what the Government intended. It seems An Bord Pleanála was not aware of that either and was not aware of any of the reports that showed the substantial emissions from transport. Perhaps there might be a different way with a combination of solutions. When the decision was made in March, there was a major press release from the Government regarding the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> I fully support the amendment relating to free transport. Perhaps it is not feasible to introduce it in January 2023 but we have no choice but to go down that road. We should look at the countries that have already been mentioned. Luxembourg became the first country to introduce it on 29 February 2020 and on 1 October this year Malta became the second country to make public transport free for all residents. Germany was overwhelmed when it introduced a fare of €9 a month, such was the demand for it. I welcome the changes that have been made by the Government through public transport fare reductions. In fact, I am back on the bus myself. I was always on a bus but I went to a car when I got the extra job and am now back on a bus again. People want to use public transport. People in Galway want to use public transport. I certainly do not want to punish the motorist in Galway who has no option because we have failed to bring in park-and-ride facilities. We have failed to lift the school transport of the city. We have failed to listen to the people of Galway. Around 25,000 people signed a petition so long ago I cannot remember. We stood in the rain asking the Government to please carry out a feasibility study. We still have no study. We have a thriving city, a beautiful city that is positioned between the beautiful Corrib and the Atlantic Ocean and Galway Bay. Within that, we need to lift the traffic off the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> There was duplicity about the western rail corridor. Hypocrisy has gone on while the north west has been demoted yet again, for the second time, by the European Commission. I did not have the chance to go to that wonderful conference on Saturday. The Minister of State was there. I have read all the blurbs relating to it and so I know they laid out exactly what was possible and the vision for it. I fully endorse that. If we are seriously interested in regional balance and if we are seriously interested in tackling climate change and biodiversity, we need a transformative vision and transformative action. It is too late for any other type of piecemeal approach.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T21:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_881">On behalf of the Minister for Transport and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, I thank all the Deputies for their contributions to this debate on accessible, affordable and reliable public transport. In both the motion itself and the contributions I have heard from individual Deputies during the debate, we can see the range of challenges and opportunities but also the progress that has been made to date. I believe we are all in agreement about wanting to provide a comprehensive public transport network that serves the needs of all members of society in both urban and rural areas and one which addresses, as a number of Deputies have spoken to, our climate challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> As the House is aware, the Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options, and public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal. The recently agreed budget 2023 helps support this objective and is a further positive development for public transport passengers across the country. We have extended the 20% fare reduction on PSO services until the end of 2023 so that everyone will benefit. Equally, we have extended the 50% reduction available for young adults on both PSO and commercial services until the end of 2023. We are supporting new and enhanced bus and rail services throughout 2023 as well. These are all part of a €563 million funding package to support PSO services. That package was hugely significant in the context of providing accessible and affordable transport options. With regard to PSO contracts, I reiterate that any issues relating to punctuality, reliability and customer service standards are dealt with as part of the contractual arrangements between the NTA and the operators.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">Furthermore, any issues of poor reliability or punctuality performance could result in financial penalties for those operators, and this has been acknowledged this evening. In incidences where operators have not met the minimum standards in recent months, the National Transport Authority, NTA, has applied significant penalties to those operators, and has engaged extensively with the operators with a view to improving service reliability.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> With regard to transport provision in rural Ireland, the Connecting Ireland rural mobility plan is a key component of the Government's ambitious plans in this area and will significantly increase the number of routes and the frequency of existing services right across the country. Connecting Ireland proposes to specifically to expand the public transport network in rural areas, and to increase service levels. For instance, under Connecting Ireland the NTA proposes an overall increase of approximately 25% in rural bus services as part of the five-year Connecting Ireland plan. Hundreds of rural villages and areas will, for the first time, be served by viable public transport link. Service improvements are already being rolled out under Connecting Ireland, with more planned before the end of the year. I endorse all of the remarks about Local Link this evening around its success and its efficacy on the ground. For the benefit of those Deputies who do not realise it, I must point out that Local Link is funded by this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_885"> At present, routes that are identified through the Connecting Ireland consultation process are being prioritised to provide emergency public transport services to areas where the population and transport demand has increased due to the requirement to house Ukrainian refugees in rural locations. This is being achieved by accelerating network improvements, including additional stocks, route modifications, and more services to increase connectivity.</p>
          <p eId="para_886"> The Government also has ambitious plans for public transport infrastructure nationwide. The programme for Government commits to a fundamental change in the nature of transport in Ireland. This is supported by the national development plan, which has allocated €35 billion to maintain, enhance and improve transport infrastructure across the country over the next ten years. The substantial investment in transport in recent years, and the planned ramping up of major projects such as BusConnects in every city, Connecting Ireland in rural areas, the Cork area commuter rail programme, the DART+ project and MetroLink means that the national public transport landscape will continue to transform for the better in the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> Under Project Ireland 2040, spatial planning and capital investment are being linked together in a meaningful way, while significant levels of investment are being put forward towards new public and sustainable transport initiatives, as well as major new road projects. Further capacity on the Kildare-Maynooth and northern rail lines will be increased by more than 30% compared to today, and the new rail cars required to achieve this increase have already started to arrive on the island and will enter service next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> The third phase of BusConnects was rolled out in May this year and introduced two new northern orbital routes: the N4 connecting Blanchardstown to the Point Village; and the N6 connecting Finglas with Howth Junction. Most recently, phase 4 of BusConnects commenced on 16 October, with the introduction of G spine routes G1, G2, and route 60 operated by Dublin Bus. The routes will serve areas such as Ballyfermot, Liffey Valley, Clondalkin and Islandbridge. I have listened to Deputy Bríd Smith's<b>
						</b>complaints about the lack of local connection to these G routes and I will follow this up.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> To help us achieve our climate targets, it was decided that from 2019 no new diesel buses would be purchased for urban public service obligation bus fleets. Deputies will be aware that as part of BusConnects the current fleet of buses in Dublin will be increased and converted to a zero-emission fleet by 2035, meeting rising demand and saving the equivalent of nearly 85,000 tonnes of CO2 per year, in line with our climate action plan targets. Buses and shelters will be modernised, increasing accessibility, and ensuring safe and enjoyable trips for passengers. Public transport investment, including bus and rail, can play a major role in decreasing CO2 emissions from the transportation sector, and provide workers, families and communities with an alternative and sustainable mode of transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> I reiterate that the Minister for Transport is fully committed to strengthening our public transport offerings and progressively making them accessible for all. This requires a whole-journey approach, which refers to all elements that constitute a journey, from the starting point to the destination. It also means applying the principle of universal design. In addition, the sustainable mobility policy and some of the other key guiding policies include the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the national disability inclusion strategy, and the comprehensive employment strategy for people with disabilities. The public transport accessibility actions across these and other national strategies have been combined into the Department of Transport's accessibility work programme, which provides a fright framework for prioritising projects and programmes to progressively make public transport accessible. The Department of Transport will continue to engage with all stakeholders, particularly people who are disabled, to continue to work and make public transport more accessible for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> As outlined earlier, the strategic rail review will examine the role of rail in supporting relevant policy objectives on the entire island of Ireland. We need this type of strategic analysis to inform our consideration of specific projects, and in this regard the House will be pleased to know that the review will consider the potential scope for improved rail services along various existing and potential future corridors of the network. That scope will also include the potential afforded by disused and closed lines such as the western rail corridor. I acknowledge Deputy Canney's work on the <i>ad hoc </i>all-party group in relation to the western rail corridor in advance of all the all-Ireland rail review. The review will be one of the most significant reviews of the rail network on the island in many years. It will provide a framework to develop a much improved all-island rail network in the years ahead. The Department of Transport expects the review to be completed by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> In conclusion, I assure the House that the Minister fully recognises and emphasises the hugely important role that public transport plays in all of our lives and is acutely aware of the concerns that have been raised in relation to making public transport fully accessible, reliable, and affordable to all. The ambitious investment programmes in the public transport sector over the coming years, such as BusConnects and Connecting Ireland, will go a long way towards achieving these goals by helping to improve people's quality of life and helping to grow the economy in both urban and rural areas through the provision of improved transport links. I believe that with the work that has been done in recent years and with these plans, which all contributors here today have agreed are essential to achieving a comprehensive public transport system that we wish to provide, we will achieve the goal to build a more efficient framework for the provision of public transport in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> Deputy James O'Connor has asked me to clarify his remarks on the planning process, which were referred to by Deputy Catherine Connolly. Deputy O'Connor had referred to the White Paper response on page 2 and his concerns about the delivery of major transport projects. Indeed, the planning framework around major infrastructural projects is also the subject of a review, which will conclude in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> I thank all Members for their inputs this evening and I look forward to pursuing the issues that have been raised.</p>

          <p eId="para_895">Having listened to some of the Government representatives tonight I believe they either come from very different places than I do or they are not being forthright in the context of the reality of many people. I come from a county that has no real transport network whatsoever. It has a bus service that has actually deteriorated since this Government came into office. It is astounding that not only did the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, not participate in this debate, not a single member of the Green Party decided to grace us with their presence tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_896"> Under the current framework of this Government the only things that the people in County Monaghan see in the lived reality are increased charges through carbon taxes, which are essentially penalties, for not using services that do not exist. People must pay more to this Government to get to work in their cars because there is no option but to use their cars. They must pay more to this Government to go to college because they cannot find accommodation in the places where they go to college. Increasingly this year they must pay more to this Government to drive with their children every morning behind the school bus to the local school and collect them every afternoon because the Government made such a hames of the school transport system for many families this year. This is simply not fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">It is simply not fair to always spout rhetoric about just transition, public transport and moving away from the car, and then penalise people for using their cars when the Government refuses to put alternatives in place. That needs to be called out and this motion calls it out. I commend Deputy O'Rourke on tabling it. If the Government is serious about moving away from fuel-powered engines, it needs to put in place the infrastructure, not through petty removal of funding for roads like the Clontibret to the Border road scheme, as the Minister did this year, without a whimper from his Government colleagues in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, but by providing investment to ensure people can get buses to places other than O'Connell Street. At the minute, you cannot get a bus to anywhere else from my county. We must put in place a blueprint that will deliver a rail network and allow us to have a sustainable route to living, working and rearing our families.</p>

          <p eId="para_898">In Limerick, I drive a car, cycle my bike, walk to work and take local buses where I can, and I mostly take a train when I come to Dublin. The train to Dublin, which I have been taking for seven years, is almost always on time. Unfortunately, the buses in Limerick are a different story. Public transport needs to be safe, reliable and affordable. If it cannot meet these three crucial criteria, people will not leave their cars at home and avail of public transport. It is as simple as that. Without a significant decrease in the number of private car journeys, we will struggle to meet the 2030 emission targets. In our alternative budget, we proposed an €195 million investment in public transport, cutting fares, investing in a new rail infrastructure and making public transport safer and more accessible. Our progressive proposal shows we can cut emissions while delivering social and economic benefits for citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> I thank the thousands of public service workers who work in our buses and trains, providing a vital service every day of the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> Prior to speaking today, I asked in my constituency for feedback on public transport in Limerick. Constituents came back with a huge number of comments, queries and suggestions, mostly about buses:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_901">Caherdavin [bus] 302, late a lot of the time, need extra buses to deal with the crowds at L.I.T. stop and no early Sunday service.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_902">305 St Marys Park [bus] there is days where the bus is a no show - St Marys Park bus stops at 5.30pm how is that fair to the people down here?</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_903">304 ...[I] have to always get the earlier bus in case the one that would have me on time doesn't arrive</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_904">303 ... is shocking bus is never on time and more than likely doesn’t come or 2 show up together [I] have been sending complaints for weeks and haven't heard back once for something that is so highly recommended because of the cost of living its not reliable</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_905">Mainly use the 303 and 302 main problem is the buses not turning up either on time (late or early, early often causing someone to miss the bus) or buses not arriving at all</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_906">I use the [bus] 304 or 304a from Mary I to Garryowen and vise versa. It's a[n absolute] nightmare. Faster walking most days because the bus is never on time and then 2 or 3 [buses] come at the same time.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_907">30[3] in weston is beyond a joke countless emails sent to them u have to get the bus well over an hour beforehand ...[Often] if ur waiting in patrick street the out of service sign is put on and no bus after half 6 no consideration for working people [whatsoever.]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_908">306 bus never on time and often doesn’t show up at all, only one per hour its a disgrace especially for elderly and disabled people of Ballynanty or for any[body] in fact living there.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_909">I use the 306 [bus on the] Ballynanty route all the time when it turns up. Every second bus doesn’t turn up. The bus route needs to go back to the way [it was] before and we need 2 buses an hour like all the other routes...</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_910">I got the 304 bus for 5 days a week for 5 years. I don’t think it ever came on time. The frequency was so bad it would often take a [supposedly] 20 minute trip over an hour.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_911">304/304A will pass out passengers in UL or go as far as town and let passengers off in town as no drivers to continue journey this is on a daily basis.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_912">Waited 40 for the 303 yesterday in Delmege park, a bus service that is meant to be every 15 minutes, not the first time it happened</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_913">The Westbury bus is rarely on time one time I was only seconds from the bus and he pulled away</p>
          <p eId="para_914">That is what people are telling me. The bus service does not work. People cannot rely on it or get to work on time. It is always delayed or does not turn up.</p>

          <p eId="para_915">I thank everyone who contributed to the debate. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, stated that some elements of the motion "do not properly reflect the progress to date in this area, the work currently under way or the Government's future plans for public transport." I do not know what that means. We have set out, for example, in the area of Connecting Ireland, the rural bus plan which is supported by the Opposition, that the Government is not investing enough in it and not rolling it out at a suitable pace. The Minister of State also said implementation of the programme would continue at the pace outlined by the Government and in line with the funding and operational resources available. The reason we tabled the motion is that we are not satisfied adequate progress has been made on Connecting Ireland. We have spelled out what we believe the Government should do, which is to increase the investment in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> I can give examples from my county. Some months ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, informed the House that Kentstown would have a service this year, after 40 years without one. It will not have it this year because the commitment is not being delivered on. The same applies elsewhere. Invest in the Navan rail line now, not post 2031 as the Government reaffirmed tonight. The same goes for the dedicated public transport policing unit. It has to happen in order for workers and passengers to feel safe to use public transport. Services must be expanded, costs and fares driven down and the people working on and using our public transport system protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> We also need accountability. The Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, made the point, which the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, echoed that the NTA engages in contracts with providers and it is a matter for them. The Minister for Transport is responsible for the delivery of the public transport network. I have sat in Opposition for at least four hours of debate on public transport in the last couple of weeks and the Minister has not been here for one minute of it. I and others have discussed with the Minister of State and others Go-Ahead Ireland and the lack of accountability for its service, and the senior Minister has not been here for any of that discussion. We want to see accountability for the provision of public transport services. There is significant room for improvement there.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> We are lucky with the huge effort and work that workers in the public transport service provide and deliver. They need to be supported and resourced. There are a huge number of issues to be tackled in terms of licensing, rostering, pay and terms and conditions that should reward those people and encourage more to go into that sector to deliver the scale and number of services the people of Ireland need and deserve.</p>

There has been quite an amount of commentary about the EU nature restoration law.

            <p eId="para_921">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_922"> The proposed nature restoration law was formally adopted by the European Commission in June. The proposals set out legally binding targets in the form of a regulation that will have direct effect across a broad range of ecosystem types, both on land and marine. These proposed targets would require the restoration of parts of these ecosystems to good ecological status by set dates. The proposed regulation has the potential to impact across a number of Irish Departments. In Ireland’s case, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, within the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, is responsible for co-ordinating Ireland’s response to the proposals. </p>
            <p eId="para_923"> The Commission’s proposals are now being discussed by the European Parliament and the Council. It is expected that discussions at Council and European Parliament level will run well into next year before the final regulation is agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_924"> We continue to be proactively engage with the NPWS and I will continue to engage with my ministerial colleagues in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. The key is that we are engaged actively on the matter and we are working hard at national and European level to ensure that our voices are being heard on the matter. </p>
            <p eId="para_925"> I am aware that farmers and their representatives are concerned about the potential of these proposals but I will work closely with them, as I always have done, to ensure that we will keep farmers doing what they do tremendously well, that is, producing food in a way that is world class and sustainable.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MattCarthy" eId="spk_335">
            <from>Deputy Matt Carthy<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T22:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_926">I recognise that this is at an early stage of the process but we can see how the debate is becoming polarised. The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has had two hearings on this. In one case we have had corrections to statements that have been made. We met with farm organisations, which are incredibly concerned about what this might mean. We have heard from environmentalists who critique anyone who raises any questions at all on this. We know that if we do not approach this correctly that it could create a space for people to manipulate facts and to contort issues but there are genuine concerns. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine will have an important role in setting out precisely what the current proposal would mean for Irish farmers and how any negative consequences can be addressed and in outlining how it intends to ensure the farmers' voice is heard at DG level within the European Commission and within the wider European institutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_927">I agree. Engagement with farmer representatives will be important in this regard because there is concern. The Deputy is also correct that it is very much at an early stage and is just emerging from European level at this stage. A number of Departments are involved and will be affected. It will be important from a farming point of view and I will meet with farm representative organisations and work closely with Government colleagues to ensure that our issues and concerns are clear at national level and clearly communicated at European level. It is something that I will engage in in a much deeper way with farm representatives. It will go well into next year. I will engage closely over the coming period with farm representative organisations as well as ministerial colleagues on the proposals on the table, the views on them and ensure our national voice and position at European level too.</p>

            <p eId="para_928">It would be helpful if the Minister could confirm that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is carrying out an appraisal of the current proposals in respect of what they will mean for land holdings on a county-by-county basis, whether they will mean a reduction in the land that is available for agricultural use and, if that is the case, how that will be managed or how the Government will approach those discussions at European level. We are living in a biodiversity crisis and that will mean that major decisions will have to be made. However, a large portion of the land that may be affected comprises private land holdings that are currently being used to produce good quality food. We need to approach this sensitively. What would be helpful first is a full appraisal and evaluation of what this could mean if implemented in its current guise. Then we can make the collective decision the Minister spoke of on what Ireland's position needs to be and how we can try to come to that position at EU level.</p>

There is also a land-use review under way, which will be important in informing our approach. My Department and myself are centrally involved in that. The issue is important. The regulation and the proposals are getting significant attention from my staff and it is something that I am also paying close attention to.

            <p eId="para_932">The compilation of the agricultural greenhouse gas inventory is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. As part of this process, the EPA determines the total amount of methane, N2O and CO2 emissions generated by the aggregation of all farms. The EPA takes activity data, for example, total animal numbers by category or fertiliser sales data and applies an emissions factor to determine total emissions. Carbon measurement at farm level will become ever more important in the context of the recently agreed sectoral emissions ceilings of a 25% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for agriculture and as a mechanism to demonstrate environmental ambition at farm level.</p>
            <p eId="para_933"> Through the Bord Bia sustainable beef and lamb assurance scheme, SBLAS, and the sustainably dairy assurance scheme, SDAS, introduced in 2014, we have a solid foundation on which to build. To date, more than 300,000 carbon footprint calculations have been completed. The Bord Bia quality assurance audit process for beef and dairy farmers facilitates the collection of the relevant farm management data required to complete a carbon footprint calculation via the sustainability survey. </p>
            <p eId="para_934"> The Department’s animal inventory and movements, AIM, data is utilised to generate an inventory of all animals on a farm for each month of a production year. Weight gain per animal is derived from a herd’s average daily live weight gain, DLWG, figure which is provided by the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation, ICBF, to Bord Bia. Both models generate a result by tracking all the greenhouses gases emitted as a result of the farm practices required to produce 1 kg of output, that is, "1 kg of fat and protein corrected milk" or 1 kg live weight gain. </p>
            <p eId="para_935"> These emissions can be categorised into emissions from: the digestion of feed; manure management; fertiliser use; concentrate feeding; and electricity and machinery use. The emissions are summed up across the beef or dairy production system and divided by the output to generate the carbon footprint. </p>
            <p eId="para_936"> The carbon footprint results are then communicated to members of the schemes via the farmer feedback report. To date, more than 5,000 farmer feedback reports have been generated and dispatched to SBLAS and SDAS members.</p>
            <p eId="para_937"> Since 2020, Bord Bia has collaborated closely with Teagasc and ICBF to improve the data collection, methodologies and accuracy of the beef and dairy models. </p>

            <p eId="para_938">One issue that farmers are concerned about is that they are not getting any credit for the carbon they sequester through pasture, crops and hedgerows. There is also a need to establish a carbon measuring, reporting and verification process which farmers need to work with. It is in place in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">Farmers wonder how the baselines are being set out and how they will be supported in putting in place measures to help reduce the carbon footprint. Things seem vague at present. Farmers are examining the various processes in place. There are pilot schemes and so on. In Northern Ireland, the ground on every farm is tested to a depth of 30 cm. Here, only one in every 20 units is tested, to a depth of only 10 cm. Therefore, we are behind the curve and not being fair to our farmers. Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p>

            <p eId="para_940">I would not agree. I outlined in my initial response the activity that has been ongoing for a significant period, or since 2014, regarding carbon assessments, on-farm navigators that have been developed and carbon-footprint calculations that have been done in this regard. I agree with the Deputy that it will be really important for farmers to have an income stream from the sequestration of carbon.</p>
            <p eId="para_941"> The EU is developing the platform on which carbon trading will work. It will be important to be able to step that out at national level. It will be key to have farmers benefit from that. Teagasc is doing a lot of research on how we can measure carbon capture and sequestration. The accurate measurement of sequestration so it can be monetised is one of the challenges. However, there is a lot of potential. It is something we have to continue to step out.</p>

            <p eId="para_942">I thank the Minister for his comments. This is a case of us chasing something very fast without having the research and knowledge base built up concerning how we will measure what farmers sequester through their daily practices and with hedgerows, etc. There have been many pilot schemes and a lot of research has been done but, as the Minister said, we do not yet have the science to show farmers will be rewarded for the good work they already do. The problem is that we have put the cart way before the horse in that we are trying to penalise people for carbon emissions without having a proper method of measuring what they are contributing. If we are to maintain confidence in farming and what is happening with carbon emissions, it is important to get the science right before making further decisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_943">The research, science and measurement tools will be really important. We are doing a lot of work in that regard. Other member states and other countries across the world are putting a lot of effort into this also. Getting the measuring tools right and accurate represents an important starting point. The infrastructure that needs to be put in place to allow for carbon to be traded and monetised will be important.</p>
            <p eId="para_944"> There is a lot of potential, as we are very much aware. We are investing in the research that will allow what I talk about to come to fruition, reach its potential and, importantly, ensure an additional income stream for farmers.</p>

            <p eId="para_947">I thank the Deputy. I am very much aware of the acute stress caused by a TB breakdown on a farm, and I am committed to driving down TB rates. Everyone in the industry is single-minded in their ambition to reduce the incidence of TB.</p>
            <p eId="para_948"> As a result of EU Animal Health Law Regulation 2016/429, new requirements concerning TB testing have been introduced. These regulations came into effect in April 2021 and are directly applicable to all EU member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_949"> The bovine TB stakeholders forum, which comprises representatives from across the agrifood sector, leading researchers and officials from my Department, has agreed to the introduction of these mandatory requirements on a phased basis. The requirements of phase 1 are that cows of all ages and males over the age of 36 months moving from farm to farm or through a mart must have been TB tested in the last six months and must also be moving from a herd that has been tested in the last six months. If the animal being moved does not meet the requirements, it must be TB tested 30 days prior to, or 30 days after, movement into the new herd. The animal is restricted to the receiving herd until the test is complete and clear.</p>
            <p eId="para_950"> The regulations are being introduced in two phases. Phase 1 is to be implemented on 1 February 2023. A campaign to inform farmers of these new requirements is being rolled out. Farmers will be notified of the requirements by way of an email or hard-copy leaflet containing "frequently asked questions" whose answers will explain the requirements. Farmers will also receive a text message with a link to the leaflet and "frequently asked questions" on the Government's bovine TB website, <i>www.bovinetb.ie</i>. There will also be a number of media articles concerning the requirements. Farmers can also contact their regional veterinary office for information and advice. No date has yet been set for phase 2 which will see the rule applied to all animals. Phase 2 will commence only following engagement with farm organisations. These new requirements are aimed at reducing the level of transmissible disease in animals, including bovines. The financial working group of the TB forum is examining the financial aspects of the programme to ensure a sustainable funding model for it is developed.</p>

            <p eId="para_951">The Minister is of course right that farmers are incredibly stressed when there is a TB outbreak on the farm, but they are also stressed by the failure to get on top of this issue. Since 2016, the TB eradication programme has cost around €100 million per year. It is estimated that expenditure up to 2030 will amount to a further €1 billion. The EU has reduced its contributions to the scheme precisely because it has not been working. Therefore, it is crucial that when we are talking about putting in place punitive measures, we have the evidence that they are going to make a difference. There have been major costs affecting individual farmers, the sector as a whole and the Minister's Department in terms of resources. What step-by-step analysis is the Minister carrying out to ensure the burdens being placed on farmers are having the desired effect?</p>

            <p eId="para_952">TB rates have been going in the wrong direction in the past few years. That is not acceptable. The objective of a TB eradication programme has to be to eradicate the disease or see figures go down. It is important that we follow the science on how to make progress on this issue. The re-establishment of the TB working group, comprising representatives of all the farm organisations and key experts, is important in determining how to step this out. The Deputy is correct that farmers, whenever taking these steps, need to be confident and assured that they will make a difference, prevent the transmission of TB and drive down the incidence rate. Pretty much all the steps taken and discussed by the TB working group are based on the scientific research and advice. New tools should enable us to make real progress in this regard. It is important that people work together and that the approach be science led.</p>

            <p eId="para_953">The key word is "partnership". This has to be seen as a partnership. It is impossible to quantify the damage done as a result of the categorisation letters issued by the Department. I realise that was before the Minister's time but relationships need to be mended. Lest people believe farmers are not contributing, they should note that in 2020, farmers contributed €37 million directly towards testing. They are paying €8 million annually in disease levies.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">The labour contribution that goes into it is unrecognised and not taken into account, but it has been valued at €20 million per annum. Farmers are as frustrated as anyone that the figures on the other side of the balance sheet showing TB numbers are going in the wrong direction. It would be useful if the Minister could give an assurance that he is doing everything in his power to ensure there will be no additional cost burden on farmers, given that the regulations in themselves are enough of a burden.</p>

            <p eId="para_955">There is no doubt that it is farm families that suffer the consequences of a TB outbreak. That is very damaging from a financial point of view. There is a significant contribution for farmers on an ongoing basis in regard to the testing regime. It is important that everybody works together in a spirit of partnership. That is why the work is done in a TB forum. I recognise the contribution of all of those who have taken part. They have worked in a very constructive spirit. They are grappling with some challenging issues and they are considering measures which can make a difference, but which will require everybody to recognise that and come together.</p>
            <p eId="para_956"> Issues relating to finance and cost are being addressed within the finance working group stream of the forum. I look forward to continuing to work with the forum and its working groups on how we can make progress. Thankfully, we are starting to see figures going in the right direction and I hope it will increase and we will see real progress in the time ahead. Ultimately, that is how we will support farmers and benefit everyone.</p>

            <p eId="para_959">The seafood task force, which included representatives of the five fisheries producer organisations and the four main fisheries co-operatives, recommended in its October 2021 report that a voluntary decommissioning scheme should be implemented to help restore balance between fishing fleet capacity and available quotas, following the reductions in quotas for stocks arising from the Brexit trade and co-operation agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_960"> I announced the scheme in July of this year, and it was opened for applications by Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, in September. The scheme makes €60 million available in funding for those who apply to take part in the scheme and an additional €20 million in tax relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_961"> In line with the recommendations of the task force, I am also requiring that owners of vessels who choose to participate in the scheme must ensure that crew working on their vessel are compensated for their loss of livelihood following the decommissioning of their vessel. Crew payments can range up to a maximum of €50,000 per individual. As the scheme is due to close on 18 November, it remains unclear how many applications will ultimately be received. However, BIM has recently informed me that 24 applications have been fully submitted, while a further 30 are at various stages of preparation.</p>
            <p eId="para_962"> The scheme runs concurrently with a series of schemes aimed at creating jobs in the seafood sector and in coastal communities, including the €45 million Brexit seafood processing capital scheme, the €20 million Brexit allocated to the sustainable aquaculture growth scheme and €25 million for the blue economy enterprise development scheme. In total, €225 million in supports and developmental strategies have been announced which will contribute to sustaining employment in the seafood sector as a whole, providing new career opportunities and ensuring those transitioning within the sector are supported.</p>

            <p eId="para_963">As the Minister is aware, I did not support this decommissioning because I always felt there were enough Irish fish in Irish waters for Irish fishermen to fish. They wanted to fish their way out of the problems they had. All they ever asked for was a fair share of the quota, which has been denied to Irish fishermen for many years, not just recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_964"> The Minister publicly welcomed the EU Commission’s approval of the scheme submitted to it to see if it would be okay under state-aid rules. In hindsight, were the Minister's chosen words, welcoming the loss of so many jobs the correct way for a Government Minister to act?</p>

            <p eId="para_965">As the Deputy states, I welcomed the approval that I had sought. I brought all of the representatives of fishers across the country together into a task force to advise me how to support the sector. As part of the report, they unanimously sought a voluntary decommissioning scheme and I then sought approval for that. I welcomed the fact that I got approval for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_966"> As we discussed at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine earlier, what we would all like is more national quota. That is something I am fighting for at national level. However, there is also a reality alongside that. Since the quotas and relative stability were established in the early 1980s, they have remained unchanged, Brexit apart. Brexit has had an impact. I am working with the representatives of fishers themselves to decide how to respond to that at national level and in regard to the challenges we have coming out of the trade and co-operation agreement and also in terms of the strategy we have at European level to try to improve our position.</p>
            <p eId="para_967"> The decommissioning scheme has been sought by fishers themselves. I am surprised that Deputy Collins does not recognise it as a requirement and as something that would help the fishers who remain. I am working closely with the fishery representatives to respond to the various schemes, not just this one, but many other schemes to support the fishing sector in every way possible to try to maximise its value to coastal communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_968">I will never support a scheme that takes Irish fishermen out of Irish waters. I could not do that. It would not be right of any Irish politician to do anything like that. The Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation was opposed to this as well, and it is a fishing organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_969"> I spoke to the Minister at the committee meeting on energy costs and fuel costs. The fishermen who are fishing at the moment are seriously concerned. They do not have the supports from the Government, perhaps not the Minister personally. The French and the Spanish are supporting their fishermen. They made sure they got their fuel subsidies because energy is a major cost, but the Irish have not. There is a fund, to which the Minister referred. I know he is looking at it, but he needs to work on it. The fund must be distributed immediately. What will the Minister do if the budget of €60 million is not enough to properly compensate these families who are losing everything they worked for, in some cases they are third and fourth generations?</p>

            <p eId="para_981">We discussed this issue at length a few hours ago at the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Deputy Mac Lochlainn is correct. I have been working closely and listening to the fishing representatives on this issue for a long time. I met with them shortly after the illegal invasion of Ukraine to discuss this issue. They requested specifically of me that I would do a second month tie-up scheme this year to support the challenges with fuel for the whitefish fleet. I delivered promptly on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">It began in June and will run until the end of November, and it is delivering €12 million into the sector to support the challenges relating to fuel. That is on top of the one month recommended by the seafood task force to respond specifically to Brexit.</p>
            <p eId="para_983"> As I have said to the fishing representatives throughout, I am continuing to monitor the situation. Fuel prices have gone up and down. For a few weeks, they looked as though they were going to fall a bit but they have spiked again. I met representatives of the producer organisations last week and representatives of the fishing co-operatives earlier today. I am assessing the situation with fresh eyes, particularly in light of the fact the scheme I have in place is due to run out at the end of November.</p>
            <p eId="para_984"> It is a difficult time. Marine gas oil is different from most other fuels in that there is no excise duty on it, so there is nothing to reduce in that regard, and the VAT is fully refundable. The EU has given capacity to member states to draw funding down from its European maritime funding allocation to put towards that specifically but that would mean taking funding out of other purposes for which it could be used to support the sector, specifically for short-term liquidity aid. It is not something I would do lightly, but I have been monitoring the issue closely and am reassessing it in light of the situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_985">The funding for the tie-up scheme comes from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund, not from the Exchequer. We have appealed to the Minister to explore both the Exchequer and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. There are resources in the fund that could be deployed here along with Exchequer funding. A package was announced in the budget to address the cost-of-living crisis and the energy crisis for a range of sectors, but not for that of fishing.</p>
            <p eId="para_986"> The Minister has met these representatives at least twice if not three times. This sector is in crisis. The break-even price was 60 cent per litre but it has been at well over €1 for the best part of this year. That is just not sustainable. I speak to fishermen every day, as I am sure the Minister does, and they tell us this. There needs to be an urgent intervention. I again appeal to him to put money on the table to keep them at sea and delivering seafood for our people.</p>

            <p eId="para_987">I have put money on the table, with the €12 million to fund the additional month of the scheme, which the sector specifically requested of me to address the fuel crisis and the challenges in that regard. I accessed that from the Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund, because that is bringing fresh funding into the fishing sector, rather than take it out of the EMFF, which is already in the fishing sector and allocated. The option is still there. The European Commission has given flexibility to member states to use that maritime funding in liquidity aid and, therefore, I still have that option after bringing the €12 million into the sector, which is at play until the end of November through that additional month of the tie-up scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_988"> I have been monitoring the prices closely month by month. As I said, we cannot reduce the excise given there is no excise on marine gas oil but there is the state aid flexibility given by the Commission to use the maritime funding but, as the Deputy will appreciate, that would mean using future funding for now and that is something that has to be considered carefully. I have been monitoring and assessing the situation, not least in light of the funding I have put in place being due to run out in November.</p>

            <p eId="para_989">What I cannot understand is that the Minister has the Brexit Adjustment Reserve fund, which is money intended to compensate for the loss of quota. That is to be deployed to assist the industry with that separate issue. He again talked about how using the EMFF would mean using funding that is supposed to be there for other issues, but why is he not talking about Exchequer funding? France, Italy, Spain and Sweden - I am sure there are many other countries but these are the most prominent four - have all made interventions, through either subsidies or emergency supports to their fishing industries. I just do not understand why we have not deployed Exchequer funding in the way we have done for the rest of the economy, whether that is business or residential.</p>

            <p eId="para_991">As I said, I have put €12 million into this scheme, which has been running from June and will continue to the end of November and which was sought from me by fishing representatives. It has been welcomed by those who have availed of it and it has been important to them. I am now reassessing that situation. It is important from a food security point of view that fishing is happening, and that has been the case. Our full quota has been fished month by month.</p>
            <p eId="para_992"> Nevertheless, the spike in the price of fuel in recent weeks has caused me to reassess the issue, not least in light of the €12 million I have put in being due to expire at the end of November. It is a situation of which I am very much aware and I am engaging on it all the time with fishermen and women. There will always be asks for additional funding but when it relates to using future funding now, any measure has to be considered carefully to ensure it is appropriate, and that is what I am doing.</p>

            <p eId="para_995">I thank the Deputy for her continued interest in this matter. As she outlined, an independently compiled review of the wool sector, which was a programme for Government commitment, was conducted and published in July. The review contained findings and recommendations, including potential funding streams, market opportunities for wool and multiple areas for additional research and development. One of main recommendations of the review was the establishment of an independent wool council, which was widely welcomed by all stakeholders. The council will be industry-led and contain multiple stakeholders from the wool sector including primary producers, farmers and commercial enterprises. Once established, it is intended the council will lead the development and promotion of Irish wool both domestically and internationally. It will also act as a forum to bring together multiple stakeholders to foster collaboration, innovation and the scaling of activities in the wool sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_996"> I am fully supportive of the establishment of this independent, industry-led wool council, which can use the findings of the wool review as a roadmap to develop pathways towards maximising the true potential of Irish wool. I understand stakeholders in the wool industry have taken the initial steps towards the formation of the council. Once it has been established, my Department will commit to providing €30,000 in financial assistance towards the initial set-up costs. Given that has not happened, there has been no drawdown of the funds as yet but it is my hope the report and the council can help chart a roadmap for the industry to help drive increased returns for the great and sustainable product that is wool.</p>

            <p eId="para_997">I do not how we can turn a good news story into a bad one. The possibilities of what we could do with wool are all set out in this report, which is quite good in parts but in others, if you will excuse the bad pun, is quite woolly. It is both concise and good as well as being vague, but it is not vague on the recommendations, one of which relates to a wool council. Nothing has happened since the report, which was delayed, was published. It is now almost November and still there is no wool council.</p>
            <p eId="para_998"> What about all the other recommendations? Have the Government and the Minister of State examined the possibilities and the recommendations that were set out, aside from the establishment of a wool council, such as the creation of an apprenticeship model for the wool sector, data collection, a feasibility study, the establishment of wool co-operatives and so on?</p>
            <p eId="para_999">There is a major role here for the Government in terms of the possibilities for the use of wool for everything from fertilisers to insulation. I would like to know what the Minister of State is doing with regard to this good news story.</p>

            <p eId="para_1000">I totally agree with the Deputy that there is much potential in wool. It is not fair to say that nothing has happened, however. After the study was completed, it was over to the sector itself to establish a wool council. It is not for the Department or for me to establish that. That was one of the most significant parts, the establishment of the wool council. However, I receive a letter from representatives of a group of stakeholders seeking to form the wool council. I responded to them requesting that they engage with farm organisations, which had not been the case, to ensure the sector's primary producers are represented on the wool council. That is essential.</p>
            <p eId="para_1001"> Certainly, we have also committed to putting aside supports for research into what wool can be used for. There are a number of potential uses, some of which the Deputy indicated. First and foremost, it is essential that we get this wool council established.

            <p eId="para_1002">It certainly is an issue for the Department and for the Government. One of the things that is lacking is a well-framed policy roadmap. That must be done by the Government and by the Minister. Previous questions have been asked with regard to fishing and task forces. Where is the task force with regard to the wool industry and the potential that is there? The possible uses include horticultural packaging, insulation, textiles, cosmetics, field products and composites. I am only listing out some of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003"> The Government carried out a report that cost €100,000 and then left it sitting there, waiting for the industry to do something. The clearest thing about wool is that the farmers are simply not getting the prices. The key economic concern for producers is that the price achieved for farmers is less than the cost of shearing. We know this. We now have a report that cost €100,000. We have set aside €30,000. We are going to do a Pontius Pilate on it and say it is absolutely nothing to do with us, and that we will wait for the council to be set up and ignore all the other recommendations. However, the best part is the wonderful opportunity for local industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_1004">I can assure the Deputy that we are not forgetting about any of the recommendations in the wool feasibility study. It is of precedence that we get the wool council established, which is what we are endeavouring to do. As I said at the start, however, it is not for the Department to establish it. It has to be industry-led and that was the agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005"> I know full well about the price of wool. I am a sheep farmer myself. Market forces and market demand unfortunately dictate the price of wool and it is, unfortunately, at a terribly low baseline price. The price at the moment really is quite appalling. When it is established, however, the wool council is where we will have the opportunity to explore that and have a collective voice to reach out and seek out the opportunities for wool. The sooner the council is established, the better. I will certainly try to urge the stakeholders to get that established as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1007">This question concerns the mental health of farmers. It flows from some recent reports that found that almost one in four farmers was considered to be at risk of suicide, 50% experienced moderate to extreme depression and 40% experienced moderate to extreme stress and severe anxiety. I know the Minister of State is very concerned about this issue. I would like to know what he is doing about it and what supports he needs to address the problem.</p>

            <p eId="para_1008">I thank Deputy Stanton for raising this critically important issue. As Minister of State with special responsibility for farm safety, I have always considered farmers' mental health and wellbeing to be inextricably linked to farm safety. We know that a farmer is seven times more likely to lose his or her life in a workplace incident on his or her farm than in any other profession in the country, making it by far the most dangerous workplace in the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009"> In that context, the results of the recent University College Dublin, UCD-HSE study are particularly stark when we look at their research project into farmers and developing a suicide prevention intervention for farmers in Ireland. That study found that between 2014 and 2019, in five of those six years, more farmers died by suicide than they did in farm safety incidents. That puts in context exactly the challenge with which we are dealing. The extent of the challenge we face in the area of supporting farmers whose mental health is suffering is really clear. Anecdotally, it is very much the case, having dealt with a number of different groups and organisations and with farmers, that the challenge has been in identifying where farmers are struggling and signposting the supports to them. It is not that the supports are not there. We have to do better in identifying where farmers are struggling, however, and identify where they pull back from society and are not having that social interaction or where they maybe feel things are getting on top of them. We are taking a number of measures in my Department and working with colleagues and other Departments as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010"> Government has placed a huge priority on farmer mental health and farm safety. We have a €2.5 million allocation in this year's budget. I have a number of initiatives that support increased awareness around the importance of mental health and helping farmers. I was very happy to launch and now look to expand the On Firm Ground proposal, in partnership with the Department of Health, the HSE and the Men’s Development Network, which sees farm advisers who are very trusted in the farm set-up being trained in identifying and signposting the supports for farmers. There are other initiatives as well, which I will come to in my supplementary response.</p>

            <p eId="para_1011">I thank the Minister of State for his response. I give credit to him for his huge interest in this very important area. Does the Minister of State agree with me that loneliness is a huge issue at the moment among the farming community? Farmers are on their own much of the time during the day. They are under much stress, and many changes in policies are also happening. Much bureaucracy and red tape is coming at farmers with many forms to be filled out and so on. If they get it wrong, then they do not get payments. There is misrepresentation in the media with farmers being blamed for climate change, even though the farmers I met really want to save the environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012"> Does the Minister of State agree that these are many of the issues and that there is much worry, stress and anxiety? Can we ensure that when people deal with and work with farmers, they treat them with respect and keep in mind that these issues are out there? As the Minister of State said, more farmers lose their lives through suicide than through farm accidents, which is a really horrific statement when we think about the families and people who are involved. I thank the Minister of State for his work in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1013">I completely concur. All those challenges are there, from concerns about the price of inputs, the weather, inspections, prices for their products, overall economic sustainability to all the pressures resulting from a narrative out there that farmers are to blame for many of the challenges. The real risk here for farmers is isolation. They spend all their time on their own and may live in isolation in the evenings. When their work is done, they bring those pressures back home with them. We all know a problem shared is a problem halved. That is why we are looking at developing a number of initiatives around the whole mental space and those in the community helping each other.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014"> I want to expand the On Firm Ground proposal out beyond the farm advisers, who are very trusted, to anybody who has interaction with farmers during the day, from veterinarians to the person who drives the mail van or creamery lorry and goes into that yard. They might be the only person a farmer sees from one day to the next. They should take that opportunity to be trained and become skilled in how to deal with it. A number of locally-led projects and initiatives are also really exciting and interesting.</p>

            <p eId="para_1015">I agree with everything the Minister of State said in respect of engagement and help and support. Has he engaged with HSE counselling services where farmers are concerned? This is bearing in mind that he said farmers very often work long hours. They come in very late at night when their families have maybe gone to bed. They might see nobody from one end of the day to the next. I would really urge the Minister of State to take as much action as he can. I am sure colleagues here will support him in this work, which is hugely important. The counselling services in the HSE are something at which we should also have a look.</p>

            <p eId="para_1016">We are working with the HSE and working closely with Department of Health and other State agencies such as the Health and Safety Authority, HSA, where we have a number of initiatives and literature on that area as well. We are also funding further research. The Dublin City University, DCU, farm health study has a very important role to expand our information and knowledge in this area. In the locally-led initiatives, I have supported funding of €1.8 million to eight projects around the country, four of which are directly linked with the area of mental health. The farm accident trauma response group from Embrace FARM does such great work. The mid-Leinster farmer wellbeing project is working on peer-to-peer support, which is a key element to this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">The Government cannot fix everything but we can support communities to help themselves and make sure they identify those people in isolation who are most at risk. I refer to the farmers' health and wellbeing alliance for FarmConnect and the farm succession wellbeing project in Mayo. The area of succession is another major cause of stress for farmers and in farm families in respect of how they deal with that. Those locally led initiatives are giving us very good feedback on how we handle these issues and support farmers better in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_1020">I thank the Deputy for the question. Last year, as he is probably aware, I commissioned a KPMG report to identify the challenges and opportunities for the horticulture sector. The report referred to by the Deputy in his question, "Opportunities for the Irish horticulture sector", was published in July this year. The report identifies the sector's dependence on peat as a threat in the SWOT analysis and the research challenge to finding alternative growing media. The report also proposes actions to address this and other cross-cutting challenges to the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021"> Additional actions were taken to address peat supply in horticulture, arising from a working paper published on 20 January 2022 by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. This working paper outlines a series of actions to support horticultural growers who are dependent on peat as a growing medium. The aim of these actions was to address the short-term issue of supply, the medium-term issue of future access to peat and also the longer-term issue of replacement with alternatives for all sectors within horticulture, including mushrooms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022"> In terms of short-term action for my Department on peat supply, Mr. Séamus Boland was commissioned to carry out a report on peat supply. A final version of his report has just recently been received by my Department and is due for publication shortly. On medium-term action relating to access to peat, Mr. Des Johnson and Mr. Padraig Thornton were commissioned to carry out a report on the planning requirements for peat extraction on sub-30 ha bogs. A final report of this work has also been received by my Department and will also be published shortly. The longer-term action for my Department requires research into alternatives to peat. Some €1.69 million was awarded by my Department for a research project, Beyond Peat. The project is co-ordinated by Teagasc, with project partners across Ireland. The project aims to identify full and partial replacements for peat within professional horticulture. The project is progressing well and to schedule. Separately, research projects on peat alternatives continue to be approved by my Department under the EU producer organisation scheme for fruit and vegetables. Trials are ongoing in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1023">Part of the problem is that all these reports, surveys and the whole lot are going no place. I am quite sure the Minister of State will have watched the committee meeting on 7 October or someone will have informed her what happened there. There is deep frustration in the sector because of the lack of the three Departments working together. We have been looking for months for the three Departments to come in front of the agriculture committee and we still cannot even get a meeting with them. The Minister of State can imagine the frustration of those in the industry who are depending on them to come together. There are thousands of jobs at risk. There just does not seem to be any rush with the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1024"> The Minister of State can quote the KPMG report but the report said that in the short term there is still need for domestic peat until alternatives are available. There is another report just sitting on a desk that is no good for anything. At the same time, we have a Green Party in government that is allowing 200 trucks load a ship 3,000 miles away, bring the peat across and allow another 200 trucks to unload it here and distribute it around the country. So much for the carbon footprint.</p>

            <p eId="para_1025">I would like to assure the Deputy that we are fully aware of the issues in respect of horticultural peat and the difficulty it is causing the sector. It is worth saying that currently there is no indication that supplies for the domestic horticulture sector will run out for either amenity horticulture or the mushroom sector. As the Deputy is aware, they require two distinct types of peat. Supply is being sourced within Ireland and is also being imported. It is worth drawing some attention to the CSO figures in respect of peat imports and exports. While they do not differentiate between the types of peat, between January and December 2020 we imported about - I cannot work it out - 10,000 or 10 million tonnes of peat - and we exported nearly 990,000 tonnes of peat. We exported 90 times more than we imported. In 2021, we imported 46,000 tonnes of peat and exported 579,000 tonnes. This year between January and July we imported 26,000 tonnes of peat and exported 260,000 tonnes of peat.</p>

            <p eId="para_1026">The Minister of State can give me all the figures she likes. We have had committee meeting after committee meeting with the sector and they are telling us they are in trouble for lack of peat here. The Minister of State talked about the sub-30 ha bogs. There has been no action there, according to the stakeholders. What can the Department do? Without the co-operation of the three Departments involved, everything is at a standstill. Where we are looking at it as a committee and from listening to the stakeholders, everything is at a standstill waiting for the three Departments to bang their heads together. Is it now the policy that instead of the three Departments working together, the mushroom sector and horticultural sector will be forced to continue to import peat? Imported peat from the Baltic states is now €26 per cubic metre whereas last year it was €16. Even the cost involved is going to drive companies out of business and the sector is a major employer in this country. There needs to be an awful lot more done.</p>

            <p eId="para_1028">Just to say to the Minister of State in respect of the export figures she is quoting, a large proportion of that includes all-Ireland trade which is not actually quantified because the Government does not identify it. If the Government has a real issue with exports, ban the export of peat from the island of Ireland. It will have the full support of my party in that respect. Here is the crux. Every player in the sector has told us that they are facing an existential crisis. I welcome the works that have been ongoing trying to identify alternatives to peat. The very fact that the Government is investing money in trying to find those alternatives is an acknowledgement in itself that the alternatives are not currently there. The only alternative that exists is the importation of peat from other parts of the world where we have no oversight in respect of the regulation. I have to say to the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, that he has to take ownership of this issue. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage is playing games. The Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is playing games. It will require a ministerial lead in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to grab this issue by the scruff of the neck.</p>

            <p eId="para_1040">We were concerned about this when the war broke out. What has been the impact on energy, grain availability, food prices, fertiliser availability and so on and what is being done to support the sector?</p>

            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T23:10:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1041">As I am sure the Deputy will agree, the people of Ireland have shown great support for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people following the illegal invasion by Russia. The Government remains resolute in its solidarity and support and will continue to co-ordinate a humanitarian, economic and diplomatic response to the crisis. Significant implications are being seen across all sectors, including the agrifood sector. As well as the immediate humanitarian crisis, which takes priority, we need to take the necessary steps to ensure food security is maintained for EU citizens, for the Ukrainian people and in the wider global context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042"> Significantly higher production costs are a feature across all sectors in 2022, with higher fertiliser, feed and fuel prices leading to an increase in agriculture input costs. According to the most recent agricultural price indices release by the CSO, agriculture input costs rose by 38% in the 12 months to August 2022. Fertiliser costs are up almost 130%, feed is up 36% and energy is up 41% over the past year. These three farm inputs accounted for almost half of all farm inputs in 2021.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043"> While farm output prices have also increased in the past year, the increase is lower than the rise in input prices. Output prices have increased by 31% in the 12 months to August 2022, with milk up 52%, cattle up 22%, pigs up 27% and sheep up 5%. Following a solid year for farm incomes in 2021, with average family farm incomes up by 26% to more than €34,000, Teagasc has forecast a decline in 2022 is now likely across most farm systems, apart from dairy farming, as output price increases will fail to offset the rise in production costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044"> There are currently no signs of fertiliser prices easing much in the short to medium term as prices are being driven by a number of factors, including global demand. As Russia and Ukraine are significant sources of global cereal exports, accounting for approximately 30% of world wheat and barley exports before the invasion, availability of cereals globally has been impacted.</p>

            <p eId="para_1046"> I am sure the Minister will agree the figures he has outlined are quite stark. There was an effort made at the start of the year to encourage more grain growing. What has happened in that regard? Has it worked, how many more hectares of grain have been produced as a result and what has been the impact of that?</p>
            <p eId="para_1047"> Is the Minister concerned about the availability of fertiliser next year? Many farmers buy ahead, which means they may be okay this year. What is the position for 2023? Is he concerned about the cost and availability of food? Will we be under pressure if production goes down?</p>

            <p eId="para_1048">Our assessment is that there are sufficient supplies of animal feed at present and importers are actively competing on the global market to ensure supply continues uninterrupted. However, prices are high. I meet with stakeholders on an ongoing basis to discuss the impact of the crisis on supply chains. As the Deputy knows, I established a rapid response team in my Department, along with the national fodder and food security committee, which I tasked with the preparation of a response to the emerging crisis in feed, fodder, fertiliser and other inputs and the development of contingency plans and advice to assist farmers in managing their enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049"> Since the invasion started, we have taken a number of measures, valued at €91 million all together, to assist the sector, including €56 million for the fodder support package, €20 million in two separate packages for the pig sector and €12 million for the tillage sector. Regarding grain growing, the assessment is there has been a 6% to 7% increase this year, which will make an important contribution.</p>

            <p eId="para_1050">Will the Minister outline the supports he is putting in place in respect of energy costs? I am particularly interested in the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, and the condition that energy cannot be paid for if it is exported onto the grid. Any progress made in that area would be a huge help. The number of TAMS grants this year is down. I contend this is because of the possibility of participants not being paid if they export to the grid.</p>

            <p eId="para_1051">Regarding energy and solar panel supports under TAMS, there is a requirement and conditionality where we are using EU funding that any energy produced be for on-farm use as opposed to export onto the grid. We are establishing a separate funding stream for energy production to the grid to ensure there is no impact on other TAMS applications. This scheme will allow for battery storage capacity, which will help farmers whose usage goes up and down at different times of the day. TAMS will be positive in supporting farmers to generate and use their electricity at farm level and in matching their needs in that regard to the level of TAMS-supported solar investment. Alongside these schemes, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is bringing forward a feed-in tariff to pay for energy that is coming off solar panels into the grid, which can be done separately.</p>

            <p eId="para_1054">The EIA agriculture regulations cover three different types of on-farm activities, including the restructuring of rural landholdings, which relates to the removal of hedgerows. The thresholds for proposed hedgerow removal where screening applications are required under the regulations are any length of field boundary above 500 m proposed to be removed or any proposed removal of field boundaries to create a field area greater than 5 ha.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055"> Any landholder who wishes to carry out field boundary removal that exceeds either of these thresholds must apply to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine for screening under the EIA regulations. All applications received are subject to an on-site inspection and a final decision is based on whether the proposed activity may have a significant effect on the environment. More significant works or activities likely to have a significant effect on the environment require a full EIA assessment. The Department has commenced a review of its procedures for dealing with screening applications under the EIA agriculture regulations. The Department is also committed to conducting a full review of the regulations, which will take place shortly. </p>
            <p eId="para_1056"> In addition to the EIA regulations, the new CAP strategic plan has a stronger focus on the environment through a combination of new land eligibility rules, enhanced conditionality, the eco-scheme under Pillar I and an environmentally ambitious agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, under Pillar 2. The new definition of the "eligible hectare" will avoid the incentive to remove features that are beneficial for climate or the environment. Under conditionality, farmers will have to devote at least 4% of their land to biodiversity. For the first time, this will place a direct financial value on hedgerows. The standards for the maintenance of land in good agricultural and environmental condition, GAEC, will also require farmers to retain landscape features, including hedgerows. There is also space for a nature option in the eco-scheme to recognise farmers who commit a higher proportion of their land to biodiversity. Under that scheme and the ACRES, there are hedgerow and tree planting options that will further incentivise farmers to plant trees and new hedgerows.</p>

            <p eId="para_1057">While I welcome the reviews the Minister referenced, will he indicate the timeline for their completion? I also welcome his comments on the changes in the CAP, which have been well flagged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058"> Under the EIA regulations that are in place, if one is removing a hedgerow with a length of 500 m or more or removing a field boundary, one must apply for screening, but there is otherwise no requirement to apply. This leaves out a lot of hedgerows straightaway and is a fundamental flaw in the current regulations. In the UK, there is an interim measure whereby the limit is 20 m rather than 500 m. I understand the Minister has the power to make the same reduction here. Notwithstanding the limitations of the rule, is there a sense of adherence to it? Could it be the case that many hedgerows that are greater than 500 m in length are being illegally removed? Has the Department done an analysis of illegal hedgerow removal?</p>

            <p eId="para_1059">I take the Deputy's point that the thresholds are high. Across our agricultural policy and under the new CAP strategic plan, the whole thrust of what we are doing is about trying to increase the number of hedgerows on farms and incentivise and recognise their good maintenance and protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">Therefore, the various schemes, including CAP, the eco-schemes and the environmental schemes, are very much about increasing and improving the quality of our hedgerows as well. Certainly, there is a very strong understanding among farmers themselves, and there has been a change of culture about the value of hedgerows. Going back ten or 20 years, it was about removing them and having bigger fields. Farmers now are very much geared in the other direction and see the value of having them from a stock point of view and also from an environmental point of view. The approach we are taking in CAP of recognising that financially is going to be important too. We need to seek to continue that. </p>

            <p eId="para_1061">I agree with the Minister's thoughts. There is a completely new thinking, but we need to go a lot further. It is the case that all applicants, as the Minister said, receive an on-site inspection, but it is also the case that 95% of landowners who seek approval do get full permission. All that adds up to 2,000 km of hedgerows being removed every year, which is a conservative estimate made by the EPA. Hedgerows Ireland, an organisation that I would like to commend has produced research on the issue. It has done brilliant work. As Deputy Carthy will recall, representatives of the organisation appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who have said that it is much greater than 2,000 km, citing research from Monaghan. Ultimately, our hedgerows are incredibly important. They are important for biodiversity and carbon sequestration. We really need to get on top of it, and advance and accelerate that new thinking that the Minister has talked about. I accept that the Minister is reviewing the regulations. We need to accelerate the completion of the review and reform the regulations overall.</p>

            <p eId="para_1062">I would say that 500 m is a fair size of a hedge to be removing. There must be bigger fields in County Donegal than I previously thought. The removal of hedgerows is an issue, but management is also an issue. We all know the value that hedgerows have and we talk about the potential for carbon sequestration and for promoting biodiversity, but are we seeking to promote the management of our hedgerows, and not just their removal? There are some fantastic traditional techniques that help rejuvenate hedges and make them much more stock-proof, while also promoting those biodiversity elements and really adding to the carbon sequestration potential. I know we are moving more towards a results-based model in our agri-environmental schemes. That is most welcome, because with the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, in some cases there was something planted, then removed, then replanted for the next round of GLAS. I know that we are moving to a more long-term view of results-based schemes. That is welcome. Hedgerows offer a huge opportunity in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1063">There are measures in the new ACRE scheme for encouraging and rewarding the improvement of existing hedges and how they are managed, and keeping them at a higher height to encourage wildlife and bird life, in particular, to use them. There has been a whole step change in farmers' understanding of hedges and what they contribute. That is really important. Certainly, it is a long time since I have seen a hedge removed in County Donegal. I am seeing them being put back and restored increasingly. How we can encourage that further is something we should look at. The thresholds should be considered as part of the review that is ongoing. We will have a look at it. I think the thrust of what we are doing is very strong, as is the response. Farmers deserve recognition for the change in culture that we are seeing here.</p>

            <p eId="para_1066">I think supporting small food producers is an important programme for Government commitment, as the Deputy outlined. Both the programme for Government and Food Vision 2030 acknowledge and underline the importance of our food producers, particularly our farmers and small food producers, and their importance in maintaining vibrant rural and coastal communities. Support is available to local small food producers and businesses in a variety of ways. Bord Bia has recently commissioned research, which examined, among other things, how other countries have been successful in developing premium markets for family farm produce from small producers. One of the issues outlined in that report was the barriers faced by producers. While there are lots of supports available to our smaller food producers, access to them and information on how to access them was found to be a barrier. Food producers were not aware that supports are available. In terms of supports provided, my Department administers the rural innovation and development fund, which includes an agrifood tourism initiative. For initiatives such as the development of farm shops, niche products and ecotourism, and for market development, competitiveness and innovation, support continues to be made available through the LEADER food initiative, which is funded by my Department through CAP and operated by the Department of Rural and Community Development. The new CAP strategic plan will provide supports to farmers and rural communities. The LEADER programme is a key element of that. My Department has also provided funding of almost €10 million for the equipment provided to the Prepared Consumer Foods Centre, which is based in Teagasc in Ashtown.

            <p eId="para_1067">Government policy needs to recognise the unique role of small farmers and producers, who provide incredibly high-quality food but are highly vulnerable to economic forces. While we pay lip service to this model of agriculture, as in the Minister of State's response, the reality is that farmers are being forced into fewer and fewer areas - mainly dairy - because it is the only way to make their farms viable. It is so short-sighted. Crucially, in terms of food security, greater diversity creates greater resilience. There are additional benefits that the Minister of State touched on in her response, including the fact that it helps create produce that can be marketed and used to attract tourism. I think west Cork is a really good example of what can be done there. However, this type of approach is at serious risk without any supports. Rather than just paying lip service to it, we need to really look at a return to practical local processing facilities, such as small abattoirs. As the Minister of State said, we need to look to other countries. In France, for example, producers can go to the Rungis International Market in Paris and trade themselves, giving them greater control. We could also look at Irish examples of that with some of our farmers' markets.</p>

            <p eId="para_1068">I concur with all that the Deputy has said. The value of small food producers has perhaps been ignored. That is why we fought to include the commitment to recognise that and do what we can to support local food producers in the programme for Government. Indeed, having local access to food processing is one part of that. Over the last number of decades, we have seen the demise of parts of rural Ireland in towns and villages that have lost their butchers, greengrocers and creameries that were there in years gone by. Reverse engineering out of that is going to be difficult, but we need to do what we can to support those smaller local producers. I have visited a number of small producers. Some of them might have a micro dairy on their own farm. They are able to pasteurise, bottle and perhaps sell from the farm gate. That has proven to be quite lucrative for those involved. There are also excellent examples of people direct selling their own meat. We need to support local producers and we are committed to supporting them.</p>

            <p eId="para_1069">In relation to small food producers, inshore fishers are important and often overlooked food producers. They offer guaranteed fresh fish that is sustainably caught. Those are the basics of the unique culinary landscape in places like west Cork. One of the issues that is really affecting them at the moment is rising fuel costs, which is having a severe impact on the inshore sector. I know that other countries are supporting the sector specifically in terms of fuel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">Is the Department considering that option?</p>
            <p eId="para_1071"> The seafood task force has called for increased processing capacity on offshore islands and major investment in public marine infrastructure. It was great that investment was secured through the Brexit fund but €10 million will still be required for the next four years. I am seeking clarification as to how budget 2023 will help to address that target.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072"> Also of major concern to the inshore sector, and many others, is the position on the forthcoming Common Fisheries Policy because it favours the big players. It does not even pay lip service to the inshore sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1074">I thank the Deputy. There is a fuel challenge at the moment. I put in place an extra one-month tie-up scheme at the request of the sector to support the fuel challenge that is there as a result of the illegal invasion of Ukraine. That scheme has been in place since June and will run until the end of November. I monitored fuel prices closely during the summer and there has been a lot of volatility in that regard. Prices peaked in August and dropped thereafter but have since increased again. I am reassessing the situation with regard to the need for support.</p>

            <p eId="para_1084">I thank the Deputy. I will try to be brief to allow for another question. The Animal Health and Welfare and Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2022 will provide for the statutory prohibition of fur farming. A commencement order is being drafted, which will include the commencement date for the prohibition on fur farming. We are working in close collaboration with the farms affected by the Bill. This is a significant change to their enterprises and how they have operated for many years. We are treating the farmers with the respect they have earned and deserve. While societal norms have changed towards the practice of fur farming, these farmers have always carried out their businesses to the highest of standards. For operational and practical considerations of the fur farming businesses, we are hoping to conclude discussions with the fur farmers in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1085">This is something we are anxious to see done. It is a programme for Government commitment that I want delivered. There are clearly animal welfare issues involved. Even if they are well kept, we know what end is in store for these animals. There is also an escape issue and mink, for example, are a non-native animal that wreak havoc among our native wildlife if they escape from farms. I acknowledge there is a just transition issue around structuring the exit of people who are currently fur farming from the industry. They were told for a long time that what they were doing was absolutely okay. The Government has now decided to move in a different direction. I fully accept that we must have a timeline for those in the industry to help them structure their way out of the business. That said, this was a commitment in the programme for Government. It is something I and the Green Party want delivered as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1089">I thank the Deputy. As part of the climate action plan process, I am in regular contact with the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications with regard to establishing pathways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the agriculture and land use sector. Measures to reduce emissions from our organic soils form part of the sectoral commitment and a target of 80,000 ha for reduced management intensity by 2030 of grasslands on drained organic soils was included in the climate action plan 2021 land use targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090"> I continue to fund, among other initiatives, two locally led European Innovation Partnership projects on reduced management intensity of farmed peatlands operating in the midlands. These projects have been providing lessons learned to scale up innovative actions and measures into larger agri-environment measures.

We are producing food in an environmentally friendly manner in this country and we must ensure that is at the forefront of any discussions. The deliberations the Departments of the Environment, Climate and Communications and Agriculture, Food and the Marine have with the European Commission must involve a sensible proposal.

            <p eId="para_1094">The Deputy's point is well made. It is important that we have balance in the steps we are taking. We must bring down our emissions and reduce our carbon footprint because we have to deal with the climate challenges. Alongside that, we must ensure food security because there are challenges in respect of food production. Food is becoming more difficult to produce in many parts of the world, specifically as a result of the climate issue. We must consider both of those aspects when it comes to any proposals we are considering.</p>

            <p eId="para_1095">The whole area of assessments of need has, unfortunately, moved from crisis to crisis and rushed solution to rushed solution. A series of court cases has been taken in the past year or so. These found that the approach being taken to the assessment of needs model that was in place was inconsistent with the Disabilities Act. Children were not getting adequate assessment of their needs. In many instances, children were only being seen briefly under what was called the standard operating procedure. That was struck down.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096"> Approximately five days ago, schools received a note from the Department of Education outlining the report of educational needs for the purpose of the assessment of need under the Disabilities Act 2005. To say that has alarmed and worried school staff, teachers and principals is an understatement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">They believe, and are quite entitled to believe on reading this document the Department has circulated, that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is passing the buck and is effectively asking schools, teachers and principals, to be the very first step in the assessment of need, AON, process and to be the people who are effectively involved in drafting a document which could form part of a legal document under the Disability Act, which is the assessment of need. This is grossly unfair on school staff, on parents and, of course, on children that schools are now essentially being charged with the initial screening or beginning of the assessment of need process. School staff are not qualified, by their own admission, to do an assessment of children with additional educational needs and it seems this is not in line with the Disability Act. It is certainly not in line with what Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act envisioned is in the best interests of children. Legal experts and many people involved in the special education area believe that the legal basis for this is questionable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098"> On top of that, this is simply not a sustainable approach. The courts decided that the NCSE had a role to play in this and that it would be responsible for ensuring that the educational needs were incorporated into the assessment of need. At no stage in that court case was it said that the NCSE should decide that the schools should do that, because those in schools are not educational psychologists. The schools have many very capable people who have a great deal of talents, with special education teachers and so forth, but the schools themselves would be the first to say they are not trained to assess the educational needs of children for the purpose of an assessment of need, which is a legal document which has considerable status in the Disability Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099"> This is an ill-thought-out approach and will lead to schools, principals and teachers being caught between a rock and a hard place. It could potentially lead to children not getting an appropriate or adequate assessment of need, or being passed over entirely, with all of the implications that that has for admissions to special classes at post-primary level and to special schools, for their therapies or for any supports they need through the system as a whole. This is a very badly thought-out approach and I urge the Department to reconsider it.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_433">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Dara Calleary)<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T23:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1100">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I am replying to this Topical Issue debate on behalf of the Minister of State with responsibility for special education and inclusion who could not be here this evening. It provides an opportunity to outline the current position regarding the recent changes to the assessment of need process and on the roles and responsibilities of the National Council for Special Education and schools. The AON process is provided for under the Disability Act 2005. Assessment officers under the remit of the HSE are charged with organising the assessment of need. The assessment officer makes the determination as to whether or not a child or young person meets the definition of disability contained in the Act. The assessment officer co-ordinates and completes the assessment report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101"> As referred to by Deputy Ó Laoghaire, since a court ruling in October 2021, there is now a legal obligation on the education system to assist the HSE as part of the HSE's assessment of need process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102"> The Department of Education and NCSE have worked intensively to ensure the process put in place adheres to legal obligations arising from the HSE's AON process, and is one that is rooted in existing good practice in schools. Under the Disability Act 2005, the NCSE is obliged to nominate a person with appropriate expertise to assist in the education assessment process. Where the child is enrolled in a school the Education of Persons with Special Education Needs Act 2004 names the principal as the person the NCSE should contact. Identification of education needs is central to the way schools provide for the inclusion and participation of all students and to providing an education which is appropriate to a student's abilities and needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103"> In that regard, it is important to note that schools routinely identify students' needs. This aligns with the obligations on schools arising from the Education Act 1998. They use a range of assessment practices as part of the continuum of support process. This is a problem-solving model of assessment and intervention that enables schools to gather and analyse data about each individual pupil's education needs, as well as for planning and review of the progress of individual pupils. The continuum of support framework enables the school to identify, address and review progress in meeting the academic, social and emotional needs of the pupil, as well as the physical, sensory, language and communication needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104"> Schools have been provided with a range of resources to ensure that the education needs of all students, including those with a disability or other additional education needs, are identified and supported. The Department of Education issued guidelines for primary and post-primary schools on how they should identify and provide for the special education and learning needs of students in 2017.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105"> Information derived from the school's assessments in education are recorded in a student support file. In line with best educational practice, the student support file details a student's education needs, as identified by the school. The information contained in the student support file is used in completing the educational component of the assessment of need form which is returned to the HSE via the NCSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106"> The Department of Education and the NCSE are conscious of the workload on schools and on school leaders and, in that regard, an extensive consultation process on the educational component of the assessment of need process was undertaken prior to its introduction. This process involved schools, advocacy groups, management bodies and unions. The Department of Education and the NCSE worked with a small number of schools on a draft of the documents required as part of the HSE's assessment of need process. The schools provided valuable feedback on the form and guidance documents which was used to inform the documents that have been issued to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107"> The Department of Education and the NCSE have put in place a suite of supports to assist schools in completing the educational component of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108"> Based on numbers supplied by the HSE, it is not expected that individual schools will have to comply with large numbers of individual requests but if this happens, and I can give a guarantee to the Deputy in the House, the dedicated NCSE resource team will work closely with the relevant schools concerned to facilitate the process.</p>

            <from>Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T23:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1109">There are two very different things at issue here. On the one hand, where a school believes a child might need additional support or may have an additional need, it will talk to the HSE and the NCSE about how that child can be supported. Schools have a role undoubtedly in that and principals and teachers are well-placed to identify somebody who potentially may need additional support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110"> It is an entirely different thing but it is completely back-to-front for the NCSE to put the responsibility for filtering that onto the school. It is one thing to say that a child may need additional support but it is another thing entirely for the NCSE to be expecting the first part of this process in the assessment of educational needs to start with the school. It changes the relationship quite substantially. A school support plan is a working document which outlines a plan to ensure the child can progress. This changes the nature of that document completely because it can now potentially form part of a legal document under the Disability Act. If the school support plan is now being equated with part of an assessment of need, then what one has been doing with the school support plan, which is a live working document and an instrument of education, changes completely. I want to emphasise that this is putting teachers between a rock and a hard place because parents will be impressing on them the fact that there are needs. The teachers may not agree but the teachers are not educational psychologists. They may miss a child, or they may miss the needs of a child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111"> This is not terribly complicated when one boils it all down and when one looks at the documents. I have to say these are not the clearest documents but it is educational psychologists who should be doing this work. If there is an additional budget, as there is for the NCSE, why is it not being put to use for this?</p>

            <p eId="para_1112">Again, I would like to thank the Deputy for raising this issue but I would draw his attention to the fact, and he would know this, the Education Act 1998 requires schools to identify and support the education needs of all of their students and to use school resources to provide for those education needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has set out guidance and frameworks to assist primary, post-primary and special schools and classes in the identification of educational need. Since 2017 and the introduction of the special education teacher model, the identification of educational needs has been central to the way schools provide for the inclusion and participation of all students. This marked a significant shift from a diagnostic-driven system of allocating support to a front-loaded, responsive and needs-led model. Schools are required to use their available resources to ensure that the education needs of all students, including those with a disability or other additional educational needs, are identified and provided for. It is, therefore, proposed that this approach to identifying education need in schools, an approach which is comprehensive, robust, evidence-informed and appropriate to the education sector at this time, is also appropriate for the purpose of identifying education needs under the Disability Act. I am assured that the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, is satisfied that the educational component of the assessment of need process is child-centred, in line with educational good practice and ensures that schools, who hold all of the relevant information on the child, are supported in providing this detail to the HSE. I assure the Deputy that the Department of Education and the NCSE will continue to provide support to schools as needed. I will certainly reflect Deputy Ó Laoghaire's concern to the Minister of State and ask that guidance be given in that regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Neasa Hourigan<recordedTime time="2022-10-25T23:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_1114">As the Minister of State will appreciate, one of the strongest elements of our democracy is the energy and commitment of our community and activist groups. These are ordinary citizens who band together to enter into debate, to bring attention to injustice and to lift up their voices. I have had positive experiences with these groups and these people, even when we disagree. That is why I am so disheartened to see a shadow cast over this community over the past few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115"> As the Minister of State will no doubt be aware, there has been a lot of public discourse on defamation. I welcome the Government's commitment to legislate against strategic lawsuits against public participation, SLAPPs in the coming months. These are meritless or vexatious lawsuits taken by powerful individuals or organisations against weaker parties who express an opinion or convey information on a public matter that is perceived as unfavourable or uncomfortable to the powerful. However, I have been made aware of a further unseen layer of this activity that would not, and could not, be impacted by the proposed legislation. While SLAPP legislation will address initiated legal action, often on defamation, as far as I understand it, it will not cover actions prior to that initiation and their interaction with non-disclosure agreements, NDAs. What I am describing is a process whereby a person or entity instructs a legal representative to write a letter threatening legal action, sometimes demanding an apology, usually demanding some financial restitution and, increasingly and more worryingly, demanding the signing of an NDA, all without any court being troubled at any time. The Coalition against SLAPPs in Europe is tracking cases like this and would welcome hearing from anyone impacted by them, as would I. </p>
            <p eId="para_1116"> To provide an example, a columnist in one of our national newspapers, Mr. David Quinn, has threatened legal action against a member of a group advocating for safe access zones for women accessing abortions. He has asked not only for money and an apology, but also the signing of an NDA. Mr. Quinn has targeted this group in his columns before and his opinions cannot reasonably be disentangled from those of his employer, the Iona Institute. This is relevant because we know that foreign money is flooding into Ireland and other European countries to stoke discord. In 2021, the European Parliamentary Forum for Sexual and Reproductive Rights published a report called The Tip of the Iceberg. That report outlined the Iona Institute's interaction with funds from Fondazione Novae Terrae. This foundation bankrolls activity against what it describes as new or secular rights such as reproductive rights, marriage equality and trans rights. The possible involvement of the Iona Institute here is relevant because its 2020 financial statements showed that it did not incur legal expenses. If its director enjoys the same luxury, a great many activists and groups in Ireland could have received similar letters from Mr. Quinn but, of course, neither we nor the Government will ever know that because the NDAs are in place and the matters in question will never get to court. I ask that any review of the Defamation Act 2009, any SLAPP legislation and any legislation at all in this area would examine what additional protections can be put in place for activists and groups in the pre-court phase of this type of activity.</p>

            <p eId="para_1117">I thank the Deputy. I convey the apologies of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who regrets she cannot be here for this matter owing to another commitment. She recognises that SLAPP proceedings are a significant potential threat to freedom of expression and to public participation, both in Ireland and internationally, particularly in respect of investigative journalism on matters of public interest. The programme for Government commits to a review of Ireland's defamation laws, as do the Department of Justice's Statement of Strategy 2021-2023 and the Minister's justice plan. The Department has carried out a review of the Defamation Act 2009, the report on which was published in March.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118"> On 27 April 2022, the European Commission published a proposal for a directive that aims to provide common procedural safeguards at EU level against SLAPPs. Ireland opted into the adoption and application of the proposed anti-SLAPP directive, in accordance with Protocol 21 of the Treaty on European Union-Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, in early July 2022. The proposed directive is now under consideration by a working party of the European Council and the Minister's officials are contributing to that discussion. The objectives of the Commission's proposed anti-SLAPP directive are compatible with those of our proposed reforms to defamation law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119"> The Department's defamation report includes a recommendation to "introduce a new 'anti-SLAPP' mechanism, to allow a person to apply to court for summary dismissal of proceedings that he/she believes are a SLAPP". A defamation (amendment) Bill to advance reforms following the review is included in the Government's autumn legislation programme. The Department is working on the general scheme of the amending Bill. The Minister hopes that the drafting of the general scheme will be completed as soon as possible. It is intended that we will take full account of the development of the anti-SLAPPs directive during its reading before the European Council. The Minister will also be taking full account of the new EU Digital Services Act as it pertains to online defamation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120"> Ensuring that journalism can flourish and that journalists can carry out their work safely and free from harassment is a responsibility shared by all democratic governments. Earlier this year, a new journalist safety group was set up comprising representatives of An Garda Síochána and representatives of the media and the National Union of Journalists. The group will allow journalists and An Garda Síochána to work in collaboration to make sure journalists are free from threats and violence. A Garda liaison officer has been appointed and steps taken to facilitate the reporting and addressing of individual complaints of harassment and abuse of journalists. In light of the importance of these matters, the Minister intends that a representative of the Department will join the group. The forum will allow regular discussion on how best to address matters of journalist safety including the increasing phenomena of online harassment and the making of online threats.</p>

            <p eId="para_1121">I thank the Minister of State. As I have said, I welcome the Government's work on this. I am particularly happy to hear an answer that flags the issue in respect of journalists in particular because I am aware of a number of journalists who are experiencing what I described in my previous contribution. Everyone is entitled to his or her good name. I would not argue that for a second. No one should have to deal with abuse in any form, whether online or in person. All of us in this Chamber know that people of prominence are likely to be the subject of harsh criticism and fairly critical engagement. Who we, as prominent people, choose to ignore and who we demand money, apologies and silence from matters and is relevant. If someone has been maligned or defamed and an individual then retracts their comments, there should be no need for NDAs. I hope future legislation can recognise that. If your grievance and good name have been vindicated, that should be public knowledge. It would be important to include that in legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1122">I thank the Deputy for that final comment. As we prepare to reform our defamation laws, further remedies are available to journalists and activists who are subject to harassment when carrying out their work. For example, harassment within the meaning of section 10 of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 carries a maximum penalty of up to ten years in prison. Any assault causing harm on any person is an offence under section 3 of the same Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">A person convicted of such an offence would be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to a maximum fine of €2,500 or both. The Minister has signalled her intention to increase the maximum penalty available for this offence to ten years' imprisonment in amendments to the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is currently before the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1124"> There is also Coco's Law, which the Minister commenced last year. Coco's Law strengthens the Government's response to harm perpetrated online as well as offline and ensures that individuals who commit crimes in contravention of this legislation can be brought to justice. This important Act not only created new offences relating to intimate image abuse, it also broadened the scope of the existing offence of harassment and increased the maximum penalty applicable. It provides for an offence of sending, distributing or publishing a threatening or grossly offensive message to or about another person with intent to cause harm. It also broadened the scope of the current offence of harassment under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act, which previously referred to communication to a person. It now includes persistent communication about a person, sometimes referred to as indirect harassment. The maximum penalty for harassment has been increased from seven years to ten years to reflect the harm caused by the most serious forms of harassment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1125">I thank the Leas Ceann-Comhairle for selecting this Topical Issue tonight. It is raining cats and dogs and we had huge rainfall Sunday night of last week in many parts of the country, including in south Tipperary. Thurles town was badly affected as were Cahir, Cashel and Tipperary town. It was unprecedented rainfall. I must mention the lack of maintenance of our roads with the cuts to personnel. I have to single out Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, and the National Roads Association, NRA, before it. They developed fine motorways through Tipperary. We see TII regularly doing maintenance with road markings and hedge cutting. I am told by adjoining landowners it does not do any maintenance on the drainage. I am speaking about the drainage that is sometimes cut out or sometimes a road is high. The roads were cut through land and through rivers and streams. I pointed out at the time that in many cases a number of small culverts were put in place rather than one eye of a bridge. They are all getting blocked with debris from forestry and everything else. It is natural debris. There is damage being done to people's homes and properties. I know of part of a farm that was washed away by a torrent coming down from the Galtee Mountains in the parish of Ballylooby. We must have respect for land owners and property owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126"> The cost of projects this year has gone spiralling upwards in the council. Its maintenance budget is exhausted much earlier than in any other year because of the increased cost. The cost of projects has massively increased because of the cost of fuel and oil-based products, including bitumen and tar. Tipperary County Council is in a perilous situation because it has exhausted most of its road and maintenance budget. Now it is faced with a bill of up to €500,000. I understand from the director of services, through my daughter, Councillor Máirín McGrath, that a letter will be arriving in the Department imminently from James Swords, the senior engineer, and Paul Farrell who is also an engineer. It will state this amount of money will be needed to repair the damage that has been done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127"> The big problem is a lack of maintenance and lack of accountability. The motorway was developed with compulsory purchase orders and we avail of it. A project cannot be built and then walked away from. We must go to the upper echelons of it and check the drainage and maintain it. It is not just the motorway. We have to have access in terms of fencing to prevent animals going on to it. It is a serious situation. The funding bill will be sent in. Unsuspecting motorists drive on the motorway with torrents of rain crossing it because of the lack of drainage. It is an extremely dangerous situation. Many people have been seriously injured and worse on the motorway. It is the same with the motorway to Limerick at Portlaoise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1128"> We have spent money on the motorways but we must maintain the curtilage and the percolation and drainage areas around them. Above all we must protect life and limb. We must also protect the property of farmers, householders and farmyards. Above all we must protect households. The council staff and the general services supervisor went out. As I said here one day, one of them, Walter Doheny, suffered a minor heart attack while on duty at night. He has recovered. I spoke to him on Sunday and thanks be to God he is fine. Council workers go out to try to sort it out as do fire brigades. We should not be putting these people in this type of danger. We need proper maintenance and proper service of the projects to take place.</p>

            <p eId="para_1129">The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of the relevant local authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993. Works on these roads are funded from the council's own resources supplemented by State road grants. I know from the Deputy's contribution there was an intense rainfall event in County Tipperary over a short period of time. I am aware that the flooding affected properties over quite an area. Unfortunately these severe weather events are becoming more frequent and they highlight the need to focus on the measures needed to address climate change.</p>
            <p eId="para_1130"> As regards the impact on regional and local roads, I can confirm that Tipperary County Council has made initial contact with the Department. It is understood, and I have picked up through Deputy McGrath who mentioned Councillor McGrath, that the council will be making a submission to the Department seeking funding to assist with repair works caused by the severe weather event.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131"> In relation to funding options for repair works, it is established practice that local authorities are advised by the Department that a contingency provision should be reserved from the overall resources available to each local authority for regional and local roads so as to deal with damage caused by severe weather conditions. As regards the Department's grants, local authorities may carry out repairs from the regional and local road grants available to them and from their own resources. In this context it is open to each council to determine and reprioritise its work programme following severe weather events. Where this is not feasible, such as in this case as I gather from Deputy McGrath, the Department always tries to work with local authorities to facilitate the management of repair works in these situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132"> Once a submission is received from Tipperary County Council which identifies the works required together with an estimate of the cost, it will be reviewed by Department officials and the Department will liaise further with Tipperary County Council on the necessary repair works and the timing of the works. In the event that national roads were affected in the manner described by the Deputy, Transport Infrastructure Ireland has stated that it is necessary to carry out a survey and hydrological assessment of the culverts and drains in the affected area to understand the cause behind the flooding and to quantify the details and costs of any works to be completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1133">It is late at night and we are all tired but this is balderdash. TII did the hydrological studies and everything else and it did not put in big enough culverts. We argued, as did farmers who knew the area and its topography, but it did not listen. Now we have a problem because it will not do maintenance. It cannot just develop a project. People cannot just build a house and forget to clean the chutes. We have this folly every time we ask a question about flooding. We hear about climate change. It just does not cut it for me. We are not climate change deniers but rivers are not cleaned and neither are gullies or streams. What happens? Every bit of dirt that runs off of this building ends up in a river, as is the case with every other building, field and roadway. I do not say forget about climate change but we need to clean the river basins and above all maintain the motorways. It makes me very angry to listen to people blame climate change. We can get downpours of rain but if the gullies and culverts are cleaned and maintained, they will take 90% of it. There might be a 10% to overflow. We see farmyards flooded because of a torrent of rain. The same places were flooded 20 years ago during the development of the motorway, or before it was developed. There are issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134"> TII, which was the NRA, is not maintaining or looking after the curtilage of the projects. In the case of ordinary roads the county council workers are not on the ground and we all know this. Maintenance is not being done. The hard-pressed taxpayers and ratepayers are being discommoded, with their businesses and homes destroyed. Numerous houses and businesses in Thurles were flooded. They will not get insurance because it is a recurring event.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">It is mainly because of blocked gullies and inverts. That is basic maintenance and it is not being done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136"> The Minister of State said to go back to their existing budget. They cannot, on 1 November, go back. The budget is expended in normal years but this year, especially because of the increased costs of materials, the budget is completely expended. They need a dig-out from the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137"> Above all, we need to revisit this and do maintenance, not fire brigade work, afterwards.</p>

            <p eId="para_1142">Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta Calleary fá choinne a cheapachán mar Aire Stáit. Guím ádh mór air sa phost úr. This is one of the downsides of getting that recent elevation. If Deputy Calleary had not got it, he would be home in his bed now. However, the Minister of State is here into the early hours of the morning. I am glad he is here. This issue does not relate to his Department but I know he will use his influence and communication skills to pass on a couple of messages.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143"> I want to raise an issue in relation to Creeslough in my supplementary, but the purpose of this Topical Issue matter is to raise what I believe is a case of discrimination against students. I do not know how many people in the Minister of State's constituency of Mayo would be going to Magee college in Derry, Queen's University or Jordanstown. It is the case that a student in west Donegal going to Galway who has a Leap card will get upwards of a 50% rebate on the cost of transportation to Ollscoil na Gaillimhe. However, a student from that same parish in west Donegal who is going to Belfast does not get the rebate. There is some sort of a nominal rebate as far as the Border but once the bus hits the Border there is no rebate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144"> I am encouraged by some of the correspondence I have seen to the effect that there are ongoing discussions but, quite frankly, a meeting needs to be held. Ongoing discussions means that there has been a meeting or maybe more than one meeting, but now there needs to be another meeting. Heads need to be put together here because students feel discriminated against.</p>
            <p eId="para_1145"> Students have always gone to the North. Traditionally, a big percentage of students from my county have gone across the Border and they feel discriminated against. If the granny or granddad of one of these students has a pension and is over 66 years of age, she or he will get free transportation to Belfast. I accept that this comes from a different Department, the Department of Social Protection. I will set out the question I am putting to the Minister of State tonight. If a senior citizen in west Donegal can get free transportation to Belfast, involving a 100% rebate from one Department, why does their grandson or granddaughter not get any rebate as a student in Belfast, Derry or Coleraine? That is my case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146"> I ask the Minister of State tonight, or rather this morning, to use his position to ask one of his own officials to make contact. I do not know if officials from the National Transport Authority, NTA, will be up at this time of the morning listening to this debate. No doubt they will not, but I hope that there will be follow-up. This is a matter that can and should be, and certainly needs to be, resolved. At the end of the day, if a student in Letterkenny heading down to the beautiful city of Galway is getting 50% back by having a Leap card and his or her next-door neighbour in Letterkenny going to Belfast has to pay the full whack, there is something wrong.</p>

            <p eId="para_1147">I thank Deputy McHugh for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. As Deputy McHugh confirmed, it relates to young adults travelling from the South to the North of Ireland using the Leap card scheme. As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Transport has responsibility for policy and overall funding in relation to public transport. However, the Department is not involved in the day-to-day operation of public transport services. The NTA has statutory responsibility for securing the provision of public passenger transport services nationally by way of public transport service contracts, and for the allocation of associated funding to the relevant operators. I assure the House that the Government is strongly committed to providing all citizens with reliable and realistic sustainable mobility options. Public transport plays a key role in the delivery of this goal. In budget 2022, the Department of Transport secured €538 million of funding for public service obligation, PSO, and Local Link services that are provided by State operators and are under contract by the NTA this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1148"> As the House will be aware, in recognising the importance of incentivising more young people to use public transport, as part of budget 2022, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, secured €25 million of funding for the introduction of the young adult card. This exciting initiative allows any person nationwide who is between the ages of 19 and 23 to avail of an entitlement to discounted travel costs, and to increase the level of discount over and above the current student discount to an average discount of 50% across all services, including city, intercity and rural services. Mature students in full-time education are also included in the scheme as are eligible visitors to Ireland within the young adult age cohort. The young adult card was initially introduced on PSO services on 9 May and then extended to participating commercial bus operators on 4 September. This extension of the scheme to the commercial sector means that the 50% fare discount for holders of a young adult card - those aged between 19 and 23 - or student Leap card is now available on bus services provided by participating commercial bus operators. It is important to note that this discount is in addition to the 20% average fare discount on PSO services that was introduced in May as part of a suite of Government measures to help to combat the rising cost of living.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149"> The Deputy has raised an interesting anomaly, which is that the grandparents of some of these students are able to travel on an all-island basis. I certainly will raise that with the Department of Transport. I encourage the Deputy to raise the issue directly with the shared island unit in Roinn an Taoisigh to pursue that anomaly, but also to promote the shared island initiative. This anomaly is something that should be further addressed in the context of the all-island strategic rail review. I will certainly address it to the Department of Transport. I thank the Deputy for his good wishes.</p>

            <p eId="para_1150">I will not elaborate further, but I am glad that the Minister of State has not read some of the prepared reply into the record. It is pure dynamite to say we will subsidise up to the Border, given that since 2016 we have been saying we do not want a hard border on the island. Now a Department is subsidising up to the Border but not further. Incidentally, if one is going from Letterkenny to Dublin, the fare is subsidised. Anyway, it is dynamite. The Minister of State's suggestion about the shared island unit is an excellent one.</p>
            <p eId="para_1151"> In the brief time I have remaining, I want to raise a specific issue in relation to Creeslough. We will have time set aside in two weeks to discuss in more depth the situation in the aftermath of the Creeslough tragedy. The specific issue is that due to the ongoing investigation, the main route through Creeslough is closed. Of the two pick-up and drop-off points for the community from Creeslough and even into Dunfanaghy, one is Falcarragh and the other is Termon. I am asking tonight if we could get somebody from the Department of Transport to reach out to a member of the community - I can facilitate that - to try to introduce a short-term shuttle service for people who wish to avail of this transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_1152">People who avail of public transport do not have a car, so they are looking to get taxis or to get neighbours to take them farther distances. This is very frustrating for so many people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1153"> I would ask for a contact person in the Department to give me a ring me tomorrow. I can link them up with a member of the community to put that service in place. We are probably only talking about a week. I do not know how long the investigation will continue; it is potentially another week. I do not have that information, as it is a prerogative of the Garda.</p>
            <p eId="para_1154"> One of the answers I will get back will be there has to be a tendering process. We have to use our common sense here. People are still dealing with this enormous tragedy, and the tragedy will be with the community for a long time into the future. It is about what we can do now in the short window we have available to fix things with a bit of common sense, such as a person picking up the phone and trying to get this sorted. I think it can be done. In fairness to Donegal County Council and all the Departments, they are all working hard to try to do the right and best thing. This is just one little thing that could help enormously.</p>
