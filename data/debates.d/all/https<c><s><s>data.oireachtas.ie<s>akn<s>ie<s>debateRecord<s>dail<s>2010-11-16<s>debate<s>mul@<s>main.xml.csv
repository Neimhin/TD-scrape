#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.The Quigley report, which was published in 2005, highlighted the need for special care in cases where a proposed consultancy comprises an element of direct service to a Minister or Minister of State, particularly in the public relations or communications area, and-or where a Minister or a Minister of State suggests the name of a person or enterprise as being suitable.  Following publication of the Quigley report, additional guidelines to be followed in such cases were approved by the Government and are published on the Department's website.  The guidelines were brought to the attention of all Secretaries General, who were asked to implement them and to bring them in future to the attention of all newly-appointed Ministers, and Ministers of State where relevant, in their Department or office.There is no special committee in my Department to oversee the awarding of public relations contracts by Ministers.  Any workload arising from the application of these additional guidelines is handled within existing resources in the Government secretariat.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The July 2008 statement by the Minister for Finance indicated that all expenditure by Departments and agencies on consultancies, advertising and public relations would be reduced for the remainder of that year and by at least 50% in 2009.  I note from the Taoiseach's departmental Estimates that consultancies went up from just over €3,000 in 2009 to €70,000 in 2010.  Given the Department of Finance's commitment to cut public relations and consultancies, what was the money used for this year?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	2	If the Deputy tables a question I will have the direct answer for him.  The question put asked me to report on the recent work of a committee in the Department that oversees the awarding of public relations contracts.  I am not aware of the issue that he refers to but we can check it out.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	3	There are three questions.  The question from Deputy Gilmore refers to the supervision by the Taoiseach's Department of public relations contracts.  Radio advertisements were placed last year by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government notifying the public about areas of special protection in coastal areas in Dublin.  This cost the taxpayer €23,000.  This was only one of several media campaigns as part of which the Minister's Department spent over €3 million in 2009 alone.  Were these contracts of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government approved by the public relations contracts committee?  Was there any evaluation of the value and impact of the campaigns?  What evaluations were carried out by the public relations contracts committee following the public relations campaign?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	4	As I indicated to the Deputy, that is not its role and there is no committee in existence which deals with that issue.  This relates to the Quigley report which arose from the need to provide some extra guidelines for Ministers and their Ministers of State in respect of the public relations or communications area where a Minister or Minister of State might suggest the name of a person or enterprise as being suitable.  This was the specific issue dealt with by that committee.  Where a Department proposes to engage consultants, the fact would only be brought to my attention where there is an element of direct service to a Minister, especially in a public relations or communications area, and where the Minister has suggested the name of a person or enterprise as being suitable.  If these criteria are not applicable, then there is no need for my approval or for referral to the Government secretariat.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Is there a public relations contracts committee in existence or is this a free-for-all?  I understood there was a committee which dealt with contracts to be awarded to public relations companies by Ministers or their Departments.  I made the point previously that the House has been vacated by Government for major announcements; they have taken place everywhere but here.  There is a Government information service which could deal with all of these matters.  Naturally, each Department wishes to play its part in putting its piece of the jigsaw in place.  In view of the seriously constrained circumstances we are in now, is it proposed to review this and have a central Government information service carry out all of these things or will we continue with public relations committees and consultants for each Department?  The situation to which I referred involving the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and special protection areas is important.  Let us bear in mind that we have taken these to the ultimate limit in this country.

In a case I heard about recently, a family that had returned from Boston could not fish because they could not get tonnage, could not cut turf because they were in an SAC area, could not build a house within sight of the sea, and could not graze sheep on the mountain because of SAC restrictions.  What in the name of God are we at?  Yet the Taoiseach is spending public money on promoting these things.  Common sense has gone out the window.

Everything we do must be in compliance with the law, whether it is planning law or any other type.There has been a reduction of more than €25 million in expenditure on advertising, public relations and consultancies, as announced by the Minister for Finance in February 2009.  There are public information campaigns about issues that must be brought to the attention of the public in the areas of health, the environment and so on.  This is done by Departments and local authorities, and such campaigns serve a purpose.There is no committee in existence to oversee public relations contracts and there never has been.  Proposals which fall under the two criteria I mentioned in my reply are referred to the Government secretariat.  Otherwise, matters must be dealt with under the reduced budgets of Departments themselves.

The Taoiseach has indicated that any such examination is not undertaken by a committee.  Can he be more specific about whether there is a designated person within the Government secretariat, his own Department or anywhere else who has responsibility for this?  Is there any up-to-date reappraisal of the context in which work that is contracted out is approved?  Has there been any re-examination of the parameters within which a project is acceptable, in the context of current economic difficulties?  If there has not been a recent review of the criteria, will the Taoiseach undertake to have such a review?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Government Information Service has no role whatsoever in the procurement of PR consultants by Departments.  It has its own role to fulfil.  There are public information services available throughout Departments.  Guidelines have been set out on consultancies and where there is a direct service to a Minister or a name is suggested by a Minister as being suitable, the proposal must be forwarded to the Government secretariat for approval.  Expenditure in this area has been greatly reduced as part of the overall drive for efficiency and reductions in non-essential expenditure.

To his knowledge, has that approval ever not been forthcoming?With regard to the criteria mentioned by the Taoiseach, is he personally aware of the conditions that have been set under which contracted-out PR work is within the Government's guidelines?  Has there been any re-examination of this?  Is he happy that in all cases the decision to put work out to contract was the correct one?Have concerns been expressed by any of the Department press offices or the Government press office about the continued contracting out of PR work?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I am not aware of any issues that arise that are not within the guidelines.  Regarding departmental press offices and so forth, as the Deputy knows the technologies available today can be released by e-mail, through text messaging, paper press release, etc.  It is necessary that Government be able to provide immediate up-to-date information with 24-hour media coverage involved.  I understand that all of these issues are looked at within Departments in terms of available resources and there has been a significant reduction in all headings.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Did I hear the Taoiseach correctly say that the number of occasions when a Minister needed to use the procedure recommended in the Quigley report, whereby when a particular PR consultant is being recommended by the Minister himself or herself it needs to go to the Secretary General to the Government, was two since 2005?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Regarding the number of cases referred to the Government secretariat, eight cases that came within the guidelines have been processed.  Since September 2008 I agreed to the appointment by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources of a consultant to conduct a facilitation exercise in connection with the consultation paper on next generation broadband.  In 2007 one case was noted by my predecessor following consideration by the Secretary General to the Government regarding an invitation to tender for consultancy work by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  I understand that the candidate concerned was not subsequently in the tender competition.  There were two cases related to the appointment of an arts adviser at the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.  My predecessor approved one of those appointments in 2005, following appropriate prior consideration by the Secretary General to the Government.  On the resignation of the original post holder my predecessor approved the appointment of a successor to the post in 2006.  The four other cases referred to the Secretary General to the Government were, on consideration by him, found not to fall within the scope of the guidelines and so did not require consideration or approval.  These related to the appointment of IT and communications consultants.

One also related to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in 2007.  Was that in the lifetime of the present Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government?

Why was the PR work concerned not considered to be a normal part of the press or PR work of the two respective Departments?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	19	It was not in the PR area; it was consultancy in respect of technical work.  There was not just PR work involved.  It is referred up to us when there is an element of direct service to a Minister or where the Minister has suggested the name of a person or enterprise as being suitable.  They are not all PR issues.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 6, inclusive, together.The OECD review of the Irish public service, Towards an Integrated Public Service, published in April 2008, benchmarked the public service in Ireland against other comparable countries and made recommendations as to the further direction of public service reform.  The programme is designed to create flexibility in the deployment of people and other resources, to improve performance by organisations and individuals and to address the immediate priority of securing maximum value for public spending.  The public service agreement, agreed at Croke Park, provides the industrial relations environment for the successful implementation of the transforming public services agenda.To date, progress has been made across a broad range of areas of the TPS programme.  In the human resource area, for example, there have been four main instruments that have contributed to the implementation of expenditure savings, notably the incentivised scheme of early retirement in the public service, the special Civil Service career break scheme, the shorter working year scheme and the moratorium on the filling of public service vacancies by recruitment or promotion.  There has already been a reduction of 12,000 in public service numbers since the end of 2008 with no reduction in services.  In addition, recently a voluntary early retirement and a voluntary redundancy scheme have been approved for certain categories of staff in the public health service.  The purpose of the schemes is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform.An e-Government strategy has been put in place.  It is being implemented to achieve an improvement in the use of electronic means for delivering public services, and the savings that go with that.  It should be noted that according to the latest EU Commission e-Government benchmarks, Ireland's ranking for online sophistication has improved from 17th position before the report came forward to joint 7th position.  A rolling e-Government programme that includes 20 individual projects has been initiated and is operational.A national procurement service was also established on foot of the transforming public services agenda.  It is about improving the public service's buying power by organising procurement of common goods and services across the public service.  It is achieving better value on procurement spend and savings in the region of €35 million have been identified and implemented already.  With regard to shared services, work is ongoing on specific proposals and there are significant potential savings associated with such initiatives.  Work is being advanced on shared services in several sectors, in areas that include human resources, pensions administration, payroll and financial management.There has been an extension of the operation of the organisational review programme so that all Departments and major offices will be reviewed by the end of 2012.  Work is also progressing on the development of new performance and governance frameworks for State agencies and the greater use of service level agreements.  This is happening against a background of agency amalgamation and abolition and fewer staff numbers.  There has also been the reconstitution of the top level appointments committee.The terms of the Croke Park agreement provide a means by which we can radically transform the public service through greater flexibility, redeployment, changed work practices and overall reductions in numbers.  We will require good leadership from management as well as staff if the commitment to avoid further pay reductions and compulsory redundancies is to be honoured.  The Government has no wish to back away from the commitment into which it entered at Croke Park, but it can do this only on the basis of full and comprehensive delivery by all of the parties.  The Government considers that any party that chooses to remain outside the provisions of the agreement cannot expect to benefit from the commitments it gave as part of the agreement.  That is our clear position.That is an update of the progress to date on this matter.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Page 38 of the report from the OECD states that for real change to take place in the public service there must be a culture of change embedded in the service.  Does the Taoiseach believe a culture of real change exists there?  What is his vision for the public service five years from now?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	22	It will require a great deal of leadership on an ongoing basis at all levels of the service to implement the vision set out in the transforming public services strategy.  A great many people are ready for that challenge.  The Croke Park agreement is important in that it provides the necessary industrial relations framework in which all this change can be implemented in an ordered and sensible manner and in a way that meets the agreements that have been set out.  In the coming year, on foot of the Croke Park agreement, one will see resources being allocated.  Obviously, there are fewer resources available to the State than was the case in the past.  That itself would be a driver for change.  The framework of the Croke Park agreement enables people to work within allocated budgets to provide the maximum efficiencies, redeployments and changes that will be necessary.  This will vary from location to location as well as sector to sector.  Even within sectors, there may be different resolutions to various issues depending on the situation on the ground and where the flexibility and redeployment can be applied.Under the Croke Park agreement, it is envisaged the resolution of these issues would be dealt with primarily at local level.  Any reference to the implementing body, therefore, would be more the exception than the rule.  It is important the agreement works in that way.We are all anxious to see this change accelerated.  It will be driven by the budgetary allocations made for the coming year.  We have already seen good examples where this has occurred.  I remain confident the Croke Park agreement will deliver the changes it set out and to which the parties concerned are committed.  It is challenging but I believe there is sufficient nous and leadership at local level to see it through.  Both management and union representatives will have to provide this to achieve this outcome.Everyone who works in the public service will be aware the taxpayer is not in a position to provide resources to the same extent as before.  Accordingly, changes internally in how services are delivered and being flexible and creative about this is fundamental to maintaining the best possible service for the citizen, who must be at the centre of all our concerns, and in ensuring the organisational arrangements are to maximum and optimum effect.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I believe in a public service that has a clear strategy and one in which all public servants can feel they contribute to the good of their country and the welfare of their community when they go home from work.The Taoiseach said no reduction in services has taken place with the lessening of numbers of public servants.  How can this be if, for example, 600 psychiatric nurses have gone with none replaced?  The Department of Finance now controls the authorisation for the filling of every position.  If it decides a post for a clinical nurse manager, grade 2, or a manager of a suite of operating theatres is not to be replaced, how can there have not been a reduction in services?  How can the author of that report for the Taoiseach claim no reduction in services has occurred when it is impossible to measure up when 600 psychiatric nurses, for example, leave the health service?Many of the young nurses who left for England and other places in the past several years are now returning to Ireland.  They are employed by nursing agencies at enormous costs to the taxpayer to fill the positions the HSE cannot fill.  How does the Taoiseach's claim of no service reduction equate with reality, particularly when there is strong demand for mental health nurses?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The premise of the Deputy's argument suggests no change can be beneficial to the delivery of services and that fewer people working in an area cannot, by definition, provide a better service.  I do not subscribe to that.  We have seen changes in a whole range of areas.For example, everyone will agree the Revenue Commissioners' provision of online services and re-organisation has led to greater throughput, efficiencies and that the time involved in serving customers and citizens has been greatly reduced.  The same applies to the Department of Social Protection where computerisation has greatly reduced the need for person-to-person interaction and made it easier for people to obtain services and be aware of their entitlements.The greater use of technology in the public service and changing how these services are delivered can bring about a far better result with fewer public servants than may have been the case in the traditional arrangement of people queuing for a service delivered from a window-hatch or cubicle.Over the last quarter of a century we have been in the process of implementing a new and welcome change in how psychiatric services are provided, moving from an exclusively institutional model to a far more community-based one.  That in itself has meant that the requirement in terms of numbers needed to treat those in an institutional setting has totally changed, and rightly so.  Rather than having psychiatric hospitals deliver such issues in splendid isolation from other hospital services, we now see the modern approach, which is to build acute psychiatric services within general hospital settings.  In that way the overall health of patients is catered for in a far more holistic and comprehensive way than would have been the case traditionally.  The old system of care had its origins in the Victorian age, rather than in the modern age.The two examples the Deputy set out are good reasons change is necessary and how change with fewer public servants does not mean that there is a diminution of service.  In fact, there is an enhanced, augmented and more modern service available.By definition, the moratorium can be regarded as a blunt instrument, although exceptions are provided for by the Minister for Finance.  It was a good control measure in the absence of an overall industrial relations framework in which to implement a more comprehensive set of reforms.  We now have those and while the moratorium must continue to exist because of the need to work against simply increasing numbers without reference to the possible cross-over of people from other areas where there is less activity, by retraining or otherwise, into new areas of demand, or where services need to be augmented by more personnel, that is the way to ensure efficiency and effectiveness.The overall industrial relations framework we now have enables service-wide change and reorganisation to take place in a way that is planned, understood and negotiated.  It can be done with the mechanisms that have been put in place, including time-limited appeal mechanisms, so that matters get resolved rather than a process taking over and change being postponed for a period which is simply too long in current circumstances.In fairness, all of that has been agreed to as the means by which we will address these issues.  For the future, I see a public service which will employ fewer numbers in the overall context but which will be as responsive and flexible as possible.  It will use all the modern IT systems to enable people to interact and interface with the service in an efficient and timely way.  We will also have professionals working within the service at all levels who are in a better work environment, which maintains a public service ethos whereby people are treated well and are accorded the appropriate dignity as citizens.  That is a strong ethic which still permeates the service, although there are many who would be frustrated because of the rigidity of structures.  In the past, hierarchical structures were built up which had their place in a different era, but we now need far more collaborative teamwork approaches because many of the old demarcations are no longer relevant.  They need to be addressed.We have an important opportunity, driven as it is by circumstances and resources.It is also driven by the initiative of public service workers and management to work together to bring about the changes necessary so that we have a sustainable level of service into the future.  This should take cognisance of the fact that there are limits to our resources and demographics at play that require us to plan ahead into the medium and long term and redeploy resources to where they are most needed.  We must also ensure that we find ways around the problems that arise, through technology, shared services, better procurement practices and a whole range of initiatives in addition to human resource issues that can bring about a better outcome for everyone, including the taxpayer.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	25	In the past ten years, some seriously good people in the public service were head-hunted by private business and quite a number left.  If change is to be embedded in the public service, as recommended by the OECD and the Croke Park agreement, should there be an opportunity for people from the private sector to work in the public sector and vice versa?  This would give everyone a full flavour of the world of work outside and the world of administration and bureaucracy inside.  Does the Taoiseach think this is appropriate?  In my experience of the public service, when it is challenged, it will always come up with a result depending on the political or ministerial guidance.  In the past decade, there has been a tendency to hive off every question to another consultant, report or committee.  The public service was always intended to be the public service but was allowed drift into endless rows of bureaucracy.  If good leadership from management is necessary, does that exist?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied the quality of personnel exists to drive the quality of change the Taoiseach wants, that Croke Park envisages and that the OECD says should be embedded in the culture of the public service?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	26	A number of questions arise from Deputy Kenny's points.  He referred to the loss of the talent from the public services to the private sector.  People took up opportunities to go into the private sector, having served in the public service.  Others have returned and some have gone from the private sector to the public sector.  That interchange in the world of work is a more common experience than was the case years ago.  One of the reasons for benchmarking was to ensure that, where there were jobs of commensurate responsibility, the public service would not be denuded of any talent it had and that the public sector would be seen as an attractive career prospect for those in a position to obtain earnings of a similar nature in the private sector.  The question of how to marry that with reform and change is one we seek to address in a comprehensive way through the transforming public services agenda.  The Croke Park agreement provides the oil in the wheel to enable it to turn and bring about the change people want to see.It is open to people from any sector to apply for public sector jobs.  We have seen changes and reconstitution in the top level appointments commission to ensure more private sector people are employed so that the disciplines available in the private sector, the innovation and change culture that must be part and parcel of any enterprise in the private sector seeking to adapt to changing trading circumstances can, in an appropriate way, be replicated in the public service, which must show a level of innovation in terms of delivering quality service at a time of tightened financial circumstances.  In terms of the level of planning, policy making and policy evaluation and accountability one wants to see in the public service, there are lessons to be learned between both sectors.There are also lessons to be learned by the private sector from the public service ethos.  Perhaps the dearth of that ethos in some respects has been the cause of some of our problems.  Unfortunately there has been a stereotypical ongoing argument about public versus private, to which I have never subscribed.  Life is not that simple.  There is a basis for a solid and well merited critique of both sectors of the economy.The overall position is that there must be change and it must happen more swiftly than we have been able to achieve before.  I now believe we have a framework in which to do that.  We have the means to achieve it and to do so in an ordered way.  Many of the mechanisms that are now in place provide us with probably the best prospect we have had in a very long time.Many people have prescribed how change should occur but the best way of achieving it is through a collaborative effort on the part of those who work in the service who have a stake in it and who have a professional ethic to see the service fulfil its objectives, namely, to be as efficient and effective a public service as one could find anywhere and that will deliver for people.  That means delivering for people in far more atypical work patterns than would have been the case in the past.  For example,  where people need services after 5 p.m., rosters will have to reflect that.  There is a whole range of customer-focused initiatives that would improve the responsiveness of the service and how people view it.  This can be achieved by demonstrating flexibility and by putting in place new practices.

Between the two sets of measures there is the potential to save the State in excess of half a billion euro on its current outlay.  We accept, as do the public service unions, that there must be reforms to work practices to ensure greater efficiency where possible and improved services, which is what we want to see in terms of the public service as a whole.Does the Taoiseach not agree that the continuation of the embargo on public service recruitment is proving counter-productive?  That is something I have argued on many occasions.  For example, there is ongoing evidence of the considerable cost of training nurses to a very high degree in this country, both in terms of general health and psychiatric health——

What is happening to overcome difficulties within the Health Service Executive at a time when it is employing agency nurses across the board, including in the psychiatric services?  The PNA has identified that the outlay is approximately 40% greater than would be the case with direct employment.The Taoiseach is familiar with the consultant's report by Mott MacDonald on HSE west which states that the recruitment ban has created another perverse incentive to use existing highly qualified and highly paid staff to cover additional staff.  Does the Taoiseach not see that this issue needs to be urgently addressed, something that the INMO itself has highlighted to him?  It has also indicated that its members — nurses and midwives — are not prepared to fill the gaps created.  Will the Taoiseach not reconsider the situation in regard to the recruitment ban?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The moratorium on recruitment and promotion had to be introduced as a matter of necessity.  It was introduced at the end of March 2009.  It allows for certain general exemptions in the education and health sectors to fill certain key posts, as well in the local authorities in respect of fire, health and safety, INTERREG and other posts.  The information in respect of posts covered by these general exemptions can be sought from the relevant Ministers.On the question raised by the Deputy, the whole purpose of the Croke Park agreement is to see in what way we can get redeployment and find a way forward that will provide us with as many permanent staff as possible.  There are some occasions when temporary agency people are required.  One would like to think that they would never be required, but there are situations in which they are required.  The availability of labour is not equal in all cases.  An agency nurse might be required in one area whereas an exception to the moratorium might be more of a solution in another area.I am not aware of the PNA-specific matter to which the Deputy referred.  The service available to psychiatric patients is different to the one that was available in an institutional setting.  It is not necessary that all people who interact with psychiatric patients in the modern care setting be psychiatric nurses.  Many of the day-to-day needs of psychiatric patients are provided by care workers and others who are quite capable of doing that job.  While there is a nursing care element to this, it is not the exclusive case now that may have been the case in the past in terms of the way in which services were organised and who cared for people.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I want to allow a brief supplementary question.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Things have changed.  I do not suggest that all problems are solved, but the Croke Park agreement gives us the industrial relations framework in which to resolve many problems which have been structural and perennial in the service.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I will ask two brief questions.  Which is the lead Department responsible for public service reform?  Is it the Department of the Taoiseach or the Department of Finance?  What savings is the Croke Park agreement estimated to achieve in 2011?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Regarding the first point, the Department of Finance and the public service deal with public service issues on an operational basis.  The Department of the Taoiseach has always co-ordinated the effort in the social partnership context of trying to promote this agenda right across the service.  I work as the chairman of the Cabinet sub-committee in that respect.Regarding the savings to be obtained by the Croke Park agreement, clearly there will be savings.  These have yet to be identified, since they all have to be negotiated and costed in due course.  As the Deputy knows, there is provision under the agreement to identify those savings on an annual basis and see to what purpose any part of them can be put to see if any assistance can be given to those who are on the lower pay structures during the course of the agreement.  The real saving of the Croke Park agreement relates to the fact that there will be fewer moneys allocated for the provision of services.  The agreement provides us the means by which we minimise service impact.  We could find a situation in which we could improve services with less money, depending on how we organise those services.  This will vary from place to place.The savings the agreement provides are not simply in the context of the reduced payroll or the reduced costs of services that can be identified upon review on an annual basis.  The real value of the Croke Park agreement will be the fact that it effects a new way of delivering services in a way that promotes industrial relations without conflict and, for the most part, provides us with a more sustainable level of service in future.  Those savings should be identified in terms of looking at the value of this agreement for the future.  If we are cutting major areas of expenditure by X%, if there is no policy change or no change in the industrial relations scenario, then the diminution in services to the public would be guaranteed.  The Croke Park agreement provides the means of having sustainable services with less money, while at the same time providing a good service to the public by reason of the redeployment of civil servants that will follow from it.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	35	The Dublin Airport Authority has statutory responsibility for the operation, management and development of Dublin Airport.As such, it is responsible for developing a strategy for increasing passenger numbers and I know that it is very active in this regard.  It also operates under a clear commercial mandate and is not in receipt of any Exchequer support.  Accordingly, issues such as the scale and management of its debt is the sole responsibility of the company and I have no function in these mattersOn airport charges, the Commission for Aviation Regulation regulates airport passenger charges levied at Dublin Airport.  Again, I have no function in the matter.  The Deputy will be aware that the question of any possible sale of State assets is one that is currently being considered by the review group on State assets and liabilities, headed by Mr. Colm McCarthy.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	36	In the light of terminal two, T2, being opened on Friday, will the Minister say whether he considers it is value for money to open a terminal that has cost somewhere between €600 million and €700 million, at a time when passenger numbers going through Dublin this year will be less than 18 million, and each terminal has the capacity of up to 15 million?I understand this was a long-term investment committed to at a time when passenger numbers were on the rise, and it is easy to look at these figures in hindsight.  I should like to ask the Minister about an area that is his responsibility, that is, aviation policy generally.  Does he believe it is appropriate that there is no competition between airports in Ireland and that one State-owned company is managing the country's three main airports at a time when passenger numbers over the past two years have fallen by almost 30%, despite the fact that in most European countries passenger numbers are increasing?  In France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Germany, Spain and Finland passenger numbers have increased——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	37	The Deputy is giving information.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	38	That is the context of the question.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The Deputy is required to eventually put a question.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	40	I have already asked two or three questions——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Exactly.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	42	——and I am just finishing the last one, if that is all right.In the context of passenger numbers increasing in the vast majority of European countries, does he consider that it is time the Government had a fundamental review of aviation policy in Ireland, to increase passenger numbers?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	43	As regards the Deputy's first question about value for money, the cost of the terminal two building is just over €300 million.  The figure of just over €600 million that he quoted relates to ancillary services and buildings that were provided at the airport prior to T2 arriving on the scene at all.  I regard it as value for money.  The Deputy rightly and fairly has indicated that this decision was made in 2005 or thereabouts when passenger figures were increasing exponentially at Dublin Airport, and indeed at the other airports around the country.  The projections at that stage, before any economic downturn, indicated that the terminal was needed.I can remember that in my predecessor's time at every Question Time there were at least one or two questions about the delays at Dublin Airport, and about getting through security, as well as the delays being faced by people when collecting their baggage on returning from holidays and so on.  There was no question that there was a need to put new facilities in place, and they will be there, as in fairness, the Deputy has acknowledged.As regards competition in airports in Ireland, the Deputy will be aware that the State Airports Act was put in place in 2004 to separate the three main airports, to allow them to compete.  Due to the downturn in the aviation sector in 2008-09, the airports requested me to defer a final decision on that until next year, which I will do.  In light of the situation next year, depending on passenger numbers etc., we shall review that in consultation with the airports.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I have two specific questions.  Could the Minister explain why the Government did not follow independent advice, when the building of a second terminal at Dublin Airport was being planned, to have it built and operated by an operator independent of the Dublin Airport Authority?  Has the Government considered the option of either leasing or selling one of the terminals at Dublin Airport, in order to have competition between the two terminals and to get prices down and services up?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	45	The Government attempted to follow the independent advice the Deputy has mentioned.  In so far as we could we went to the stage of actually tendering for an operator for services at the terminal.  We had to abandon the tendering process, specifically because we could not get a suitable tender to provide the services there.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	46	That is not true.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	47	It is true, and I went through the process myself.  We got independent advisers to go through the whole tendering process, which was the subject of questions in the House before.  The current position is to the effect that the DAA will now operate that terminal.  It has a four-year period in which it can operate it.  As we come to the end of that period we shall establish what the market conditions are and determine whether it is possible for the terminal to be operated, independently.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The Commission for Aviation Regulation is responsible for the regulation of airport charges at Dublin Airport and I have no function with regard to their determination or application.Airport charges at Cork and Shannon Airports are set by those airport authorities and again I have no responsibility as to how they are applied.  Similarly, airport charges at the six regional airports, which are owned and operated independently, are a matter for each airport concerned.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	49	Given that Dublin Airport Authority will have a substantial bill, namely, the €300 million he mentioned as well as other costs, does the Minister not consider it strange that the National Consumer Agency report last week indicated that the airlines were ripping off the consumer to the tune of €28 million annually, by refusing to refund the taxes, charges and administrative funds while not refunding cancellations, as well?  This means a healthy sum of money is being lost, both to the DAA and perhaps, in some cases to the Exchequer.  Has the Minister any plans to ensure that the airports and airport charges are recouped by the airport authorities so that we do not see "Rip-off Ireland" continuing into the recession, with the airlines simply taking all that money for themselves?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Again, the question the Deputy raises is one specifically for the airport authorities and perhaps for the Department of Finance, as regards the airport taxes that are paid and subsequently not transferred to the appropriate authorities.  I did not have any real notice that this was the intent of the question, but I shall raise it with Dublin Airport Authority and attempt to ascertain what action it is taking to ensure that it does not incur revenue losses in circumstances such as these.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I thank the Minister for his reply, but I would have thought this matter was more appropriate to the Minister since he is responsible for the overall policy.       It would seem appropriate to have a code of conduct operating in the aviation industry in relation to refund of charges that are appropriate to the authority itself and appropriate to the Government if somebody has cancelled or there is a no show.  Some airlines have their own adiministrative charges which incorporate this area and some make one level of return and others make none.  There is no policy. The Minister should impose policy in this area and it is appropriate that we have a code of conduct that extends to all airlines.  The sum of €28 million is a sizeable sum.  The National Consumer Agency has determined that the only way it can deal with this matter is to go to the High Court.  I would like the Minister to intervene in this matter.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	52	There is a policy in that anyone who owes taxes to the State must pay them.  Deputy Costello correctly pointed out that there are varying practices in the airlines.  One method some airlines use to avoid paying taxes is to say that the administrative charge in respect of refunding money to passengers equals the amount of tax outstanding.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	53	That is a sleight of hand.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Yes, I agree.  The National Consumer Agency, which is a Government agency, has taken up the matter and is seeking a determination in that regard from the High Court.  It is hoped the outcome will be positive and will clarify the situation.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	55	Driving under the influence of intoxicants, drugs and alcohol, is one of many key issues in road safety.  Testing of drivers in respect of drugs is already provided for in the Road Traffic Acts.  Section 49 of the Road Traffic Act 1961, as amended by the Road Traffic Act 2004, provides that where a member of the Garda Síochána is of the opinion that a person in charge of a mechanically propelled vehicle in a public place is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such extent as to be incapable of having proper control of that vehicle, he or she may require that person to go to a Garda station and there submit to a blood test or provide a urine sample.The issue of roadside drug testing was discussed as recently as August 2010 at the International Conference on Alcohol, Drugs and Traffic Safety.  It is agreed that there are scientific and legal issues to overcome in respect of roadside drug testing.  Some of the issues include, the limitations in the choice of drug for detection, the level of detection of each drug class and the amount of specimen required.The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is aware of the mechanisms for testing suspected drug driving operated by the French and Australian State of Victoria.  Both jurisdictions are operating limited roadside saliva testing using the technology that is currently available.  The bureau is aware that some other Australian States and other European jurisdictions, including Belgium, are preparing for the introduction of saliva testing and the bureau will continue to review the forensic options available as the technology develops.In the meantime, the Road Traffic Act 2010 includes provisions for "field impairment testing", namely, non-technological methods by which the Garda can make a preliminary assessment about the possible presence of drugs.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	56	The Medical Bureau of Road Safety carried out a survey in 2001.  Is it not time another survey was undertaken?  In excess of €650 million is being spent annually here on illegal drugs.  People are extremely concerned about this issue.  Is it not now time that another survey be undertaken with a view to discouraging young people from engaging in drug misuse or driving cars while such substances are in their bodies?  It is important this information is updated.  Perhaps the Minister will consider having another survey undertaken.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I agree that the more information collated and published the better.  I assure the Deputy that the medical bureau continues to analyse blood and urine samples received from the Garda Síochána under any of the road traffic Acts not alone for alcohol but for drugs.  Much of the data obtained from research and testing is used.  Under a roadside drug testing assessment project, the levels of drugs in blood, urine and saliva, using a range of drug screening devices, in approximately 3,000 cases have been examined.  A Rosita-2 project was carried out from 2003-2005 to evaluate the usability and reliability of on-side saliva testing.  However, following research, it was determined that none of those tests were sufficiently reliable as to allow us legislate for their use on a regular basis.I assure the Deputy, whom I acknowledge is as concerned about this matter as am I, that as soon as a robust mechanism is found we will be in a position to move on it.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Is the Minister in a position to set out a timescale in respect of putting a mechanism in place?  There has been much research in this area and we are aware that people abuse the situation.  When does the Minister envisage progress in this area?  Can he indicate a timescale?  Will a test be in place in six months, 12 months or two years time?  It is important to address this issue.  Speed cameras have been put in place, as is testing in respect of drink driving.  However, there is wholesale abuse in the area of drug driving.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The question of a timescale does not arise.  We must first come up with a device that will prove robust in terms of testing.  The Rosita-2 project was carried out.  Nine different devices were evaluated across six countries in Europe, including Belgium, Finland, Germany, Norway, Spain and France and five States in the United States through a series of laboratory and field based evaluations, six of which had a failure rate of 25% or greater.  It is a matter of research and science coming up with a suitable device, in respect of which I cannot give a timescale.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads is the statutory responsibility of each local authority, in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on those roads are funded from local authorities' own resources and are supplemented by State road grants.  In January 2010, my Department established a review group to carry out a review of the transport response to the severe weather during the period November 2009 and January 2010.  In this review, my Department has recommended that local authorities and the National Roads Authority should work together to put in place framework contracts with a number of salt suppliers and that local authorities should draw down their supplies under these framework contracts and should continue to be responsible for the implementation of the response on the ground.  The National Roads Authority has put a framework contract in place, providing for 80,000 tonnes of salt with scope to draw down additional salt supplies as required.The review also recommended that local authorities should draw up lists of priority routes for treatment during severe weather.  Local authorities were asked to publish their winter maintenance plans on their websites in advance of December 2010.  This would allow the public to be aware of what routes will be treated in the case of severe weather and the type of intervention envisaged.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The Minister will recall the lack of leadership from himself and his Department last January, which surprised many people involved in this area.  I am somewhat reassured that plans have been put in place to ensure there is not a repeat this winter.I have two specific questions for the Minister.  How much salt, which it is appropriate to put on the roads, is currently in storage here?  If there is a big freeze next week, are we ready for it?Has the Minister prioritised essential roads?  What are the criteria for doing so?  Do they include traffic numbers or the motorway system?  Following the report last January, what was the estimated volume of salt and grit that should have been in place and required to deal comprehensively with the big freeze last winter?  Is there enough in storage currently or will we have to rely on imports like last year when we were not able to bring in enough?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I remind the Deputy that no local authority ran out of salt and grit during the more than 20 days of sub-zero temperatures.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	63	That is simply untrue.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	64	The incident last year, which went on for more than 20 days, caused a problem.  Arrangements had to be put in place to move salt and grit from county to county in a number of instances.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	65	How much salt is stockpiled?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	66	That was done successfully.  Up to last year, 61,000 tonnes of salt was available annually.  This year, as a result of what happened last year, there is a framework contract in place that provides for 80,000 tonnes of salt to be drawn down
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	67	How much salt is stockpiled?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I will call the Deputy again.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Additional salt is available under this contract.The priorities are clear and they do not change from year to year.  The hierarchy is the motorway system, the national primary system, the national secondary system and local and regional roads of importance.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Will the Minister repeat his answer to the question about whether local authorities ran out of salt last year?  Is he suggesting no local authority in Ireland ran out of salt last year during the big freeze when it is a fact that Cork County Council had to supply Kerry County Council with significant tonnage of salt?  The Minister should rethink his reply to that.How much salt is stockpiled in Ireland currently to prepare for the possibility of a big freeze next week or the week after?  I do not ask about January; I ask to ensure we are ready for next week.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	71	There is enough salt to cater for anything that could happen over the next few days.  The way this works is that the salt is brought in over time as needed.  The contract last year was for 60,000 tonnes, which had been more than adequate every year for decades before that.  Stockpiles are maintained but the salt is generally bought as needed over time.  There is not a great deal of sense in stockpiling the 80,000 tonnes of salt in case it is not needed.  It does not keep well from year to year.  That is the method used in providing the stockpiles but the contract is for 80,000 tonnes.  The difficulty that arose last year in many respects was we were reaching our 60,000 tonnes limit, there was a need for salt elsewhere and we faced competition.  Cork County Council had its own supply and it was asked to make salt available.  The same happened in one or two other local authorities and if the Deputy wants to refer back to the blacks, he will see that I said that individual local authorities had to be helped by other local authorities.  That is why the NRA came in to organise it.  That is why we are now suggesting that the NRA should continue that in one form or another.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The local government efficiency review group recommended the introduction of new tolling schemes on national roads, both new and existing, based on an equitable distribution of tolling points across the national network, with a proportion of revenue being used to invest in local and regional roads.  The infrastructure investment priorities document for 2010 to 2016 also refers to the introduction of further tolling on national roads and recommends that additional income generated through tolling should be retained by the National Roads Authority, NRA, to help fund ongoing road investment.  In light of these recommendations, the NRA was asked to examine options for a new tolling strategy.  I have just received a report from the NRA on options for a future tolling strategy, which I am now considering.  At this point, however, no decisions have been made on additional tolling on specific national roads.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	73	That is convenient.  There is a great deal of concern that additional tolls will be placed on our motorway infrastructure and it would be helpful if the Minister clarified whether he intends to use additional tolling to raise revenue, whether that be for infrastructure or for the Exchequer.  There is potential for a huge waste of money because he has asked the NRA to put considerable work into designing tolls, for example, on the Jack Lynch Tunnel adjacent to my own constituency.  What is the Minister's thought process in this regard?  Does he plan to introduce additional tolls on motorways that have been paid for, or are being paid for, by existing tolls to raise additional revenue for his Department or the NRA?  Is that likely to be a feature of the upcoming budget?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	74	All I can do is repeat the answer I gave the Deputy.  The suggestion was made by the local government efficiency review group.  It was mentioned in the capital programme 2010-16.  In light of those recommendations, the NRA was asked to examine the options for a new tolling strategy.  The authority has completed a report, which I received at the back end of last week.  I will have a look at the report and, on foot of that, a decision will be made on whether we will go ahead with tolls, whether they are necessary and what design might be used, if we proceed.  There are conflicting recommendations in the two reports.  One says some of the money should be available to fund local authorities while the other says the money should stay with the NRA.  We do not, and will not, have the same funding available for maintenance or repair of roads as we had over the past decade.  That is why this is being considered.  When one gets such reports, one must consider the pros and cons.  When they are discussed and decided by the Government, I will bring the news to the House.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Will the Minister consider whether it makes sense to charge people and, in doing so, discourage them from using the safest, quickest, most direct infrastructure on which we have spent a fortune constructing, thereby increasing traffic on secondary roads and sending it back into towns and villages, which is contrary to the motorway strategy in place?  If he is considering introducing new measures, whether they be levies, tolls or taxes, to raise additional revenue from transport, there are more straightforward and effective ways of doing so to ensure we can afford to pay for the infrastructure that will be required over the next number of years.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	76	I am more than wiling to listen to suggestions the Deputy has about more effective ways to raise finance and so on.  There are two sides to this argument.  It can be argued on the one hand that the most effective way to ensure sufficient funds for the maintenance and upkeep of roads is to ask those who use the roads to pay for them rather than asking the taxpayer to do so.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	77	This is not about maintenance but the building of new roads.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	78	There is not much evidence to suggest people have significant difficulty in paying for the convenience of top quality roads and diversion rates are quite small for current toll roads.  Tolling or congestion charges can also be used in urban areas to enhance the environment and health benefits for people in certain areas.  There are pluses and minuses.  Tolls can be an expensive way to raise finances and put infrastructure in place.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I can understand the rationale of a congestion charge.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	80	That is a separate issue.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	81	The issue surrounding the tolling of bypasses, tunnels and major infrastructure is that the opposite effect will be achieved, with traffic being diverted into towns and villages.  That is the point.  If tolls are to be in the form of congestion charges, people should be encouraged on to motorway infrastructure, which makes much more sense.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	82	We are not talking about any structure currently because we have not finalised any decisions regarding tolls.  There are pros and cons.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I propose to take questions Nos. 48, 57 and 83 together.Some 36 rural community transport groups are being funded under my Department's rural transport programme, which is operational in every county.  These groups are working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas having regard to local public transport service needs and the availability of resources.  I understand that on average some 13,600 transport services a month are now being provided under the programme.  In addition, a number of pilot transport projects have been undertaken in the north east and north west to explore the potential for improved synergies between existing transport providers.The outcome of these projects, together with those of the recently completed exercise to map all transport services in County Louth and a cross-Border pilot rural community transport project under the auspices of the British-Irish Council, will feed into the process for developing rural transport policy into the future.  Some €11 million is being provided for the programme this year.  Consideration of further funding for the programme will be considered by the Government in the context of the budget for 2011 and later years.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I have a number of specific questions.  I recognise that rural transport requires a State subsidy and is quite complex in its make-up.  Is the Minister satisfied that the €196 million per year currently being paid for school transport, in the context of rural transport, as well as the average €25 million per year spent on providing HSE transport, largely made up of hiring taxis in rural areas, represents the best delivery structure for a cost-effective rural transport system?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I am not satisfied that we are getting the kind of value we might be able to achieve if the system had more integration.  That is why we have initiated some of the projects being discussed.  There was one in operation for a while with the HSE in Cork as well.  We should be able to get better value for money and that is the reason those projects have been put in place.  It is also the reason I asked Bus Éireann, the Department of Education and Skills, the HSE and my Department to try to formulate a better integrated system.We can do better on rural transport, and the Deputy is probably aware that there are a number of voluntary groups with their own transport which may be integrated into the process.  I have asked groups and officials from my Department to engage with the National Transport Authority to see if this can be pulled together to reduce costs generally in the system while improving the service at the same time.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	86	I am glad the Minister has indicated he is not happy with the current system and that it is not sufficiently integrated.  Does the Minister have any thoughts on combining some of the services being provided on one side by the HSE, which are very costly, with school transport on the other side, where separate fleets of vehicles are being used?  Has he considered bringing on board local authorities, which are providers of very considerable services throughout the country?  An integrated system is the only way we will be able to make a rural transport service functional in any decent capacity.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	87	My aim in this regard is to try to combine services and ensure we get value for money.  It is a good area and we could get more with less money even than we are talking about now.  As Deputy Coveney noted, it is a complicated area and we are talking about network planning.  Bus Éireann have experts in this regard and with the school bus service, for example, a considerable number of providers are on contract to CIE; they are not employees of the company.  I am not sure how many of those would be available during the course of the day.  It should be sufficient to give a reasonably integrated service throughout the country.The Deputies made points about the HSE and health services and there was a very good system in operation for a while in the hospital in Drogheda.  A minibus brought people to a clinic and they were taken in the first couple of hours.  After some time for a cup of tea or coffee, they were brought back.  The two systems married well.  Unfortunately, a change in personnel in the hospital blew that out of the water but we should be capable of providing such programmes to ensure a good service.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I welcome the fact that the Minister is open to suggestions in this regard.  I ask the Minister to include in such a review the following issue.  With more emphasis on preventing drunk driving in the past few years, people in remote rural areas, especially younger people, have no way to go home at night from discos, etc.  I have travelled through several towns in the past few months late at night and could see such people waiting in a queue in the cold, with some walking home.  It is unfair and the issue should be examined.  Will the Minister consider this as it is a matter of controversy and concern?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I will consider it but we must ensure that some of the cost would be met by those who benefit most from people being out late at night.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	90	It is not as simple as that.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	91	There is a social aspect that probably requires a State subsidy from a road safety perspective.  Will the Minister consider clustering services, whether they are for the HSE, school transport or some other rural transport service provision?  Will he allow the private sector to compete for the business through an outsourcing tendering process so as to encourage people to come forward with cost-effective solutions for a cluster of problems within counties or regions?  Bus Éireann will be part of that competitive process but there are plenty of private operators, some of which are operating under contract to Bus Éireann now, which would love to have the opportunity to tender for this business if given the opportunity.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	92	Many rural transport groups use private transport and Bus Éireann is hardly involved at all in the provision of these services.  Pobal makes the specific funding available to individual rural transport programmes and contracts services.In some cases, rural transport programmes may have their own vehicles but the one of which I am aware in Meath does give facilities and business to the private sector.  I have no difficulty with that.  It is a good idea that we should have competition.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	93	As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in regard to the national roads programme element of Transport 21.  The implementation of individual national road projects, including service areas, is a matter for the National Roads Authority in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.Section 54 of the Roads Act 1993 specifically provides for the NRA or a local authority to provide and-or operate service areas.  In 2005, the then Minister for Transport asked the NRA to review its policy of generally not providing service areas on national roads, particularly on the expanding network of access-controlled motorways and dual carriageways.  Arising from this review, the NRA developed a programme for the provision of up to 12 service areas on the major inter-urban routes as well as the N6-N18 junction and the N11 route at intervals of approximately 50-60 km.  Two documents relating to the NRA's policy on the provision of service areas are available on their website at www.nra.ie.The NRA has completed the delivery of the first tranche of three service areas under a PPP programme — two on the M1 and one on the M4.  A further service area at Gorey on the M11 is scheduled to be constructed as part of the N11 Rathnew-Arklow and N7 Newlands Cross junction improvement schemes.The NRA proposals for other service areas are progressing through the planning process.  However, the construction of these service areas is heavily dependent on the availability of funds and the prioritisation of projects within a reduced capital budget.  In light of this, I have advised the IR — I am sorry, I meant the NRA — that it should consider other options to finance the provision of service areas which do not require Exchequer funding.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	94	Clearly, Gerry Adams is getting a bit close to the Minister.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	95	He is not in my constituency.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	96	He is nearly bordering it.I do not understand why this question is not grouped with Question No. 54, which deals with more or less the same issue.  I drive from Cork to Dublin most weeks.  I leave Cork at 10 p.m. and often drive home on a Thursday evening at a similar time.  This is not only a serious road safety issue in that there is nowhere to pull in on the motorway between Dublin and Cork once one passes Naas, it is also a danger in terms of being able to refuel as there is only a small number of 24-hour petrol stations close to that route.  Nonetheless, the main issue is a road safety one, namely, people falling asleep at the wheel when they should be provided with service stations to get a cup of coffee and fill up on fuel.This is standard practice with motorway infrastructure in other parts of Europe, certainly in Britain, where there is a very good road safety record, as the Minister will know.  It is not good enough for the NRA to state we simply cannot afford to do proceed at present because we do not have the resources.  This is something the private sector should and can do but it probably requires a change in the criteria we currently require in terms of all the facilities that must be provided to make a service area viable.Will the Minister talk to the NRA in regard to redrafting the guidelines in order to attract private sector investment in the provision of service areas on motorways such as the Cork-Dublin motorway?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	97	That is precisely what I asked the NRA to do, and I asked it to come back to me with proposals for service areas along these routes that would not cost the Exchequer anything.  I agree with the Deputy that the private sector should be in a position to do this, although the NRA has informed me that part of the reason service areas were not provided for initially was that it thought the private sector would come in to provide them.  When it was discovered it was not doing that, the policy was changed in 2005.  While we are now in the financial situation we are in, I have no problem with the Deputy's suggestion that the private sector should provide these service areas and I have asked the NRA to come back with proposals that would allow the private sector to do so.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	98	The Minister has partly answered the question.  Why, in the first instance, was this not an integral part of all major road construction projects?  How could the NRA have contemplated links between Dublin and the main cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Wexford without having service stations along the route?  Anyone in their right mind who has travelled on a road would recognise that this was par for the course and the norm in any other country.The Minister said the NRA was asked to review this in 2005, which is five years ago.  Virtually all of the main routes have opened since then and much work could have taken place to ensure some formula was found to enable most of the new routes to have service stations by now.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	99	As the Deputy knows, while all of the routes are now being finalised, many of them had gone through the planning process in 2005 and the ones that had not, namely, the M1 and M4, have service areas.  It would be unfair to characterise the NRA as not being in favour of providing the service areas as it certainly is in favour of it and it understands the arguments in this regard.  It is a matter of coming up with the ways and means of providing service areas without taking money away from road building projects.A number of private developers have obtained planning approvals for offline facilities, including at the M7 Mayfield junction at Monasterevin and in a number of locations on the M6 and M8, including at Kilcullen, as well as a number of others in various locations.  In response to both Deputies, the NRA has been asked to try to come up with a formula that will allow these to be built.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	100	There was no planning for service stations on most of the roads, particularly the Dublin-Cork road.  Will the Minister have the NRA allow the erection of signage from a road safety perspective?  People are driving the roads but they do not know where to get off to have a cup of tea, to refuel or otherwise.  Given these stops have not been built, signage is needed.  We have contacted the NRA several times in this regard but it will not allow signage to be erected.  In the interim, I ask that this be done as well as allowing the projects to be progressed.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	101	The NRA has allowed for signage for offline services and this has been provided on all of the major inter-urban routes.  There are criteria in this regard and in regard to identifying the appropriate locations.  It is based on the proximity of a particular premises or facility to an interchange and on an indication of whether the operator can provide the facilities to which Deputy Coveney referred, such as fuel and toilet facilities.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Since 1 December 2009, the implementation of Metro North is a matter for the National Transport Authority.  My Department's policy on the release of cost and economic information on transport projects is designed to protect the taxpayer's interest.  There is a balance to be struck between promoting public transparency and ensuring value for money in this regard.The Railway Procurement Agency is currently involved in an ongoing PPP procurement process for Metro North with two bidding groups.  There is a risk that releasing any information on tenders received in regard to Metro North would provide an indication of what the State is prepared to pay for the project.  Bidders involved in the project could then focus their final bids at that level instead of at the lowest price at which they can deliver the project.  Given the reasons I have outlined, it is clear that it would not be in the public interest to release any information which has the potential to increase the cost to the taxpayer of delivering this project.  The National Transport Authority, NTA, has made available on its website a redacted version of the most up-to-date business case for metro north.  The NTA has had the business case independently reviewed and has confirmed that the cost-benefit analysis for the project remains strong.  My Department and the implementing agencies have undertaken to provide relevant economic and financial information on projects at an appropriate time but without compromising the commercial sensitivity attached to the projects.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	103	It is important to cut to the chase.  It is no longer a matter for the National Transport Authority or the Railway Procurement Agency.  They continue to work on metro north.  The issues around metro north relate to whether the Government will sanction it and this is the issue I would like the Minister to address.  There is great uncertainty around what is likely to be the biggest infrastructure project in the State for the next decade and people do not know where we stand.  They do not know whether the Government will sanction the €75 million which will be necessary next year to conclude the tendering process and carry out the ancillary works required before any major project can begin.  Will the Minister give an indication of his and the Government's view on metro north at this stage?  Is it going ahead or not?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	104	It is wonderful that no matter how often a Minister stands up and says a project is going ahead, all it takes is one newspaper article for someone to say it is not going ahead.

However, it was granted in such a manner that there are certain curtailments to the project, including approximately 2 km of track to be removed at Belinstown and the proposed depot being switched to another site.  Consequently, the Railway Procurement Agency, RPA, must apply for a new railway order.

However, he is not correct to suggest that a new railway order will be necessary.  A planning issue must be dealt with for the depot.  The NTA and the RPA have estimated that because of the way the planning permission is worded there will be approximately a six month delay.  They hope to be in a position to have the matter out of the way in six months but it will have a knock-on effect.  This will mean the actual construction will begin sometime in 2012 but it does not affect the commencement of the facilitating works, which must be carried out before the contractors come on site.

The Taoiseach and the Government have politically betrayed our country.  They have led down the founding fathers of their own party, they have let down those who fought to achieve Irish independence and, by their actions, they have now endangered the economies of other European countries.  Their greatest failure has been to let down our people.  The blatant incompetence of this Government has resulted in the people being paralysed by anxiety, concern and fear about their future in respect of their businesses, employment, families and mortgages.  This is all because of the gross incompetence of a Government that has ignored every proposal for a constructive future.  It is our job as politicians——

The Taoiseach partially opened the books in the Department of Finance but no Opposition party has had any word from the Department of the Taoiseach about the most potentially catastrophic consequences for our country.  Will the Taoiseach tell the people what has been going on during the past week?  Have there been discussions or intentions of discussions about an emergency bailout for this country or other?  We are aware of the statements of Ministers who have said, "We have not applied for this".  Will the Taoiseach now tell the people, truthfully, the extent of the contact, technical, formal and political, with the European institutions in respect of the seriousness of the banking problem that afflicts our economy?

There has been rumour and conjecture for some time regarding Ireland's position, which I clarified a number of times over the weekend, as did the Minister.  Despite suggestions to the contrary from whatever quarter — including some who may not be disinterested — this country has not applied to use the European financial stability facility.  We made the point, as we have done previously, that we are pre-funded up to mid-2011.As people also know, there has been a continuing problem with regard to underpinning banking and financial stability in the euro area generally, and the peripheral countries — including Ireland, because of the size of our deficit, the banking crisis and other issues — have had to deal with this.  All of the policy initiatives we have taken were with the consent and approval of the EU institutions.  Many of the proposals put forward by the Opposition, unfortunately, would not have obtained approval.

All of these actions by the Government have been in an effort to show that we are doing all we can within our power to deal with the situation that has arisen.  We are making sure we work with our partners in the European Union in dealing with the issue that now affects the entire euro area.  It is not specific to Ireland.  Of course, Ireland has its own issues, which it has been talking about with the European Union institutions on an ongoing basis since the crisis first began.  What we need to do is to allow those discussions to take place at the meeting of euro area finance Ministers, and presumably a statement will emerge.  We will then be in a position to come back to the House after the ECOFIN meeting to discuss this further.  I do not think it does the country any good to engage in controversy here while people are representing our essential national interest abroad.  We are all trying to make sure Ireland sees its way to recovery from this difficult period.

We have never been told the full truth.It is my belief that a bailout is not inevitable.  That means that if we get a few things right, it will not have to happen.  First, the Government must restore the confidence of other governments, the markets and the international community, so that they will actually believe its words; second, there must be a parliamentary majority in this House with the moral authority and political credibility to make the necessary changes; and third, there must be a proper growth plan to demonstrate to others that we are serious about our business and about the future.

Governments throughout the world have had to intervene due to the impact of the financial crisis.  To suggest that Ireland, uniquely, would have been immune is to refuse to face the facts.  Yet it continues even now, after all that has been said and written about the crisis by those who examined the facts.  We subsequently recapitalised the banks because we needed to do so, and then we segregated the distressed assets and parked them in the National Asset Management Agency.

Last week the cost of State borrowing reached record levels and last Thursday morning I asked the Tánaiste on the Order of Business if the Minister for Finance was going to make a statement either that day or sometime over the weekend about the very turbulent financial situation the country was facing.  No such statement was made.  However, we had a series of quite extraordinary developments over the weekend.  On Friday morning we had the statement that emerged from the meeting of the G20 in Korea.  By lunchtime of that day there was speculation in news media outside the country either that Ireland was seeking some kind of state bailout or that some kind of European support for the State was being discussed.  All through the weekend the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers were making statements to the effect — as he repeated in reply to Deputy Kenny — that no application for European assistance or no application to the European fund was being made.We need to get some clarity.  I am not sure what the Taoiseach was saying in reply to Deputy Kenny.  I accept what has been said that no application has been made.  What types of contacts have been taking place between the European institutions and the Government over the course of the weekend?  Were they at Central Bank level, official level or ministerial level?  Has there been any suggestion from European sources that some assistance is to be provided to the State or is it the case, as is being speculated in this morning's newspapers, that what is now being discussed is in effect another bailout for the banks, this time through the European institutions?  What are the implications of that for the State's finances?  In his reply to Deputy Kenny the Taoiseach appeared to be acknowledging that the Irish banks now need a further bailout.  I believe the phrase he used was "banking stability"; he made a couple of references to that.  The people want to hear a clear statement from the Taoiseach as to what is going on, what is being negotiated, what kinds of conditions are being attached to it and over what period of time.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I made it clear yesterday evening that I am not responsible for the rumour mill all over Europe or elsewhere.  I was told last Friday that, as Head of this Government, I had made an application at that stage to enter a facility, which was not true.  Despite the fact that I said it was not true, the person who asked me the question seemed to think it was true.  What I was indicating was that the suggestion that we had applied to enter a facility was not correct.  At the G20 meeting in Seoul obviously discussions took place on the currency situation worldwide, including the euro.  Obviously the situation in Ireland and other countries, which has been the source of public comment for some time, was mentioned there as well.  What was welcome about the Seoul statement from the finance Ministers concerned was that should the question emerge at the December Council meeting regarding private sector involvement in the whole question of public debt and how that was to be paid off in the future, in the event of there being problems in any particular situation, which is not ours, that would mean it would only relate to debt that would take place after 2013.  That provided a lot of reassurance, presumably, to the markets which were interpreting comments on this matter in previous weeks as if it related to debt — existing debt or debt that was already within the overall public debt portfolio of states, which was not the situation.  That is from where that emerged.The second point that emerged was that, as I have already said, discussions have been going on all the time on the whole banking situation — generally the European Central Bank and the central banks themselves.  The European Central Bank, governing bodies and governors have all had their views on these matters.  At the end of the day I was simply confirming a fact as far as Ireland was concerned, which is that we had not applied to any facility and despite the fact that it was being mentioned in a lot of so-called reputable news organisations it did not make it any truer.  That is the first point.The second point relates to the wider issues that have emerged regarding the currency itself.  Market conditions have not normalised as we can see.  There are concerns out there regarding the markets.  From our point of view it gives rise to concerns.  We are discussing with other European partners what stabilisation is necessary and what further policy initiatives might be considered.  That is an issue that is being discussed at ECOFIN level and finance Minister level on an ongoing basis at their monthly meeting and obviously officials have been involved in those discussions, but we have not been involved politically in those discussions until such time as today's meeting takes place.  I mentioned I took a phone call from the President of the Commission last Friday and I made it very clear, if anyone wanted to know, that we had not made any applications for the facility and obviously he was happy for me to confirm that.These are matters at all times for sovereign governments.  At the moment we are making sure that regarding our own situation it is understood that we are pre-funded up to the middle of 2011.  Regarding banking policy, we have taken all the necessary steps with full transparency — a lot more transparency than might be attempted to be conveyed by others — regarding how we are dealing with our banking situation.  We have done the guarantee; we have done the capitalisation; we have segregated the assets; we have set a very rigorous test on the capital requirements of banks — it is 8% tier 1 capital requirement, including 7%——

That is a fact of the situation.  We are prepared to work with others — with our counterparts in the euro area — to see in what way we can help address that issue and help to normalise market conditions.  From our point of view, it is not appropriate to suggest that we are doing anything other than protecting our interests and ensuring that our national interests are understood.  We will work constructively with people on that basis as part of our international obligation as part of a euro area that is wider than our own jurisdiction as we know and that is what we are doing.  For people to be coming to conclusions about those discussions before the conclusions have even been reached as we speak does not serve our interests in any way either because there has been far too much speculation on those matters.  While I am not saying it is anybody in this House, there are some who have been involved in those sorts of public positions being taken, who perhaps are not exactly disinterested themselves in what might emerge in terms of what they could get out of it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I accept that the Taoiseach is not responsible for the rumours and speculation in the international media, but he and his Government are responsible for putting those rumours to rest and for settling the position.  Unfortunately, that has not happened over the course of the weekend.  The Taoiseach continuing to rely on the phrase that the Government has not made an application to the European fund does not address the issue.I asked the Taoiseach a direct question.  I accept that no application has been made, and I accepted that on Sunday when I was asked about it by a journalist.  However, the issue remains that we need to be told, because there is speculation about it not only in our media but also in the international media, including it being the subject of comment today in the Financial Times, whether discussions are taking place about assistance being provided to the State, in the first place, and, second, about the question of additional funding for the Irish banks.  It is important to address that.I was interested to hear the comments by Daniel Gros of the Centre for European Policy Studies on "Morning Ireland" this morning.  He made a direct connection between the State and what is happening in the banks.  He said Ireland was the first country to say its government would guarantee all of the banks and every penny of their liabilities and that the decision, which looked smart then, is now the downfall of the entire country.  He went on to say that, in his view, the financial markets were saying that the Government and the banks are the one thing as they are tied together.  He elaborated further on that point.All I am seeking from the Taoiseach is information.  There is continuing speculation and comment in the media and among the public.  It is one thing for the Taoiseach to tell the House that there is a general discussion about the eurozone area, but that is not the way it appears.  Instead, it appears to be a specific discussion about Ireland's difficulties and the consequences for the euro area.  There is an obligation on the Taoiseach to level with the House and with the public about what exactly is happening, but he continually fails to do that and speak directly.  There is no point in being cagey and coy about this now, because it is being discussed anyway.  Are we talking about assistance for the State?  Has that been offered?  Are we talking about assistance for the Irish banks?  The Taoiseach must tell us exactly what is happening because it is being discussed anyway.To say that these discussions are taking place at ministerial level and when they are concluded we will receive a report would be perfectly in order in normal circumstances, but it is not in order now.  What is being discussed at that level is the subject of speculation and the Government's response to that over the weekend has not settled markets, public opinion or sentiment or international comment about this country.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	207	As I said to the Deputy, I have always levelled with the Irish people and have always defended their interests.  Some people would have liked to have had Ireland apply for this facility, with no prospect whatever of Ireland being able to put its case.  Ireland has a case to put with regard to all of these matters.Second, there is the question of market risks.  Of course we are working with others to see how we can ameliorate market risks, but we are also in the business of trying to ensure that what emerges for Ireland and the euro area will be about bringing the type of stability that is supposed to be the objective of the policy in the first place.  We have done everything we were required to do in best practice, and we have done everything transparently and above board.  The market's sentiment or position is not normal at present.  It does not look to the underlying strengths of economies or to the fact that we expect to have a net debt to GDP ratio of 83% this year when one takes account of the National Pensions Reserve Fund.There are a range of issues here, including whether, if the market wishes to act completely irrationally, one is supposed to be enslaved to that and allow it to determine the matter.  What we are trying to do——

They are doing enough harm.The issue is very simple.  We are in discussions with our European counterparts to see how we can assist to ensure that market risks are taken out of the equation.  We are not in the market at present.  We are seeking to ensure that we underpin stability for the entire euro area, including Ireland because we are part of that area.  We are working with others to see what will emerge from the discussions taking place at present.

I understand it is entirely within the competence of the bank's IT section, which the Taoiseach owns, to have these files opened.  As the owner of the bank, I request the Taoiseach would follow this up so the authorities can pursue their responsibilities and, if necessary, that the law be brought to bear on those responsible for what might be criminal activities.

The plan will be published when it is finalised and approved by the Government.  We indicated an indicative timetable of around mid-November.  We are at that point but we are not ready to publish it because we have not yet finalised, discussed and approved it.  We are working on it as a matter of priority.

It is in our interests that market conditions normalise regarding this situation.  Anything we can do therefore to facilitate a stabilisation of that situation within the euro area is something to which we are all attuned at the moment.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	257	We are all well aware that there has been much comment and speculation in recent days on developments within the euro area and especially with regard to Ireland.  We are living in a fragile atmosphere and we need to be careful about what we say so that we do not add to that turbulence.Since the middle of 2008 we have taken significant steps in response to the rapid deterioration in our public finances in order to stabilise the situation and begin the process of returning this country to a sustainable fiscal position.In total, adjustments amounting to close to €15 billion have been implemented over the course of the past two and half years.  The measures we have taken are working.  Our deficit for 2010 is estimated, on an underlying basis, at 11.9% of GDP this year.  This is broadly in line with our budget day forecast and provides further evidence that the public finances are under control.  We will therefore achieve our aim of stabilising the underlying deficit this year at the 2009 level.Those who are now commenting on Ireland's financial situation should also remember that the Exchequer is fully funded into the first half of 2011, so the impending sense of crisis that some wish to suggest the Irish State faces is not a fair reflection of all the facts.Our gross level of general Government debt will increase this year, to around 98.5% of GDP, but a large part of that is due to the statistical accounting treatment of the capital support being provided to some of our financial institutions.  Statistically, we are taking the hit upfront but in reality we are borrowing the money over a much longer period.Taking account of the substantial assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, our net debt to GDP ratio is better, estimated at around 83% at the end of 2010.While substantial progress has been made in tackling and stabilising the deficit, this Government is acutely aware that further measures will be required to restore sustainability to the public finances.  That is vital to underpin future economic growth.Despite the weaker economic outlook we remain fully committed to reducing the general Government deficit to below 3% of GDP by the end of 2014.  This means budgetary adjustments of some €15 billion must be implemented over the course of the next four years, which is a significant amount by any measure.  Let us not forget, however, that we have already implemented measures worth close to €15 billion since mid-2008, at a time of economic decline.  The €15 billion in adjustments can be delivered in a way that will allow the economy to return to growth.Our revenues and our spending are out of line to the tune of €19 billion and this is a gap that is currently being filled by borrowing.  That cannot continue.  We must continue along the road of budgetary consolidation which we first embarked upon in 2008.With a significant front-loading of consolidation into 2011, we will have completed two thirds of the overall adjustment by the end of next year.  This will demonstrate clearly to all that we take our commitments seriously and that we will take the necessary actions to return this country to a sustainable fiscal position.  We will stabilise our gross debt to GDP ratio over the 2012-13 period.A four-year budgetary plan is being prepared and will be published shortly.  The plan will be clear and workable and will map out a way forward to national recovery.  The plan is not just about cutting the budget deficit, as important as that is; it is also about setting out the key reform measures that the Government has decided to take to restore competitiveness, boost employment and return us to a sustainable medium-term economic growth path.The recent increase in our bond spreads is of course a concern.  However, it is important to remember that we are not currently active in the market so we are not borrowing at the current elevated levels.  The NTMA decided to withdraw from the market until early next year to allow markets to digest the end-September statement on banking, the upcoming four-year plan and budget 2011.As I have already mentioned, we are fully funded into the first half of next year so there is no immediate funding pressure on the sovereignty.  Clearly, there is a need to bring stability to markets here and elsewhere, as the current costs of borrowing are very high and are at a level that would make it difficult for banks here to operate as engines of recovery.It is important to point out that the European Central Bank continues to meet the liquidity requirements of the banking system.  In addition, this Government's priority throughout the banking crisis has been to safeguard deposits, and this is a concern shared by governments across Europe and by the European Commission.I want to take this opportunity to reiterate the strength of the Government's commitment to safeguarding deposits in the Irish banking system in view of the recent ill-informed and inaccurate speculation by a small number of external analysts and commentators on this issue.Tomorrow this House will consider a motion to extend the current bank guarantee scheme for a further year.  This scheme guarantees the security of all deposits in the participating institutions in the scheme, along with that of other bank liabilities guaranteed under it.  The scheme complements the protection afforded to all depositors up to €100,000 under the permanent deposit guarantee scheme which has no expiry date.  The protection of depositors has been and remains one of the over-arching priorities of the Government in responding to the difficulties in the Irish banking system.I wish to reiterate what I have been saying in response to speculation over the last number of days that Ireland is seeking financial assistance.  Ireland has made no application for external support.  The EU Commission has stressed this point as have other member states.  Given the current market conditions, there have been ongoing contacts at official level with our international partners.  The Department of Finance is continually in contact with these bodies.  The engagement has been particularly intense in the run up to the budget and the four-year plan.  The Minister for Finance has not been involved in these discussions.  However, he is in Brussels this evening to discuss these issues with his eurozone counterparts at their usual monthly Eurogroup meeting, and he will also attend the usual monthly meeting of EU Finance Ministers tomorrow.It is in all of our interests that we find a credible, efficient and, above all, workable solution that will provide assurance to the markets and thereby restore confidence and stability.  There is no doubt that financial markets have been extremely volatile over recent weeks and we need to provide them with a level of reassurance.  However, this is not an insurmountable challenge.  Through working together with our partners in a calm and rational manner, we can resolve these issues and underpin financial stability in the medium and longer term.The strategy being pursued by Government has addressed the difficulties facing the banking system, is bringing sustainability to the public finances and is resulting in ongoing improvements in competitiveness.  Pursuing these policies is essential for a return to growth, the evidence of which we are already beginning to see.I am also encouraged by the broad consensus among the main political parties on the need to reduce the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2014.  Delaying taking action will only make the task more difficult and will add to our debt burden, so it is simply not an option.  In his recent visit, Commissioner Rehn noted that our assessment was correct and agreed that significant front-loading, amounting to €6 billion for next year, was appropriate.Growth is returning to the Irish economy, so that the environment in which future adjustments must be made is different from that which prevailed in recent years.  Our exports are performing well, as confirmed by figures this week which show that industrial production rose by 12% in annual terms in the third quarter.  Our strong export performance reflects the significant price and wage adjustments that have taken place, which is testament to the flexibility of the Irish economy.Another key fact is that Ireland remains an attractive place in which to do business.  We continue to attract inward investment, notably in knowledge-intensive sectors.  Ireland remains open for business and is still the destination of choice for many of the world's leading firms.We have taken measures to ensure that the banking system can continue to function as a vital element of our economy.  These measures have been approved by the appropriate European authorities and supported by the European Central Bank.The turbulence in the markets over recent weeks has been about issues of wider concern than Ireland's situation.  It is appropriate therefore that we discuss with our partners, as we are doing, how these issues should best be addressed.  Through the clarity and determination of the Government's position on stabilising the public finances and restoring growth, we can create the conditions through which confidence in the Irish economy will be maintained on the part of citizens, investors and our international partners.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	258	There is nothing new in what the Taoiseach announced compared to what we have heard already.  Ireland is on the front page of major international newspapers again today for all the wrong reasons.  The country is on the airwaves of our nearest neighbour again today for all the wrong reasons.  Let us be clear that it is not because the bond markets, the EU or the international media have lost faith in Ireland.  They have not.  They have not lost faith in the Irish people.  They have not lost faith in Irish resilience, ingenuity, energy or education.  They have lost faith in a Government.  They have lost faith in a Government that boasted about a bank bailout it said would be the cheapest of its kind.  It has turned out to cost more than €50 billion, more money than this country drew from the social and cohesion funds since Ireland joined the EU.To be clear for members of the Cabinet, this is not a crisis of liquidity for our banks, this is about their solvency.  Liquidity was the argument used on the night of the bank guarantee to shoehorn Anglo Irish Bank into the guarantee, even though it was known by some that Anglo Irish Bank was trying to hawk itself to potential buyers in the week of the guarantee.  That deception fooled people then; it will not wash today.People have lost faith in a Government that, two years ago, brought in an emergency budget it said would stabilise the nation's finances.  We are still waiting for that to happen.  The world is now waiting for that to happen.  They have lost faith in a Government that said it must cut €3 billion this year and, just two months later, has more than doubled that figure.  They have lost faith in a Government that stood idly by as one of the world's greatest property bubbles swelled and burst.The Government consistently turned a deaf ear to the calls from this side of the House and other quarters to reform the public service and put the citizens at the core of what Government does.  Lastly, they have lost faith in a Government that does what all discredited regimes do in their dying days — use the courts to try to prevent the people exercising their right to vote.  The international markets and the international community have not lost faith in Ireland.  They have lost faith in the Government.In particular, they have lost faith in the Government's policy on Anglo Irish Bank.  Anglo Irish Bank was a disaster but it is not clear that this Government has learned the lessons.  If media reports are to be believed, the Government seems intent on persisting with further bailouts of other institutions, this time with money borrowed from the EU and other European countries.  For two years, the Government has talked about its bravery and courage in taking tough decisions and it has taken some.  One of those supposedly tough decisions is that the taxpayer must bail out private investors in the banks to protect the State's credibility.  This has proved to be a catastrophic error of judgment.It is not the decisions that are tough or that require courage; it is the consequences of those decisions for every family in this country.  Every family in this country now knows or is beginning to know a new poverty.  Every family in this country now knows the new fear.  What they need is competence in their Government, courage, clarity and consistency.  This party can offer all four.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	262	We are the only party with clear plans to rescue Ireland from the tsunami of misery this Government and the Taoiseach's party has visited upon the nation.  We have not, would not and will not try to sweeten the bitter pill Fianna Fáil and the Green Party has forced this country to swallow.  That bitter pill is the potential loss of a key aspect of our cherished freedom.  This Government will be remembered for generations to come if that applies.Fine Gael has set out how it will make cuts, effect savings, demand efficiencies and be able to pay back the mountain of debt left to the people.  This House, this country and those who watch and listen around the world need to understand this economy can be repaired and Ireland will again be a beacon of enterprise and initiative.The one tough decision this Government has not faced up to and which it does not have the courage to make is to ask the people to provide the mandate to do what must be done.  If the Government makes that decision, everything can change for the better.  Does the Taoiseach have the courage to put the nation first or will we continue to be dragged through the mire of uncertainty, fear and confusion the Government created and seems determined to sustain, even when the solution is clear and present?  It is that mire of uncertainty, concern and anxiety that one independent commentator described as the downfall of the country.  This is a downfall that sees sons and daughters of proud Irish mothers and fathers reared once again for export.  It may be that their remittances from Dubai, Sydney and Toronto will replicate what happened in the past.  It is a downfall that sees young and old in ever-lengthening dole queues as we break economic records and make international headlines for all the wrong reasons when things could be so different.  It is a downfall that has seen the hope and ambition of a generation of Irish people crushed by the political and economic madness of a golden circle at which the Taoiseach's party was at the heart.Before the full impact of this downfall unfolds, the Taoiseach has an opportunity to do something in the national interest.  People talk about the budget.  The Government has a majority to vote in favour of the budget but that will not end the uncertainty in the new year, with the Supreme Court making its decision on Donegal South-West, a further three by-elections pending, the Finance Bill to give legislative impact to the budget and the bond markets still having gross uncertainty about the political stability of this country.  In the national interest, the Taoiseach can let the people have their say.  Hundreds of thousands of people are concerned about their country, their futures, their families, their businesses and their careers.  They should have the opportunity to have their say and provide a mandate for what must be done in the future.  The Taoiseach should let the people have their say in order to shape the future destiny of our nation.  Let the people decide who will run the country.  This is their decision.  This should be their decision because the Government has lost the authority to govern.With regard to the bank investors and bondholders, what is needed is a new Government with a strong mandate from the people.  The Taoiseach may not like what they have to say but they are entitled to be heard.  The choice is clear.  The Taoiseach should give the people their opportunity and let the people have their say.  A new future and a new direction for our country will bring about a change of confidence, a new stability and a new future.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	263	This country's best days are ahead of it.  This country's economy has great strengths.  I agree with some of the things the Taoiseach has said in the House today, that, for example, our exports are growing and that this is a good country in which to do business.  I believe we will get through the economic crisis the country is now facing.  I believe also that the majority of people in this country want to put their shoulder to the wheel to help us do that.We have a big problem, namely, that there is no sense that anybody is in charge.  I am not sure why the Taoiseach made this statement today.  I am not sure what it adds to the sense of confidence or lack of it in the country.  It certainly does not add anything to clarity about what is happening at the moment to our finances and in regard to discussions that are taking place with Europe.In the course of the past fortnight we have seen a dramatic increase in the cost of borrowing for the State.  It reached a peak of approximately 9% last week.  It still remains at approximately 8% today which is really at crisis levels.  That is the market sentiment.  That is what the Taoiseach calls irrational.  That is where we are at after, as the Taoiseach has said, budgetary adjustments of the order of €14 billion to €15 billion have been made already.  An announcement has been made by Government that it is committed to saving another €15 billion, €6 billion of it in the coming year.  It comes shortly after a statement by Government that we had got the final figure for the money that was to go into the banks.  The Taoiseach has acknowledged that it is also in a context where the main Opposition parties are committed to getting our deficit down to the targets that were agreed with the European Commission.It is manifestly clear that the markets are not responding to all of the signals coming from this country.  It is clear that they are not responding because they do not see the problem as purely a public finance or budgetary issue.  They see a country where the banks have been tied at the hip to the State as a result of the bank guarantee that was introduced in September 2008.  In addition, they have also lost confidence in the Government, as indeed have the people.The Taoiseach has referred to the problem as being a general European one.  I accept there is a European problem.  Europe has a responsibility to work with this country to resolve the problem.  I accept that the issue does not relate solely to the Irish national interest.  The reality is that it is this country which is now at the apex of that storm.  It is Ireland that is at the centre of international attention and is the story in all of the various media.  In that context, there is a responsibility on Government to clarify what is happening.  That has not happened in the House today.  What we got over the weekend was a series of qualified denials from Ministers and official sources.  There have been stories, speculation and ponderings in the international media and comments from European Central Bank sources about hypothetical talks.  We need to know what has happened.  The Taoiseach has told us that there have been discussions at official level but that no Ministers have been involved.  We must take that at face value.  It is astonishing that given what has been happening over the course of the weekend and in recent days that there would not have been direct ministerial involvement in the discussions that have been taking place.  There is speculation that this country is in bailout territory as far as the European institutions and our banks are concerned.  That is adding to the worries people already have.People have been affected directly by the crisis that has occurred.  More than 400,000 people are out of work.  Many people have lost businesses.  Many businesses are not able to access credit from the banking institutions.  Large numbers of people have mortgages.  Many of them are in negative equity and are worried about how they will pay.  In addition to the worry of families that are seeing their children, many of them well educated, having to emigrate in order to make a future for themselves, people are now seriously worried about the future of the country's economy and finances and its economic sovereignty and independence.  There is a mood across the country that we are about to lose our economic independence if in fact we have not already done so.  There is a responsibility on the Taoiseach and the Government to address that in an upfront way.  His statement does not do that.It is not just what is happening now.  It is the sequence of things that have happened.  We can go back over the history of how the Government managed or mismanaged the economy.  We can go back over the decision on the bank guarantee which the Taoiseach told us would not cost the taxpayer anything.  We now know the consequence of that.  We can go back over the mistake and tragedy it was to provide the guarantee to Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society and the consequences that has had for the banking system, the country and the economy.

I drew attention to the comments made by Daniel Gros of the Centre for European Policy Studies this morning where he set out clearly that the banking guarantee has led to the economic downfall of the country and that the consequence of that guarantee is that the fortunes of the banks and of the State are now perceived to be as one by investors and others outside of the country.  That is what has us where we are.The Taoiseach indicated that he wants market conditions to stabilise and that anything that can be done should be done, or that anything that he can do, he will do to make that happen.  There is one thing he can do to help make that happen.  That is for his Government to resign.  That is necessary for a number of reasons.  First, because any Government with any sense of self-respect that would have got the country into the mess that he and his Government have got it into would do the decent thing and go.  Second, even if that were not a consideration, what is now required is the change and the renewal of confidence that comes with giving the people the opportunity to have their say, to elect a new Government which will have a mandate for four to five years and that will provide a fresh start for the country.

However, the Government can decide to bring to an end the uncertainty and lack of confidence which the Taoiseach's and the Government's continuation in office is bringing down on this country.

It is simply unthinkable that the Taoiseach intends to continue to serve out the next 18 months or whatever is left of the normal life of the Government in circumstances where there is no confidence in the Government among the people and where clearly and more significantly there is no confidence in the Government internationally.  Outside Ireland, people believe there will be a general election in the next 18 months.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	291	If the Taoiseach would give the House real information, I would happily give way to him, but he said nothing in his ten minutes.  He behaved exactly as he did during Leaders' Questions this afternoon, in that he danced on the head of a pin around a concoction of words that was probably put together by an official in the Department of Finance and which provided no information whatsoever.Let us be clear.  I welcome the opportunity at any time to discuss this urgent matter in the House.  In order to do so constructively, we need information from the Government as to what talks are ongoing in Europe and what talks have been held in Europe in recent days, but the Taoiseach told us nothing about them.  He is hiding behind words.  We are long beyond the stage of hiding behind words.  The bluffing and fibbing that have been ongoing for two years are part of the problem because they are part of the reason the markets and the Irish people have no confidence in the Government.  When will the Taoiseach ever learn?  When will he consider returning honesty and integrity to the project that is government in this State?  It does not exist currently.  It simply is not there.The banking crisis has been at the centre of policy and the Government for two years while the latter ignored any stimulus.  By and large, it also ignored anything to do with job retention and job creation.  It announced some 650,000 in the past six months, but where are they?  This is further bluff and nonsense.  In the same way, the House was misled in September 2008 when we were told the banks were not too serious a problem and that it was down to a liquidity issue.  We were to get over that hump, introduce the guarantee and live happily ever after.  It was nonsense.  We now know that the Taoiseach was sitting in the Department of Finance with the very characters who, alongside the Government, created this mess.  Did they not tell him the truth?  According to some of the innuendo in reports, they shared with the Taoiseach the seriousness of the situation.

The latter constitutes one fifth of the ECB's total investment in banks across Europe.  Does the Taoiseach believe we can continue to fill the black hole that is the Irish banking system?  Does he believe this is good enough?  It is not working.  One reason for this is that many of the crooks who headed the banking sector are still in place.  I would not expect them to change, seeing as how they are getting plenty of encouragement from the Government.The Taoiseach is telling us another fib, namely, that we are doing brilliantly and do not need to return to the market for funding until the middle of 2011.  Why do he and Ministers keeping repeating it?  They know it cannot be done.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	335	What is the Government going to do?  Will it start pouring the funds in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, into the banks?  If not, it will need to return to the markets.  This is more fibbing on the part of the Government.It is time for integrity and honesty.  Take my word on this — the markets would enjoy a level of openness and honesty from the Government, as would the House.  In the past while, the nonsensical figures coming from the Government have been so far out.  I do not know whether the Government is getting it wrong, which would constitute incompetence —  I am sure none of us on the Opposition benches would be surprised — or deliberately misleading us.  One is as bad as the other.  We need integrity and openness on all of these matters.  In that event, the House could deal with them properly.If the Government wants a solution to the banking problem, it is important that I share with it the Sinn Féin position.  We are still adamant that what is required is a stable, steady and trustworthy State bank.  Had one been put in place two years ago instead of the nonsense the Government got up to, we would not be in this deep crisis.  We would have economic difficulties, but we would not be in this difficulty.  Whatever crazy ideological opposition the Government has to the proposal is beyond me.  However, had it put in place a proper and stable State bank, there would not have been nearly as many job losses because our businesses would have been viable.  Those SMEs, which are folding because of the lack of credit, would still be operating and we would be generating some type of stimulus in the real economy.  However, the Government chose not to do that and opted for the easy option, to bail out these corrupt bankers and prolong the agony the taxpayers of this State and others will have to pay for over decades, and it is now inter-generational.  Until the Taoiseach changes his mind, we shall be in serious difficulty.I hope there is an opportunity to debate the outcome of whatever messing is going on in Europe at these meetings this evening and tomorrow.  Unless something positive emerges — I do not expect that it will — then God help the poor unfortunate people of this State who are not among the wealthy elite that is constantly protected by this Government.

employer that affects an employee to his or her detriment with respect to any term or condition of his or her employment and which is consequent upon a protected disclosure by the employee.(3) For the purposes of subsection (2) but without prejudice to its generality, penalization includes suspension, lay-off or dismissal (including a dismissal within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2005), or the threat of suspension, lay-off or dismissal, demotion or loss of opportunity for promotion, transfer of duties, change of location of place of work, reduction in wages or a change in working hours, imposition of any discipline, reprimand or other penalty (including a financial penalty), coercion, intimidation or harassment, injury, damage or loss, and threats of reprisal.(4) Subsection (2) shall not be construed in a manner which prevents an employer from ensuring that the business of the body concerned is carried on in an efficient and effective manner.8B.—Where an employee makes, in good faith and not for personal gain, a disclosure to an authorised person and the employee has reasonable grounds for believing that it will show one or more of the following:(a) that a criminal offence has been committed, is being committed, or is likely to be committed;(b) that a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply with any legal obligation to which he is subject;(c) that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur;(d) that the health and safety of any individual has been, is being or is likely to be endangered;(e) that the environment has been, is being or is likely to be damaged;(f) that there is conduct which has led, is leading or is likely to lead to a misuse or substantial waste of public funds;(g) that

has been, is or is likely to be at risk;(i) that the actions of any person employed has posed, is posing or is likely to pose a risk to the health or welfare of the public;(j) that the information tending to show any matter falling within any one of the preceding paragraphs has been, is likely to be deliberately concealed or destroyed;then disclosure shall be a protected disclosure under this Act.8C.—Notwithstanding anything in the Official Secrets Act 1963 a disclosure of information to which section 15 relates shall be a protected disclosure if the employee makes the disclosure in accordance with section 17.8D.—(1) A qualifying disclosure is made in accordance with this section if the worker—(a) makes the disclosure in good faith to a person prescribed by Regulation made by the Minister for Finance for the purposes of this section, and(b) reasonably believes—(i) that the relevant disclosure falls within any description of matters in respect of which that person is so prescribed, and(ii) that the information disclosed, and any allegation contained in it, are substantially true.(2) An order prescribing persons for the purposes of this section may specify persons or descriptions of persons, and shall specify the descriptions of matters in respect of which each person, orpersons of each descriptions, is or are prescribed.8E.—(1) A person is not liable in damages in consequence of a protected disclosure.(2) Subsection (1) does not apply in respect of a person who makes a disclosure knowing it to be reckless as to whether it is false, misleading, frivolous or vexatious or who, in connection with a disclosure, furnishes information that the person knows to be false or misleading.(3) The reference in subsection (1) to liability in damages shall include a reference to any other form of relief.8F.—(1) An employer shall not penalise an employee for making a protected disclosure.(2) A contravention of subsection (1) is a ground of complaint by an employee to a rights commissioner.(3) In proceedings before a rights commissioner or the Labour Court in relation to a complaint of a contravention of subsection (1), it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that the disclosure was a protected disclosure.(4) If the contravention of subsection (1) was a dismissal of the employee within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2005, relief may not be granted to the employee both under this section and under those Acts.(5) A rights commissioner hearing a complaint under this section shall—(a) give the parties an opportunity to be heard and to present any evidence relevant to the complaint,(b) give a decision in writing, and(c) communicate it to the parties.(6) A decision of a rights commissioner under subsection (5) shall do one or more of the following:(a) declare that the complaint was or, as the case may be, was not well founded;(b) require the employer to comply with subsection (1) and to take specified steps;(c) order the employer to pay to the employee compensation of such amount (if any) as is just and equitable having regard to all the circumstances.(7) A rights commissioner shall not entertain a complaint under this section unless it is presented to him or her within the period of 12 months beginning on the date of the contravention, unless there are circumstances that prevented the presentation of the complaint within that period, in which case the rights commissioner may allow such further period for the presentation of a complaint under this section, not exceeding 6 months from the expiration of the period of 12 months, as the rights commissioner considers reasonable.(8) (a) A complaint under this section shall be presented to a rights commissioner by giving notice of it in writing to him or her and the notice shall contain such particulars and be in such form as may be specified from time to time by the Minister for Finance.(b) A copy of a notice under paragraph (a) shall be given to the employer by the rights commissioner.(9) Proceedings under this section before a rights commissioner shall be conducted otherwise than in public.(10) A rights commissioner shall furnish the Labour Court with a copy of any decision given by the commissioner under this section.(11) A party to proceedings under this section before a rights commissioner may appeal to the Labour Court from a decision of the rights commissioner and, on an appeal, the Labour Court shall—(a) give the parties an opportunity to be heard by it and to present to it any evidence relevant to the appeal,(b) make a determination in writing in relation to the appeal affirming, varying or setting aside the decision, and(c) communicate the determination to the parties.(12) (a) An appeal under this section shall be

of this subsection and to be so signed is deemed to be so signed and shall be admitted as evidence without proof of the signature of the Superintendent purporting to sign the certificate.”.This amendment proposes to replace the existing new section 8A, which is referred to in section 4 of this Bill as being inserted into the Prevention of Corruption Act 2001.  The provision in the Bill before the House essentially applies to public officials, and it is by way of a form of whistleblower's provision to allow for public officials in certain circumstances to blow the whistle on criminal and bad behaviour.The difficulty is that the provision contained in the Bill does not go far enough.  In Fine Gael's view there is a need for a far wider and broader provision.  In that context we have tabled a very substantial amendment, which will appear in the formal Dáil record of debates.  However, I shall refer to part of the substance of what is being proposed.  We are proposing new sections, 8A and 8B.  The kernel of the amendment is in the provisions in the new section 8B, to be included in the 2001 Act.  It reads:8B.—Where an employee makes, in good faith and not for personal gain, a disclosure to an authorised person and the employee has reasonable grounds for believing that it will show one or more of the following:(a) that a criminal offence has been committed, is being committed, or is likely to be committed;(b) that a person has failed, is failing or is likely to fail to comply with any legal obligation to which he is subject;(c) that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, is occurring or is likely to occur;(d) that the health and safety of any individual has been, is being or is likely to be endangered;(e) that the environment has been, is being or is likely to be damaged;(f) that there is conduct which has led, is leading or is likely to lead to a misuse or substantial waste of public funds;(g) that there is conduct leading to concern about questionable accounting, internal controls or auditing matters;(h) that the health or welfare of a person who is receiving a health or personal social service has been, is or is likely to be at risk;(i) that the actions of any person employed has posed, is posing or is likely to pose a risk to the health or welfare of the public;(j) that the information tending to show any matter falling within any one of the preceding paragraphs has been, is likely to be deliberately concealed or destroyed;then disclosure shall be a protected disclosure under this Act.Essentially, this is designed to ensure that where a protected disclosure is made, an individual cannot be prosecuted or dismissed.  Where an employer attempts to dismiss an individual,there are appropriate remedies available to him or her and appropriate compensation can be ordered.The new sections 8C and 8D, which are of relevance also, read:8C.—Notwithstanding anything in the Official Secrets Act 1963 a disclosure of information to which section 15 relates shall be a protected disclosure if the employee makes the disclosure in accordance with section 17.8D.—(1) A qualifying disclosure is made in accordance with this section if the worker—(a) makes the disclosure in good faith to a person prescribed by Regulation made by the Minister for Finance for the purposes of this section, and(b) reasonably believes—(i) that the relevant disclosure falls within any description of matters in respect of which that person is so prescribed, and(ii) that the information disclosed, and any allegation contained in it, are substantially true.These are extremely important provisions.  It is particularly appropriate that on this day of all days this Bill comes before this House and these issues are being debated.  I want to give a very stark illustration of the possible use of this provision and how it might have been used in the past in the public good and to the benefit of the State and everyone living here.Under existing law, if, three or four years ago, an employee of Anglo Irish Bank blew the whistle on some of the exotic conduct of the board of that bank and those in managerial positions at the bank, that employee could have been subject to dismissal.  The dismissal would have been regarded as fair, the individual would have had no right to compensation and, indeed, in certain circumstances, could have found himself or herself at risk of criminal prosecution.  To this day, we do not have adequate legislation to deal with and address the need for the protection of individuals who want to blow the whistle on what they see as corrupt and bad behaviour within the businesses in which they are employed, be they in a junior or senior position.  The provisions in the measure before us deal essentially with public officials at governmental or European level.  They do not deal with the protections that should be available in other circumstances to ensure that certain ethical standards are met, laws are complied with and where there is illegal conduct, the whistle is blown and action is taken.  People who are whistleblowers should not be confronted with the dilemma of staying quiet and remaining in employment or blowing the whistle and becoming unemployed and, possibly because of the strength of the corporation in which they are employed, being portrayed as either nut cases or pariahs within society.We could all in this House name some individuals whom we are aware of who attempted to blow the whistle on events in recent years, but whose whistleblowing was ignored and they found themselves out in the cold as a consequence of their conduct.  It is extraordinary that to this very day our legislation in this area is grossly inadequate.  As a matter of principle, I, and the Fine Gael Party, welcome the fact that the House is now dealing with Report Stage of this Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill 2008 and that the Bill is on the verge of being completed.  As the Bill was published in 2008, it cannot be described as having been given priority or of being speedily processed through the House.  I deplore the fact that we are not addressing issues more extensively in this area that deserved to be addressed.  There is more than one elephant in this particular room.I am being careful in what I say because I am very conscious that there is more information that could be put on the record of this House that might be utilised by those who are currently the subject of investigation to try to avoid having to face the full rigors of the law should any prosecution ever be taken.  Our law in this area is not adequate.  This Bill does not provide the comprehensive legal change that is required.  This particular amendment — I am conscious we are on Report Stage and not Second Stage — is designed to address some of the issues that require to be addressed in our legislation to deal with the issue of whistleblowing, to provide protection to those who act in good faith on the basis of information made available to them and who seek to facilitate the investigation into alleged criminal conduct in circumstances in which at present it may not merely be difficult for them to do so, but may result in their loss of employment and being rendered one of the 450,000 individuals who are currently unemployed in our State.This is an important amendment.  It was also canvassed on Committee Stage on behalf of Fine Gael, but it was not taken on board by the Minister.  I note the Minister is, in some of the amendments we are discussing that are within the confines of this Bill, trying to tidy up some aspects of the Bill.  Knowing what we now know and being where we now are and aware of some of the extraordinary conduct within our financial institutions, there is an urgent public need to go beyond those operating as public servants and to comprehensively extend our law in this area with regard to whistleblowing.  What we need is one particular statute, a consolidated statute, dealing with corruption and criminal offences relating to it and protecting whistleblowers as opposed to piecemeal legislation contained in a number of Acts going back now over 100 years, which makes the law difficult to tease out and understand for many who seek to ascertain where it is.I have no optimism that this amendment will be accepted by the Minister.  It is the Minister's form to reject every amendment that comes from the Opposition side of the House on every piece of legislation over which he has control.  However, the amendment has been tabled in the public interest.  There is a public interest priority and need that legislation such as proposed in this amendment be enacted and prioritised.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I prepared a Bill on this issue.  I commend Deputy Shatter for the time he has taken in constructing amendment No. 1.  I intend to move amendments Nos. 2 and 3 when we reach them, while accepting that they are being discussed now, as part of a group, with amendment No. 1.I was disappointed when the Government voted initially to accept my Bill, which subsequently died on Committee Stage, proving the Government was no more amenable to the Bill at that Stage than it was on the first occasion.  We badly need reform in our society in the form of protection for whistleblowers.  Following everything we have seen during the past four years, I would have thought it plain to everyone and common ground in the House that we need protection for whistleblowers, and not on a sectoral or segmented basis.We all know what happened during the beef tribunal.  The witch hunt was to find out who leaked information about the skullduggery and tax evasion going on at that time in the Goodman empire.  We recently witnessed, in respect of Allied Irish Banks, what happens to whistleblowers.  The whistleblower usually ends up outside the employment, with little enough regard had to the loss to the public interest of acting on whistleblower information and protecting the whistleblower when that information is brought into the public domain.Our Exchequer retrieved just over €1 billion as a result of the DIRT inquiry and it is believed that came into the public domain because of an internal employee in Allied Irish Banks.  That was the suspicion.  More attention was devoted to that than what he had to say about wrongdoing, yet because this House, exceptionally, acted on it and caused a committee of the House to inquire into it, which retrieved more than €1 billion for the State, the reaction of the House since has been to sit idly by while inquiry by parliamentary committee has been struck down.  It has done nothing to refurbish the law.  The result is a loss of autonomy to the House and gradual erosion of the powers of Parliament vis-á-vis the Executive.  The Government has acquiesced in that, because without its approval, Opposition Members do not have the numbers to refurbish the law.Amendment No. 2 proposes the insertion of the words "or suspicion" because the reality of the world in corporate Ireland is the person may not be able to establish more than that it is a suspicion and sometimes the issues are so big that it is for others to establish if that suspicion is well founded.  To expect someone to come out of the system and prove something or simply to do something because they are of a opinion is not good enough.  The purpose of my amendment, which is to protect the reporting of suspicion as well as opinion, is necessary in this particular Bill.Amendment No. 3 proposes the deletion of the words "has been or is being" and the replacement with "may have been or may be being".  The purpose of the amendment is to widen the circumstances in which protection is afforded to whistleblowers because, as drafted, the new section 8A only provides protection for persons who report an opinion that an offence definitely has been or definitely is being committed.  This should be widened to cover a situation where a person reports a suspicion as opposed to a definite opinion.  Given all the skullduggery and wrongdoing we have seen in corporate Ireland — to our greatest cost within the banking system — a necessary and essential reinforcement of this Bill would be to take on board that concept.Most people do not believe we could have reached the stage we have reached this evening and they ask fundamental, straightforward questions about how all this could have gone on in the banks with nobody blowing the whistle.  The answer is that if a person were to blow the whistle, he or she would have lost his or her employment.  That is the reality, yet we are in a situation now where, notwithstanding the debate we have just heard, this country's economic sovereignty is at risk because of the behaviour and reckless conduct, if not criminality, of the banks.  That is why we are where we are.  We do not know what will come out of tonight, we do know what is going to come out of tomorrow and it is plain that the Government does not know but everything for which people fought in this country is at risk now because of misbehaviour, wrongdoing and reckless conduct in the banking system.What is the point in us condemning this and the Minister saying he will agree with us about the banks if we do not take steps to prevent this ever happening again?  We have one slight Bill before us.  Our anti-corruption laws, even to comply with our international responsibilities, are not up to speed.  It is still only a slight Bill but it would be strengthened if the Minister was prepared to take on board these amendments.  If the Minister for Finance, for example, is successful this evening, he will return tomorrow evening like Chamberlain waving a piece of paper in his hand saying "Peace in our time.  We've got a bailout for the banks."  That is yet another bailout for the banks but the reality is that will have the most onerous implications for our society and for our economy, whether he can separate the banks from the international perception that this is all sovereign debt now because of the guarantee and one cannot separate one from the other and one can provide financial assistance only to a member state, not to a bank.If the member state wants to put it into a bank, that might be capable of being negotiated but how did this harm befall us?  How did we all let one small casino bank grow like Topsy until it threatened the entire banking system?  When The New York Times asked “Can a bank bring down a country?”, it was sneered at in circles in this House and outside but that is exactly the situation we are tottering on this evening.  A bank can bring down a country and, therefore, if there is not intent on the part of the Government to refurbish the legislation so that this kind of reckless misconduct cannot happen again, why are we here?  We must be able to take measures to ensure that, while not stifling business and entrepreneurship, plain wrongdoing or suspicion of wrongdoing can be brought to the attention of the relevant authority without the person bringing it being put at risk of his or her employment.  I ask the Minister to make a positive response to the amendments.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	346	We discussed amendment No. 1 on Committee Stage and I outlined Government policy regarding the protection in law for persons making reports in good faith.  Previous mention was made of the corruption laws in our country.  Significant anti-corruption legislation is on our Statute Book.  The Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1889 to 2005, relate to this area.  I indicated that I have asked my officials to produce consolidated legislation, once this Bill is passed, containing all provisions relating to corruption.The principal purpose of the legislation is to ensure compliance by Ireland with the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions.  However, it should be pointed out that whistleblower protection provisions in this Bill are not confined to bribery of foreign public officials and apply to any person reporting his or her opinion that an offence under the Prevention of Corruption Acts has been committed.  The Bill is quite extensive in its scope and its provisions are applicable to a wide variety of persons as set out in the Prevention of Corruption Act 2001.  The anti-corruption legislation we have covers any person employed by or on behalf of another, or any person employed by or acting on behalf of the public administration of the State.There are ongoing issues relating to the investigation of what went wrong in Anglo Irish Bank and I assure the Deputies that I understand from discussions with the Garda Commissioner and the Garda Síochána that existing legislation is sufficient in respect of any criminality that may have occurred in that instance.  Clearly that is yet to be decided.  With regard to this piece of legislation, a person employed in either the public or private sector who suspects an offence under the prevention of corruption legislation is being committed and reports that submission will be protected.  The communication must be made in good faith and not be frivolous, vexatious, intentionally false or misleading.The protection afforded is two-fold.  First, a person will have no liability in damages arising from that communication and, second, if a whistleblower makes or wishes to make a report in confidence, he or she may do so.  The provisions in this Bill have been drafted with the intention of ensuring protection for the whistleblower.  They clarify the rights of redress open to an individual who may be penalised by an employer for reporting a corruption offence.  In drafting this measure, it is my intention that whistleblowers with a genuine belief that a corruption offence is taking place should be given every encouragement to report that opinion to an appropriate person.  It is my intention that the full protection of the law should be available to these people.Deputy Shatter proposes to provide in this Bill whistleblower protection for a broad and diverse range of issues and sectors, whereas the purpose of the Bill as discussed today is to afford protection to whistleblowers reporting suspected corruption offences.  The amendment as it stands does not relate only to offences contained in the Bill but proposes to protect disclosures in a wide variety of circumstances unconnected with corruption offences.  His amendment addresses matters as diverse as health and safety, auditing, miscarriages of justice, environmental damage and much more.  These are not the issues under consideration with this Bill, as I indicated on Committee Stage when this amendment was proposed.As Members will know, it has been Government policy for some time to deal with the issue of protection for whistleblowers on a sectoral basis rather than on an omnibus basis.  This is a very firm commitment reflected in a wide variety of Bills.  Deputy Shatter's amendment and the Private Members' Bill published previously by Deputy Shatter assumed that a single all-encompassing whistleblower provision is the best way to proceed.  I have already set out in a parliamentary question today to Deputy Varadkar how the matter was considered by the Government a number of years ago, with certain legal obstacles identified which indicated that the application of whistleblowers' protection within a single statute would not be effective in the variety of circumstances in which it would apply.  The Government does not want to introduce whistleblower protection which, if tested in the courts, might be found wanting.  What is needed are solutions that will work well in the particular circumstances of each case.  That is ultimately why, on balance, it became clear that a sectoral approach to the issue would be more effective and efficient.A wide range of Bills have already been passed by this House with whistleblower provisions specific to those particular areas.  These include the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998, the Competition Act 2002, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the Employment Permits Act 2006, the Health Act 2007, the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007, the Consumer Protection Act 2007, the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, the Chemicals Act 2008, the Labour Services (Amendment) Act 2009, the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, the Charities Act 2009, and the Inland Fisheries Act 2010.  In addition, a number of Bills currently in preparation contain whistleblower protections, including the Employment Agency Regulation Bill 2009, the Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2010, the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008, the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 and the Bill being considered by the House today, all of which contain similar protections specific to certain areas.The Garda Síochána Act has particular whistleblower protection and provisions relevant to the area but it is more comprehensive; it may not necessarily be applicable in other areas.  The way whistleblowing in the Garda Síochána Act is framed with the independent person is very different from whistleblowing provisions in other pieces of legislation.  The issue is better because it is tailored.  On the advice of the Attorney General, the Government decided to deal with whistleblowing on a case by case basis rather than dealing with an all-encompassing piece of legislation as proposed by Deputy Rabbitte.Amendment Nos. 2 and 3 from Deputy Rabbitte provide for the insertion of the words "or suspicion" after the word "opinion" into section 8A(1) of the 2001 Act, and the substitution of "may have been or may be being" for the existing wording of "has been or is being" thereafter.  As I stated in the course of the debate on Committee Stage, the advice which I received was to the effect that an opinion can be founded on a belief, which would encompass actual knowledge or suspicion.  Given that an opinion can be founded on a suspicion, my advice was that the addition of the word "suspicion" was not required.  Accordingly, it is considered that the addition of the words in the amendment would not actually broaden the existing meaning of the provision nor would the amendment assist in further clarifying the test which would determine whether the protection under this measure for a person making reports in good faith would apply.Deputy Rabbitte will recall the official amendment to this section which was agreed on Committee Stage.  The earlier test required before the whistleblower could be afforded protection against civil liability under this section was simply whether he or she had acted "reasonably and in good faith" in forming the opinion and communicating it to the appropriate person.  On Committee Stage, further tests were introduced, which were agreed by the committee, which must be passed before the potential whistleblower obtains protection from liability in damages under this provision.The section provides that the whistleblower is not liable in damages or other forms of relief unless when communicating the opinion regarding an offence under the legislation providing he or she did so not knowing or being reckless as to whether the view was false, misleading, frivolous, vexatious or giving information that the person knew to be false or misleading.  In this section I am endeavouring to secure a reasonable balance in encouraging whistleblowers to come forward and protecting their rights while also paying due regard to the rights and entitlements of the person subject to the whistleblower's report.  Taking all the factors into account I am of the view that the existing text, providing protection for reports in respect of an offence which has been or is being committed, is the best wording and is likely to be the most effective.I am proposing amendment No. 21.  As I mentioned on Committee Stage, my Department received observations from An Garda Síochána which raised certain issues about the implications of attempting to provide for absolute confidentiality in the context of investigation of certain cases where the whistleblower could come forward to expose corruption.  As the Bill stands, there is a reference to the Garda Commissioner disclosing the identity of a confidential communicator for the purpose of investigating the alleged offence but not for the purpose of prosecuting the offence.  The provisions of the Bill as it stands might have been interpreted in a way which would have hampered disclosure of the identity of the whistleblower to the DPP.  Such disclosure by the Garda Commissioner might be necessary to enable the alleged offence to be investigated and prosecuted.The amendments to Schedule 2 will allow for limited disclosure of the whistleblower's identity where the Garda Commissioner is satisfied that disclosure to a member of the Garda or a civilian staff member or the DPP is necessary for the investigation or prosecution of the alleged offence.  In proposing this amendment, I assure the House that I have considered the matter very carefully in light of the concerns raised by the Garda and the advice of the Attorney General.  I am eager to ensure that the rights and entitlements of all the parties involved are given due weight.  My aim is to provide the requisite level of protection for whistleblowers while ensuring that those who engage in corruption can be successfully brought to book for their actions.While we had a good discussion in this regard on Committee Stage, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive.  I repeat the general point that the Government decided a number of years ago to deal with these issues on an issue-by-issue basis.  The record speaks for itself in regard to the address of these issues in the many pieces of legislation that are being and have been drafted and passed by this House and which are specific to those particular areas.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	349	The difficulty with this Bill is that the things a whistleblower could do are constrained.  The Government was wrong to have adopted a policy to provide legislation in regard to whistleblowers in, as the Minister puts it, a sectoral context rather than a global context.  A global piece of legislation could have been drafted which contained within it, for example, specific exceptions that might have been necessary regarding the manner in which the Garda Síochána needs to conduct investigations.I was interested to note the Minister's reference to the 1998 Act which provided protection for those who in good faith reported child abuse.  That was the first Act dealing with whistleblowers and it was introduced by me in this House as a Private Members' Bill.  It remains today of particular importance in the area of child abuse.  It is noteworthy that the manner in which the current Fianna Fáil-Green Government deals with Opposition Bills, such as that published today, would make it impossible to have such Bills enacted, just as Deputy Rabbitte's very excellent Bill dealing with whistleblowers has found itself lost in some sort of legislative black hole because of the Government's approach to it.  The Government, which did not have the courage to vote it down, just sent it off to a committee controlled by Fianna Fáil to let it languish.I want to make one point only.  Among the issues the amendment I have tabled covers is to allow someone to act as a whistleblower where the person is aware of "conduct which has led, is leading or is likely to lead to a misuse or substantial waste of public funds".  That conduct may not be corruption within the narrow confines of the criminal law as is defined in our corruption Acts but it is conduct that has been all too prevalent and has cost this State a huge amount.For example, if someone in FÁS had blown the whistle a long time ago, how much money would have been saved for the taxpayer?  One can argue whether what happened in FÁS was corruption in a criminal context or simply mismanagement and maladministration.  However, if there is substantial maladministration within a public body where hundreds of thousands of euro of taxpayers' money is disappearing down the toilet, an employee of that body should be able to blow the whistle, know their job is protected and instigate by their conduct an appropriate investigation and accountability for the loss.What the Minister will vote against today is allowing for whistleblowing in that type of circumstance.  The sectoral approach has proved to be grossly and totally inadequate with every new revelation of misuse of funds by State agencies and bodies that is discovered and addressed within the Committee of Public Accounts or by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We need a better and more rigorous law in this area.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I look forward to seeing the reply.  I believe it was 1999 when I introduced my Whistleblowers Protection Bill.  I never had explained to me or I never received any letter from the Minister stating why the advice from the Attorney General was to the effect that there were legal impediments in the way of a general whistleblowers protection Act and that the Government had resolved on a sectoral approach.  I have never understood this and I do not know why we would be reluctant in this regard, given the careful manner in which it is framed, whereby a person giving false, mischievous, vexatious or frivolous information exposes himself or herself to committing an offence.  I do not know why we cannot do it or are not doing it.Deputy Shatter has given explicit examples.  He did not touch on, for example, the entire area of the hospital system, which is familiar to the Acting Chairman.  It is not just that millions of euro of taxpayers' money might have been saved if we had whistleblower protection but perhaps a great deal of pain and anguish for so many people in our hospitals would have been prevented if conscientious people working in the hospitals felt their employment was protected in the context of bringing misconduct or dereliction of duty to the attention of the relevant authority.This seems to be the last opportunity we will have to import this into a Bill that would have general application.  I had hoped the Minister would have agreed to do so.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	353	As I said earlier and also when we discussed this previously, I have no doubt predecessors of mine indicated why the Government had decided, based on the strong advice of the Attorney General, that a much more robust way of dealing with whistleblower protection was by doing it on a sectoral basis in order to tailor it to the circumstances that pertain in the particular area.  There is no doubt there is existing and substantial legislation in the area of corruption and its prosecution.  What we are endeavouring to do here, as is clear under the existing 2001 legislation, is to ensure the provisions on whistleblowing, particularly those added to by this Bill, create a situation where any official, public or private, who complies with the law in regard to good faith can make a report.  To a certain extent, the Deputies are exaggerating in regard to some of the specific issues that have arisen.With regard to amendment No. 4, we propose to remove the words "ought reasonably to know".  This, in effect, reduces the test for knowingly making a false report to an objective test so that it depends now on what a whistleblower actually knew, not what they subjectively could be expected to have known.  I propose the amendment.

In page 6, to delete lines 6 to 8 and substitute the following:"(5) An employer shall not penalise or threaten penalisation against an employee, or cause or permit any other person to penalise or threaten penalisation against an employee, for—".Amendments Nos. 6, 8 and 9 relate to penalisation of an employee for making a report of a suspected corruption offence.  Section 4 inserts section 8A into the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001, and subsection (5) of this section, which relates to penalisation or threatened penalisation by an employer or a person acting on the employer's behalf, prohibits such action against an employee as a result of his or her making a report in good faith of suspected corruption.  Subsection (7) provides that an employer contravening this provision is guilty of an offence, and the purpose of amendment No. 6 is to ensure that as well as action taken directly by the employer, the offence at subsection (7) will encompass actions carried out by a third party as a result of the employer's causing or permitting another person to penalise or threaten penalisation of the employee.Amendment No. 8 affects subsection (15)(a), which provides that the term “penalisation” will not be construed in a way that prevents the employer from ensuring that his or her business is carried on in an efficient manner.  The amendment provides for the deletion of the words “and effective”.  I am advised that this term was so broad that it would be difficult to apply in practice in an employment context.  Deputies will also note the provision in subsection (15)(b) whereby the term “penalisation” cannot be construed in a way that would prevent the employer from taking any action required for economic, technical or organisational reasons.Amendment No. 9 is a drafting amendment which clarifies that "penalisation" means the specified acts as listed in the definition of this term, whether they are carried out by an employer or by a person acting on behalf of the employer.  I commend these amendments to the House.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 11, line 9, to delete "his or her parent or guardian" and substitute the following:"the employee's parent or guardian with his or her consent".Schedule 1 of the Bill provides redress for compensation and a mechanism for complaints to a rights commissioner for an employee who may have been penalised or threatened with penalisation by an employer as a result of having made a report to an appropriate person, containing his or her opinion of a suspected corruption offence.  The purpose of these amendments, which are of a drafting nature, is to provide clarity that where an employee has not reached the age of 18, his or her parent or guardian may present a complaint to the rights commissioner on that employee's behalf.  Amendment No. 10 affords a more precise wording in setting out that in respect of an employee under 18 years of age, the employee's parent or guardian can, with his or her consent, present a complaint to the rights commissioner on that employee's behalf.  Amendment No. 11, which again is a drafting amendment, substitutes "the employee" for "his or her" to improve clarity of meaning.

In page 11, to delete lines 27 to 32 and substitute the following:"(b) require the employer to take a specified course of action, which may include, in a case where the penalisation constitutes a dismissal within the meaning of section 8A(13), re-instatement or re-engagement;”.Amendment No. 12 relates to Schedule 1 of the Bill, and paragraph (1) deals with redress for an employee, following a complaint to the rights commissioner in cases of penalisation or threats of penalisation to that employee.  The amendment is essentially tidying up the drafting of subparagraph (3).  The reference to compensation which was in clause (b) is unnecessary as compensation is provided for in clause (c), and the introductory line of subparagraph (3) makes it clear that a rights commissioner may order one or more of the reliefs specified in clauses (b) and (c).  The new wording is in line with the approach being taken in the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008.While the amount of damages a rights commissioner may award under clause (c) is limited to 104 weeks of pay and calculated in accordance with the unfair dismissals regulations, paragraph 3(8) makes it clear that an employee who suffers penalisation must choose whether to seek redress under this Act, or whether to seek redress under the Unfair Dismissals Acts or for wrongful dismissal at common law.Amendment No. 13 is a drafting amendment, required to enable insertion of the proposed new sub-paragraph (10) which relates to circumstances where there is a delay in making complaints by an employee.  Under subparagraph (4), the period which the employee can make a complaint to a rights commissioner is six months, beginning on the date of the contravention to which the complaint relates.  The proposed amendment No 14, inserts subparagraph 10, which provides that where a delay by an employee in presenting a complaint is due to a misrepresentation of his or her employer, then the six-month clock only runs from the date of the discovery of that misrepresentation by the employee.  I believe this is more equitable and fairer to the employee.

In page 14, line 13, after "employee" to insert the following:"(or, in the case of an employee who has not reached the age of 18 years, the employee's parent or guardian with his or her consent)".As I mentioned earlier, section 6, inserting Schedule 1 of the Bill, contains a mechanism for complaints to a rights commissioner for employees who may have been threatened with penalisation, following the making by them of whistleblowers' reports as provided for under this Bill.  There is also provision for parents or guardians of employees under the age of 18 to make a complaint to a rights commissioner on behalf of the employee, subject to getting that employee's consent to do so.  The purpose of these amendments is to ensure there is specific provision for a young employee's parent or guardian to take proceedings on his or her behalf on the basis that he or she has given consent to this.  There is provision for the institution of proceedings by a parent or guardian under the Unfair Dismissals Acts or to recover damages at common law for wrongful dismissal as provided under amendments Nos. 16 and 17.Amendments Nos. 17 and 18 provide more precise wording to clarify respectively that the employee's parent or guardian cannot institute unfair dismissal proceedings or seek damages in common law in addition to making a complaint to the rights commissioner in subparagraph (8)(b).  Amendment No. 19 reflects the previous amendments to clarify that the parent or guardian of an employee may, with his or her consent, apply to the Circuit Court for an order directing an employer to comply with a Labour Court determination.

As the Courts Act 1981 ultimately refers back to the Debtors (Ireland) Act 1840, this amendment results in a more direct reference to the effective provision where the interest rate is actually set.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The purpose of this motion is to highlight unacceptable interference with the role of the Ombudsman.  As the motion states, the Ombudsman encountered unprecedented opposition and a lack of co-operation from the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive, HSE, in the course of conducting her investigation into the right to nursing home care in Ireland, an issue that concerns many families in this country.I will first refer to some aspects of the Ombudsman's report and then discuss the first paragraph of the amendment proposed by the Minister.  In response to this report the Department put forward a multiplicity of charges against the Ombudsman.  They were that the Ombudsman exceeded her jurisdiction in undertaking the investigation; that she failed to abide by fair procedures, particularly with regard to the provision of a draft version of the investigation report; that she displayed prejudice and objective bias in the course of the investigation, which is a very serious charge; that she displayed arrogance in purporting to interpret the law, although when it comes to displays of arrogance this Government has been more guilty of it than any other body of which I am aware; and that the Ombudsman purported to deny the State bodies concerned the right to have litigation determined by the courts.  In effect, the Department and the HSE are saying that the Ombudsman undertook this investigation in bad faith.The Ombudsman states that her motivation to produce this report was to highlight the very significant difficulties faced over several decades by families seeking to make arrangements for long-term nursing home care for a family member; to represent, in many instances through their own words, the distress and upset, including financial, of people who complained to the Office of the Ombudsman over the years about nursing home care; to highlight the inadequacy and tardiness of the State's responses to these problems; to raise the issue of whether, and, if so, how, people adversely affected should have some recognition of having been failed by the State; and to raise wider questions of governance prompted by the practices highlighted in this report.The Ombudsman said she is satisfied that the investigation is within the jurisdiction conferred on her office by the Oireachtas and that the requirement to provide relevant material served on the HSE and the Department constitutes a reasonable exercise of the statutory powers conferred on the Ombudsman.  She stated that the challenge by the Department and the HSE to the Ombudsman's jurisdiction in this case is the most serious mounted against the Office of the Ombudsman since its establishment in 1984.Fine Gael believes this challenge raises important issues both about the independent role of the Ombudsman and how she should discharge that role.  From time to time there might be conflict between the Ombudsman and the HSE, but the Minister or any Department or agency of the State must not be allowed to frustrate statutory investigations.  I hope the Minister will comment on this.  Knowing what one's entitlements from the State are and being able to count on being given one's entitlements is a basic right, a right that is more important in the case of vulnerable groups such as older people.  As the Ombudsman pointed out, at the heart of the report is the question of whether there is an enforceable entitlement to be provided with long-stay nursing home care by the health board, now the HSE.  The Department and HSE contend there is no such right, while the Ombudsman believes there is such a right.  The resolution of this disagreement lies in a careful analysis of the relevant health service law and, in particular, section 52 of the Health Act 1970.The Ombudsman found that the health boards failed to fulfil their obligations to older people under section 52 of the Health Act 1970 and that this failure came about with the full knowledge and agreement of the Department.  As a result of this failure, many older people and their families suffered significant adverse effects over several decades.  The Government's health strategy, Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You, published in 2001, highlighted the need for new legislation to provide clear statutory provisions on entitlement.  According to the health strategy this would involve reviewing and updating existing legislation, rationalising the framework for entitlement — not eligibility — and ensuring that eligibility arrangements would be simplified and clarified.  This has still not happened.When the HSE was dealing with the illegal nursing home charges and the establishment of the nursing homes repayment scheme, the Minister could have clarified entitlements for nursing home care.  Again, this did not happen.  Fine Gael believes the law should be clear and that the State agencies should implement the law as it is, rather than as they would wish it to be.  The legislation should state what it means and should not be open to interpretation.  If resources to meet statutory duties are not available, the legislation should be amended to reflect practice.  The eligibility for health and personal social services Bill is at very early stages of drafting and we have no idea when it will be published.  If it were published, we could clarify much of what is in dispute in this matter.  It is absolutely certain that clear legislation pre-empts litigation.At present, the State is defending in the High Court more than 300 legal actions taken by or on behalf of people who claim that their right to long-stay nursing home care has not been honoured.  The claims of the plaintiffs are based on the contention that they have been forced to take up expensive private nursing home care because of the failure of the HSE to provide public care.  The defendants are the HSE, the Minister for Health and Children, Ireland and the Attorney General, and various combinations of these.  These families are seeking compensation from the State for costs.  To date, none of these cases has gone to hearing and judgment in the High Court.  The Ombudsman points out that this is rather surprising given that many of the cases were commenced more than five years ago.Settlements involving some level of payment to the plaintiffs have been reached in at least a dozen of these cases but details of these settlements have not been disclosed.  Perhaps the Minister could tell us why, if there were differences in these cases and what they were.  As the Ombudsman points out, the situation regarding settlements is confusing in that both the Department and the HSE argue that the plaintiffs' cases are without legal merit and that the plaintiffs have no entitlement to compensation.  One can only wonder why, in these circumstances, the State is paying public money to people whose claims it believes to be without foundation.  Fine Gael believes the Minister must clearly point out why and on what basis these cases were settled.  Does the State consider that settling individual cases by way of compensation is less costly than the case going to a hearing in court?  What about the hundreds of outstanding cases?The issues at stake here are interference with the Office of the Ombudsman and the Ombudsman's ability to perform her duties, and clarity for those who seek care from the State.  It might be the Minister's contention that the Health Act 1970 contains so many qualifications that eligibility and entitlement are unclear.  Will the Minister confirm media reports that her view is that while people may be entitled to eligibility, it does not mean they are entitled to services?In 1976 the Supreme Court ruled that Maud McInerney was entitled to long-term care because under the 1970 Health Act inpatient services included such care.  The confusion, however, remains.  The Minister's amendment to the motion states the nursing homes support scheme "addressed the previous inequity by equalising State support for those in public, private and voluntary nursing homes" and "legally defined eligibility for long-term nursing home care".  It has not, however, defined entitlement.People's entitlements when they seek long-term care must now be addressed.  If the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill was brought forward to clarify this, it would also indicate the State's responsibilities and place a cap on further exposure.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	385	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion regarding Who Cares? — An Investigation into the Right to Nursing Home Care in Ireland by Ms Emily O'Reilly, the Ombudsman.I watched with horror the "Prime Time" programme in which the Ombudsman tried to put across the failure of the Government and the Health Service Executive to co-operate with her investigation while, from another studio, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, refused to speak about the facts, dwelling on the present rather than the past.  Clearly, by agreement with RTE, the Ombudsman was refused the right to reply.  This seems to be the type of agreement the Minister is able to extract from RTE.  The same happened several months ago when she sat in RTE listening to the first-half debate on "The Frontline" and was then allowed the freedom to answer without debate in the second.The Ombudsman's report, unfortunately, bears out the facts that many in this House have been raising for some years.  I will never forget the case in which a relatively young woman in her early 70s and her more elderly husband, both diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, had to be put into a private nursing home as no other accommodation was made available for them.  All their family members were married with their own family structures to maintain, leaving them in an extremely difficult position as the cost of care came to €900 a week for each parent.I remember another case where I persuaded an aged lady to sell off a portion of the family property to fund her in a private nursing home.  When she ran into some health difficulties in that nursing home, the services were not even prepared to listen to her immediate friends.  When they brought in their own family doctor, the person was rushed to hospital.  Unfortunately, the situation was too late and the poor lady passed away.  Although the hospital and post mortem findings were quite significant, the subsequent inquiry never communicated with the friends responsible for calling the doctor concerned.  They were not allowed advise the inquiry of what really happened.  Subsequently, the inquiry went nowhere.Why was the Ombudsman obstructed by both the Department and the Health Service Executive?  Will the Minister explain why some cases are settled on the steps of the courts?  Does the State believe settling individual cases by way of compensation is less costly than going to a full hearing?  Considering the number of cases taken, why will the Minister not allow one case to proceed to legally clarify the position in this regard?In May 2002, a close friend was placed by the health authorities in a private nursing home because no other bed was available.  Her old age pension was part of the funding to that home.  Her neighbour who went into a public nursing home later, however, received a refund under the refund scheme.  No wonder there are legal cases.There was a total failure in the legislation to clarify what people were legally entitled to or otherwise.  There was a total failure by the Government to bring forward the necessary clarification in the law to ensure everyone was treated fairly.  The subvention scheme which was available in the early part of the past decade was unclear.  I dealt with nursing homes in the former western health board area which had received patients from the north-east health board area.  Nursing home management simply could not understand the different regulations that were used between the two different areas.When nursing homes increased their charges, the Health Service Executive under the Minister, Deputy Harney, refused to increase the subvention before the long-promised nursing home support Bill was introduced.  This has resulted in nursing homes following patients for debts they never personally incurred because it was the health authorities that placed them in those homes, not a relative.  Can one imagine a person 101 years of age being threatened with court proceedings?For years I have called for the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill to be introduced to bring clarity to what people are entitled to and eligible for.  I call again tonight for this Bill to be introduced as a matter of urgency.  So far the nursing home support legislation has been of some benefit to families; this year it will come in at the proposed cap of €970 million.  However, the Health Service Executive is winding down some of its public health beds with the ratio turning much more to the private sector.  Our aging population is entitled to know what the future holds for them.The Minister may believe she is above questioning by the Ombudsman.  She will, however, soon be accountable to the people.  Fine Gael believes this report raises important issues concerning the Ombudsman's independent role and how she discharges it.  From time to time, there may be conflict between the Ombudsman and the Health Service Executive.  However, the Minister for Health and Children, her Department or any other agents of the State must not be allowed to frustrate statutory investigations.  The Minister must advise us on this.Fine Gael believes the law should be clear and that State agencies should be implementing the law as it is rather than as they would wish it to be.  Legislation must state clearly what it intends instead of being open to interpretation.  If resources to meet statutory duties are not available, legislation should be amended to reflect that practice.While I accept the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill is at an early drafting stage, there is no excuse for the continuing delay in its publication.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I congratulate the Ombudsman for producing this detailed report, which meant her office having to travel a difficult road, and for being fearless in that respect.  As her report states, she did encounter hostility from both the administrative and political side of Government.  That is hugely regrettable.  Coming as it does hotfoot on a previous report by the Ombudsman into the Lost at Sea case, it reflects poorly on the Government.  It also indicates a pattern of behaviour by this Government that is contemptuous of the Office of the Ombudsman when it seeks to vindicate the rights of individual citizens.  That is a regrettable departure upon which the Minister should reflect seriously.  When it was established under legislation in the 1980s, the Office of the Ombudsman enjoyed the support of all sides of this House.  Clearly, however, the actions of the Minister and the Government, both in the context of this report and the Lost at Sea report, reflect a clear departure in respect of the Government's policy towards the Office of the Ombudsman.It is interesting to note that there are no Green Party representatives in the Chamber.  When the Lost at Sea report was raised initially the Government attempted to bury it, but at the insistence of the Green Party it was referred to the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Regrettably, however, the approach of "might is right" operates in committee.  An inbuilt Government majority means that, having gone through the contents of that report in forensic detail, the committee divided along party political lines.  It is regrettable that there were no Green Party members on the committee.  The Fianna Fáil majority on the committee voted to reject entirely the findings of the Ombudsman's office.As we can now see, at least initially, a similar report from the Government reflects the combined thinking of Independents, Fianna Fáil and the Greens.  That is an alarming departure.  If this was a functioning Legislature we should leave our party political hats outside the door in order to bring our distilled wisdom to bear on this report, as well as making recommendations which would have the imprimatur of a committee of this House acting in unison.  Because of the Whips system, however, there is an immaturity beyond belief which demonstrates the Legislature’s lack of self confidence.  We hide behind political Whips while serious work, such as these two reports, are jettisoned for party political reasons.  That is hugely regrettable.In anticipation of this debate, I tabled two questions for the Minister for Health and Children.  Unfortunately, however, for some unknown reason, the Ceann Comhairle stated that the Minister had no official responsibility to Dáil Éireann for these matters as they anticipated the debate on Private Members' business scheduled for this week.  The questions concerned the amount of compensation paid and the number of legal cases pending.  I cannot understand why the Office of the Ceann Comhairle believes that providing such information in advance of this debate would in some way seriously undermine our capacity to have a rational discussion, or in some way transgress the rights of Members or of the Minister to protection.As a Member of this House I am fed up of being abused by a process which means that I cannot carry out my duties as an elected Member to hold Ministers to account.  This system is broken beyond repair.  It requires radical surgery to make this a functioning democratic Legislature whereby we would not just rubber stamp decisions but would hold Ministers to account.  That is a clear weakness in the current system.This report is essentially about section 52 of the Health Act 1970 and whether rights to nursing home care as enshrined in that legislation were denied.  I was doing a quick calculation and I think that reflects on the management of 13 different Governments and possibly more Ministers for Health in that period.  In so far as we on this side of the House may have been implicated in the denial of those rights, I wish to apologise personally to people who were adversely affected.  The Ombudsman's report clearly states that there was a denial of entitlement.  Given the precarious nature of our public finances, it is fortunate that the Ombudsman did not go down the road — as she did in the previous report on the Lost at Sea scheme — of outlining a solution.  The hardship that was suffered by the denial of these rights caused serious financial pain to those who were adversely affected.  It is a reflection on the maturity of the Office of the Ombudsman that it has not gone down that road, but asked this House to reflect on the matter.  If we had displayed some degree of maturity in reflecting on an Ombudsman's previous report, that would have been the way to proceed.  Regrettably, however, we have not done so, which is a big problem.The HSE assumed the responsibilities of eight former health boards, but it is now beyond redemption.  The Minister knows it is impossible to get any accountability through representations by individual Members via parliamentary questions.  For instance, when I sent in a query nearly two months ago about a development in my constituency, a senior manager in the HSE South replied stating this matter would be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  Two months later, however, I have still received no response.  The same body issued an unwritten edict to senior staff in the throes of the 2007 general election to say that no bad news was to emanate from the HSE South during that campaign.  That is a fact, so the HSE is beyond redemption.  It betrays the good efforts of thousands of its frontline staff, in addition to well-intentioned middle management.  The sooner the HSE's structure is dismantled the better.  We should start again with a blank canvas to put in place a public administration for our health services that captures the abilities of those who work there.  It should enable them to deliver services more efficiently.The report accuses the HSE and the Government of obstruction and unprecedented intervention.  The Government amendment asks the House to note that the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman relates primarily to administrative actions and does not encompass issues such as Government policy, legislation passed by the Oireachtas, the conduct of litigation by the State and the wider governmental process.  In her reply to this debate, the Minister should explain how the Ombudsman can carry out her duties if she is not entitled to assess how those charged with implementing legislation carry out their administrative functions.  How can the Ombudsman conduct her functions if she is not in a position to assess how administrators interpret legislation passed by this House?  She is not seeking to direct or overturn legislation, but in the administrative process is seeking to see if legislation is being properly implemented.Deputy Crawford referred to the interview given by the Minister when she appeared on the "Prime Time" television programme.  The Minister wanted to draw a line under everything that happened up to the introduction of the nursing home subvention scheme.  The scheme is welcome and has delivered some clarity to the situation, but it was as if we should not hold anybody to account for anything that had happened prior to that date.  While the Minister and the Government may wish that to be so, it simply cannot be the case.  If citizens were previously denied their entitlements and legal rights just because we addressed the matter from a specific date, it does not mean that discrimination did not happen or that those responsible should not be held to account.The Government amendment goes on to state that Dail Éireann notes with concern the way this particular investigation was undertaken and in particular the failure to follow fair procedure.  Time does not allow me to elaborate on all of the issues I would like to address in respect of the report before us.  It would be preferable to proceed by referring this report to a committee of the House to investigate it in a forensic manner.  The experience of referring the Ombudsman's report on the lost at sea scheme to a committee of the House was futile and meaningless.  I sat through every deliberation of the committee for many weeks, with all parties given an opportunity, but the fact that deliberations of the committee were thwarted by a simple vote that was railroaded through by a Government majority raises the question of what the purpose is here.  The Government sees this House as a nuisance and an interference in its divine mission to govern.  That mission will come to an abrupt end shortly but we need to reform the way this House does business.  It is not serving the best interests of the citizens we represent.  It will seriously undermine the Ombudsman's office if it does not take this report seriously.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I compliment Deputy James Reilly on tabling this Private Members' motion.  It is sad that it is before the House.  Many years ago, I was Fine Gael's deputy spokesman on health.  One of the issues I dealt with was older people.  I raised this issue on a continual basis in regard to the way the health boards were treating the elderly in the country.  I refer in particular to those who had medical cards and were entitled to public nursing homes but the State was unable to provide beds for them.  Many found it difficult to look after their loved ones, they found it difficult when they had to go into the private sector and they found it difficult to raise the necessary finances.  Serious injustice was done to these people.Then, people who were in private nursing homes had money paid back because the State wrongfully took this money from them.  People have been hard done by and there are many cases in the Four Courts awaiting adjudication.  I cannot understand why these have not been adjudicated on by now.  Some cases have been settled and we should know what ones have been settled and why.  Many feel injustice was done.I compliment the Ombudsman on her bravery and guts.  The Minister should bring in the officials in her Department who did not co-operate with the Ombudsman.  I can understand how the Ombudsman feels on this point.  I thought this House was part of a democracy and that its wishes would be obeyed by civil servants and the HSE or the health boards as they were then.  People within the health service think they are more powerful than the Minister, who has allowed something to happen that should never have happened.  The Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, is an honest, decent woman — no more than the Minister — and both mean well.  However, they have let down the people of this country.  They handed over the power of their office to individuals who never stood for election and who do not seem to understand democracy.  I will give a simple example concerning the Minister of State, Deputy Brady, who means well.  The Government has a national policy on home help.  In the constituency of Mayo, where I come from, the HSE has disobeyed the Minister's policy and has cut hours even though the Minister of State has informed me that, under the national framework, they should not be doing so.  They continue to do so.  When I look for information from the HSE, I cannot access it.I am glad there is the Ombudsman, who is independent of this House as an outside agency.  Sometimes I get annoyed with the media because they criticise Deputies for tabling Dáil questions and tell us they cost €200.  I do not see how a Dáil question could cost €200 when we do not get answers to them.  The Minister of the day will send me a reply saying the Minister has no responsibility for the HSE.  If it is costing €200 to send this message, it is no wonder the country is in the state it is in.  Will the Minister do anything about the HSE in regard to queries I have tabled?  Today, I asked the Minister and the Ombudsman about Dáil questions, and letters I sent to the chief executive officer in Mayo that have not been replied to since April.Yesterday, a constituent of mine criticised me for not responding on the subject of a loved one whose home help hours were cut.  The home help had to go across the fields to bring bread and milk to that person and the hours of home help were cut.  I wrote to the HSE and tabled Dáil questions.  I did not receive an answer from the Minister or the HSE.  I have now sent all of the correspondence to the Ombudsman to see if she can elicit a reply.  I thank her for her courage and guts.  I am sure she sees the frustration of Members on this side of the House.  Dáil Éireann is supposed to be about accountability.  People died in this country to provide this Parliament.  Over the past number of years, the situation has developed where people outside dictate to the House.  Questions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government are referred to its website.  At the Department of Health and Children, one is told the Minister has no responsibility.  At the Department of Education and Science, staff are too busy to compile the information.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle or the Ceann Comhairle must sit down with the leaders of the parties.  We must do something about reforming this House because it means nothing.

Fine Gael is talking about disbanding the HSE, the biggest monster we have ever created.  Talk about monsters that frighten children in November, this is the greatest monster and it is costing us billions to keep it alive.  No one knows what is going on.  Last night at a public meeting, one of the home help women told me she received letters to attend to two people but both were dead.  It is no wonder the HSE is in disarray.Regarding the Ombudsman's report, I hope the Minister will answer some of the queries raised.  It is a sad day in this country when we depend on the Ombudsman, an independent person, to investigate legislation in this House and what a State agency is doing.  That should be done within the confines of the House.  We should have the powers to do so, perhaps at the level of parliamentary committee, and it is wrong that we do not.  This must be dealt with.People who depend on the State have been very badly let down.  People were entitled to beds in State homes but beds could not be found for them.  The State seemed to wash its hands of them even though the legislation was clear that anyone with a medical card over 65 years of age was entitled to a bed.  The State let them down and if the State was not able to cope or provide beds, it should have helped them to get beds in the private sector.  These people have been let down by the Government, by this Parliament and by the HSE.  Something needs to be done so that it never happens again.I remember visiting a State nursing home in Belmullet.  Someone tipped me off that things were not right.  When I came into this House after visiting it, I contacted the health and safety authorities.  They visited the home and threatened to close it down.  Someone broke a leg there.  After I raised the matter here, the health board rushed out and spent €600,000 developing it.  I should not have to raise that.  People should not have been left in those conditions.  The health board itself could not get down there quickly enough with the spin and to get the work done.  It tried to castigate me on the grounds that I should not have raised the matter.  I should have raised it.  Elderly people should not have been left in those conditions.  What has gone on with the elderly of this country is wrong.  I hope the Minister will respond to the Ombudsman's report and that what happened in recent years will never happen again.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I robustly and strongly defend the role of the Department in the investigation by the Ombudsman.  Section 4 of the Ombudsman Act 1980 states:Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Ombudsman may investigate any action taken by or on behalf of a Department of State or other person specified in Part I of the First Schedule to this Act (being an action taken in the performance of administrative functions) where, upon having carried out a preliminary examination of the matter, it appears to the Ombudsman....Under legislation, the Ombudsman is not entitled to interpret the law or to make the law, nor is the Ombudsman entitled to the State's legal strategy.  I thought it was interesting that my Department was asked for that by the Ombudsman following the enactment of the Nursing Home Support Scheme Act.  She wrote to the Department on 30 July 2009 seeking certain information.  The legislation had been passed in June 2009.  That was refused on the strong advice of the Attorney General on the basis that the Ombudsman was outside her jurisdiction.  The Department took issue with two matters on the advice of the Attorney General.  I emphasise that because in her report the Ombudsman criticised the Department for failing to take the legal advice on charging medical card holders that were in public nursing homes, yet she went on to criticise the Department for being overly reliant on legal advice.  You cannot have it every way.The first point on which we took issue is that we said we could not interpret section 52 of the 1970 Act as we were not free to do that.  The second point is that we could not inform the Ombudsman of our legal strategy on cases against the State.  It is not just an administrative matter.  The Minister, in defending actions on behalf of the State, does so in her executive capacity.  Every citizen is entitled to protect their legal strategy under the Constitution.  We would totally undermine our position if our legal strategy was to be the subject of an investigation by the Ombudsman.  In her own report——

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	404	On page ten of the report the Ombudsman indicates a list of things she requires, including the actions of the Department and the Health Service Executive in response to legal proceedings initiated on behalf of patients, information on legal proceedings and documentation.  On page 109 of the same report she indicated that she did not want that.  She said the present investigation did not extend to include the manner in which the Department and the Health Service Executive had been handling the litigation.  It is very confusing.  That was the big point of difference.The Ombudsman, as an officeholder of the State is entitled to her good name and the presumption of good faith.  As an individual she is entitled to that too, but so are civil servants, both as office holders and individuals.  I stand fully behind the civil servants in my Department in the office for older people.  They are people of integrity who are completely committed to the cause of older people but they work within the law and the resources that the Oireachtas makes available.  They are not free to interpret the law nor do they make the law.  I will not deal with the issue tonight as it goes beyond nursing home care but the Ombudsman had a lot to say about the role of the Executive vis-à-vis Parliament and the role of Ministers vis-à-vis civil servants.  Again, that is completely outside her remit.  I say that on the strong advice of the Attorney General.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	405	The report makes for uncomfortable reading.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	406	No.  All officeholders must live by the Constitution.  We all have clearly defined powers.  Section 5 of the Ombudsman Act states that the Ombudsman may investigate a matter but if the person affected by the action has initiated any court civil legal proceedings and the proceedings have not been dismissed for failure to disclose a cause the Ombudsman is precluded from investigating the case.  In spite of that, the case of Mrs. B, who is the centrepiece of the investigation, is currently before the High Court.  That was made very clear to the Ombudsman.  In a letter of 29 August the Ombudsman said she would not deal with litigation yet that case is the centrepiece of her report.  She mentioned many other cases that she would not investigate but she would presume she could rely on the complaints.  If we got complaints and did not investigate them nobody would take us seriously.  The issue is one of law.  The Ombudsman's role is clear in the law.  On the advice of the Attorney General to me, my Department and to the Government, the Ombudsman went way outside her authority on the investigation.I wish to deal now with the substance of the report.  The Ombudsman said we failed to bring legal clarity on the eligibility of older people to care.  The nursing home support scheme could not be clearer.  It has now supported 12,200 people in long-term care.  Two hundred individuals have been refused care.  Relatively speaking, that is a very small number.  One of the officials involved in the nursing home scheme was speaking today at an OECD meeting because of the interest expressed in the scheme.  The British Government has asked for a copy of the scheme and Norwegians have come to this country to ask about it also.  Many countries see our long-term support scheme as not only sustainable and fair but one they would like to mirror in their own countries.  In Britain 60 old people a day sell their homes to pay for long-term care.The reason we introduced the nursing homes support scheme is that the system we had was grossly unfair.  There is no doubt about that.  I said that when I brought the legislation through this House.  To be fair to parties opposite, with the exception of Sinn Féin, the nursing homes support scheme was broadly supported.  I accept Deputies had issues with it but it was broadly supported as it was seen to be a reasonable attempt to introduce a system of support for older people and their families that was fair to families.  Heretofore, if one were in a public nursing home 90% of the cost of care was paid regardless of one's means.  If one were in a private nursing home 40% of the cost of care was paid.  Now we have a nursing homes support scheme that treats everyone equally.Everyone is entitled to an assessment of his or her need.  That assessment of need is done on the same basis for every single individual.  In the case of the 200 applications which were refused, some decisions were made on the basis that applicants were not regarded as people who were in need of or suitable for long-term care.  Everyone has a financial assessment, again, based on his or her means.  Everyone gets support on that basis.  Nobody pays more than 80% of his or her disposable income, whatever that is.  Everyone is entitled to keep 20% of his or her income.I visited three nursing homes in the past week.  Some of the correspondence we receive from families show considerable support, especially from those who were supporting parents or loved ones in nursing homes for many years.  Nursing home care was completely unaffordable for many people, some of whom had to sell homes, remortgage or take out big loans.  In the current financial circumstances I cannot imagine what that would have been like.In 1993 the then Minister, now Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Howlin, introduced the nursing home subvention scheme as an honest attempt to support people in private nursing home care.  The allocation for the scheme was £5 million in 1993.  It rose to €350 million in its final year of operation.  The subvention is still being paid to some people, on the basis that no one was going to be adversely affected, but nobody new can avail of it.  This year, between the subvention and the nursing homes support scheme we are spending just under €1 billion.The Department's estimate of support required for the rest of this year is sufficient to meet the demand.  Notwithstanding the financial pressures we are under, that money is being ring-fenced for next year.  We are providing sufficient money.  On the issue of eligibility and entitlement, in every country in the world entitlement is subject to a cap on resources.  Nobody has infinite resources for health.  Whether it is in the United States or in Europe a finite amount of money is available to fund health.  Therefore, eligibility must be governed by the resource cap that is available in any year.  This has been the policy of successive Governments, although it means waiting lists for services in many areas.  The Ombudsman seems to take the view that it is never acceptable to have a waiting list.  Nowhere in the world is there not a waiting list.  It is not realistic in the context of a finite amount of resources.  For the foreseeable future, however, we will be able to provide the resources required to meet demand.Not only can older people get supports on the basis of their means and a single assessment of need, but nursing homes are all quality assured.  Two nursing homes have already been closed down by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.  Nursing homes are inspected against rigorous environmental and, more important, care standards.  Everyone must have an individual care plan, which must be implemented.  We are receiving considerable praise from nursing home residents and their families for our new standards of care.  Last week, I attended the first inaugural awards for private nursing homes, presided over by Uachtarán na hÉireann.  It was great to see people being enthused about the even-handed approach to inspection in the public and private sectors.In the Ombudsman's report, she was critical of a number of factors, including what she calls marketing and spin.  On page 129, the report unfairly refers to public servants being involved in political marketing and spin.

On page 103 of her report, however, she refers to the nursing home support scheme being so poorly drafted that it would be incomprehensible to the average citizen or even the reasonably well educated lay person.  It is difficult to believe this is valid criticism of legislation that is doing so much good.As the Government was so concerned by the Ombudsman going way beyond her remit in her report, I wrote a strong letter on the advice of the Government and drafted by the Attorney General.  Regarding fair procedures, twice after the Ombudsman initiated her inquiry she made public statements — once at the MacGill summer school in July and previously during the nursing home conference — in which she set out her views.  This was at a time when she was asking the Department to respond.  Eleven times the Department asked for a copy of her report, to which we were entitled under the Act.  Section 6 states: "The Ombudsman shall not make a finding or criticism adverse to a person in a statement, recommendation or report under subsection (1), (3) or (5) of this section without having afforded to the person an opportunity to consider the finding or criticism and to make representations in relation to it."  The report was out for two hours before we received a copy.  A journalist could ring at 10.30 a.m. last Wednesday and tell us the gist of what the report contained.  That is incredible, but it is the story.  Fair procedures were not followed, which is not something I say lightly.I am a strong fan of having an Ombudsman for Children and an Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly.  They are important roles in a democracy.  In the case of the latter, she protects the rights of citizens who have been grievously dealt with administratively by Governments.  No more than myself or any other constitutional officeholder, though, the Ombudsman must operate within the law as laid down.  I make no apologies for vigorously and robustly defending on behalf of my Department the fact that it could not reveal the legal strategy we were adopting.Some 400 cases have been taken against us and how quickly a case advances is a matter for the plaintiff.  There have actually been 13 settlements, so I was wrong last week when I said 12.  We are vigorously defending the Mrs. B case referred to in the report.  Many of the cases against us are taken by estates where the individuals concerned have passed on.  If we were to compensate, we reckon the amount involved would be approximately €7 billion.  There is no pot of money from which to compensate people, so the compensation would come from today's services.  We could not possibly countenance that, nor could anyone in my position.

To this end, an additional €200 million has been invested in community services.  Where support in this way is not feasible, we support access to quality long-term residential care where appropriate.In line with the introduction of the fair deal scheme, the Government was conscious of the need to ensure that, once access to residential care was available to those who needed it, the quality of the care would need to meet rigorous standards.  It is important that we have effective mechanisms in place to maintain and enhance public confidence in the delivery of quality services.  The welfare and safety of each resident guides us in reforming the health service and we in Government place great importance on the policies, standards and legislation we are implementing.We are all aware of previous failings and their impact on residents and their families.  It is important that the lessons we learn from these few, but controversial and well publicised events will continue to inform our thinking in respect of long-term care.  We must take all necessary measures to prevent such events recurring.  Residents, their families and the public need to be reassured that an independent regulator is monitoring the care residents receive.  The Health Act 2007 provides this, with a regime designed to reassure through an independent inspection and registration system for residential services.On 1 July 2009, statutory responsibility was given to the Chief Inspector of Social Services, part of HIQA, for inspecting and registering nursing homes.  This responsibility is underpinned by a comprehensive quality framework comprising the Health Act 2007, the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009, the Health Act 2007 (Registration of Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 and the national quality standards for residential care settings for older people in Ireland.The national standards consist of 32 standards focusing on the outcomes for the resident under seven groupings, those being, rights, protection, health and social needs, quality of life, staffing, the care environment and governance and management.  These standards provide the basis for the best quality of care to be provided, monitored and enforced in all nursing homes.  The standards acknowledge the unique and complex needs of the individual at the centre of care and require service providers to deliver a person-centred and comprehensive service that promotes health, well-being and quality of life.We must also acknowledge that the standards are about much more than infrastructure.  They are a blueprint for the provision of a higher standard of care delivered against a set of understood and developed criteria and are designed to improve and enhance care and to recognise good practice.  All homes are subject to the same core standards in respect of quality and safety.As formal standards are a key requirement for inspection and registration, all current residential facilities for older people must comply with both the national standards and the regulations underpinning them.  If a nursing home is not in compliance, it may either fail to achieve or lose its registration status.  Our overall emphasis is on promoting a high-quality patient-centred service delivered to those who require it and in the most appropriate setting.  HIQA has registered more than 600 designated centres for older people in accordance with the Health Act 2007.  To date, the authority has inspected all of these designated centres and carried out more than 900 inspections.Recent years have brought significant changes to the nursing home sector.  By introducing this new system of registration and inspection in 2009, we changed the landscape of the regulatory framework for all nursing homes.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for older people, I am proud of the Government's achievements in this regard.  We have a national system of financial support for all those assessed as requiring long-term residential care.We have underpinned this with a quality assurance mechanism of standards and care and welfare regulations, subject to independent inspection by HIQA.  Fundamental to all of these initiatives has been the principle that the resident and his or her family are at the centre of the service and all decision making.This shows clearly the Government's commitment to older people, a commitment we are continuing and will continue to uphold.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I welcome the amendment as proposed by the Minister, Deputy Harney, and I am glad of the opportunity to say a few words on this important issue.At the outset we should remember that we are discussing health and the Department of Health and Children.  We have to factor in the budget that is available and the pay bill required to pay the many people who provide their services.  Then we are left with an amount of funding which must be quantified and controlled in good times and bad.  The Department of Health and Children is in competition with other Departments for scarce finance, and we must start from that premise.Given the huge demands on that Department it is very difficult to provide adequate resources for all the different disciplines and demands.  If we are to be honest in this debate, we should not lose sight of that.  Care of the elderly has always been a core value of my party and of Government.  In recent years where the economy was in surplus we increased the budget enormously and that should be acknowledged.  We must look at the enormous increases that have been put into all the different health disciplines in those years, all very welcome, but each one must have a definite amount of money allocated to it.We are talking specifically about the care of the elderly, nursing homes etc., and HIQA has been mentioned etc.  I welcome the fact that HIQA, as the regulatory body, is doing its rounds throughout the country and is responsible for the registration of nursing homes.  If we did not have Leas Cross and its likes, we would not require HIQA, and this must be acknowledged as well.  Unfortunately that is the type of world we live in, however.  If people did not break the law, we would not need gardaí on the streets.  They do, and we must accept that.  People have broken the law blatantly in the nursing home sector and we have to acknowledge that the regulatory position had to be corrected.  HIQA is now doing that job.  One can talk about bureaucracy, red tape etc., but ultimately there has to be a satisfactory regulatory body to ensure that the best care is given to the elderly when they are obliged to finish their lives in nursing homes.I have seen both sides, both personally and in my constituency work, as regards people doing their best to cater for the elderly in their own homes.  We talk about the home care packages, home help hours, visits from the community health nurse and all the different back-up services that we try to have in place.  Of course we do not live in an ideal world, and we all wish to enhance those services more, but by and large the vast majority of people living in their homes are well-supported.  As regards institutional care, there are both public and private facilities to be considered.  On many occasions in this Chamber I have made criticism to the effect that discrimination was being applied when decisions were being taken about where elderly people were being placed.  Those fortunate enough to get places in public facilities — I am not sure what the selection criteria were, perhaps social and medical circumstances — paid a small price for their keep.  On the other side of the coin, a next door neighbour, perhaps, might have been unfortunate enough to have had to go to a private facility.  I am not referring to the level of care.  When a person had to go to a private facility, the bill was anything from €500 to €1,000 or whatever.  There was the person's pension, a subvention paid by the State and in many instances there was a shortfall which had to be made up by the family.  In many instances, such families were at the pin of their collar to put their children through college perhaps, and have some degree of quality of life.  I greatly welcome the fact, therefore, that we have taken out the discrimination and now have a system that is equal and fair to all, whereby people may apply for the fair deal, and be assessed.There will always be delays in certain cases, where people make applications.  My understanding is that the applications are straightforward and are being dealt with relatively quickly.  I support the view expressed by the Minister when she referred to public officials in the Department of Health and Children and also the HSE.  We are probably too inclined to be negative as regards the work they do.  The vast majority of public officials I meet in the course of my duties as a public representative, whether in local authorities, the HSE or Departments of State, are good people and do a good job.  As in any part of society, one will find people who work more efficiently and better than others, and those who are more responsible than others.  This is a fact of life and we have to put up with it.  When one is dealing with an organisation of more than 100,000 employees, one must be sensible and realise there will be difficulties.  One must also acknowledge the vested interests that exist within the system, which can create further difficulties.  It is time, however, that we are honest about the debate.Like everyone else, I should love to see more home help hours and home care packages.  However, I can recall as a member of Limerick County Council that if one suggested to the county manager or officials at budget time that one wanted to make changes in what was being proposed, one would be asked to find the necessary savings someplace else.  We have to be sensible here.  There is a limited amount of funding and there are enormous demands on it.  There are many disciplines in health provision that are all seeking parity with each other, if not more funding.  The situation is very difficult.However, as regards the arguments being put forward tonight, I am proud of the fact we have supported and enhanced the facilities that have been provided, which have ensured a better quality of care for the elderly, whether in their homes or in institutions throughout the country.  I acknowledge that HIQA has a job to do, and this can cause difficulty perhaps for some groups at times.  I had occasion to speak to the Minister about a voluntary respite centre in my home town, Drumcollogher, probably unique in the country, with 20 beds.  That is not long-stay care, and the difficulty it faced was that it could not tick the boxes, effectively, since the criterion as laid down by HIQA was basically the provision of long-stay care.  I welcome the fact that this is now being looked at and I am sure it will help other places as well as Drumcollogher's respite centre.  We must accept the facts of life.  We have nursing homes, we have to have standards and registration and by and large they are all providing a good and worthwhile service.  However, we must also acknowledge that we are working within a particular budget which this Government and Minister has increased year on year, and substantially so over the last ten years.No matter what government is in power, we must acknowledge that we have to draw the line somewhere.  We have to give the best possible service, but we must be realistic as well.  We have to live within our means.  I support the amendment and commend the Minister on her work.

Having listened to the Minister, it is a critical issue that there is such a divergence of view between, on the one hand, the Government and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney and on the other, the Office of the Ombudsman, the Ombudsman being the champion of the public with regard to administrative matters in regard to the law and the State and the various functions carried out by the State on behalf of the public.The Minister gave a robust defence of her Department and the Government's perspective on this matter.  However, the Ombudsman is not in this Chamber to defend her office and the manner in which she interpreted her duties under the 1980 Act.  I believe it behoves us on the Opposition side to express in so far as we can where the Ombudsman and her office were coming from on this issue.  It is a serious situation for the citizens of this country that we have this relative stand-off between Government and the Office of the Ombudsman.  I do not believe this stand-off will end at the conclusion of this debate.  This matter needs to be resolved in the interests of citizens.  The public must have confidence that there exists an office that will stand up for their rights, one which Government will respect.  There is a serious issue here in terms of Government respecting the Office of the Ombudsman.This is against the background of other champions of the rights of the public being spanceled in various ways, including the dilution of the Freedom of Information Act, the spancelling of the Equality Authority and the abolition of the Combat Poverty Agency.  We now have this disagreement with the Office of the Ombudsman and previous disagreement with it in regard to the Lost at Sea report.  The public needs to be sure it has robust champions of their rights.  This is a serious issue.I would like to set out the detail in terms of where I believe the Office of the Ombudsman was coming from on this matter.  The Ombudsman refers in her report to more than 1,000 complaints having been received since 1985.  She is clearly responding to issues raised by members of the public with regard to the interpretation by the State of the 1970 Act, which is the legislation on which the Ombudsman primarily bases her report, as did her predecessor, in regard to people's rights to nursing home care.  While at that time there was a different Minister and Ombudsman in office, essentially the issue was the same.  The issue was not resolved.At that time, the Government indicated it would introduce legislation in regard to eligibility.  The point at issue was whether eligibility and entitlement are the same and whether eligibility grants a person entitlement.  There was a commitment given that legislation would be introduced to clarify people's entitlements under the 1970 Act.  It is, therefore, disingenuous of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, to say that the Ombudsman was raising the rights under the fair deal legislation.  What the Ombudsman was saying is that the rights of the 1970 Act supersede what is contained in the fair deal legislation and, therefore, she was essentially dealing with the 1970 Act, as was her predecessor.  That is my interpretation.The Ombudsman in her conclusions specifically states that the State, through its agencies, the health boards, HSE and the Department, has failed over many years to provide people with their legal entitlement to nursing home care.  She further states that the HSE and the Department, with the support of the Government, have opposed the Ombudsman investigation and have made very serious charges against the Ombudsman's office.  In effect, the charge is that the Ombudsman has acted in bad faith in its conduct of this investigation.  The Ombudsman totally rejects these charges.The Ombudsman looks at issues first raised by her predecessor in 2001 in a related investigation report to do with how we govern ourselves and concludes that the problems identified in 2001 have become more deep seated in the intervening decade.  The Ombudsman concludes that the health board-HSE failed to fulfil its obligations to older people under the Health Act 1970 and that this failure came about with the full knowledge and agreement of the Department.The Ombudsman makes clear that what she is referring to is rights under the 1970 Act.  She also makes clear that she believes she does have a right to carry out this investigation.  In effect, if this is not the case, and the Government is now contending that the Ombudsman does not have that right, this should have been dealt with after the 2001 report.  The Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, states in her report that it was expected that it would be dealt with under eligibility legislation but that never happened.  When it did not happen, the Ombudsman instigated this further report.  I can see a legitimacy in the Ombudsman's argument that what she was doing was within the scope of her rights under the legislation and that she was dealing with the administration of legislation by the State, namely, the 1970 Act.I would like to set out the history of what happened since the 2001 report and the issue then raised in regard to eligibility and entitlement.  Mr. Kevin Murphy was Ombudsman at the time the Government stated it disagreed with the Ombudsman's interpretation of the law.  It also said it would address the issue by way of the introduction of legislation.  The Government amendment states that the Government recognises that eligibility for in-patient services under section 52 of the Health Act 1970 has always been subject to, inter alia, the availability of resources.  That is a statement of fact.  It is the Government’s interpretation, which is still contended by the Office of the Ombudsman.  This is where the situation rests until such time as legislation is implemented.  The problem is that the legislation has not been brought before this Chamber.I will set out the history since 2001.  In November 2001, the Department of Health published Quality and Fairness — A Health System for You which proposed a general review of legislation on entitlement.  The strategy as published by the then Minister stated that new legislation would be enacted to provide for clear statutory provisions on such entitlement and promised to introduce a Bill in 2002.  The Travers report also addressed the issue of eligibility and entitlement.  It stated that the advice which the Department had available from the Attorney General on the issue differed from the position put forward by the Ombudsman.  The Travers report stated: "The legal uncertainties in this complex area do not appear yet to be fully resolved."  It went on to comment: "It is a remarkable feature of the health services in Ireland that such vast sums of money are expended on a system, the statutory basis for which is so confused and haphazard and where practise seems to be dislocated from statutory theory."We then had the 2003-05 strategy, Fair Access, which stated that the legislation would be high level objective No. 2 but it was not implemented.  The strategy for 2005-07 again stated the legislation would be introduced but it was not.  The latest strategy 2008-10 again states it will be introduced.  The Bill was listed on the B list of the Government's legislative programme in summer 2006.  In other words, it was a Bill in respect of which heads had been agreed and texts were being drafted.  The expected publication date was given as late 2006.  The Bill is now back on the C list and as such is going backwards.The history of this issue is somewhat different than what the Minister presented here tonight.  There is an absolute obligation on Government to produce that legislation.

I have seldom seen a report by any statutory body so strongly critical of a Department and I have seldom seen such hostility to a statutory body as that shown by the Government to the Ombudsman.The matter in question — the care of our older citizens — is extremely important for each and every one of us and the issue at stake — the role and future of the Office of the Ombudsman — is very serious for democratic accountability and civil rights in this country.  The Minister for Health and Children and her Department, as well as the HSE, should have co-operated fully with the Ombudsman in her investigation.  Instead, both the Department and the HSE refused to co-operate and the Ombudsman states in her report that it is her view that the Department and the HSE are in breach of their statutory requirements under the Ombudsman Act 1980.This is a very serious charge on the part of the Ombudsman and I have no doubt that she is correct.To make the matter even more serious, the Government, on 10 September 2010, informed the Ombudsman that it supports the position of the Department.  The Government says the Ombudsman is acting outside her powers and that her actions constitute interference in the State's defence of several hundred legal actions.  "An unprecedented intervention by Government" is how the Ombudsman has described the Government's treatment of her investigation and report.  The Ombudsman states:The HSE and the Department, with the support of the Government, have opposed this Ombudsman investigation and have made very serious charges against the Ombudsman's Office. In effect, the charge is that the Ombudsman has acted in bad faith in the conduct of this investigation. The Ombudsman rejects these charges totally.It is unprecedented that any Government in this State should have deliberately caused such a serious confrontation with one of the principal watchdogs for the rights of citizens.  The Government's approach represents an attack on the Office of the Ombudsman and, by extension, on the rights of citizens.Why is this being done by Government?  Clearly, it is being done to undermine a report that exposes attacks on the rights of citizens by successive Governments.  The conclusions of the Ombudsman could not be clearer or more damning.  The Ombudsman concludes that the State, through the Department of Health and Children, the former health boards and the HSE has failed over many years to provide people with their legal entitlement to nursing home care.  She says that this failure has inevitably caused confusion, suffering and hardship.  She finds that the health boards and HSE failed to fulfil their obligations to older people under the Health Act 1970 and that this failure came about with the full knowledge and agreement of the Department.The key finding of the Ombudsman's report is that the obligations of the Health Act 1970 relating to nursing home care continue to have effect and have not been set aside by the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009.  The latter Act legislated for the so-called fair deal scheme.  That Act introduced a complex new system regarding support for nursing home care that is hugely problematic.  I said on Second Stage of the Bill that I believed, as did organisations representing older people, that the Bill effectively removed the universal eligibility for a place in a public nursing home as provided for under the Health Act 1970.  The Ombudsman's report clarifies the matter now.  It exposes as false the Government's argument that universal eligibility never existed under the 1970 Act and it asserts that this eligibility still exists under the 1970 Act, notwithstanding the 2009 Act.  I welcome that clarification.The statutory eligibility to a bed in a public nursing home has never been vindicated in terms of the provision of the resources to make those beds available.  This led to a huge reliance on the private nursing home sector and a complex and inequitable system of State subsidy for nursing home care.  Undoubtedly, this had to change but I believe the Government, in doing so, went in the wrong direction.  How wrong is now exposed in the Ombudsman's report.  Of course, this is not the first such report.  The previous Ombudsman published one in 2001.We also had the report, Care for Older People, published by the National Economic and Social Forum in 2006.  That report exposed how our system of care for our senior citizens is skewed towards residential options and how there is a funding bias towards nursing home subventions.  It pointed to the lack of a general model of assessment and rehabilitation.  The figures in the 2006 report — and I doubt they have changed much — show that the 5% of older people in long-stay care account for 55% of the overall budget for care of older people.  Describing the barriers to the development of community services for older people, the report referred to "perverse investment incentives" and stated: "The present official funding of services is not consistent with the policy objective of encouraging community-based responses; considerable resources are invested in nursing home care responses, some of which are unnecessary and inappropriate."The worst nightmare for the vast majority of older people is to have to leave their homes and enter long-term residential care.  The best option is for people to be cared for in their homes with the help of their family, friends, neighbours and the health and social services provided by the State.  The Minister claims that the Government is providing for improved support for older people in their homes but the reality is that current provision is totally inadequate.  Under the disastrous regime of this Government, the cuts of recent years to home helps and other supports will be far exceeded in the forthcoming budget.  Comprehensive rights-based legislation setting out the entitlements of older people to all forms of care in the home, in other community-based settings and in nursing homes is needed.The sad reality is that the inadequacy of support for older people to spend their twilight years in their own homes means that more of them end up having to avail of expensive nursing home care.  It means that more of them become ill and lose their independence.  This short-sighted failure of successive Governments to provide the essential resources for community care has cost the State hugely in providing for long-term residential care.  When it comes to residential care the Government, blind as usual to fairness and to real efficiency, downgrades public provision and gives preference to the more expensive private sector.  It took years for proper standards to be applied to nursing homes by a Government more concerned with fostering the private nursing home sector as a lucrative business than with ensuring the best care for our older citizens.  For example, we had the recent closure order on the private Upton House nursing home in Clara, County Offaly, which failed to meet HIQA standards.  I had raised concerns about that facility in a parliamentary question only last year.  At the same time, the HSE, because of the Government's privatisation policy, is attempting to close a public nursing home, Loughloe House, in Athlone, which it did not recommend to close.  There is a clear pattern.  It is not only a recommendation or the absence of one, but the privatisation agenda that is driving the Government and the HSE in carrying out their policies.  The Sinn Féin Deputies fully support the motion before the House this evening and tomorrow and I urge all Deputies, on both sides of the House, to support it.

The need to build a new primary school for St. Colmcille's in Knocklyon has been on the political agenda for at least 15 years.  This is the largest primary school in the country; approximately 1,500 students attend it.  For far too long a large portion of the classrooms have been prefabricated buildings, many of which have long passed their use-by date.The school has gone through the various stages to facilitate construction and got to a point in October this year where the final documentation was furnished to the Department of Education and Skills.  It is my understanding that it was indicated to the school board and the principals of the school that by 15 November, the final consideration would be given to the final document received relating to the project.  Indications were given that the tendering process to construct the school would commence.I ask the Minister of State to tell the House the current position.  Was sanction given yesterday or will it be given this week to the tendering process?  When will the construction of the school be advertised for tender?  I am conscious that a substantial amount of money for the construction of schools during 2010 remains unspent and I am very anxious to be assured that not only will the tendering process be sanctioned and go ahead, but also that the funding is available to construct this school.I am very conscious of the state of the public finances and the catastrophic difficulties confronting the State but in the context of tackling the major unemployment crisis we have, with in the region of 450,000 unemployed, there is great value to the State as well as to individual communities in the construction of school building projects going ahead.  We can now build new schools at far less expense than was the case in the past.  We have a huge body of construction workers currently unemployed in receipt of social welfare who are looking for employment.  The construction of this school would not only be of substantial benefit to the local community in Knocklyon and to the students attending the school, but would provide badly needed employment.In order for the school to be constructed, it has to move to a temporary site.  I understand that it was the hope that if tendering proceeded or was sanctioned this week, the school would move to its temporary site next Easter and would be able to open after the Easter break at the temporary site so the project could be advanced and construction could start.  I hope the timeframe that was indicated after literally 15 years battling to get this school built will be complied with and I hope the Minister will tell us on the record of the House this evening that the project is going ahead and the tendering process can start.  If I am not going to be told that, I want the Minister to explain why that is the case.This is a crucial moment for the construction of this school.  Far too many pupils in this school are using prefabricated classrooms that are inadequate.  The school lacks the type of library and play facilities it should have and the staff lack the basic facilities which should be available to teachers in a school of this size.  I hope we will get some good news tonight and, if not, I hope the Minister will tell us why.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the Government's strategy for capital investment in school building projects and also to outline the current position for St. Colmcille's senior and junior national school, Knocklyon, Dublin 16.Modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth is a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The allocation of funding for school buildings in 2010 is almost €579 million and this represents a significant investment in the schools building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the Government's commitment to investing in school infrastructure and it will permit the continuation of the Department's programme of sustained investment in primary and post-primary schools.All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need presenting based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc., leading to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and these criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision of desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or new sports hall.  The project for St. Colmcille's senior and junior national school has been assigned a band rating of 2.1 under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  A band rating of 2.1 means that there is a deficit of mainstream accommodation in the school and the deficit constitutes a substantial and significant proportion of the school's overall accommodation needs.All major projects on the Department's capital programme progress through the same structured process of architectural planning which is divided into clearly defined stages.  There are five stages involved in the progression of major school building projects through architectural planning.  These stages are set out in the Department's design team procedures and are necessary to comply with Department of Finance guidelines which require that capital projects be fully designed prior to going to tender.  They also ensure proper cost management of capital projects and facilitate compliance with statutory and public procurement requirements.The project referred to by the Deputy provides for the removal of all existing prefabricated buildings and demolition of the existing St. Colmcille's junior and senior school buildings in a phased development programme and their replacement with a new three storey 58 classroom school.  The total floor area will be 9,847 sq. m. with ancillary accommodation which will include general purpose rooms, libraries, meeting rooms, special educational rooms, three atriums, junior and senior administration offices, car parking and play areas.To facilitate the construction of the new schools in a phased approach, planning permission has been secured to relocate St. Colmcille's senior school to a temporary prefabricated structure at the nearby Ballyboden Saint Enda's GAA grounds.  For the duration of the building project, St. Colmcille's junior school will remain on the existing site.  The project for St Colmcille's senior and junior school was authorised earlier this year to progress to tender and construction.  Following a third party appeal to An Bord Pleanála, the final grant of planning permission was upheld.  The fire certificate and disability access certificates have also been secured.In October, the design team submitted the stage 2b report, which has been reviewed by the Department.  Following this, a letter recently issued to the school authority requesting confirmation from all design team members that a final review would be undertaken and that a complete and co-ordinated package of tender documents would be prepared for issue to tenderers.  The Department intends to publish an advert later this week in the EU journal and on the Government's etenders website seeking suitably qualified contractors.  This is the first phase in a two-stage tender process and will result in a shortlist of ten main contractors who will then be invited to tender for the works.I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the current position regarding the school building project for St. Colmcille's senior and junior school.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I raise this issue given the severe flooding in the Cork area on 19 November 2009, the first anniversary of which is approaching this week.  There are a number of issues surrounding the aftermath of this severe flooding and I want to concentrate on the plight of residents and business owners in the area who are not being given insurance or must pay severe excess charges.As the Minister of State is probably aware, the flooding resulted from severe rainfall in the month of October which built up in November.  The ESB has two dams on the upper Lee catchment area, the Carrigadrohid dam and the Inniscarra dam.  There was a wind, rain and tidal alert on the night of 19 November but this was not a tidal flood but one which came from the upper catchment of the River Lee.  The area flooded was not prone to the type of flooding that happens in Cork city, which is caused by a combination of high tides, easterly winds and high levels of rainfall.  It was a different type of flood which has been described as a once-off, flash flood.  Residents who have been living in the area for years, and whose ancestors lived there for centuries, know the area does not have a history of flooding.This is the crux of the matter.  These residents now find themselves in a situation where they cannot insure their homes or business premises.  A report published in July 2010 by the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government recommended that there would be an independent investigation into the flooding and that a co-ordinated attempt would be made by the city council, county council and the ESB to address the issue.  What can be done to put in place management structures for the dams in consultation with the ESB and the local authorities to make sure the insurance companies can get to a position where they will insure residential households and business premises?It is important to repeat that this area is not normally prone to flooding.  A severe flood occurred last November but nobody has stepped up to the plate and outlined what could have prevented it.  We need an independent investigation to establish what exactly went wrong so we can put in place structures and lines of communication to ensure it does not happen again.  Meanwhile, residents in areas that have never been flooded find themselves victims.  They are powerless and are being stonewalled by the insurance companies.  There is an opportunity for the Government and the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, who has visited the area, to step in and speak to the insurance companies to find what they are doing to alleviate the difficulties.  If the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, visited the area today, he would see the locations where the quay walls were broken by the force of the river and have not yet been replaced.We are facing into the winter and there have been flood alerts in recent weeks.  The residents are extremely vulnerable and feel the State is not stepping in to protect them and ensure they can continue to live in the relative security they had before 19 November 2009.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	435	It must be stated at the outset that the decision to provide new cover or renew existing cover in any insurance situation is a commercial matter for insurance companies, as it allows insurance companies to properly assess the risk they are accepting.  These are often considered on a case-by-case basis and, as such, the Government does not have any influence over this matter.  That being said, the Government is fully aware of the difficulties currently being experienced by householders in certain areas in accessing flood insurance.  The Minister for Finance is completing a memorandum for the Government which is expected to go to Government very shortly on the options available to address these difficulties.  Care has to be taken that the State responds in an appropriate and cost-effective manner and in a way that allows it to provide flood relief measures which allow the insurance companies to continue providing cover in those areas.While it must be acknowledged that there have been instances where insurance companies have refused to cover some property owners who made claims on their policies in the aftermath of last year's flooding, the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, has informed the Department of Finance that the insurance industry is very reluctant to discontinue flood cover for existing policyholders, and would generally only do so in exceptional cases, such as where there have been repeated flooding claims.  The IIF has also indicated that approximately 98% of householders who have household insurance currently have flood cover.  It points out that insurers look at the claims history of the individual risk when deciding what underwriting action to take. They also look at any flood protection measures implemented by the local authority or OPW in the area.  It states that where the flood risk is higher than normal, people will generally pay a higher premium or have a higher flood excess on their policy.It is clear that the structured engagement between the IIF and the OPW is critical if progress is to be made on this issue so that underwriters are aware of what is being done in different parts of the country to address flooding problems.  Such an arrangement would also help the OPW prioritise its remedial works which in turn would provide greater reassurance to the industry that the problem areas were being addressed in a structured way and this should lead to a greater willingness to offer cover in marginal areas.Work has already begun on this and as part of this structured engagement the OPW has provided the IIF with a list of its capital projects and their current status.  It has also provided it with another list of other flood mitigation works and studies on a county-by county basis.  Furthermore, the OPW met industry underwriters at the end of October in order to give them a greater understanding of how they are addressing the flooding problems in different parts of the country.  This type and level of engagement between the agency having the lead role in flood prevention measures and those providing insurance is part of the Government's response to this issue in flood prevention measures.Another key part of the response I wish to draw to the attention of the House is the fact that the Government allocated €50 million for flood risk management activities for 2010, which is administered by the Office of Public Works.  This increased allocation allows for delivery of a range of capital works schemes throughout the country.  A concerted effort to roll out schemes, taking account of the seriousness of the underlying flooding problem in the different localities, is currently underway.In February of this year, the Minister of State responsible for the OPW, Deputy Mansergh, launched the River Lee flood risk management plan, which is the result of three years work by the OPW and its partners, Cork city and county councils.  This sets out a range of measures to manage effectively and efficiently the flood risk for the whole Lee catchment, which, when implemented, should significantly reduce the likelihood of the severe flooding witnessed in Cork city and elsewhere in the catchment of last year.The OPW, in association with the city and county councils, is currently progressing the lower Lee flood risk management scheme, one of the key recommendations in the Lee catchment flood risk management plan.  This scheme seeks to manage the flood risk from the River Lee and has been developed to protect against river and tidal flooding in and around Cork city.  The scheme will involve works downstream of Inniscarra and through Cork city, permitting greater discharges to be made from the ESB reservoirs without causing flooding of properties and will provide protection against flooding from the river and during periods of high tide or storm surge.  Based on extensive analysis, undertaken between 2006 and 2009, of river flows and tidal-surge levels, this scheme is considered the most cost effective means of managing these flood risks in Cork city.While it is likely be some time into 2012 before construction works begin on the scheme, should interim measures be identified to reduce the existing level of risk in the course of the consultant's work, these will be considered by the OPW and its partners on the steering group.  Furthermore, the OPW has sanctioned €0.9 million for Cork City Council to undertake the repair of quay walls breached last November and contract works for this are currently at tender stage by Cork City Council.  I can confirm that the cost of undertaking the development work and the eventual construction works has been included in the OPW's budget profiles for flood relief activities for the coming years.  The Minister of State is confident that the scheme to be developed will lead to a significant reduction in the risk of flooding as experienced last November.

The International Children's Games and Cultural Festival, ICG, is an annual sports event that has evolved since its inception in 1968 in Celje, Slovenia into the largest multi-sport youth event in the world.  More than 30,000 children have taken part in the games since 1968 with, on average, between 1,500 and 2,000 athletes aged between 12 and 15 years participating at the annual event in selected host cities and towns throughout the world.  Upwards of between 80 and 90 cities from all five continents participate annually.  Athletics and swimming are the core sports involved and the host city is also required to offer participating cities between six and eight other sporting disciplines in accordance with international governing body rules.  In addition to the athletes, approximately 2,500 overseas visitors attend the games as part of the extended visiting city delegations, team coaches and family members.Tralee has been participating in the ICG since 2005 when it received an invite to attend the games hosted in Coventry.  Subsequently, teams from Tralee have participated annually in venues as diverse as Bangkok, Reykjavik, San Francisco, Athens and Bahrain.  The experience of attending the games has led to strong support locally to put forward the case to host the 2015 games in Kerry.  As part of the initial campaign for Kerry to host the games, the executive committee of the ICG was invited to undertake a fact-finding visit to Tralee in April 2008.  Letters of intent to host the games were issued by Kerry County Council and Tralee Town Council following the visit.  A feasibility study was commissioned in 2010 to determine the financial implications of hosting the games in Kerry in addition to assessing the existing facilities.  The study has shown that Kerry has the capacity to host the international event in 2015 and has indicated that a total cash cost of €2 million would be required to successfully bid for and host the event.  The support of the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport is seen as critical to the process and the local organising committee is seeking up to €1 million from the Department and Government, while undertaking to raise the other €1 million through the corporate sector and other means.Kerry has a long established reputation of hosting major international sports events.  Its reputation as an international tourism destination highlights its capacity to organise and host international events.  Kerry has the largest accommodation stock outside of Dublin while possessing a rich cultural and heritage tourism product range that will facilitate the cultural element of the games.Recent announcements concerning the new sports complex development at the Institute of Technology, Tralee will provide the county with a top-class sports hub to centralise the planning, organisation and hosting of international sports events.  The proposed sports complex for the Institute of Technology, Tralee would provide a modern sporting hub to host the 2015 games.  A decision to invest in the hosting of the 2015 International Children's Games in Kerry, with Tralee as the central hub, would provide a means of creating and generating considerable economic impact for the region and should be strongly supported.  The Kerry ICG games of 2015 would have the capacity to generate an overall economic impact for Kerry of between €5.6 million and €7.8 million against an expenditure on games preparation and hosting of approximately €2 million, based on 100 teams taking part as outlined in the feasibility study.  The event has the scope to attract more than 6,000 attendees, resulting in approximately 20,000 bed nights for the region during the course of the games, which is usually between five and six days.  Potential returns to the Exchequer, based on participation rates ranging from 80 to 100 cities, would amount to €1.68 million rising to €2.326 million.In conclusion, bringing the International Children's Games to Kerry would be a sound investment in the short term and the long term, generating considerable Exchequer returns, providing a platform for tourism development in the region and the country, and leaving a lasting legacy for sports participation and the hosting of international sports events in the country.  It may not be the Olympics as we know it, but for the children of the world it is understood as a mini-Olympics.  It would provide the opportunity for those in many other Irish cities and towns to join their international brothers and sisters and participate in a truly worldwide sporting and cultural event in Ireland in 2015.  The Government should support the overall project and the bid to host the 2015 games wholeheartedly as a project with the potential to bring considerable benefits to Tralee, the county of Kerry and Ireland.  I call on the Minister of State to look favourably on the project.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Support, Deputy Mary Hanafin.  I thank Deputy McEllistrim for raising the matter.  The Minister is supportive of the efforts of the tourism state agencies and the national governing bodies of sport to attract international events here, subject to an assessment of the costs and benefits involved in any State financial support.  Since taking up office, the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, has been involved in several meetings and discussions relating to such sports events.In accordance with the provisions of section 8(1) of the National Tourism Development Authority Act 2003, consideration of possible support towards such events is a day-to-day matter for Fáilte Ireland.  Fáilte Ireland administers the Government's international sports tourism initiative, which has been in operation for ten years.  The key objectives in sponsoring events through this initiative are to secure significant worldwide media coverage and tourism marketing opportunities for Ireland and secure significant bed nights and economic benefits for the region in which the event is taking place.Under the initiative, Fáilte Ireland has provided sponsorship to several significant events including the Irish Open Golf Championship and the World Rally Championship.  The initiative was also a key factor in the hosting of the 2006 Ryder Cup in Ireland.  Fáilte Ireland also supported the very successful stopover of the Volvo Ocean Race in Galway during 2009.  This event exceeded all expectations in terms of visitor numbers and economic benefits, to the extent that Galway has been selected as the finishing venue for the Volvo Ocean Race 2011-2012.  We greatly look forward to welcoming the Solheim Cup at Killeen Castle next year.  It will be a great honour for Ireland to host one of the most prestigious golf tournaments in the world.With regard to a bid to host the International Children's Games in 2015, the Minister, Deputy Hanafin, met with Deputy McEllistrim in July along with representatives of Tralee International Children's Games Limited, the body seeking to place the bid to host the games in Tralee in 2015.The Minister, Deputy Hanafin, suggested that the organisers should meet with the Department and Fáilte Ireland to discuss the matter further.  A subsequent meeting was arranged by the Department, which took place on Monday, 8 November.  The meeting was attended by a representative of Tralee International Children's Games Limited, the operations manager for Fáilte Ireland south west and an official from the Department.  At the meeting, Fáilte Ireland provided details of the basis on which it assesses the tourism potential of proposed sporting events.  Fáilte Ireland is currently examining what supports may be available towards assisting with the bid process and will advise Tralee International Children's Games Limited in this regard.  A further meeting will take place later this week directly between Fáilte Ireland and Tralee International Children's Games Limited to progress the matter.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue.  I have been trying to discuss this matter with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, for two years.  As a result of the failure of those discussions I have been obliged to bring the matter to the House tonight.I thank the Minister for the fact that some money has been made available to the person who represents the third example I will provide.  The man in question is still being withheld 10% of what he is entitled to simply because of the failure of personnel within the system to pass on correspondence from the farmer which was submitted as requested.  The farmer in question built his own shed.  He built identical buildings with the same finish for two other farmers, both of whom have been paid in full.  However, he has been waiting since April 2009 for news of progress.  Last Friday he received a portion of the grant.  This happened simply because of the attitudes of different inspectors and the failure to use common sense.The first case on my list involves a structure built totally on the advice and guidance of the then Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food official, that is, the grant inspector.  This man used the same cladding as his neighbours, whose shed was passed and paid for two years ago.  This farmer has received no payment although the then Department official visited and measured the building on three occasions and assured him that everything was correct and was put through for payment.  However, when the inspector retired, the farmer found the application had not actually been put through.A different inspector took a different attitude, and this man now finds himself under severe financial pressure, paying high interest on money borrowed.  This case has been with the Minister since April 2009, and I ask for it to be fully resolved urgently.In case 4, the person concerned has a similar problem to that I outlined in case 1.  His cladding is the same as that of his neighbours, who have been paid, yet he has not.  It was accepted by the grant personnel in Monaghan that properly perforated cladding would ensure clear air in the building but prevent the chicken litter from becoming wet, which is the whole purpose of such housing.  In cases 5 and 6, structures were built with advice from the same Department official who gave the instruction in case 1.  Case 5 has been partially rectified through the appeals system, but there is still significant money outstanding.  In case 6, although the building was built to much stronger specifications than were required, as demanded by the Department official, the cost of this was never taken into account when the grant, amounting to around 40% of the total rather than the 70% the farmer was originally promised, was paid.  In case 2, a structure was built with the clear involvement and advice of a Department official but unfortunately, once again, a different official dealt with the case on completion, and there was a shortfall in the grant of at least €10,000.These are just some examples in which farmers — exceptionally good farmers, not fly-by-night types — who worked closely with officials, having found no reason in the past not to trust them, now find themselves under severe financial pressures through no fault of their own.  It is important that the Minister of State understand that those who used high-quality perforated cladding rather than open mesh in order to provide sufficient air flow in their chicken houses while ensuring that the chicken litter was not damaged or destroyed by rain were not asking for the cost of the cladding in their requests for grant aid.  They simply included it because of their knowledge of the typical weather conditions that would force rain through mesh structures.  It is plain to any person who stands in one of these structures that they meet all the necessary criteria and are in the best interests of everyone concerned.  As I said, I welcome the news that there has been at least one partial breakthrough.  I hope the Minister of State's reply will give me some hope for the remainder.As someone who spent seven years involved in the sale of structural steel and farm buildings, overseeing and inspecting the finished structures — none of which has fallen in almost 40 years — I have some understanding of what is necessary and what is justified.  I would certainly recommend any of the buildings I have mentioned for inspection by any person and I assure the Minister of State that they will meet the necessary specifications.  These farmers are under extraordinary pressure.  The situation, which resulted from no fault of theirs, has continued for two years now and is extremely unfair.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I thank Deputy Crawford for raising these matters with me.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify the position on the farm waste management and farm improvement schemes, which are at issue in the cases referred to by the Deputy.A revised farm waste management scheme was introduced by the Department in March 2006 to assist farmers in meeting the additional requirements of the nitrates directive.  The amendments to the scheme included an increase in the standard grant rate from 40% to 60%, with 70% being available in the four zone C counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim and Monaghan.  In addition, the new scheme provided for an increase in the maximum eligible investment ceiling from €75,000 to €120,000 and removed any minimum income requirements from farming from the scheme so that all small farmers could participate.  As the Deputy has mentioned, all work had to be completed by farmers by 31 December 2008 and the application of this date was a strict requirement of the EU Commission state aid approval for the scheme.The immense success of the scheme is demonstrated by the fact that almost 43,000 approvals to commence work issued to farmers while the scheme was in place.  However, due to the budgetary constraints placed on the Department at the beginning of 2009, it was decided to make the remaining payments under the scheme on a phased basis, with 40% being paid in that year as claims were approved, a further instalment of 40% in 2010, and the remaining instalment of 20% in 2011.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, also announced at that time that a special ex gratia payment would be made to farmers whose grants were deferred in this manner.  It is also intended to make this payment in early 2011.  The financial commitment of this Government to the scheme is substantial, particularly during these challenging economic times.  It is estimated that when all payments have been made under the scheme in early 2011, the total expenditure under the scheme since its introduction in 2001 will be of the order of €1.2 billion.The farm improvement scheme was introduced on 12 July 2007 following receipt of EU approval for the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013, and closed for applications on 31 October 2007.  The scheme replaced the previous farm waste management, dairy hygiene and alternative enterprises schemes, which had closed for new applications at the end of 2006.  Under the 2007-2013 programme, a sum of €85 million was allocated for modernisation of agricultural holdings, including the farm improvement scheme.  Of this amount, €6 million was subsequently earmarked for the introduction of the 2007 pig welfare — sow housing — scheme, thereby leaving an allocation of €79 million for the farm improvement scheme.  It was clearly stated at the time of the launch of the scheme and in its terms and conditions that the scheme would be suspended when the financial allocation for the scheme had been reached.A total 12,675 applications were received from farmers under the farm improvement scheme by the closing date of 31 October 2007.  However, the funding of €79 million permitted approvals to issue to farmers only for the 7,347 applications received up to 21 October 2007, and these approvals have now issued to the farmers concerned.  Under both schemes, however, it is clear that all work must be completed in full in accordance with the Department's technical specifications.  This is clearly set out in the terms and conditions of both schemes.  The existence of these Department specifications is widely known in the sector, and they reflect the highest construction, health and safety and animal welfare standards.With regard to the specific cases raised by the Deputy, the circumstances of each case are different, and the time available does not permit me to enter into the individual details of each case.  I propose therefore to write to the Deputy to advise him of the up-to-date position in each case.

Because of the inter-relationship between the section of the Act that introduces mandatory breath testing and other drink driving related sections of the Act, it is now clear it will not be possible to commence this section until the new apparatus to measure the reduced levels of blood alcohol concentration has been procured.However to overcome this difficulty it is my intention to introduce mandatory breath testing at an earlier date and officials in my Department and are currently in discussions on a number of legal drafting issues with the Office of the Attorney General, to seek to finalise a Bill in this regard.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	442	With regard to the Core Airport Management Operational Subvention (Opex) scheme, because of a projected shortfall in the resources available to fund this scheme in 2010, after allowing for estimated requirements for the PSO Air Services Programme for 2010, the six Regional Airports were allocated Opex funding on a pro rata basis in July of this year with no airport getting the full amount it might otherwise expect.  This allocation was in line with the Opex contracts with the Airports.  However, I am very much aware that payments at the reduced level have been causing difficulties for the Airports.  My Department has been monitoring the position with management at each of the airports.All the Airports have submitted additional information in support of their applications for funding.  This updated information is being re-assessed by the Department in accordance with the terms of the scheme and I will make further allocations accordingly.The provision in my Department's Vote to fund the capital expenditure (Capex) grant scheme for all the Regional Airports in 2010 is €3 million.Grant aid for urgently required work at Knock and Donegal airports was approved for this year together with the completion of projects which had been contractually committed prior to July 2008.  Just over €324,000 has been drawn down so far this year by the airports. It is not possible to say at this stage what the final draw down will be.The Value for Money Review of Exchequer Expenditure on the Regional Airports Programme, including the Capex and Opex Schemes, has been completed and is at present being considered by Government.  It is expected that, in the light of that Review, decisions on funding for regional airports in future years will be made in the context of the Estimates and Budget process.

The implementation of individual national road projects, including service areas, is a matter for the National Roads Authority in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.Section 54 of the Roads Act 1993 specifically provides for the NRA or a local authority to provide and/or operate service areas.In 2005, the then Minister for Transport asked the NRA to review its policy of generally not providing service areas on national roads, particularly on the expanding network of access-controlled motorways and dual carriageways.Arising from this review, the NRA developed a programme for the provision of up to 12 service areas on the major interurban routes (MIUs) as well as the N6/N18 junction and the N11 route at intervals of approx 50-60 kms.Two documents relating to the NRA's policy on the provision of service areas are available on their website at www.nra.ie.The NRA has completed the delivery of the first tranche of three service areas, under a PPP programme (two on the M1 and one on the M4). A further service area at Gorey on the M11 is scheduled to be constructed as part of the N11 Rathnew/Arklow and N7 Newlands Cross Junction Improvement Schemes.The NRA proposals for other service areas are progressing through the planning process.  However, the construction of these service areas is heavily dependent on the availability of funds and the prioritisation of projects within a reduced capital budget.  In the light of this, I have advised the NRA that they should consider other options to finance the provision of service areas which do not require Exchequer funding.

Planning and design will continue on all projects in Transport 21 so as to be in a position to move to construction at the earliest possible date once financial circumstances permit.The Department of Finance's Review of infrastructure investment priorities for the years 2010-2016, which was published in July 2010, was based on input from all Government departments.In the Review €12.2 billion has been specifically provided for the Department of Transport's capital programme up to 2016.  While this is a reduction from the original allocation of €15.9 billion for the years 2010-2015.  However, improved value for money now available in procurement of infrastructure will go some way to bridge the shortfall.The final capital funding allocation for my Department in 2011 and allocation for 2012-2014 will be settled in the context of decision on the Budget for 2011 and the 4 year plan currently being considered by Government.

I propose to make an order under section 31 of the Act towards the end of this year to give effect to such transfer.  The Commission's permanent staffing complement of twenty-three will transfer to the National Transport Authority but will remain at their Headquarters in 35 Fitzwilliam Square, Dublin 2.With effect from the dissolution date, the National Transport Authority shall carry out the principal functions of the Commission as set out in Section 9 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, namely the development and maintenance of a regulatory framework for the control and operation of small public service vehicles and their drivers.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	446	I am aware that October 2010, with 35 road fatalities, has been the worst month for road fatalities since December 2007.  It is worth bearing in mind, however, that even with the dreadful events of October, the total number of road fatalities for the year so far — 197 as of 11 November 2010 — is still below the number for the same period in 2009.The core objective of the current Road Safety Strategy 2007–2012 is to reduce road deaths to no greater than 60 fatalities per million of population by the end of 2012, or an average of 252 deaths per year.  2009 saw the lowest number of road deaths on record in Ireland, 240.  This means that we reached our core objective well before its target date.  Indeed, road deaths dropped by 41.6% between the period 1999 and 2009.However, 240 deaths on our roads is still far too many, and we can never be complacent.  We must now, collectively, do all in our power to ensure that the core objective figure is not exceeded, and hopefully improved upon, this year and in future years.While many road users in Ireland have embraced road safety and taken personal responsibility for their behaviour on our roads, I would like to take this opportunity to ask everyone, whether on a personal or professional basis, to work together and redouble all efforts with a view to making 2010 our safest year yet and to making 2011 even safer again.One of a number of areas in which we can make improvements to road safety is through strengthening the process of learning to drive in Ireland.  In September last, the Road Safety Authority launched proposals for the introduction of a graduated driver licensing scheme, and I am committed to seeing them implemented.  These proposals include stricter rules on learner and recently qualified drivers, and will enhance the learning process, to the benefit of all road users.The Road Safety Authority is currently engaged in work on preparing the roll-out of the various graduated driver licensing proposals.Many of the proposals in the scheme will require primary legislation, and it is my intention to publish a Road Traffic Bill to provide the necessary powers in 2011.

My Department is currently carrying out a ports policy review.  The consultation document published in September last contains a section dealing with ports and energy policy.  The document acknowledges the very significant proposals that are under development in relation to ocean energy, in particular offshore wind. New deepwater port sites may be required to service this industry. One of the questions raised in the consultation is whether further action might be required to meet these needs.The Irish Maritime Development Office and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland are also currently conducting a joint study to examine the potential of Irish ports and shipping companies to meet the demand for future offshore energy projects. This work will be completed shortly and an industry briefing is planned for January 2011.

The Road Safety Authority publicised the campaign again in August of 2009 to ensure older people were aware of the initiative. The high visibility jackets were made available through local pharmacies.The campaign was designed to heighten the awareness of vulnerable road users, in particular older pedestrians who are over represented in the number of those killed and seriously injured on Irish roads. Over the period 1998 — 2009, almost a third (30%) of pedestrians killed were aged 65 or over.In 2010 the RSA has again distributed high visibility jackets and armbands to vulnerable road users, including cyclists.A total of 340,000 high visibility arm bands were distributed recently through a Sunday newspaper to mark World Remembrance Day for Road Victims on the 29th November, 50,000 high visibility vests at the National Ploughing Championship, 130,000 high visibility jackets through the ‘Back to School' campaign, 25,000 high visibility vests through the ‘Bike Buyers Guide' and a further 20,000 to community and sporting groups around the country.The Road Safety Authority will be running additional campaigns targeting vulnerable road users including cyclists in December.The Authority is planning to continue its high visibility campaign into 2011 and will finalise specifics once the Authority has determined its budget for 2011.

Since June 2010 new Small Public Service Vehicle licences are issued only in respect of wheelchair accessible vehicles and a new category of wheelchair accessible hackney was introduced.  As part of its statutory remit the National Transport Authority is responsible for improved access to the transport system and in particular for public passenger transport access for persons with disabilities. In addition, the functions of the Commission for Taxi Regulation will be absorbed into the National Transport Authority by the end of the year.The Commission for Taxi Regulation favours the provision of some financial assistance to wheelchair accessible licence holders to upgrade their vehicles by 2012.  I have referred the Commission for Taxi Regulators's proposals to the National Transport Authority in March 2010 for its consideration and decision.It will be a matter for the National Transport Authority to decide on the future approach to incentives for wheelchair accessible taxis in the light of available funding and other priorities as regards supporting enhanced accessibility on bus, rail and taxi services.

The Chairman confirmed that Iarnród Éireann has completed 8 of the 14 recommendations and have submitted documentation to the Railway Safety Commission for verification that they have been achieved and can be closed. He also indicated that the remaining 6 recommendations are being completed at the rate of envisaged in the programme agreed with the Railway Safety Commission and are in advanced stages of completion.Since the issue of the Rail Accident Investigation Unit report on 16 August 2010, I understand from the Railway Safety Commission that it continues to hold on-going discussions with Iarnrod Eireann in regard to progress with all recommendations arising from investigations into the collapse of the viaduct at Malahide. The Railway Safety Commission has confirmed that documentation has been received from Iarnród Éireann in regard to the 8 recommendations that it considers have been completed and this documentation is currently being assessed by the Railway Safety Commission with a view to confirming that the recommendations have been adequately closed off.  The Railway Safety Commission continues to monitor progress with the remaining 6 recommendations to ensure that they remain on schedule with the agreed implementation plan.As to the question of loss of corporate memory, I understand that Iarnród Éireann is committed to implementing the organizational and system changes recommended in the Railway Accident Investigation Unit, Railway Safety Commission and Iarnród Éireann investigations of the Malahide viaduct accident. Iarnrod Eireann extensively re-organised the Civil Engineering Department and implemented a structured Safety Management System for that Department.I have also been informed by the Railway Safety Commission that it has recently engaged specialist consultants to examine the organisational and cultural factors present in Iarnrod Eireann that contributed to a loss of corporate memory and to determine if such factors still persist and affect the engineering functions.  A final report is scheduled to be presented to the Railway Safety Commission at the end of March 2011.The Railway Safety Commission have also clarified that in accordance with good Safety Management System procedures, all recommendations and agreed actions, whether closed or in progress, will remain on the Iarnród Éireann Risk Register as a means of underpinning corporate memory.

Works on those roads are funded from local authorities own resources and are supplemented by State road grants.  In January 2010, my Department carried out a review of the transport response to the severe weather during the period November 2009 and January 2010 and established a Review Group to carry out that task.  In this review, my Department has recommended that local authorities and the National Roads Authority should work together to put in place framework contracts with a number of salt suppliers and that local authorities should draw down their supplies under these framework contracts and they should continue to be responsible for the implementation of the response on the ground.The Review also recommended that local authorities should draw up lists of priority routes for treatment during severe weather.Local authorities were asked to publish their Winter Maintenance Plans on their websites in advance of December 2010.  This would allow the public to be aware of what routes will be treated in the case of severe weather and the type of intervention envisaged.In February this year I announced an allocation of €411.409 million to local authorities under the 2010 Regional and Local Roads Investment Programme.  From this allocation, a total of €111.409 was allocated to local authorities for maintenance works on regional and local roads, including repairs to roads damaged by the severe weather in late 2009 and early 2010.  As of 19th October 2010, (the last date for which figures are available), €87 million or 78% of this maintenance allocation has been drawn down. It should be noted that by now further work will have been completed by local authorities but not yet claimed for. It is expected that the remainder of funding will be fully drawn down by the end of the year.

These contracts run from July 2008 to July 2011.Ryanair were awarded the contract to provide the scheduled air services between Dublin and Kerry over the three year contract period and have been receiving payments in accordance with the contract.Despite several requests to Ryanair over recent months asking them to abide by the terms of the contract, I have been advised that with effect from Saturday 13 November, 2010 they have carried out their threat to reduce services on the route from three daily to one daily. Ryanair have already indicated that this daily service will be operated outside of the PSO arrangements.I have since written to Ryanair formally notifying them that in accordance with the terms of the contract, due to the material breach of performance of the terms and standards specified in the contract, the contract has been terminated by me with effect from 13 November, 2010.In accordance with Paragraph 8 of the original invitation to tender of 30 January, 2009, my Department has yesterday been in contact with the next highest ranking tenderer for the Kerry/Dublin PSO service and has asked them to consider whether they are in a position to provide the service for the remainder of the concession period, subject to the same conditions and level of compensation applying to the current contract.

The CIE Holding Company provides central services for the whole CIE Group.  These include services such as IT, legal, insurance, property management, management of the pension schemes and human resources management.  Strategic direction, control and overall co-ordination is provided by the holding company whilst each subsidiary has a high degree of operating autonomy.  The number of employees in the CIE holding company is less than 2% of the total number of employees in the whole CIE Group.  The Exchequer does not fund the operating costs of the CIÉ holding company.  CIÉ has a statutory mandate under various Transport Acts to provide Public Service Obligation (PSO) passenger services.  The National Transport Authority governs the funding of these PSO services through the Public Service Contracts which are in place between Iarnrod Eireann, Bus Eireann and Dublin Bus.In 2002 PriceWaterhouseCoopers undertook a research study into the financial and other implications of a proposed restructuring of the CIE Group.  This report concluded that any restructuring of the Group would require extremely complex issues to be addressed in areas such as ownership of CIÉ property, pensions, insurance liabilities, debt management and human resources.  In the event radical CIE restructuring did not proceed for the reasons mentioned.  However, since the report was published, the bus and rail subsidiaries have operated with enhanced devolved responsibilities.

The report is available on the website of the Central Statistics Office, www.cso.ie   The Ports Policy Statement, published in 2005, is the guiding policy framework within which our commercial seaports operate. In September this year I published a consultation document on a review of that policy statement.The review provides an opportunity to consider all issues in relation to the sector, including the issues mentioned in the Deputy's question.My Department is currently examining the submissions received during the recently concluded consultation period.

The EU adapted the Clean Vehicles Directive 2009/33 on 23 April 2009. This Directive aims to stimulate the market for clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles by ensuring a level of demand for clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles, which is sufficiently substantial to encourage manufacturers and the industry to invest in and further develop vehicles with low energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and pollutant emissions. The CIÉ Group is continuing to monitor new developments in the fields of alternative fuels and emission reduction technology and are committed to moving to lower carbon/ environmentally friendly solutions for their fleets as quickly as commercial and technical issues allow.

The review by CAR concluded that any reduction in the level of the bond required by travel agents would increase the likelihood of further calls on the Travel Protection Fund (TPF), which has been called upon following a number of collapses in the industry in 2008, 2009 and to date in 2010, even at current bond levels.In November 2009, as part of the Review of the Consumer Aqcuis, the Directorate General for Health and Consumers (DG SANCO) of the European Commission launched a review of the Package Travel Directive. The Commission is assessing the different policy options, with the aim of presenting a possible proposal for revising the current legislation at the beginning of 2011.Given this development, there would not appear to be any merit in undertaking reform of the bonding regime at this time without a clearer understanding of what the Commission is proposing in this area.

The National Maritime SAR Framework sets out the arrangements whereby responsible parties work together to provide effective and efficient maritime and aeronautical SAR services. The Framework has been prepared both to meet domestic needs and comply with International commitments.In addition, detailed plans for the provision of services and cooperation arrangements by the various organisations involved in the Irish National SAR are contained in Liaison Agreements and Memorandum of Understandings as well as in Coast Guard Operational Memoranda.The Framework is now the standard reference document for use by all Irish SAR authorities working in the maritime domain and promulgates the agreed methods of co-ordination through which search and rescue operations are conducted.Participants to the Framework include my Department, the Irish Coast Guard, the Irish Aviation Authority, the Department of Defence, the Department of Justice, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Fire Services and Planning Directorate, the Health Service Executive, the Irish Mountain Rescue Association, the Irish Cave Rescue Organisation, Local Authorities, Harbour Masters, Irish Water Safety, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, Dublin Fire Brigade, Community Rescue Boats of Ireland, the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency, the Civil Defence, the Commissioners of Irish Lights, and the Air Accident Investigation Unit.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	468	Article 13 of the Statistics Act, 1993 makes clear that the Director General of the Central Statistics Office has sole responsibility for and independence over all decisions regarding statistical methodology and statistical standards adopted by that Office.Consequently the Taoiseach has no input into operational matters within the CSO, including the selection of enterprises for statistical surveys.Minimising respondent burden, especially that placed on small businesses, is a corporate priority for the Central Statistics Office.  The Central Statistics Office has published a number of reports, all of which are available on the CSO website, on the administrative burden imposed on businesses by CSO surveys.  These reports show that typically 70% of small businesses (i.e. those enterprises employing less than 20 persons) do not receive any questionnaires from the CSO.  A further 20% of small businesses only receive a single questionnaire. The overall administrative burden imposed by the CSO on businesses (as measured using the Standard Cost Model) is less than €11m per annum; this accounts for less than 1% of the total administrative burden imposed on Irish business by Government regulation, which  was estimated at €2 billion in the 2007Report of the Business Regulation Forum  .Approximately 94% of Irish enterprises are small businesses employing less than 20 persons.  As the dominant size class in Irish business, small businesses must be correctly represented in official statistics, both to comply with precision standards prescribed in EU legislation but also so that robust information can be provided to policy makers to support decision making in Ireland.  Not only are these data important in showing the contribution of small business to the wider economy, they are essential building blocks in the calculation of GDP and Gross National Income.  At a time when very significant decisions are being made, it is more critical than ever that estimates of economic performance are accurate and credible and that policy decisions are informed by robust information.While the majority of the data is collected by the CSO in compliance with EU legislation, those same data are also demanded by Government and other national users. In fact, recent reports such as the 2008Building Ireland’s Smart Economy, Catching the Wave (2008), Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy (2010) and the 2010 Report of the Innovation Task Force   are just some of the examples, where recommendations have been made that CSO collect additional data.In an attempt to comply with the increasing demands for official statistics, arising from both EU legislation and national requirements, while also addressing the need to minimise the administrative burden placed on survey respondents, the CSO have in recent years introduced a range of burden-reduction measures specifically targetting small businesses. A number of survey questionnaires have been redesigned, with a reduced number of questions now being asked. In addition, the sample sizes of surveys have been decreased wherever feasible; in some cases, such as that of the Business Register Inquiry, surveys have been discontinued altogether. The CSO are also increasingly using administrative data, obtained from the Revenue Commissioners and other Government bodies, to both reduce existing burden to business or to avoid imposing additional burdens on business in compliance with new EU legislative demands. It is expected that this will lead to significant reductions in the number of small businesses being surveyed by the CSO's major structural inquiries.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	472	Community Employment (CE) is an active labour market programme/intervention designed to provide eligible long-term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including lone parents, recovering drug mis-users and those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful part-time work within their communities on a temporary, fixed-term basis.CE helps unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to a work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills by providing opportunities for individual training and development. The Individual Learner Plan (ILP) training is an integral part of the CE placement for all CE participants, providing tailored training based on the individual needs of the participants. There is no link between social welfare payments and training provision on CE.The continued receipt (or otherwise) of a particular social welfare payment whilst participating on a CE scheme is dependent on the Department of Social Protection rules governing each type of payment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	473	The Government announced its intention to use €110m of the offers of contributions to be made by the religious Congregations over the next few years to establish a Statutory Fund on 15th April last. This proposal is in keeping with the all party Motion passed by Dáil Éireann, supporting the proposal for a Trust to be set up and managed by the State for the support of victims and for other education and welfare purposes.My Department has undertaken a wide ranging consultation process, meeting with groups representing survivors of institutional abuse, the religious Congregations and other interested parties. Press advertisements also invited views and submissions as to the exact nature of the fund, how it will operate and the uses to which it will be put. The views expressed in the responses together with the views from the Department's engagement with groups and other interested parties have been considered and my Department expects to report to Government shortly on the matter and will be submitting a Scheme of a Bill to provide for the Statutory Fund.To date €20.6m has been received in contributions towards the Statutory Fund as follows: Brothers of Charity — €1,000,000; Dominican Friars — €6,500,000; Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul — €1,000,000; Daughters of the Heart of Mary — €1,500,000; Hospitaller Order of St John of God — €1,000,000; Presentation Brothers — €2,000,000; Presentation Sisters — €4,000,000; Sisters of Charity — €1,000,000; Sisters of Our Lady of Charity — €600,000; Sisters of St. Clare — €1,000,000; and Sisters of St Louis — €1,000,000.These contributions have been deposited in an interest bearing account in the Central Bank of Ireland pending the establishment of the Statutory Fund.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I propose to take Questions Nos. 93 to 95, inclusive, together.Catchment boundaries have their origins in the establishment of free post primary education in the late 1960s. For planning purposes, the country was divided into geographic districts, each with several primary schools feeding into a post primary education centre with one or more post primary schools. The intention was that these defined districts would facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs. They also facilitated the provision of a national school transport service, enabling children from remote areas to get to their nearest school.In general, the Department does not change schools from one catchment area to another.  However, when a new post primary centre is established, it is necessary to create a new catchment area for the purposes of identifying feeder primary schools, previously belonging to other post primary centres, for the new centre.  This happened, for example, in Meath in recent years where two new post primary centres were established in Ratoath and Laytown.  This is not the case where an additional school is provided in an existing post primary centre as this centre then becomes a multi-school centre.Furthermore, where a sole post primary school in a post primary centre is closed, the existing feeder primary schools may have to be reassigned to another appropriate post primary centre.Unfortunately, it has not been possible to gather the specific details requested by the Deputy in the time available. However, I will arrange for the details to be forwarded separately to the Deputy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I can inform the Deputy that all primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.Should school authorities have specific difficulties with regard any of the foregoing or in relation to a specific pupil I would suggest that they should contact the relevant local NEPS Regional Director, for whom contact details are available on my Department's website.The Deputy will no doubt be aware of the undertaking within the Renewed Programme for Government to an overall expansion of NEPS psychologist numbers to 210, currently NEPS staffing numbers stand at 157.However I can inform the Deputy that my Department and the Public Appointments Service (PAS), following the organisation of a competition and interview process earlier this year, has put in place a new recruitment panel for NEPS. PAS is currently poling candidates for an initial intake of 22 psychologists which it is hoped will, following the required Garda vetting process, be available for intake into NEPS by years end or early in the new year. It is also envisaged that the remainder of the required intake, to the level of that committed to in the Renewed Programme for Government, will receive similar offers shortly thereafter.The assignment of a NEPS psychologist to the school referred to in the Deputy's question is a matter for consideration by the relevant NEPS Regional Director and will be subject obviously to the availability and engagement of suitably qualified personnel in the above process for the relevant NEPS office.

Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	481	The information requested by the Deputy on the number of special needs assistants employed in each county on the dates specified is not readily available.The number of Special Needs Assistants employed nationally in each of the past five years and on 30th September 2010 is available in the document below.  The details for each of the past five years are the December figures for the year in question. The primary schools information is inclusive of the special schools details.As the Deputy will be aware, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.SNAs are allocated to schools to enable them to support pupils with disabilities who also have significant care needs. The allocation for any school and any adjustments to that allocation depends on a number of factors such as the number of pupils with care/medical needs leaving, the number of new pupils and the changing needs of the pupils. While SNA posts may be allocated to schools in line with my Department's criteria, SNA posts may also be suppressed where a child may leave or move school, or may achieve a greater level of independence.I wish to confirm for the Deputy that my Department is very supportive of the SNA scheme. It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes.YearNumber of Special Needs Assistants in Primary schoolsNumber of Special Needs Assistants in Post Primary Schools, including VECs.20056,2731,02120066,9741,41620078,0381,78620088,4402,00220098,3921,95030/09/20108,1412,065

Accordingly, a forum was set up with the aim of establishing the position in schools regarding the terms and conditions of certain school secretaries and caretakers employed using grants issued by my Department. The forum is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Finance and includes the relevant management bodies and the unions involved (SIPTU and IMPACT).In order to establish the factual position of secretaries and caretakers, a survey, developed in conjunction with the school management bodies and the relevant unions, was carried out in all schools. The results of the survey will feed into the work of the forum.I do not propose to comment further until the outcome of the forum discussions is available.

My Department must then lay the accounts together with a copy of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General (C & AG) before the Houses of the Oireachtas.In the case of the institution referred to by the Deputy, the accounts for the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 were signed off by the C & AG on 29th July 2009 and were subsequently received in my Department on 11th October 2010, and were sent to the Oireachtas Library on 1st November last.  I understand that any further delay in submitting the accounts to my Department was due mainly to arrangements being made by the institution concerned to translate into Irish the relevant documentation concerned.In April of this year my Department requested that the Higher Education Authority (HEA) remind all institutions of their responsibility in ensuring the immediate submission to my Department of their accounts once signed off on by the C & AG.

In 2009, 61 searches of aircraft were carried out at Weston, while to date in 2010, 33 searches of aircraft have taken place there. No seizures were made and no drugs were detected in either 2009 or 2010.  In relation to Baldonnel Aerodrome, no searches of aircraft have been carried out in the year 2009, or to date in 2010 on the basis that profiling of the traffic using the aerodrome and review of available intelligence suggests that the risk of smuggling through this location is minimal.

In addition, my Department is aware of the views of these unions concerning the Government's planned introduction of a single pension scheme for all new-entrant public servants.  The Trident Report was made available to officials of my Department and was the subject of a specific meeting between my officials and the teachers unions.As I announced in Budget 2010, the Government are committed to the introduction of a new single public service pension scheme for new joiners. The new scheme is aimed at securing considerable long-term Exchequer savings, while continuing to offer fair and reasonable pensions to retired public servants. Its principal features will include career-average benefit accrual, inflation-indexation of benefits and an increased pension age. Extensive consultations on the proposed new scheme with Government Departments and with the staff side have taken place. Draft legislation to introduce the new scheme is currently in preparation, and it is planned that the scheme will be operational in 2011.I welcome the Trident Report as a contribution to the debate on pension provision.  However the Report's recommended approaches to pension provision differs in fundamental respects with the Government's policy and I can not accept the Report as a policy basis for pension provision for new-entrant teachers at this time.

For 2009, a further more substantial loss was incurred.  The individual was visited and the business examined in detail.  Following this relief was refused.  The individual in question failed to satisfy the Inspector concerned that Section 662(2)(d) should apply i.e.(i) "that the whole of the — farming activities in the year following the prior 3 years are of such a nature, and carried on in such a way, as would have justified a reasonable expectation of the realisation of profits in the future if those activities had been undertaken by a competent farmer or market gardener, and(ii) that if such a farmer or market gardener had undertaken those activities at the beginning of the prior period of loss, such farmer or market gardener could not reasonably be expected those activities to become profitable until after the end of the year following the prior period of loss."The loss incurred may be carried forward under Section 382 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 for set off against profits incurred in the same trade in future years.If the taxpayer is dissatisfied with this determination, the assessment issued may be appealed under Section 933 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  The taxpayer and her agent have already been advised verbally that the assessment could be appealed to the Appeal Commissioners.

In relation to the taxation of betting, I have stated previously that it is my intention to widen, if possible, the tax base on which betting duty would be applied.  We have a situation where bets placed through one platform, namely betting shops, are subject to 1% betting duty but bets placed through other platforms are generally not.  This is because bets placed either online or over the phone are generally with out-of-State companies so applying betting duty has been difficult.I have asked my officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice and Law Reform, to look at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in this area.  I have stated previously in this House that any extension of betting duty will be applied on a fair basis and should not be perceived as an attempt to threaten jobs.  Also, tax changes will be in tandem with ongoing work by the Department of Justice and Law Reform on issues surrounding licensing and regulation.I am trying to ensure that we can put together a solution that is fair and reasonable, has a sense of balance and will not threaten jobs.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the full year cost to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2011 incomes, of reducing the higher rate of tax by 1% point would be approximately €185 million in a full year.  If this rate reduction is confined to income earners whose gross incomes are below the income levels mentioned in the question the cost could be reduced to €65 million in a full year.These figures are an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2008 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2011. They are therefore provisional and likely to be revised.

The necessary legislative basis was provided in this year's Finance Act and the Bond was launched on Tuesday 4 May.The National Solidarity Bond is one of the State Savings products which are managed by the National Treasury Management Agency and are designed primarily for the retail investor. The National Solidarity Bond is designed as a ten-year product. It complements the existing savings bonds and savings certificates, which are shorter-term products for three and five-and-a-half years respectively. The other State Savings products are Instalment Savings and Prize Bonds.I might add that it is possible to encash National Solidarity Bonds at any time but, as is the normal practice with longer-term investment products, the interest rate is structured so as to encourage investors to leave their money in the Bond as long as possible.

IFSAT is an independent body providing for appeals against certain decisions made by the Central Bank (formerly known as the  Financial Regulator) including administrative sanctions.  The Act provides for the appointment of two executive members i.e. the Chairperson and the Deputy Chairperson and no fewer than one and no more than five lay members.In 2007, the President made the first appointment of seven members to IFSAT.  The rate of remuneration of the members of IFSAT as determined by the President (in accordance with Section 57D(5) of the 2003 Act) in 2007 is:Rate of RemunerationChairperson€1,011.00 per dayDeputy Chairperson€910.00 per dayLay members€666.00 per dayA reduction of 8% was applied by IFSAT in 2009:Rate of RemunerationChairperson€930.12 per dayDeputy Chairperson€837.20 per dayLay members€607.20 per dayThe 2003 Act (as amended) imposes a variety of executive and administrative duties on the Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson.

My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation will shortly announce further administrative savings in areas such as Company Law, Employment Law and Health and Safety Law.The Government's priority is to ensure that the business environment continues to be supportive of enterprise. Addressing the needs of SMEs is a particular priority that my Department will continue to support.The Enterprise Development Agencies continue to play a key role in stimulating the development of new businesses, facilitating the expansion of existing companies and targeting new foreign direct investment through a broad range of initiatives, including direct financial and non-financial supports to enterprises. These supports are aimed at improving productivity, market knowledge, competitiveness and leadership and management capabilities so that firms can compete successfully and grow their businesses and exports.Access to bank credit for businesses, particularly SMEs, has been central to Government Initiatives in addressing the crisis in the banking sector.  Both the 2009 and 2010 Bank Recapitalisation arrangements provided specific commitments from the recapitalised banks to assist SMEs.  Under the 2010 Bank Recapitalisation arrangement, AIB and Bank of Ireland have both committed to making available not less than €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011.  This must include funds for working capital for businesses.  Finance is also made available to businesses, including SMEs, through the various supports and grant Schemes provided through the Enterprise Development Agencies operating under the aegis of my Department.  My officials are also working with their counterparts in the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office on potential new credit initiatives for SMEs.I issued guidelines to public contracting authorities aimed at operating their tendering processes in a manner that facilitates increased participation by SMEs, while ensuring that all purchasing is carried out in a manner that is legal, transparent, and secures optimal value for money for the taxpayer.  The guidelines also highlight practices that are to be avoided where they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation also met with the Local Authority Managers in July to discuss what initiatives they can and should take to support business and facilitate training, to foster the business environment in their areas and to ensure that their procurement strategies promote innovation and provide greater SME access to public contracts.  The message was also conveyed that competitiveness at local level is as important as it is at national level. Decisions made at local level have a huge role to play in determining the success of enterprise.  More generally, we are seeing lower costs for business, particularly in areas such as rental of prime industrial space and office space.I will continue to work with my Ministerial colleagues to ensure that State charges for the provision of services to business take account of the impact which such charges can have on the competitiveness of companies and their potential to create jobs in the economy.

This facilitates meaningful comparative analysis.  The latest published figures for outstanding taxes, showing the position as at 31 March 2010, is as follows:Of the total debt on record of €2,112 million, €669m was under appeal and therefore not available for collection.Of the total of €1,443m available for collection, €946m was under active collection while €378m was at enforcement and €119m was being managed through agreed instalment arrangement, where additional time to pay is given by Revenue.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	520	For some years now the EU payments industry has been working to improve cross-border business activity by developing a pan-European electronic payments system for payments in euro, known as SEPA (the Single Euro Payments Area).SEPA will be an area where consumers and companies can make and receive electronic payments in euro in Europe — whether between or within national boundaries, under the same basic conditions regardless of location.The key components of SEPA are the new payments systems for:SEPA Credit Transfers (SCT), that is, making payments electronically from or into bank accounts, including the use of internet or telephone banking and which was launched on 28 January 2008;the SEPA Cards Framework, also launched on 28 January 2008; andthe SEPA Direct Debit Scheme (SDD), which was launched on 2 November 2009.The Payment Services Directive (PSD) provides the necessary legal framework to support the implementation of SEPA.  It came into effect on 1 November 2009 and my Department transposed it through the European Communities (Payment Services) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 383 of 2009) to enable Ireland to apply the PSD's provisions by that date.SEPA relates only to electronic payments and industry has a key role to ensure that competitive SEPA-compliant services are available on the market.  The Irish Payments Services Organization, which administers domestic payment schemes on behalf of Irish banks, has put in place a national SEPA migration plan for the industry here.  I look forward to the industry's roll out of each of the above components of SEPA.Recognising that public authorities have a key role to play in promoting migration to SEPA based payments in Member States, given the large volumes of payments that are executed throughout the public sector, the Government is currently considering how best to leverage the payments that it makes and receives towards promoting the implementation of SEPA in this jurisdiction.In order to further incentivise migration, the European Commission is considering legislation to establish legally-binding end-dates and a draft EU Regulation to give effect to this is expected to be published by the Commission in early 2011.  My Department is monitoring the position and will assess any such proposal in due course, with a view to supporting the swift implementation of SEPA consistent with national goals and obligations.

In the case of public sector projects, the standard forms of contracts that are used include provisions requiring compliance with the Registered Employment Agreements (REAs).  The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) is responsible for enforcing REAs.  Any review of the REAs would be a matter for the relevant parties to the Agreement.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I have stated previously that it is my intention to widen, if possible, the tax base on which betting duty would be applied.We have a situation where bets placed through one platform, namely betting shops, are subject to 1% betting duty but bets placed through other platforms are generally not.  This is because bets placed either online or over the phone are generally with out-of-State companies so applying betting duty has been difficult.This is an uneven situation and as the Minister responsible it makes sense to explore options to even-out the position.  Consequently I have asked my officials, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice and Law Reform, to look at the scope to overcome legal and operational difficulties in this area.  I have stated previously in this House that any extension of betting duty will be applied on a fair basis and should not be perceived as an attempt to threaten jobs.  Also, tax changes will be in tandem with ongoing work by the Department of Justice and Law Reform on issues surrounding licensing and regulation.Some of the leading figures in the betting sector in Ireland have publicly stated they have no problem with extension of the betting duty once it is done in a manner that is enforceable for all and consequently does not disadvantage Irish based services.I am endeavouring to ensure that we can put together a solution that is fair and reasonable, has a sense of balance and will not threaten jobs.  In that context various proposals are being considered.

In general, there are two thresholds: the goods threshold, which is currently €75,000, and the services threshold, which is €37,500.  Where 90 per cent or more of the turnover of a person or company consists of the supply of taxable goods, that person or company must register and account for VAT on sales if the total annual turnover of the business exceeds the goods threshold.  In most other cases registration is required if the annual turnover from the supply of taxable goods or taxable services exceeds the services threshold.  However, a person who makes a supply of immovable goods (that is, land or buildings) has no threshold, and must register and account for VAT on all sales regardless of value.Accordingly, a building contractor whose turnover is from the supply of construction services must register if the annual turnover of the business exceeds €37,500, whereas a property developer must register for VAT for all sales regardless of value.With regard to raising the VAT registration thresholds for building contractors, or introducing a threshold for property developers, I would point out that the thresholds can only be increased in line with inflation, and the Irish services and goods thresholds are as high as they can be.  Furthermore at €37,500, Ireland has the fourth highest threshold for services in the EU and some countries have no registration thresholds.

This is done at a very detailed level, with the result that an overall economy-wide estimate is not available.My colleague, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation is working with the business community to lower their administrative burden and other business costs.  The Budget and the Four-year plan will also examine further measures that may be taken to improve labour activation.  These actions will help discourage participation in the informal economy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	526	At the outset it should be noted that neither I in my role as Minister for Finance nor the Central Bank of Ireland can prohibit or restrict an insurance company from changing its annual premium rates, as this is a commercial decision for the company in question.I am aware of increased pressure on insurance premiums in recent times particularly in the household insurance area.  Much of this is due to the unprecedented level of claims which the insurance industry suffered last winter. The insurance industry estimated that between last November's flooding and the big freeze at the start of this year they have paid out about €550 million worth of claims.  The industry has put the level of claims in further context by indicating that the insured cost of these two weather events exceeded the total cost of all serious weather events that have occurred in the last decade estimated at €358 million.The question of house prices and house-rebuilding prices determining home insurance premiums is a matter between an individual householder and his or her insurance company.  If a householder is of the opinion that the value of his or her house has changed when renewing cover, then it is a matter for that person to inform the company accordingly rather than the company to make this assumption and perhaps make it incorrectly.  I have  been informed that the Society of Chartered Surveyors have a guide to house rebuilding costs on its website, scs.ie, which anybody can use to establish what their rebuilding costs should be for insurance purposes.As the Deputy is probably aware insurance costs must reflect the underlying risk — one of the factors which is previous claims history — because from a prudential perspective insurance companies are required by the Central Bank to meet their capital requirements on an ongoing basis in order to ensure the sustainability of their business.  In these circumstances when they are exposed to higher level of claims, such as that incurred in the last 12 months, it is inevitable that their capital position will suffer and put pressure on prices.  In this regard, it should be noted that the new prudential regime for insurers in the EU, known as Solvency II, which will come into force from the start of 2013 will place a greater emphasis on the need to price risk appropriately than the existing regime, and will in turn require insurance companies to be more conscious of their pricing policy.  This will benefit the consumer in many instances, however in circumstances where there has been a significant increase in claims, it is likely to result in higher premiums.The Government is of course committed to ensuring that the insurance costs in Ireland are competitive and correspond to appropriate international benchmarks.  In that context the Revised Programme for Government contains a commitment to review insurance costs.  It is expected that this review will commence shortly.

Part of that process involves addressing the unsustainable and unrealistic level of debtor overheads which had been permitted by the participating institutions.  As part of the debtor business plan process, NAMA has typically required debtors to reduce their business overheads by between 50% and 75%.These reduced overheads have to cover a broad array of expenses, including salaries for relevant executives.  NAMA does not specify the salary of any individual but the level of business overheads permitted by NAMA will reflect the business activity of each debtor and the requisite added value that a debtor can add in terms of achieving the financial and other targets set by NAMA.

As with any employment, of whatever occupation, an employer is obliged to make the appropriate deductions of income tax, income levy, PRSI and health levy on the making of any payment of such income.An individual's liability to tax is, of course, reduced by virtue of that individual's tax credits and allowances.

As part of Revenue's verification program, the claim was identified for checking and additional details were requested to support the claim. This request issued on 29 September 2009. As no reply was received to that request, in October 2010, the person concerned was advised that the credit was being withdrawn. A revised tax credit certificate for 2010 was issued on 19 October 2010, withdrawing the relief for the remainder of 2010.In addition a PAYE Balancing Statement (P21) for the year 2009 was also issued.  This statement shows an underpayment of €3,054.A further letter has now been issued to the person concerned again requesting the details necessary to verify the claim. On receipt of a reply to that letter with the necessary supporting documentation the position will be reviewed and the relief will be restored if it is correctly due.

The requirement arose when the need was identified for the complete refurbishment of the existing Revenue offices at Sullivan's Quay to bring them into compliance with accommodation regulations. When it became clear that the likely cost of such a refurbishment, including temporary re-location of staff, would be prohibitive, it was agreed that acquisition of a new building, in exchange for the existing one, would provide a more cost-effective and timely solution.The new purpose built offices in Blackpool were valued at the time at €39,136,000.00.  OPW paid a monetary contribution of €19,136,000.00 and also provided the Sullivan's Quay Premises as part of the transaction.  This represented exceptionally good value to the State.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	543	Directive 2005/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on the recognition of professional qualifications applies to all EEA nationals wishing to practise a regulated profession in an EEA Member State other than that in which they obtained their professional qualifications.  Its intention is to make it easier for certain professionals to practise their professions in European countries other than their own but due safeguards are provided in the assessment of the qualification for public health and safety and consumer protection.The Directive provides for member states to assess member state nationals with non-EEA qualifications under their own rules. The person whose details are supplied is an Irish national whose qualifications were not obtained in the EEA but she has been given the full benefit of the assessment regime of the Directive.  For the purposes of the Directive, a regulated profession is defined as a professional activity access to which is subject, directly or indirectly, by virtue of legislative, regulatory or administrative provisions to the possession of specific professional qualifications.  Where statutory registration does not exist for a profession in Ireland, non-Irish qualifications are assessed for their equivalence to the Irish entry-level qualifications required to work in the Health Service Executive.  Pending the establishment of statutory registration under the Health and Social Care Professionals' Act, a health and social care professional with non-Irish qualifications is free to seek employment in the private sector without having their qualifications recognised.Under Statutory Instruments Nos. 139 and 166 of 2008, which transpose the Directive into Irish law, the Minister for Health and Children is the Competent Authority for the profession in question.  Under Regulation 23(1) of S.I. No. 139 of 2008, an applicant may appeal to the High Court any decision of a competent authority, or any failure of a competent authority to make a decision, in relation to an application by him within a period of 42 days from the date of communication of the decision.  This was made clear to the person in question when a decision issued to her and the Minister has no role in such an appeal process.The Department has put in place an administrative appeals process to facilitate applicants in avoiding the time and cost of a High Court Appeal.  Such an administrative appeal must also be submitted within 42 days from the date of the decision being conveyed.  Again this was indicated to the person in question when a decision issued to her.  I do not intend to reconsider my decision not to allow an administrative appeal in relation to the decision on the application of the person in question as the appeal was sought well after the 42 day period for appeal.  To disrespect this time frame would set an undesirable precedent, be unfair to applicants who respect the process and create administrative uncertainty in the Validation Unit of my Department where more than 1000 applications are processed annually.

They recommend that all new entrants to Ireland who originate from a country with a high incidence of tuberculosis (= 40 TB cases per 100,000 population notified per year) and who will be spending at least three months in Ireland should be provided with an opportunity to be screened for Tuberculosis (TB).  Screening is undertaken on a voluntary basis. The introduction of mandatory health screening is not being considered at this time. Healthcare professionals are advised to be vigilant for the symptoms of TB in persons from countries with high TB notification rates.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	546	Firstly I want to emphasise that the contention included in recent media coverage on this matter that adoption agencies, babies in hospital or in care and prospective adoptive parents will be "left in limbo" as a result of the Adoption Act 2010 is incorrect, nor is there any doubt about the legal status of agencies.Accredited bodies — organisations delivering adoption services — must comply with the terms of the 2010 Act.  This legislation ends the practice whereby a single adoption agency could provide the full range of adoption services, from pre-birth counselling to post birth placement with prospective parents.  This was a very clear policy decision taken to avoid the obvious conflicts that could arise.  This decision was communicated to the agencies involved on several occasions over the course of the past 12 months.  Each agency needs to decide what services it wishes to deliver and apply to the Adoption Authority for accreditation.The HSE already provides a wide range of adoption services and can if necessary take over cases if an agency decides not to deliver the particular service involved.  I can assure the House that any hand-over that might arise will be handled sensitively and that no-one will be left without service, nor will anyone have to go back to the beginning of the process.

I agree that it is very important to ensure that appropriate counselling is available to all those that the organisation supports and both I and the HSE are anxious that all former patients of the consultant are made aware of the free counselling support that is available.The HSE has made arrangements for counselling support, using the National Counselling Service, which provides individual, couple, family, group and psychosexual counselling. Persons affected by these issues, but who do not wish to avail of counselling can also speak with a psychologist or counsellor in confidence.  The need for additional support will be continuously monitored by the HSE.  The HSE has assigned co-ordinating responsibility for these matters to the Area Manager for Consumer Affairs in the North East who will continue to liaise as required with former patients and support groups.

In these circumstances, I welcome the fact that the HSE has prioritised the development of mental health services for children and adolescents.  In relation to the availability of dedicated in-patient beds for children and adolescents, the position is that during 2009 bed capacity almost doubled, bringing the total number of in-patient beds to 30.  Capacity will further increase this year with the commissioning of two purpose built 20-bed units in Bessboro, Cork and Merlin Park, Galway, and plans are at an advanced stage for the development of a further 6 beds at St Vincent's, Fairview and 4 beds at Warrenstown.In relation to the delivery of mental health services to 16-17 year olds, as this is a service matter, the question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

Determination of eligibility is the responsibility of the HSE.  Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the HSE as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility (medical card holders) or limited eligibility for health services.Regulation (EC) 883/2004 deals with the coordination of social security, including health care, for those moving within the European Union.  Under its provisions, persons residing in Ireland who are attached to the social security system of another member state, are entitled to receive health care services in Ireland at the cost of that member state provided they are not subject to Irish social security legislation. Persons in this category are entitled to full eligibility and receive a medical card as evidence of their entitlement.

As the Irish recognition authority for social work qualifications, the main functions of the NSWQB include the following:awarding the professional social work qualification in Ireland, the National Qualification in Social Work (NQSW), to persons who have successfully completed a recognised course;accrediting course that lead to the NQSW;accrediting holders of non-national qualifications who wish to work in Ireland as professional social workers, when candidates meet the criteria.The Health and Social Care Professionals Council (HSCPC) was established in March 2007 to implement the Health and Social Care Professional Act 2005. The Act provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for twelve health and social care professionals, including social workers, will apply to the twelve professions regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector or are self-employed and is the first time that fitness to practice procedures will be put in place for these professions on a statutory basis. The structure of the system of statutory registration will comprise a registration board for each of the professions to be registered, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters.The first registration board under the Council, the Social Workers Registration Board, has recently been established. Under the 2005 Act, the Social Workers Registration Board is charged with establishing statutory registration for all social workers. The object of the registration board of each designated profession in the 2005 Act is to protect the public by fostering high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among registrants of that profession. The functions of the registration board of a designated profession are to:establish and maintain a register of members of the designated profession;issue certificates of registration under section 41;give guidance to registrants concerning ethical conduct and give guidance and support to them concerning the practice of the designated profession and continuing professional development;monitor, in accordance with section 49, the continuing suitability of programmes approved by the board for the education and training of applicants for registration, andmake recommendations under part 6 with respect to sanctions to be imposed on the designated profession.The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the subsuming of the National Social Work Qualifications Board into the Health and Social Care Professionals Council. The appointment of the Social Workers Registration Board will now allow for the dissolution of the National Social Work Qualifications Board in advance of the associated Social Workers Register opening to accept receipt of registrants in the profession in 2011.With regard to the remuneration and expenses received by members of both boards, no such expenses have been paid to members of the Social Workers Registration Board.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	576	The Nursing Homes Support Scheme is a new system of financial support for people in need of long-term nursing home care.  The scheme applies to both public and private nursing homes.  In the case of private nursing homes, the scheme replaces the previous nursing home subvention scheme (although people who were in receipt of subvention prior to the introduction of the new scheme can choose to retain it or transfer to the new scheme).Anyone who is ordinarily resident in the State and who has been assessed as needing long-term nursing home care is entitled to apply for financial support under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme.The objectives of the scheme are to equalise the level of State support available for public and private nursing home care and to ensure that such care is affordable for all who need it.Under the scheme, the level of financial support payable to each individual is calculated based on a standardised means test.  Each person makes a contribution towards their care based on ability to pay and the State meets the full balance of the cost of care.  A person can choose their nursing home and will make the same contribution towards their cost of care regardless of whether they enter a public or private nursing home.The scheme is budget-capped. A dedicated subhead was established for the purposes of the scheme (subhead B12 in Vote 40 refers).  This is managed centrally within the HSE and funding is allocated to qualifying individuals on a ‘first come, first served' basis.An additional €97 million was provided for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme in Budget 2010.  The additional funding brings the total budget for long-term residential care in 2010 to €979 million.  This is effectively the budget for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme albeit that transitional arrangements must also be facilitated from within the subhead, i.e. people in contract beds or people who choose to remain on subvention.

Just under 35,400 or 99.9 % of all claims have been concluded.  To date nearly 19,500 repayments of charges to the value of €438m have been processed under the Scheme.  This includes 4,515 repayments deposited to patient private property accounts valued at €116m.  The remaining claims are being progressed currently and it is expected that these will be finalised very shortly.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	578	Under the Health (Repayment Scheme) Act 2006, a relevant person or a connected person as defined in the Act was entitled to apply for a repayment under the scheme.A relevant person is a person who was charged and paid recoverable health charges.A connected person includes the following:(a) a person who has been nominated in writing by the relevant person(b) the Registrar of Wards of Court if the relevant person is a ward of court,(c) a person with an enduring power of attorney in respect of the relevant person,(d) a next friend appointed by a court,(e) the HSE if none of the aforementioned is applicable to the relevant person, and the relevant person is unable to make an application due to a physical or mental disability or ill-health,(f) a living spouse or living child of the relevant person who has paid recoverable health charges on behalf of the relevant person.In regard to patients in the care of the HSE who were deemed by a medical practitioner not to have sufficient mental capacity to understand the scheme and for whom there was no other connected person as defined in the legislation, the HSE made application to the Scheme Administrator for a repayment on their behalf.  As provided for in the legislation, all such payments made in respect of HSE applications were lodged to the patient's own private property account.  The legislation also provides that an application may be made to a judge of the Circuit Court for the repayment to be made otherwise than to the patient's private property account.Where monies have been lodged to a patient's private property account, the HSE ensures that this money is used only for the benefit of the patient.  All funds held in a patient's private property account are the property of that patient and are retained for the exclusive use of the patient.  The HSE is always happy to involve interested family members in the management of each patient's finances, so as to ensure that the patient's available funds are used to best effect in providing benefit to the patient concerned.

These arrangements relate to disqualifications arising from a range of traffic offences.   Now that the mutual recognition of driving disqualifications is in place, a project plan will be developed to pursue the mutual recognition of penalty points, between this country, Northern Ireland and the UK.Unlike driving disqualifications, there is no agreed international framework dealing with the recognition of penalty points for driving offences and a very significant volume of work needs to be done to, among other thingsprovide an appropriate framework of law and international agreementput in place the necessary administrative systems, involving the development, implementation and operation of computer systems; andovercome the practical difficulties arising from the differences in the penalty points systems in the UK and Ireland.Officials from all three jurisdictions will continue to work towards next steps regarding this longer-term project.However, as there is no mutual recognition of penalty points at present between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, there is a need to address the aggregation of such penalty points in the overall context of a move towards the mutual recognition of penalty points between the UK and Ireland.

There is regular and ongoing contact between the Road Safety Authority and my Department in regard to the National Car Testing (NCT) Service.  My Department receives reports from time to time in relation to the delivery and operation of the service.  I understand that NCT has taken a number of steps to increase capacity to meet the substantial increase in demand in the early part of the year due to car owners wishing to become compliant early because of my introduction of penalty points last year for failure to display a valid NCT certificate.  Additional staff have been employed, some test centres have increased opening hours to include evenings and weekends and two new test centres have opened in Carndonagh, Co Donegal and Greenhills in Tallaght.  A new test centre is planned for Ballinasloe and the test centres at Arklow, Waterford and Portlaoise are being extended.During the period November 1 to November 7 2010, 99% of those applying for a test received a date within 30 days.  At this stage of the year any backlog has been cleared and NCT are encouraging car owners due a test in the early part of 2011 to come forward for test before year end.The RSA continues to monitor the position regarding demand for car testing and testing arrangements and I am satisfied that the RSA is taking action as appropriate.

No remuneration was paid to the Chairman or indeed any member of the Board in 2007, 2008, 2009 or to date in 2010.  No expenses were paid in 2007, 2009 or to date in 2010.

The amount of money that is spent on individual rail lines including the Limerick-Nenagh-Ballybrophy rail line, in relation to track renewal and improvements as well as marketing campaigns is a matter for Iarnród Eireann.

Airport charges at Cork and Shannon Airports are set by the relevant airport authority while charges at the six regional airports, which are owned and operated independently, are a matter for each airport concerned.  In relation to comparative charges at other airports in Europe, I understand that a number of relevant benchmarking studies have been conducted or referenced by the Commission for Aviation Regulation (CAR).  The most recent report, conducted by Indecon-Jacobs during the 2009 regulatory determination process, demonstrated that the operating costs per passenger at Dublin Airport were the second lowest of the sample of comparator airports in Europe in 2008.Other reports have consistently demonstrated that charges at Dublin Airport are amongst the lowest of comparable airports in Europe.  For example in 2008 Airports Council International, the representative body for Airports worldwide, identified Dublin as having the lowest airport charges among the top 20 airports in Europe and preliminary results for the 2009 survey show a similar position.  Finally, the annual Airport Charges Monitor, published by the air transport consultancy RDC Aviation, which measures the top 50 airports in Europe, consistently shows that Dublin Airport is well below average with respect to airport charges.  In the 2009 survey, Dublin is ranked 39th cheapest in terms of the level of airport charges for common short-haul aircraft operations.  I understand from the DAA that charges at Cork and Shannon also compare favourably with European benchmarks.

For the years in question, the following amounts were provided for these schemes under Subhead B1: 2007 — €6.4 million; 2008 — €7.2 million; 2009 — €5.9 million; 2010 — €6.3 million.  Indications are that all the relevant funding for 2010 will be drawn down by the end of the year.In addition, the National Roads Authority (NRA) also allocates funding to low cost remedial safety improvements and high cost safety improvements.  Under Section 17 of the Roads Act 1993, the responsibility for dispersal of these funds rests with the NRA and they do not report specifically on such expenditure.  The road safety budget for next year will be considered as part of the Estimates process for 2011.

All transport projects are subject to cost benefit analyses, which must clearly demonstrate the returns and value for money of the investment.  The Review of Infrastructure Investment Priorities for the years 2010-2016, which was published by the Department of Finance in July 2010, acknowledges the importance of further targeted investment in transport, stating that it has the potential to unlock productive capacity in the economy and enhance national competitiveness.Estimates of the labour intensity of investment in transport infrastructure across the public transport and roads sectors are in the range of eight to twelve jobs created per €1 million invested.  Having regard to the above, transport investment is targeted in the Capital Review published in July to continue to be the largest capital programme in the years up to 2016.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection through his legal representative.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.I would advise the Deputy that it is practice in my Department, where a legal representative is on record, to correspond with that legal representative and not the person concerned, unless correspondence is received directly from that person.  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

In December 2006, the person concerned was advised by letter — which also set out the reasons — that his application for naturalisation was not successful. In December 2007, a fresh application was received from him.The application is currently being processed in the normal way with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision in due course.

This application was refused because he was not resident in the State at the time of his application.The person concerned subsequently entered the State in September 2008 and was granted permission to remain for 90 days on Stamp 3 conditions, as a spousal dependant, up to 14 December 2008.  He sought an extension of this permission in November 2008 and again in January 2009 and was requested to provide documentation regarding his finances and future intentions in the State. Some documentation was supplied by the person concerned in January 2010 but was insufficient to prove his ongoing residence in the State and further documents were requested in April 2010.  To date the person concerned has not responded to this request and I would advise that he do so as soon as possible given that he is currently in the State without permission.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course. If her application for a certificate of naturalisation is successful then the person concerned can apply for an Irish passport.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

As I have said before, we must first achieve a policy in relation to a new gambling architecture that is capable of winning broad spectrum agreement.  It is when this goal is achieved that we will be in a position to address the matter of legislative change, with some degree of confidence.I am now considering a report from my officials on a proposed policy for the better regulation of gambling.  Following consideration of the report by me I will make the necessary arrangements to bring it before the Government.  Pending a decision on the matter by the Government, I do not intend to make any further comment on the substance of the document under consideration.On the specific matter of taxation, may I say that while taxation did not form part of the review, it is my personal view that gambling should be subject to taxation . The Deputy will be aware, however, that taxation — where it is applied and at what rate — is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance who will, I am sure, pursue that issue as part of any new regulatory framework adopted for gambling in general and on-line gambling in particular.

Sub-section (3) of Section 4 sets out the various circumstances which an immigration officer may have regard to in refusing to give such authorisation.  These circumstances, any one of which may give rise to a permission to land being refused, include:(a) that the non-national is not in a position to support himself or herself(b) that the non-national intends to take up employment in the State, but is not in possession of a valid employment permit;(k) that there is reason to believe that the non-national intends to enter the State for purposes other than those expressed by the non-national.Furthermore, in performing his/her functions under the Immigration Act, 2004, an immigration officer is obliged, pursuant to the provisions of section 4(10) of the said Act, to have regard to all the circumstances of the non-national concerned known to the officer or represented to the officer by him/her and, in particular, to matters including the following :(a) the stated purpose of the proposed visit to the State;(b) the intended duration of the stay in the State;(c) any family relationships (whether of blood or through    marriage) of him or her with persons in the State;(d) his or her income, earning capacity and other financial resources(e) the financial needs, obligations and responsibilities which he or she is likely to have in the foreseeable future(f) whether he or she is likely to comply with any proposed conditions as to duration of stay and engagement in employment, business or profession in the State;On arrival in the State on 1 October 2010, the person referred to was obliged to present at the immigration control facility at the port of entry for the purpose of making an application to land in the State.  In the course of the examination of the person concerned, the immigration officer to whom the person presented established that he had first arrived in Ireland on 14 August 2006, at which time he was granted permission to remain in the State until 23 September 2006. However, in the course of conversation with the person, the immigration officer established that the said non-national remained in the State unlawfully for over one year, until at least the end of 2007, during which time he engaged in employment, without having permission to do so. The Immigration Officer also spoke to a brother of the person, who confirmed this information.As a result of information ascertained during the above mentioned process, the Immigration Officer refused the person's application for permission to enter the State, on the basis that circumstances set out at section 4 (3)(k) of the Act of 2004 existed.  The person was informed, in writing, of the grounds for the decision to refuse to grant them permission to land in the State.

The Refugee Applications Commissioner refused him a declaration of refugee status.  This decision was subsequently upheld by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  A Deportation Order was made in respect of him on 11 May 2005.The person concerned instituted Judicial Review proceedings on 18 April 2005 challenging the Deportation Order made in respect of him and accordingly, as the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Acts 1995 and 1997 provide a legislative basis for this Convention in Ireland. Under the Acts, a sentence is defined as any punishment or measure involving a deprivation of liberty ordered by a court or tribunal for a limited or unlimited period of time on account of the commission of an offence. A sentenced person is defined as anyone on whom a sentence has been imposed in the territory of a Convention state. Each transfer is subject to the consent of both states and the individual concerned. There is no obligation on any state to agree to a transfer.Without a specific case to refer to, it is difficult to comment on the transfer of prisoners suffering from mental illness. Cases of this nature would require individual assessment.  However, the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act, 2006 and in particular section 15, provides a mechanism whereby a prisoner suffering from a mental illness can be transferred from a prison in this state to a designated centre under the Act. Currently the only designated centre is the Central Mental Hospital at Dundrum in Dublin. The Act provides that a transfer can be made following an assessment by a registered medical practitioner or approved medical officer with the agreement of the prisoner. Where the prisoner does not agree to be transferred, the transfer may still proceed where two medical practitioners or approved medical officers are of the view it is in the best interests of the individual in question.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I have responsibility for two Bills currently before the Houses, the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill, which contain whistleblower protections.Given the broad spectrum of areas where whistleblowing could arise, it is not an issue that could easily be effectively addressed by any one Department or piece of legislation.  Nevertheless, it has been suggested by a number of parties that a single, all-encompassing whistleblower provision might be the best way to proceed. When the matter was considered by Government some years ago legal obstacles were identified to the provision of a single statute which would be effective in the variety of circumstances in which it was to apply.  The Government did not want to introduce whistleblower protection, which, if tested in the courts, might be found wanting. What is needed are solutions that will work well in the particular circumstances of each case.  That is ultimately why, on balance, it became clear that a sectoral approach to the issue would be more effective and practical. Ministers in the course of preparation of Bills are required to include whistleblowing provisions, as appropriate, having regard to the nature, purpose and scope of the proposed legislation in question.The number and range of whistleblower protection provisions introduced in the past number of years is a clear indication of the Government's commitment to this issue. These include the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998, the Competition Act 2002, the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, the Garda Síochána Act 2005,the Employment Permits Act 2006,  the Health Act 2007,  the Communications Regulation (Amendment) Act 2007, the Consumer Protection Act 2007,  the Medical Practitioners Act 2007, the Chemicals Act 2008,  the Labour Services (Amendment) Act 2009, the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, the Charities Act 2009, and the Inland Fisheries Act 2010. In addition a number of Bills currently in preparation contain whistleblower protections such as the Employment Agency Regulation Bill 2009, the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008, and the Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2010.

I am advised by the Garda authorities that a decision has been taken to outsource the management of towing services in each Garda Division, following a successful pilot project.

These contracts provide for the management of the overall service, including recovery, storage, disposal and receipt of payment of fees.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that they provide a detailed guidance document for towing contractors.

To that end, a proposal to draft a Criminal Justice (Community Service) (Amendment) Bill was approved by Government on 9 November.  An amendment to existing legislation will require courts to consider imposing a community service order in any case where they had envisaged imposing a prison sentence of 6 months or less.Also, when section 18 of the Fines Act 2010 has been commenced it will be possible for the court to impose a community service order on a person who defaults on payment of a fine, rather than sending the defaulter to prison.  The Act does not include provision for attachment of earnings or social welfare payments.  However, when section 15 of the Act is commenced it will allow a person on whom a fine has been imposed to make an application to the court to pay by instalments.  It will be possible for the court to direct that the fine be paid over a period of 12 months, and exceptionally, over a two year period.I would like to see how these arrangements operate in practice before considering other measures for the recovery of fines.

As regards below-cost selling of intoxicating liquor, the position is that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment revoked the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order 1987 in March 2006, thereby removing price controls from alcohol products.  However, in March 2009, the Government agreed to include alcohol in the National Substance Misuse Strategy and a Steering Group was subsequently established under the aegis of the Departments of Health and Children and Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs to develop proposals for integrating alcohol misuse into that Strategy.I understand that the Steering Group has been examining a range of issues relating to alcohol policy, including pricing, and is due to submit its report, including policy recommendations, by the end of the year.

The number of prisoners on temporary release for that day was 660.The Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts.  There has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 435.  This represents an 11% rise in the number in custody.Temporary release arrangements can operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison system worldwide.  They are an important vehicle for reintegrating an offender back into the community in a planned way.  The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on completion of their full sentence.  The Irish Prison Service has also judiciously used temporary release as a means of reducing numbers in times of serious overcrowding.Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.  In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station.  Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda.

These regular service visits take place without fail.Should any report of sightings of rodents, insects or other pests be made by staff or prisoners the contractors are called in immediately outside of the normal contract visits.  A report is signed off by the engineer indicating where additional bait boxes are laid, together with a suggestion of a return visit date.

This documentation was received on 12 August 2010.  All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.  There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

Furthermore, additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 12 weeks.I am further informed by the Garda Authorities that the Garda Central Vetting Unit has not received a vetting application in respect of the person referred to.   In the circumstances, I can only suggest that the person seeks clarification from the organisation submitting the application.

These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour.  For adults they provide for a behaviour warning and a civil order.  For children, they range from a behaviour warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children Court.  Applications to the courts for civil orders and behaviour orders are considered only as the last stage in a process.  If the offending anti-social behaviour has been addressed at an earlier stage in the process, it is not necessary to apply to the courts for an order.The range of legislative, policy and operational measures which target anti-social behaviour, including those provided for in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, are under ongoing review by my Department, in consultation with the Garda authorities and other relevant Departments, in the light of the experience gained in their utilisation.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	634	The Government's approach to tackling the problem of drug misuse, including heroin use, is through a co-ordinated and integrated approach under the National Drugs Strategy. The Strategy tackles the issue under pillar headings of drugs supply reduction, education and prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. Drugs and organised crime are being prioritised by An Garda Síochána as a core focus for 2010, through the Garda Síochána Policing Plan, which reflects Government strategies contained in the National Drugs Strategy.Drugs units are in place in every Garda Division and work in partnership with the Garda National Drugs Unit in tackling and targeting drug-related crime. Divisional and District Policing Plans also reflect the focus of the Policing Plan in terms of drugs law enforcement. In addition, An Garda Síochána has strong and strategic partnerships in place at international level targeting drug trafficking. The links between organised crime and the illicit drugs trade continue to be actively pursued. The Garda National Drugs Unit, working with other national units, including the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau, are targeting persons involved in the heroin trade who are the subject of intelligence-led operations aimed at detecting and prosecuting offenders.An Garda Síochána is satisfied that, in addition to the considerable volume of drugs seized to date in 2010, a significant impact has also been made by arresting and prosecuting a number of major players involved in the trafficking of drugs including heroin.  All of this work is underpinned by the stringent and wide ranging criminal justice legislative package of measures targeting organised crime, including drug trafficking, which I have brought through the Houses in recent times. I can assure the Deputy that my Department, and all the agencies under its aegis, remain fully committed to the approach adopted in the National Drugs Strategy and to its implementation.

Persons who are refused a declaration under Section 17 of the Refugee Act 1996 that they are a refugee, subsequently enter what is commonly referred to as the "leave to remain" process. This is separate to the asylum or refugee status determination process.I would point out that payments in relation to JRs are made on foot of Bills of Costs submitted (following clearance by the Chief State Solicitor's Office's Costs Accounting Section) by applicants' legal representatives. Accordingly, there are often considerable delays in the submission of Bills of Costs for payment; that is to say that the time between the finalisation of cases before the courts and the submission of the Bills of Costs to my Department can vary considerably.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	637	As part of the five year strategy ‘Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy', which was launched by the Taoiseach in September this year, my Department has undertaken to establish a mechanism to ensure that the visa regime here supports the priorities set out in the Strategy.  This new mechanism will be designed to ensure that entrepreneurial, business and tourist travellers to Ireland who can be identified as such, are specifically facilitated, and that businesses promoting trade, tourism and investment are not placed at a competitive disadvantage. My Department has written to all relevant Government Departments inviting them to nominate high level officials to sit on a Consultative Group on Visa Issues to deliver on this commitment.  In addition the relevant State Agencies will also be involved.As with all visas in all countries worldwide, the central concern is to strike an appropriate balance between protecting the country's vital national interests by maintaining an effective immigration regime, while at the same time not placing unnecessary or unreasonable obstacles in the way of those who intend travelling for legitimate purposes and who are likely to abide by the terms of their visa.  Each visa application is decided on its individual merits and I believe that, in most cases, my Department achieves this balance.  Visa approval rates for the countries mentioned by the Deputy bear this out.Approval rates for visa applications of all types processed through the Irish overseas Visa Offices in India and China in 2009 were:New Dehli (serving India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal) — 90%Beijing (serving China, Cambodia, Mongolia) — 86%Currently, straightforward ‘visit' visa applications are being decided upon within 10 working days by the Visa Office, Beijing.  The decision time frame is even shorter where applications are lodged via a Chinese government approved tourist agent, such applications being decided upon within 1-3 working days.  A decision time frame of 1-5 working days applies to ‘visit' visa applications considered by the Visa Office, New Delhi.  Whilst I am satisfied that Ireland compares favourably with international competitors regarding processing times and approval rates for Visas from China and India, my Department continually examines ways in which the visa process can further facilitate the promotion of tourism to the State from these markets, in conformity with the needs of an effective immigration regime.

In accordance with the provisions of the contract, following the necessary preparatory work, roll-out of the national mobile safety camera network commenced at midnight on 15 November, 2010 and is expected to reach full capacity in early 2011. The cameras will be deployed at locations which have been identified as having a high incidence of speed related collisions.  Information on these locations is available on the Garda website www.garda.ie.  As well as enforcing vehicle speeds, the cameras will carry out surveys of the speed of vehicles at the locations, so as to ensure that the cameras are deployed where they are most needed. On completion of the roll-out early in 2011, the network will provide 6,000 hours of monitoring and 1,475 hours of surveying per month.An Garda Síochána will determine the scheduling of the speed monitoring and survey sessions and will oversee the day-to-day running of the project.  The service provider will have responsibility for ensuring monitoring and survey sessions are conducted in accordance with those schedules and providing the survey and monitoring data to An Garda Síochána.  The selected supplier will also provide the necessary vehicles, monitoring and survey equipment and operating personnel.  An Garda Síochána will issue fixed charge notices to speeding drivers who are detected and pursue any court prosecutions undertaken. The service provider will be paid according to the level of service provided.  The number of speeding drivers detected by the service provider will have no effect on the level of payment.  The purpose of the contract is to reduce speed, and so increase road safety, not to generate revenue either for the State or the service provider.

The 1875 Act was amended by the Criminal Justice Act, 2006 which came into effect  in August, 2006 to provide for new offences governing the possession of illegally imported fireworks with intent to supply.  The amendments also provided for significantly increased penalties governing the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.Under the provisions, it is an offence:for any person to possess a firework with intent to sell or supply, without a licence,to throw an ignited firework at any person or property, andto light unlicensed fireworks in  a public place.The penalty for such offences is now a fine of up to €10,000  or 5 years imprisonment or both.A nationwide information campaign took place in the run up to Hallowe'en using national and regional newspapers to highlight to the public the dangers of fireworks and the significant penalties that exist for their illegal use.I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that Operation Tombola, the annual Garda operation, was in place for policing during the Hallowe'en period. I understand that Operational Orders were put in place in every Garda Region, in particular in the Dublin Metropolitan Region and Border Divisions, to prevent and detect the organised importation of fireworks in the lead up to Hallowe'en and to police the Hallowe'en period.Persons suspected of engaging in the importation, supply or sale of fireworks were identified and targeted, including by way of intelligence-led operations and searches which to date in 2010 (as of 2nd November, 2010) have resulted in 164 seizures of fireworks, worth an estimated €59,216. These statistics are operational and liable to change.An Garda Síochána also engaged with local communities, Local Authorities and other stakeholders, such as Dublin Bus, in putting plans in place to address the issues that arise around the Hallowe'en period.  Through the Schools Programme and other local programmes members of An Garda Síochána have highlight the dangers associated with illegally imported fireworks.  With regards to bonfires, Gardaí have a liaison mechanism in place with Local Authorities for the removal of identified stockpiles of combustible materials, in advance of Hallowe'en night.Gardaí have also advised Managers of Off-Licences to ensure that staff are apprised of their obligations and responsibilities under Licensing legislation relating to the sale of alcohol, in particular to underage persons.I am also informed that proactive policing arrangements were in place covering the period coming up to and including Hallowe'en night.  Additional patrols were carried out by uniform personnel as part of high-visibility policing initiatives supported by plain-clothes personnel, including District Detective and Drug Units, Divisional Crime Task Force, Traffic Corps personnel and Community Policing and Mountain Bike Units.Given the offences and increased penalties that now exist, together with the measures outlined above, I expect that the Garda operations will continue to be successful in combating the illegal importation, sale and use of fireworks.

The Act works in tandem with the ongoing controlling, as appropriate, of identified harmful substances by the Department of Health and Children through the Misuse of Drugs legislation and the National Drugs Awareness campaign which is highlighting the dangers of the use of psychoactive substances.I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act, 2010, which came into effect on 23 August, 2010, has had an immediate effect in significantly reducing the number of ‘headshop' outlets operating in the State.    As of 4 November, 2010, only 12 such outlets continue to operate in the State. I am further informed that none of these outlets have been found, or are suspected of being, involved in the sale or supply of harmful psychoactive products. In contrast, the information provided to me in May of this year by the Garda authorities indicated that there were 102 headshops operating in the State at that time. I am satisfied that the operation of the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 has had a significant impact on the operation of such outlets. I can assure the Deputy that the situation will continue to be closely monitored by senior Garda management.

Applications for funding must be in respect of projects that are of a capital nature and must be directly related to the provision of sporting or physical recreation facilities. This means that the project must involve improving or building an asset or buying non-personal sports equipment that will be used for at least five years.The Programme does not provide grants towards buying sites, premises or personal equipment. In the assessment process the guiding principle is that priority is given to the facilities closest to actual participation in sport.  In this regard bar facilities, landscaping and car parks are not funded under the Programme.It is open to the club in question to apply to the Department for funding under any future round the Sports Capital Programme should they have a suitable project. No decision has been taken on the timing of the next round of the Programme.Fáilte Ireland undertakes a range of activities to promote angling in Ireland, including investment in infrastructure. Previous grant assistance under Fáilte Ireland's Tourism Capital Investment Programme has been aimed at ensuring that the angling product is maintained and where necessary upgraded to increase supply and improve the quality of the product to bring it in line with best international standards. Because of the infrastructural nature of the investment, Fáilte Ireland has provided funding in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.  A direct approach to Fáilte Ireland (88-95 Amiens Street, Dublin 1, Ph: 1890 525 525) by the group in question is recommended.

Provisional allocations under the Programme cannot be formally approved until all legal requirements are met.  The grantee in question was informed in the letter of provisional allocation on 9 May 2007 that no works should be carried out prior to receipt of formal approval from the Department.The terms and conditions include a requirement, for grantees in receipt of allocations that cumulatively exceed certain threshold levels, to execute a Deed of Covenant and Charge, which is designed to protect the Minister and taxpayers' interest in the grant-aided facility.Where grantees hold a lease to the property in question, and that lease contains a forfeiture clause, grantees are required to have the landlord execute a landlord agreement.  This agreement stipulates that in the event that the facility reverts to the landlord within the period of the Minister's charge, the landlord will either maintain the facility in sporting use or repay the unexpired value of the grant to the Department.  The Chief State Solicitor's Office (CSSO) advised in September of this year that landlord agreements should remain an integral part of the Minister's security under the Department's capital programmes.In the case of the grantee in question, the landlord refuses to enter into such a landlord agreement.  The Department is consulting with the CSSO and the landlord concerned to identify a solution to this matter.  Following a recent meeting with the landlord in question, the Department wrote to the CSSO on Friday last, 12 November 2010, seeking observations on a proposed solution.

The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by whole-time members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda Síochána, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day and full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State — in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who  because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).While electoral law is subject to ongoing review I have no proposals at present to alter existing arrangements for postal voting.

The two clubs referred to in the question applied to my Department to hold meetings on Saturday 25 September, 2010.  I approved these two applications as most meetings are traditionally held at weekends and given the fact that the granting of licences would not result in additional coursing meetings being held.   Similar licences were issued to clubs in previous years.

The position in relation to 2010 spending is being monitored closely by my Department, in consultation with local authorities. While it is likely that there will some capital savings in 2010, it is not possible at this stage to quantify the precise extent of any savings. I do, however, expect that any such amount will be modest relative to the overall capital provision.

These are essentially private homeowners and my Department does not therefore collect data in respect of the performance of such mortgages.The Government has put in place a range of supports for home owners facing difficulty in meeting their mortgage repayments including a Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears which applies to all mortgage lenders; support from the Mortgage Interest Scheme under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance system; and the provision of advice on debt management through the Money Advice Budgeting Service (MABS).In addition, the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — which published its interim report in July 2010 — has now submitted its final report to the Minister for Finance. This is expected to include recommendations on further measures to assist such homeowners.In terms of local authority borrowers, data published in the annual Service Indicators in Local Authorities gives details on local authority mortgage arrears generally, including some mortgages drawn down by households purchasing under the various affordable housing schemes as well as those purchasing under Tenant Purchase.  The most recent data from the 2008 Report show local authorities mortgage arrears running at 11.7%.Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 enables a housing authority to enter into an arrangement with a household for the rescheduling of payments of accumulated arrears, including interest, due to it in respect of specified rents, equity charges and loans, where the authority is satisfied that the household would otherwise suffer undue hardship.Local authorities can and do exercise the powers available to them and endeavour, in all arrears cases, to engage proactively and constructively with a distressed borrower with the aim of enabling a household remain in their home.  In addition, I issued comprehensive guidance earlier this year based on the Financial Regulator's Code of Practice, to ensure that cases of local authority mortgage arrears are handled in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned. My Department has also been represented on the above–mentioned Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.Where any borrower, either from a local authority or from a private financial institution, is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, they should engage proactively and constructively with the lender to seek to achieve an agreed solution.

Similarly, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for determining whether an EIA and/or Appropriate Assessment is required in relation to its licensing functions.My Department collects statistics from planning authorities on the total number of EIA planning applications received in any year, but I am advised that these are not broken down by type of development such as peat extraction. I am not, therefore, in a position to provide the information requested in that regard. My Department does not have information regarding the number of Appropriate Assessments undertaken by Local Authorities, nor does it have information regarding Environmental Impact Assessments and Appropriate Assessments undertaken by the EPA.  However, my Department is aware of a number of cases where a determination has been made that EIA is required for proposals relating to turf extraction.  I will arrange for details of such cases to be forwarded to the Deputy.Applications for consent for turf extraction below ten hectares within Special Areas of Conservation and Natural Heritage Areas are decided by me, as Minister, on the basis of the provisions of the European Communities (Natural Habitats) Regulations and the Wildlife Acts. In such circumstances, it is also open to me to require that an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out where I consider that the proposed activity is likely to have significant effects on the environment.In my role as a consent authority in this regard, I have refused several requests for consent to extract turf within SACs. I will arrange for details of these requests to be provided to the Deputy as soon as possible.Following the end of a ten–year grace period granted regarding turf-cutting for domestic purposes in SACs and NHAs, the Government confirmed earlier in 2010 that no further turf extraction should occur in such sites without the explicit consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This applies to 31 raised bog SACs from this year, the remaining 24 raised bog SACs from the end of 2011 and 75 Natural Heritage Areas from the end of 2013. In these sites, appropriate assessment will be required for all such determinations. It will also be open to me to require Environmental Impact Assessment in such cases.I have no function in determining whether or not a proposal is an exempted development under Class 17 of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Planning and Development Regulations 2001.

Monies are provided on an exchequer neutral basis to meet the costs of persons transferring from the Rent Supplement Scheme to the RAS.  The issue of savings does not therefore arise.The total budget for RAS in 2010 is €125 million, which represents a 38.1% increase on the budget provision for 2009 (€90.5m). The €125m budget provided for RAS in 2010 is intended to support the costs of all existing rent supplement households transferred to the scheme previous to 2010 and to fund the costs of rents of additional new transfers to the scheme during the year.My Department has supported external review of RAS undertaken by the Centre for Housing Research, as well as undertaking an Interim Value for Money and Policy Review of the scheme.  In line with the Department of Finance guidelines on the latter, the completed review has been the subject of an external evaluation and will be published in the New Year.

The Acts require that discharges of trade effluent to waters or to sewers are licensed by local authorities.  In granting a licence, the local authority may attach such conditions as it considers appropriate, for example, covering the nature, composition and volume of discharges.In addition, regulations made in 2009 and earlier this year as part of the ongoing implementation of the Water Framework Directive establish environmental quality standards and environmental objectives for surface waters and groundwater across a range of substances.  Local authorities are required to have regard to these when licensing discharges of trade effluents to waters.  Under the Planning and Development Acts 2000-2010 and the associated regulations, all development commenced on or after 1 October 1964 requires planning permission unless specifically exempted.  Section 4(1) of the Act, and Article 6 and Schedule 2 of the Regulations, set out certain broad categories of development that are exempted from the requirement to obtain planning permission. There is no specific exemption for car wash facilities.

Within the North South Ministerial Council, we have discussed matters mandated under the Good Friday Agreement such as waste, water quality, and environmental research and monitoring. Other important areas of co-operation, outside the remit of the Council, include biodiversity, spatial planning and housing.Specifically, in the area of water services, the Water Framework Directive requires that, in cross-border river basin districts, Member States must coordinate their activities.  On the island of Ireland, three of the eight river basin districts are cross-Border districts and the authorities in both jurisdictions have worked closely together in the preparation of the river basin management plans.   The primary means of co-ordination is through the North-South Water Framework Directive Coordination Group, comprised of representatives from the implementing authorities in Ireland and Northern Ireland.The issue of an all-Ireland water distribution system has not been discussed. This does not, however, preclude local authorities in the Border regions from co-operating with neighbouring councils in relation to water services.

The purposes for which the Fund may be used are set out in section 74(9) of the Waste Management Act 1996 (as inserted by section 12 of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001) and the Waste Management (Environment Fund)(Prescribed Payments) Regulations 2003.It is essential that every effort is made to ensure that those responsible for environmental damage fully meet the costs involved and any question of the State funding any remedial works involved, whether from the Environment Fund or any other source, would fall to be considered in that context.

The shortfall is largely due to some claims being adjusted by the Department to comply with approved scheme budgets or to exclude ineligible expenditures.    My Department is currently examining claims on hands with a value of about €2 million and it is expected that the eligible payments will made before the end of the year.  In addition, my Department is examining the final accounts for a total of 14 water services schemes on which monies may be owed to the Council.   The Department also awaits the final accounts on a further two schemes.  It is not possible to declare the amount of monies still owed to the Council on all such schemes until the Department has assessed the final accounts in each case and agrees the final outturn figures for each scheme with the Council.Under my Department's 2010 Rural Water Programme, Mayo County Council has been notified of a block grant allocation of €14.610 million.  To date, €9.525 million of this amount has been paid to the Council. The balance will be paid when my Department is satisfied that any payment claims, either already received or which will be received in good time for payment this year, are due to the Council and in order for payment.

The assessment of buildings must be carried out by independent BER assessors who are registered with SEAI.The primary purpose of the BER certificate and advisory report is to enable prospective purchasers or tenants to take a building's energy performance into account when deciding on whether to avail of a building offered for sale or letting.In response to the growing importance of energy considerations across member states, a new Directive (2010/31/EU) on the energy performance of buildings was adopted earlier this year and came into force on 9 July 2010.The deadline for the transposition of Directive 2010/31/EU is 9 July 2012.   While Ireland's existing arrangements for BER certification address many of the requirements of Directive 2010/31/EU some modifications and enhancements will be required. In this regard a transposition plan is currently being prepared by my Department which it is intended will be the subject of public consultation prior to being communicated to the European Commission well in advance of the deadline for transposition.

Very considerable progress has been made on both the sale of affordable housing and the deployment of unsold affordable homes for other purposes, including temporary use under the social leasing or RAS schemes. As of now, there are approximately 640 affordable units available for sale or transfer.  While sale remains the preferred outcome, local authorities continue to have available to them a range of options to bring these units into effective use and are supported in this regard by my Department and the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency. I have no immediate plans to introduce a general rent-to-buy scheme across all local authorities because I do not believe such a scheme is needed in areas where there are only very small numbers of unsold units on hand. However, Dublin City Council, following approval by my Department, has recently launched a pilot scheme of "Rent to Buy" for a number of unsold affordable homes in three developments in Dublin City. I have asked Dublin City Council to prepare and submit a report on the operation of the pilot before the end of this year.  This pilot will be reviewed before deciding whether it is appropriate to make such a scheme available in any other local authority area where there are significant numbers of unsold affordable homes.

Cork. Accordingly, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage & Local Government has been a party to a number of legal cases relating to the site. In June 2001, Irish ISPAT Limited went into voluntary liquidation and Mr. Ray Jackson of KPMG was appointed liquidator of the company.  In June 2002, Mr. Jackson initiated proceedings under section 290 of the Companies Act 1963 to disclaim both the lease in respect of the site and the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) licence in respect of the operation of the steelworks.The State, acting through the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage & Local Government; Defence; and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources took counter-proceedings under sections 57 and 58 of the Waste Management Act 1996 seeking orders requiring the liquidator to carry out remediation works (section 57) or to have the costs of the remediation included as a debt against the liquidation (section 58).In February 2003, the liquidator exercised a break clause in the lease, and gave three months' notice.  He was constrained to remain on site until 18 June 2003 by way of an interlocutory injunction pending the removal of radioactive materials, at which point the site reverted to the State.The liquidator successfully disclaimed the IPC licence as the judgment in the High Court on 29 July 2004 found that, as a matter of fact, the IPC licence was granted after the company had ceased production of steel and that the conditions of the licence could not be applied retrospectively.  The State was also unsuccessful in its attempts to have the remediation costs enforced as costs of the liquidation.In 2009, the Hammond Lane Metal Company Ltd initiated proceedings against the Minister for the Environment, Heritage & Local Government in the High Court (Commercial) seeking to recover €8.1m plus further damages to be awarded at the discretion of the Court in respect of invoices relating to a series of unauthorised works by sub-contractors of Hammond Lane in early summer 2008 and for which my Department refused payment.  Without admission of liability on the part of the Minister, full and final settlement of all issues, claims and disputes made in the proceedings in the sum of €1.8m plus costs was agreed in April 2010 and accordingly the proceedings were struck out. Plaintiff's costs were in the sum of €378,784.25.Information on the State's costs in cases such as this is not available in my Department as these are covered by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.

The oil market is fully deregulated and the Commission for Energy Regulation has no function in the setting of prices.Ethanol can be produced from a number of different commodities all of which are globally traded, and which vary significantly in price from time to time.  Furthermore, shifts in currency can have a dramatic effect on prices.  In recent months, a combination of changes in currency and a dramatic increase in the price of commodities, such as wheat, have led to substantial increases in the price of ethanol.

Legislation to transpose this Directive has been drafted and, subject to Government approval, I plan to publish the Communications Regulation (Postal Services) Bill, 2010, in the very near future.The issues for Ireland arising from the Directive have been widely and comprehensively consulted upon, and as with all legislative proposals, a regulatory impact analysis was conducted.  In designing the new regulatory framework, the key principles are the maintenance of a universal postal service and the development of a competitive sector providing competitively priced, high quality postal services to both business and residential customers.I look forward to the debate on the draft legislation when it is published, and will be working towards having it enacted before the end of the year.

I also decided that the final decision on this matter will be informed by an independent analysis of the financial and other impacts of listing each event.  Indecon International Consultants were commissioned to do this report and I can confirm that the report has been submitted to my Department.  The value of the contract is €73,387.The report was delivered yesterday in accordance with the timelines agreed between Indecon and my Department as the process progressed and these timelines reflected the need to ensure that relevant rights-holders were given the opportunity to present their cases fully during the process.  The question of a late delivery penalty, therefore, does not arise.After consideration of the Indecon report and other submissions received, I will revert to Government with definitive proposals. Subsequent to Government consideration of the matter, I am required under the AVMS Directive to inform the EU Commission of any changes to the events to be designated.  The Commission has a period of three months to verify that the list is compatible with Community Law, to notify other Member States and to seek the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to the Directive.  Any designation will only be effective after the Commission has published the list in the Official Journal.I confirm that I propose to publish all the submissions and the final report at the end of the process, subject to the usual considerations including, inter alia, protection of commercially confidential information that has been made available to me.

ComReg publishes quarterly statistical reports on developments in the fixed-line, mobile and broadband communications markets.These reports, among other things, demonstrate the significant progress in broadband roll out and increasing broadband speeds in Ireland over recent years.  At the end of March 2007, for example, the number of broadband connections, at 600,000 approximately, first exceeded narrowband connections.  At end June 2010, by comparison, Ireland had in the region of 1.48 million broadband subscriptions and narrowband connections had reduced to less than 5% of all Internet connections. 85.8% of SMEs are now using broadband speeds between 2mbps and 10mbp and of the homes with broadband access, 77.8% of them are also using broadband speeds between 2mbps and 10mbps.  The year-on-year growth in subscriptions over the preceding 12-month period from June 2009 was over 16.5%.  Internationally, Ireland ranks 11th of the EU 27 for per-capita broadband penetration (composite fixed and mobile), 4th for mobile only penetration, and 14th for fixed broadband penetration.I signalled last month that I have commenced the establishment of a Next Generation Broadband Taskforce to consider how best to facilitate the roll-out of next generation broadband services in Ireland.

RTE launched the DTT trial service, Saorview, to 90% of the population on the 29th October 2010.  This trial service is available to the public and currently broadcasts RTE1, RTE Two, TV3, TG4 and the RTÉ News Now service.  RTÉ is proposing a full national launch in the second quarter of 2011.  Further information on the RTÉ DTT service is available on www.saorview.ie.  Information on the launch is also available from the DCENR website www.digitaltelevision.ie.I believe that this RTE trial service is essential as it provides time for the DTT network to be completed, services to be fully developed and for additional content and receivers to be made available.  It also means that TV viewers can choose to adopt the new service at the earliest opportunity.I have also developed a steering group, chaired by my Department and comprising members from RTE, BAI, ComReg and other stakeholders, in order to progress the digital switch-over process and to ensure that  information and advice is made available to TV viewers in a timely and cost-effective manner.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I propose to take Questions Nos. 338 to 340, inclusive, together.The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband services, is a matter for private sector service providers operating in a liberalised market regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  ComReg's website www.callcosts.ie   provides detailed information on the various private sector telecommunications products and services available on a county by county basis, including County Donegal.In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.EU State Aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.In determining the Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered by the NBS, my Department conducted a detailed mapping exercise in 2008 of the levels of broadband coverage existing throughout the country at that time.  The coverage analysis determined that of the 149 EDs within County Donegal, 52 were eligible for inclusion in the NBS on the basis of insufficient broadband coverage.The provision of broadband services under the NBS advanced incrementally over a 22 month period and services are now available throughout the entire NBS area.  A list of the 52 EDs covered by the NBS in County Donegal, together with the relevant broadband coverage details is provided in the table below.  My Department and its external consultants actively monitor coverage within the NBS areas.  In summary, broadband services in the NBS EDs in County Donegal are available to 98.55% of premises by means of mobile wireless broadband coverage, with coverage to the balance of 1.45% of premises being provided by way of satellite.It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.    Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally launch a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of this year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.There will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme.  While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS.  This process will be technology neutral — it will be a matter for the bidders to decide which technical approach they propose in their bids.Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.I am satisfied therefore that between the services being provided by the commercial operators, the service now available trough the NBS and the forthcoming RBS which will target individual un-served premises, the county of Donegal will very shortly be fully served from a broadband perspective.Electoral Division NameED RefTotal Fixed Residences and Fixed BusinessesI-HSPA Mobile Wireless Coverage (quantity)I-HSPA Mobile Wireless Coverage (%)I-HSPA Dongle only CoverageI-HSPA Dongle and Repeater CoverageI-HSPA Dongle and External Antenna Repeater CoverageSatellite Coverage (quantity)Satellite Coverage (%)ALTNAPASTE5700118216992.86%120463137.14%ARAN5700343843799.77%273163110.23%ARDMALIN5700552451698.47%3731251881.53%ARDS57006771771100.00%402369000.00%BALLINTRA57007370370100.00%233137000.00%BALLINTRA57008605605100.00%389213300.00%BALLYSHANNON URBAN5701213201,320100.00%1192128000.00%BINBANE5701410710699.07%5551010.93%CARROWKEEL5702550948996.07%16229235203.93%CARTHAGE5702645444798.46%2681691071.54%CAVANGARDEN57031161161100.00%9960200.00%CHURCH-HILL5703219418695.88%16814484.12%CLIFF570331008686.00%324771414.00%CLOGHAN57034403403100.00%33762400.00%CLOGHER5703635335299.72%81268310.28%CREENASMEAR57043148148100.00%7465900.00%CREESLOUGH57044507507100.00%302201400.00%CROVEHY57046979698.97%3660011.03%DOE CASTLE57052133133100.00%10825000.00%DUNAFF5705641741699.76%309102510.24%DUNLEWY5706044743797.76%2501825102.24%EANYMORE57061304304100.00%176127100.00%FANAD NORTH5706443743599.54%35679020.46%FANAD WEST57065282282100.00%19486200.00%FEDDYGLASS57066216216100.00%72139500.00%FINTOWN57068183183100.00%76102500.00%GARTAN57069898696.63%777233.37%

Ireland aims to be at the forefront of electric vehicle technology developments and my Department is working with relevant Departments and Agencies to ensure that the necessary structures and initiatives are in place to meet this target.Last April I signed an Agreement with the Renault-Nissan Alliance and ESB, which underpins Ireland as one of the European leaders in electric transport.  The Agreement, building on the Memorandum of Understanding last year, includes the development of a nationwide electric car charging infrastructure, the continued sharing of technical and market data between the parties and the early supply of electric cars into the Irish market by Renault and Nissan from next year.Progress has also been made in discussions with other major motor manufacturers to make early production vehicles available to the Irish market.  Last month, I signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Toyota Ireland and I expect that other agreements will be developed in the foreseeable future.The Electric Vehicle (EV) grant scheme, which is due to commence in January 2011, will provide for grants of up to €5,000 for full battery electric vehicles and up to €2,500 for plug in hybrid electric vehicles.  This scheme, which is subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance and availability of the requisite resources, is anticipated to provide grants for up to 6,000 vehicles over a two year period.  It will be administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).In February 2011, Nissan will begin to supply its all-electric, LEAF hatchback to the car market in Ireland.  A number of other car manufacturers have indicated that they will also be launching electric vehicles into the market later in 2011 and in 2012.The ESB will roll out 1,500 charge points on a nationwide basis by December 2011.  These charge points will support both battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs).  The rollout has already begun with 12 on street charge points, 15 domestic charge points and 13 industrial chargers are already installed.  The roll-out of these charge points is continuing, in anticipation of the first production EVs from major manufacturers coming to market in early 2011.  It is anticipated that approximately 200 public charge points will be in place by year end.  ESB also plans to install up to 30 fast charge points across Ireland by the end of 2011, with nine expected to be set up by the end of this year.SEAI provided grants of €138,000 for eight demonstration EVs in 2009 under its Renewable Energy in Transport Research Programme.  Approximately €30,000 has been committed by SEAI on IT systems updates in anticipation of the Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme.

Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.That mapping exercise found that at least one existing broadband supplier was already active in the area referred to in the Deputy's Questions and consequently the locality was excluded from the Scheme.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	713	Preparation of the Animal Health and Welfare Bill, which gives effect to commitments in the Programme for Government and the Renewed Programme for Government on issues relating to animal health and welfare is ongoing in my Department.  The new Bill will consolidate and update a wide range of existing legislation to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly.  The consolidation of legislation into a single statute should prove considerably more convenient to all those who deal with or have an interest in animal health and welfare matters.I propose to submit the proposed heads of this Bill to the Government at an early date.

Unfortunately, the herd owner in question died before the payments could issue.  Appropriate documentation confirming the beneficiaries of the Estate, including relevant bank account details, are required before these payments can be released to the Estate of the deceased.  There is no record of an application in respect of the 2009 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme having been received in my Department.  An application under the 2010 Single Payment Scheme/Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was received in the name of the "Reps. of the Deceased".  As there are a number of issues that need to be resolved before this application can be processed, officials of my Department have been in contact with the legal representatives of the Estate in an attempt to resolve matters.

All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006.I wish to advise the Deputy that this application was refused on the 9th September 2010 on the grounds that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits for highly skilled, highly paid positions or, in respect of non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or, where there is an officially recognized scarcity of workers of a particular type or qualification.Furthermore, the documentation supplied with the application showed a discrepancy in the annual salary paid to the employee.An appeal in respect of this decision was received in the Employment Permits Section on the 21st September 2010.  All appeals are dealt with in date of receipt order and there is currently a waiting period of 4-6 weeks because of the number of appeals being processed with limited staff resources.  In this case, further information has been requested from the employer with regard to the appeal made and a decision should be made on this appeal when this information is received.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidationI can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on in respect of the individual concerned on 8 July 2010.  This claim awaits processing.In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time for these claims has improved and claims dating from April 2010 are currently being processed.Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:Almost doubling the number of staff working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.   In 2009, my Department processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on the previous year.  Furthermore, the level of new claims processed in the first ten months of 2010 was 63,484 — up over 66% on the corresponding 10-month period in 2009 (38,149) and surpassing the total amount of claims processed for the full year 2009 which came to 50,644.  The backlog of claims is decreasing — reducing from its highest level in November 2009 of 43,608 to a current level of 29,672.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

Grants paid in a particular year do not necessarily refer to approvals in the same year as it is up to the individual company when they choose to draw down the grant.   Due to client confidentiality it is not possible to divulge details of grants paid to individual companies but I am happy to say that in the period from 2007 to 2010 Capital Grant payments to IDA supported  companies in Waterford City and County amounted to €5,000,000.The number of jobs created in an individual company resulting from a grant approval is confidential.

Grants paid in a particular year do not necessarily refer to approvals in the same year as it is up to the individual company when they choose to draw down the grant.   Due to client confidentiality it is not possible to divulge details of grants paid to individual companies but I am happy to say that in the period from 2007 to 2010 Employment grant payments to IDA supported  companies in Waterford City amounted to €369,000.The number of jobs created in an individual company resulting from a grant approval is confidential.

No.142 of 1987) which rather than banning below cost selling, prohibited below invoice price selling.  In effect, the Order had allowed wholesalers and suppliers to determine minimum retail prices being charged to consumers, thereby seriously constraining competition in the grocery trade.The use of aggressive pricing strategies in any business is a legitimate marketing tool and is the normal outcome of the competitive process.  Low cost and below cost selling by a retailer is not of itself an offence unless it involves abuse of a dominant position.  A determination on whether a retailer is abusing a dominant position in the marketplace would necessitate a comprehensive investigation by the Competition Authority.The Authority is the independent statutory body responsible for enforcing competition law in the State and complaints of any alleged anti-competitive practice should be referred to it.The sale of alcohol, essentially regulated by the liquor licensing laws, which are the policy responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, is a matter in which I have no direct function.

The Scheme is operated as part of an Irish state aid scheme approved under the European Commission's Temporary Framework on State aid, introduced in December 2008.  The scheme was brought in on a temporary basis to allow Member States increased flexibility to assist companies in the real economy that were facing difficulties in accessing finance as a result of the economic downturn.There have been 2 calls under the Scheme and as a result almost 1,700 enterprises were approved for support with those companies committing to maintaining over 100,000 jobs to end November 2010.  There are no plans to extend the Scheme.

The CEB's unique role positions them as a first point of contact for persons wishing to set up in business. I would advise the promoter to contact their local CEB; the Dublin City Enterprise Board in the first instance to discuss what options may be available to them and their proposed business venture. The Board is located on the 5th Floor, O'Connell Bridge House, D'Olier Street, Dublin 2; Phone No: 01 635 1114, Fax No: 01 635 1811: Email: info@dceb.ie: Website: www.dceb.ie.To be eligible for CEB grant support an enterprise must be in the commercial sphere, must demonstrate a market for the proposed product/service, must have a capacity for growth and new job creation and must not employ more than 10 people. CEBs can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter. The forms of financial assistance which are available subject to certain restrictions and conditions, include Priming Grants, Business Expansion/Development Grants, and Feasibility/Innovation Study Grants. The CEBs give priority to enterprises in the manufacturing or internationally traded services sector and must always give consideration to any potential for deadweight and displacement arising from a proposed enterprise. In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.It is my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50's) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.Under Redundancy legislation the onus, in the first instance, is on the employer to pay to the employee their redundancy entitlements.  The employer is then entitled, by virtue of pay related social contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, to recover 60% of the amount paid to the employee.In circumstances where the employer is unable to pay the redundancy entitlements, a claim can be lodged with the Department and the documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.

The €1m figure includes general maintenance costs of the National Metrology Laboratory of the National Standards Authority of Ireland. For 2010, these costs are expected to be in the order of €140,000 approximately, which will be recouped from the NSAI.  The current rates bill for the site will reduce by 50% or €280,000 in respect of 2010, which is due to be rebated in 2011.   In addition Enterprise Ireland has advised that it has also secured an 8% reduction in the fees paid in respect of security services provided on the site.Options regarding the future of the site are being considered by my Department to determine its best usage for the State.

As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland does not tend to become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention. In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable the State to ratify the Convention. The Committee has developed a programme on which work is progressing to address the matters that need to be aligned with the UNCRPD. One of the key requirements in this regard is mental capacity legislation, which is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Law Reform. As indicated in the Government's Legislation Programme, it is intended that the Mental Capacity Bill will be published in the current Dáil Session. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.The decision by the Government on whether or not to be a party to the Optional Protocol to the Convention does not arise at present pending the making of arrangements for the ratification of the Convention.

A total of 64 organisations within the sector are supported under this scheme and funding in the order of €16.6m has been provided over the three year period 2008-2010.Contracts under this scheme are due to expire on 31 December 2010.   An evaluation of the scheme, which included a consultation exercise with the organisation referred to by the Deputy and the other organisations involved in the scheme, has been completed. On foot of the review, I anticipate that my Department will be in contact with all organisations involved in the current scheme in the coming weeks regarding arrangements for 2011 and subsequent years.The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot pre-empt the outcome of this process with respect to any individual organisation.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-11-16 00:00:00	Prelude	760	The proposal that money confiscated by the Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB) be allocated to fund drugs services in Local and Regional Drugs Task Force areas is an interesting idea and it has been raised on a number of occasions.  However, it would be contrary to the normal Estimates process to ring-fence specific money obtained by the Exchequer and to reallocate that money for a specific purpose.  The Constitution requires, and Government accounting principles provide, that public money be spent as voted or approved by Dáil Éireann, unless otherwise provided by statute.Also, the variable nature of the value of the assets seized by the CAB in any given year could also cause problems, as funds generally need to be provided on an ongoing basis for drugs programmes and services.   Difficulties might also arise if there were delays as a result of legal challenges to Court disposal orders.  Such an unstable revenue source would increase the difficulties of proper planning of drug programmes by Drugs Task Forces and organisations involved in the delivery of such services.More generally, there is a critical need to ensure that resources are directed in a targeted and effective manner and that the maximum benefit is achieved. As part of its role, each Drugs Task Force should constantly monitor and review projects and should ensure best use of allocated funds.I am confident that the work being done to tackle problem drug use this year will continue to make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by the problem.  I will make every effort to protect funding in this important area but, as the Deputy is aware, I cannot give an undertaking in this regard in advance of the completion of the estimates process and the Budget.
