People woke up this morning to the latest Daft.ie rental report. It confirms what everyone knows. The report shows the biggest hike in new rents since records began - a staggering surge of 14% in one year. It is a new, grim record achieved on the watch of the Taoiseach's Government. What does this mean for hard-pressed renters? Across the State it means an average monthly rent of over €1,600. In the Taoiseach's neck of the woods, renters in Cork city will fork out over €1,700 a month. Get this - in this city, Dublin, it means paying an average monthly rent of €2,258, or a staggering €28,000 a year. Has the Taoiseach read this report? It is just off the wall. Who can afford to pay these insane amounts of money? The answer is very few. Very soon, only the very well-off will be able to live in our cities. The teaching unions today issued a statement. They say our education system is at risk because schools are finding it increasingly difficult to recruit teachers because of this housing crisis. Working people cannot afford to rent. Working people cannot afford to buy. Social housing delivery is nowhere near what is needed. While this situation worsens, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, who is completely out of his depth, says we do not have a housing emergency and the Tánaiste wrongly tells young people that the grass is not greener and they will not find lower rents abroad. In fact, they will. The Taoiseach comes in here every week and tells us the Government's housing policy is working.Well, it is not. The housing policy of this Government should be about delivery, but instead we get denial, delusion and desperation. The record rent hike was entirely foreseeable. The writing was on the wall. We told the Government the credit for renters included in its budget was not enough. We told the Government that to really protect renters it also needed to ban rent increases. Each time the Government's answer was "No". We also repeatedly warned the Taoiseach that the Government's targets for the delivery of cost rental homes are too low, and it is not even meeting those low targets. Now, we hear that commencement rates for housing construction have dropped significantly, putting housing targets for next year in real jeopardy. If this was not bad enough, a Government memo has confirmed a housing underspend of almost half a billion euro in the middle of Ireland's worst ever housing crisis. It is scandalous. Faoin Rialtas seo, tá an t-ardú cíosa is mó riamh againn ach fós deireann an tAire, an Teachta Darragh O’Brien, nach bhfuil éigeandáil tithíochta againn. Tá sé in am i gcomhair gnímh. Caithfidh an Rialtas cosc a chur ar arduithe cíosa ar feadh trí bliana. The Taoiseach says housing is the number one priority for this Government, but the crisis in people's lives puts that claim to shame. The Government acts as if rip-off rents are a figment of people’s imagination. Now the chickens of its inaction have come home to roost and it is renters who pay a heavy price. What is the Taoiseach's answer to renters across Ireland who are fleeced by these outrageous rent hikes? Does this record rent increase now convince him that we do, in fact, have a housing emergency? Will he finally do what is necessary and ban rent increases for three years?

She is not the first to come up with the term "emergency". At the launch of Housing for All in September 2021, I made it clear that when I talked about and referenced a whole-of-government approach that, "[T]he fact is that the social emergency that is our housing crisis cannot and will not be solved by any one department on its own". The point is that we have treated this issue as an emergency from day one, in terms of the legislation we have passed and the initiatives that have been outlined. A lot of what we are doing is already bearing fruit. While many people urgently need housing, many others have got housing. I refer to Laura, a new tenant in Stepaside, who was struggling to find accommodation and said that she had to get her dad to help her because it was so expensive. With the cost rental scheme things are now a lot more affordable and it has been a great opportunity for her to move into an apartment she can finally afford. Bernardo said that his family had been looking for housing since last November and it had not being going well. They wanted a two-bedroom apartment. He went on to say that he did not quite believe the price could be true because he knows the rent in Dublin for a two-bedroom apartment is about €2,000 per month and they were ready to go for a one-bedroom apartment that would cost at least €1,500 per month. The family is moving into a brand new apartment with two bedrooms for €1,264 per month and, unlike other rental properties, they can stay for the long term and it is their home for as long as they want which makes them really happy and secure. Courtney, who is moving to a cost rental home in Kilcarbery Grange, said it gives her security and has a beautiful home. Bernard was one of the first home scheme applicants. He said the first home process was easy, fast and has helped him, and that the first home scheme experience is definitely one of the best services he has received. What is significant about the first home and cost rental schemes? Yesterday, I was at a Land Development Agency, LDA, development at Shanganagh where the sod was dug for 600 houses. Some 50% of the units will be a cost rental. Actions speak louder than words. Who opposed the LDA? Sinn Féin opposed it and voted against it in this House and the prospect of 600 homes. All councillors in the area, irrespective of party, yesterday celebrated the launch of the development and their role in making sure the site was available. Who opposed the first home scheme? The Sinn Féin Party opposed the first home scheme.Time and again the Sinn Féin Party has voted against and opposed significant housing developments throughout Dublin and the country, from Oscar Traynor Road to Ballymastone in Donabate.

I am finding it increasingly difficult to understand how Sinn Féin reconciles its track record in this House and elsewhere in opposing such good initiatives that are now leading to cost rental and affordable homes and social homes. Sinn Féin opposed all of those. Yet, in opposing all of those it still declared the housing issue to be an emergency. The two positions do not reconcile.

As we speak today, house prices and rents are up and, very sadly, we will hear again that the rates of homelessness are up. The way in which the Taoiseach tries to dodge and evade answering questions by pointing to others, as though he was not the Taoiseach - and I know he has limited time left but he is still the Head of Government - as though he was not the Government and did not carry the responsibility to tackle this emergency, is quite astounding. There will be fewer than 500 cost rental homes this year. That is all. It is good news for those who have those tenancies - let me state that plainly - but it is not enough. That is fact. The report published this morning says it all. The average cost of renting in this city this year is €28,000.

It is entitled "Housing Crisis will not be solved by Sinn Féin's cynical populism". In the last paragraph, he writes that Sinn Féin's Stormont record suggests that party populism is more fervently held than its grasp of the detail of what would actually improve the housing situation and it is prepared to be deeply cynical in this area.

All Deputies will want to share their thoughts and sympathies with them and their families. Each week brings more news of the Government’s failure on housing policy. Today in particular we see news about failed policy in regard to renters, with a report from Daft.ie showing that rents rose by 14% year on year and a record 4.3% increase between June and September this year. Rents in Dublin, including my own constituency, are now more than €2,200 per month on average. In Longford, Leitrim and Cavan rents rose by a staggering 20%. We are seeing that this is a widespread phenomenon.We see rising rents and unaffordable homes for people. Increasingly, I know all of us are hearing, as I am, stories from those seeking to rent who are simply unable to secure affordable accommodation. One student told me at the weekend of spending five months looking in Dublin for somewhere suitable to rent and is now paying €1,200 per month for one room in a shared house with a shared, communal bathroom facility. Another constituent told me that upon contacting her landlord to request necessary plumbing and heating repairs, she was then issued with a notice to quit because her landlord was selling her home. The Government’s very welcome U-turn on a temporary eviction ban means she will not be without a home this Christmas, but the notion that a landlord could even threaten someone with eviction merely for requesting necessary repairs to their home is an indictment of our housing system. Some of the stories I hear all of the time from constituents about their difficulties with securing housing are stories we might expect from a Seán O’Casey play, not from a wealthy, prosperous European capital city in the 21st century. It is again an indictment of Government failings. I urge everyone to come out this Saturday, 26 November, for the Raise the Roof rally in Parnell Square, which we in the Labour Party and those across the Opposition are supporting. We know that policies are failing, that people are left without homes and that 11,000 people registered homeless last month. We see trade unions representing those in the education system saying the housing crisis is jeopardising education because teachers cannot afford homes and students at third level cannot afford to rent close to where they are going to college. I ask the Taoiseach to commit to spending the time that has been bought through the winter eviction ban to ensure the reduction of red tape to facilitate the purchase of properties by local authorities, so at least we will see the tenant in situ scheme ramped up and strengthened to ensure some protections are afforded to families beyond this winter, where otherwise they might be facing eviction. Will the Taoiseach heed our calls and adopt a policy of strengthening the tenant in situ scheme to ensure we will not see a deluge of further evictions in the spring?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	27	I have repeatedly made it clear in this House that housing is the single most urgent and important social issue facing our country. The Government has brought in a range of actions in terms of increasing housing supply, and it is about housing supply. The targets this year will be exceeded but we need to do far more. The Deputy used the phrase, and I will take her up on it because I have heard precious little on solutions from anyone in the House. I have had no comprehensive response to Housing for All from any party in this House. There is no alternative comprehensive policy position presented by any party in this House against Housing for All. The strength of Housing for All is the diverse range of options, from cost rental to affordable and local authority affordable to the Land Development Agency, which is now looking, through Project Tosaigh, at about 5,000 new homes, and then right across the board to the local authorities themselves and the approved housing bodies. We will have a very high number of social housing units this year through building, acquisition and some leases, probably the highest in many a year, but we need solutions. When we come forward in the next couple of weeks, first, with an amendment of the An Bord Pleanála Bill, it will give us stronger powers, not just to cut red tape but to move much faster in the planning process for social and affordable houses. I look forward to Deputy Bacik’s support when that is presented before the House. I look forward to the Sinn Fein Party’s support. The time for playing with words is over on the Opposition side. It is fine that people can raise issues and that is legitimate, of course, because this is a big issue, but I heard people this morning on radio and television but not one proposal, not one option to do anything other than to criticise an existing range of policies. Supply is the issue. Delivery is the issue. Planning is also an issue. It will be a short measure that the Minister is bringing forward but there will be a far more comprehensive measure in terms of a new planning Act which consolidates and codifies the planning laws to streamline the planning process, so we can get housing proposals through faster, to be frank, and so we can build houses more rapidly than we currently are, using the best advanced manufacturing technology in their construction. This will be coming before the House in the next number of weeks.I do not expect the entire planning Act to be done before Christmas. That will not happen. I accept there will have to be a full discussion but some of the earlier initiatives will be coming before the House and we will want the support of the Deputy's party in that respect so that we can get social housing built faster on publicly owned land, with some affordable as well. The Minister will be using powers to do that. I invite the Deputy to express and articulate her support for measures of that kind.

He is also right about supply being the issue. However, he is wrong to say the Opposition does not come up with constructive ideas and solutions. We in the Labour Party put forward a clear proposal in our alternative budget this year for an additional spend of €1.5 billion precisely to deal with that issue of supply and to build homes on public land. Here are two other constructive solutions. First, let us see the scaling up of the tenant in situ scheme about which we have spoken and which I have raised before in the House to ensure that local authorities are given consistent rules to apply to prevent homelessness after the winter eviction ban has ceased. Second, let us see the Government spending the money allocated in the housing budget. Members have seen it reported in the Sunday Independent that €476 million of the Government's housing budget for the first nine months of this year went unspent, including a €228 million underspend on council housing. That is not the level of expenditure one would expect or should see during what President Higgins has rightly described as a housing disaster. We will be constructive, we have welcomed the winter eviction ban and we will welcome constructive reforms to the planning legislation, but we also want to see urgent action from the Government in delivering the supply of new housing.

In addition, there will obviously be money allocated towards the end of the year again in terms of housing initiatives. The housing in situ scheme is one the Minister himself initiated. It is up to 600 houses now that have been or are in the process of being purchased by local authorities, with tenants in situ. That scheme is happening as we speak. As I stated in the context of the social housing target, in terms of builds, acquisition and leasing we will be well above previous years in terms of social housing output. It is not an issue of funding; it is actually an issue of delivery through the various planning processes and so on and getting projects delivered in a much faster way, which will mean, in some respects, particularly on public land, rapidly accelerating housing, especially social housing, in terms of the planning process.

I once asked the Taoiseach, perhaps unkindly, whether he is a Cork Taoiseach or a Taoiseach who happens to be from Cork. That remains an open question. Under his tenure, I have watched Cork flourish, finally putting to bed the sad days of Ford and Dunlop. I know this was an era from which the Taoiseach's political philosophy was hewn and from which he draws. As a son of Cork, he has undoubtedly delivered for the city. This delivery reminds me of Michael Noonan's stalwart ability to bend the nation's spending towards Limerick. Sure is that not politics after all? When asked what matters to him, the Taoiseach always says it is community, kith and kin, and GAA jerseys. I have often admired the intrinsically Irish qualities he possesses, although they have not always worked to my advantage or that of Waterford. He has accomplishments to point to on the national stage. His statesmanship has restored an empathy and character to politics here. This lies in stark contrast to the political misfortunes being visited on our traditional friends in Britain and the USA. His focus on housing and health and his refusal to resile from attending to the most intractable and meaningful deficiencies of the Republic are commendable, although change comes slowly. It is worth reflecting on what his term in office means for the people I represent. He has been kind enough to meet me on a number of occasions and to support my access to senior Ministers and leading public servants. I have pressed, using wide evidence, the Waterford and south-east regional agenda to him and to others. That agenda includes equal healthcare provision in the acute hospital in the region, as demonstrated by the need to deliver 24-7 cardiac care; equal access to a university education; airport access for the region to the UK and beyond; and urban and rural regeneration, with focused development of the North Quays, along with the Abbey quarter and Trinity Wharf projects.These are all projects that continue to lie just beyond the funding horizon as yet invisible to the naked eye. I contrast the Taoiseach's visible delivery for Cork with my hope, which at this point is all I have to hang onto for my efforts to date, that the initiatives for our hospital, university, airport and north quays developments will commence soon. It seems somewhat paradoxical that this hope has suddenly arisen in the dog days of the Taoiseach's term. Quarter 1 2023 appears to be D-day, or delivery day, for the revision and the revised administration to deliver cardiac care, the airport, the public private partnership buildings of the South East Technological University, SETU, and the north quays projects. Expectations are huge and continue to be so. A people who have been failed by national politics for a generation wait with bated breath.

I also thank him for his initial kind comments, although I felt a sting was going to come at some stage towards the latter end of his contribution. I will make it very clear that the Government is absolutely committed to ensuring equal opportunities for all our citizens, regardless of geography or where people live. We are particularly committed to regional development because it is important we get regional, balanced development in the country, economically, socially, educationally and culturally. It has to be acknowledged that the Government acted very early on the two calls for proposals under the urban regeneration and redevelopment fund, URDF. More than €110 million has been allocated for projects in Waterford city and county under those two calls. The Government recently approved a final business case for the URDF Waterford north quays public infrastructure project. As the Deputy knows, there were some early issues with that project that were not of the Government's making. That funding, however, enables the largest urban regeneration project in the country to begin. The Waterford north quays URDF public infrastructure project involves the provision of key, sustainable transport infrastructure. It will transform the city and regional access, and facilitate game-changing development on the north side of the River Suir. That has to be acknowledged. This is a big development that will leave a very important legacy to Waterford. The total Exchequer funding for it is approximately €170 million if local authority, URDF and National Transport Authority funding of about €70 million is included. Waterford City and County Council will proceed to the main construction contract. The new South East Technological University was formally opened in October by the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris. Its first president, Professor Veronica Campbell, is a former bursar of Trinity College Dublin. It is a very strong technological university. The Minister and Department are committed to expanding the footprint of the university in Waterford. The engineering, computing and general teaching building in Waterford is being advanced through the higher education public private partnership programme. Additionally, construction is scheduled to commence next year on significant energy retrofit projects in Waterford. The Minister recently confirmed approval was given to the technological university for negotiations with the vendor of a site in Waterford within agreed parameters, again to expand the footprint of the university in the city. On 11 November, the Minister, Deputy Harris, announced €23 million in funding for technological universities, including a further €5.25 million for the South East Technological University. That brings the full funding to that university close to €20 million, if the €10.6 million of the previous fund is taken into account. University Hospital Waterford is currently progressing the development of the second cardiac cath lab. The construction, completion and handover of the second cath lab is now expected the week beginning 28 November, which is next week. We then have to equip and commission it, which will take 12 to 16 weeks. That is good progress on that front.

I thank the Taoiseach for that. I point out, however, that the south east still cannot see whether it is getting a fair share of capital funding. In fact, Deputies essentially vote on a black box when it comes to the €10 billion capital allocation. It is a message for the Government that people throughout the country need to see this fairness and transparency, especially those regions that have not enjoyed the same recovery as Dublin, the south west, mid-west and west. Above all, for me and the people of the south east, cardiac care will tell the tale of the performance of this Government. I again wrote to Professor Philip Nolan at the weekend outlining both the cardiac transfer data over the past three years out of University Hospital Waterford and the findings of the National Office of Clinical Audit report, which shows only 5% of patients are getting out of the south-east region when the Waterford cath lab centre is closed.As his final gift in his tenure, will the Taoiseach deliver on foot of Professor Nolan's report? All the evidence points to the south east needing to be brought in line with other regions. We need 24-7 care delivered as per the promise given in 2016. If that happens, I will say, maith thú

I did acquire that land for Waterford Institute of Technology back in the late 1990s. This was the land that made all the development on the campus possible in Carriganore. At the time, a lot of people questioned the wisdom of that but in the long term, it proved to be a fairly far-sighted measure that facilitated the expansion of the university, which is key to economic growth. Why do I say this? Employment in the south east has grown by 8.6% in the past year. There are now 79 IDA Ireland companies employing approximately 15,000 people. A number of significant investments were made. I do not think this is separate from the investment in the college. Likewise in terms of healthcare facilities, the Deputy is correct that this is very important. The Minister for Health has pushed strongly for the completion of the second cardiac cath lab because, again, that is key to the ultimate objective set by the Deputy. We need to get that project physically completed and staffed, and we need to get additional beds into the hospital and additional recovery beds in respect of that second cath lab.

So far, I have received emails from 34 consultants at Sligo University Hospital, SUH, highlighting the completely unacceptable and unsafe conditions for patients and staff, the consistent underinvestment in the hospital and the unfair and unjust sharing out of resources within the Saolta University Health Care Group. This action is unprecedented, which tells you that this is an emergency that needs immediate and ongoing attention at the highest level. This situation did not arise overnight. I do not have time to go into the historic underfunding at SUH, but nothing less than a complete refocusing of resources is needed to address the historic under-resourcing at SUH. I have raised this issue with the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Tánaiste many times on the floor of this House because the hospital is in crisis and not for political reasons. The Taoiseach has received all the emails so I am sure he is well briefed on the issues raised but in the minute or two I have left, I will highlight in the words of the various consultants the most pressing issues. Perhaps one phrase from one consultant sums it up: "I have worked as a consultant at SUH for over 17 years and I have never seen the demand on our services so high nor the morale of our staff so low." Another consultant backed this up by saying: "We are haemorrhaging staff and cannot recruit. SUH is in my opinion at a tipping point."  SUH has one CT scanner and when it is serviced or breaks down, as it did for three days last September, Sligo cannot provide the absolute basic requirement of an acute hospital. A new CT scanner is promised for 2024 yet Saolta has prioritised a third CT scanner for Galway University Hospital where there are five other CT scanners within a five-mile radius rather than a second one in SUH where there is a much greater clinical risk. SUH has one ageing MRI scanner providing imaging services for a population of 250,000.  Time and again, I have raised the issue of trolley numbers. The Taoiseach will be well aware that this number compared to the number of beds in the hospital is the worst in the country. I know there was an emergency meeting with the Minister for Health last night, which is great. Any meeting is a start but that is all it is. There have been many false starts. We are well used to them in Sligo. I want to hear real commitments today.

The Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, met with the consultants from the hospital yesterday. I believe it was a constructive meeting. The Government is committed to the development of regional hospitals, such as Sligo University Hospital. There has been a significant increase in the funding allocated to the hospital. I understand that over the last five years there has been an increase in funding of €30 million. I understand it has gone from approximately €130 million to €160 million. In July 2022, staffing levels stood at 1,885 whole-time equivalent staff. This was a 12.3% increase since the end of 2020, and included an increase of 71 nursing midwife whole-time equivalents. The winter plan has specific initiatives for Sligo University Hospital. Three emergency medicine consultants and one registrar have been appointed to assist with pre-admission patients. There are also additional administration staff to support referral pathways between the community and Sligo University Hospital, including three healthcare assistants, and this is just for the winter alone. Turning to the capital projects referred to by the Deputy, various projects are in train, including additional ICU isolation rooms, a 42-bed ward block, a second CT scanner and MRI replacement and a new accidental and emergency surgical block. The accident and emergency department modular unit has been handed over and internal works in the existing accident and emergency department are complete. On the ICU isolation rooms, construction of a new four-bed unit is now complete, commissioned and handed over. The detailed design for minor capital infection control works for the remainder of the existing ICU is currently being completed. It is expected to proceed to tender in quarter 4. The new ward block extension will provide an additional 42 bed spaces and an additional shell and core area for future development. The submission for the medical bed project has been submitted. Construction must proceed to tender and this approval must be granted, but construction is intended to commence in quarter 1 of 2023. Regarding the second CT scanner and MRI replacement, I agree with the Deputy that this is required. The project has been approved. It is in the capital plan. The design team tender process is being finalised, with the appointment of consultants and the development of design to proceed this quarter. On the accident and emergency surgical block, this major project will involve construction of a new multistorey extension to the hospital. It will consolidate theatres and provide surgical and maternity wards, a new accident and emergency department, radiology and integrated paediatric departments. A report on this project has been completed and submitted to HSE estates. A strategic assessment review must now be undertaken, as required under the public spending code. A tender to appoint a consultant to carry this out is under way. Again, it is to be completed this quarter.

He has told me about all the things that have been done. He is not responding in any way to the fact that 34 senior consultants signed an email that was absolutely incredible. The Taoiseach talked about the €30 million increase in funding to Sligo hospital. How does this compare to elsewhere? He talked about staffing increases, but he did not compare them to what is happening anywhere else. We are not at the races. After the crash, Sligo hospital lost 60 beds, which was, proportionally, far more than any other hospital. It did not get one of them back until it got three or four in the last year or two. Historically, there has been underfunding and under-resourcing. The Taoiseach mentioned the winter plan. I wrote to the HSE asking about the staff being recruited for this plan. Does the Taoiseach know what response I got? It was that the HSE is starting to recruit. I got this response a week ago. I am pleased to hear the Taoiseach mention the new surgical block. This was in place, basically, ten years ago. Does the Taoiseach know what point it was at then? Staff were then sitting down and looking at where various pieces of equipment would be located in the block. That was ten years ago, and nothing has happened in the meantime.

The issue from hereon in is delivery and whether we can accelerate the timeline in terms of its construction because health capital projects, by definition, tend to be slow to get going and slow to get through the process. We have had these discussions at Cabinet subcommittee level, in particular, with the Department of Health and with the HSE. There is a lot of capital work going on. It is important in the context of what gets said that we acknowledge the progress that has been made in respect of some of the capital projects and that the CT scanner is on the way. It is a matter of the speed at which we can get that up and running and get it done because consultants are concerned that maybe the existing scanner is not fit for purpose for the long term. We, therefore, need two fully-operational CT scanners at the hospital. That is the Minister's intention. He will press the HSE to deliver this on an accelerated timeline.

There has not been dialogue. There has not been planning. There have not been additional resources for communities that host vulnerable people seeking international protection. East Wall is merely the latest example of this. East Wall, by the way, is a diverse and integrated community, yet now totally unnecessary division and anxiety has been driven by a lack of dialogue and a lack of basic planning. Communities know that those seeking international protection have to be catered for. That matter is not in dispute. They also know that communities such as East Wall have been treated with utter disrespect and that, in fact, asylum seekers themselves have been treated with utter disrespect. The Taoiseach needs to set out for the Dáil what he means by what he calls "consultation".

We need a proper discussion here in the Dáil this week. These subsidies are not supposed to be paid until 23 February next year. For many businesses, this will be too late. They will be gone for good. Can we have a debate here this week to release this money earlier?

We do not have an option but to avail of all offers of accommodation including those that in ordinary times we would not consider appropriate. This includes the use of repurposed office buildings, sports facilities and tented structures. We are not in ordinary times. We are doing all we can to provide shelter and to comply with our international obligations. As of 13 November there were 17,192 people accommodated through the International Protection Accommodation System, IPAS. By comparison at this point last year there were approximately 7,250 in IPAS accommodation. This is just with regard to international protection alone, separate from the Ukraine war situation. Because of the brutal war that Putin is raging almost 60,000 people have arrived in Ireland. We saw the warnings this morning in respect of a freezing winter in Ukraine and the utter destruction of the infrastructure there. In my view this will accelerate further migration to Europe. Approximately 14 million people have been displaced. We need to consult and we also need to engage with the public on the horrible reality that war has brought upon the Continent of Europe. There are no easy solutions. We cannot suggest to people, unfortunately, that there are easy solutions. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, has been before the Dáil in respect of this issue. He has spoken and engaged. There is no magic solution. In the context of East Wall-----

Ultimately we have to be fairly straight with people. We have international obligations and with regard to fulfilling them the pressures are enormous because of a number of issues such as conflict, famine, drought, climate change and the war in Ukraine itself. The Minister and the Department are engaging with local representatives to provide the information. They will be providing more information directly to the community in the coming days. This is happening. The Minister wants to foster positive linkages with the local community for the new centre in East Wall. He is also committed to supporting those communities that are supporting refugees. I have dealt with the issue raised by Deputy Gino Kenny. To respond to Deputy Michael Collins, five hours debate are provided for the Finance Bill. He should support the Finance Bill because under the temporary business energy support scheme it will provide supports to many businesses, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, in respect of the shocking increases in energy prices brought about by the war. To respond to Deputy Bacik, the Minister for Education has met victims' groups in recent days and will continue to do so this week. The Minister intends to meet spokespersons on education from various parties in the House, the idea being to see how we can progress this issue in a victim-led way.

He said yesterday morning he was reluctant to tackle toll rises if it would come at a cost to other priorities. I have to put it that the priority now should be to support workers and businesses facing a cost-of-living crisis and certainly the Government should not be worsening that crisis by hiking the cost of getting to work. Last night the Minister, Deputy Ryan, said he was examining the matter. We have heard that before. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment today in the Dáil that the proposed hike in toll charges will not go ahead as planned?

The other point is that we are in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, and we get that. The Minister is examining the situation.

Despite the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme and core funding model, parents in Dublin are still paying as much as €1,000 per child per month, if they can find a crèche place. We know providers are closing crèches because many are also struggling and skilled early-years educators are still not being paid enough, despite the welcome changes with the employment regulation order. We are failing parents, staff, providers and, most of all, children by failing to deliver a proper, State-funded, universal childcare scheme. The Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality called for Ireland to move to a publicly-funded, accessible and regulated model of affordable early-years childcare over the next decade. We are working on the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly but we are conscious the clock is ticking and we are one tenth of the way through that decade. The Government must take action now to ensure, by 2030, we move to the model of childcare to which the Citizens' Assembly aspired.

We are investing approximately €1.25 billion in childcare. This means the first of five investment targets, €1 billion by 2028, has been achieved five years ahead of schedule. This year's budget allocation will support a reduction of up to 25% in childcare fees. This measure will put close to €2,100 every year back in the pockets of parents from next year. This follows last year's budgets that provided funding for a new employment regulation order, which was agreed between employee representative bodies and the employers. This will result in increases in wages and better conditions for those working in the childcare sector. The Deputy stated that childcare has evolved on a piecemeal basis. I take her point but that has been the case for over 30 years in terms of community-based, private sector and State-based childcare. The issue now is how we build on that and make it affordable for parents.

It is beyond disgraceful that our laws, after repeal, are still forcing people enduring the pain of complicated pregnancies and foetal anomalies to go overseas for healthcare. There is also the unnecessary three-day mandatory waiting period, a barrier that has no evidence basis. In addition, only 11 of the 19 maternity hospitals provide these services and many rural areas have no provision, forcing women to travel for hours. The review of abortion services is due to be completed soon. Will the Taoiseach guarantee that it will address both the operational and legislative issues that are restricting abortion care in Ireland?

These people, who are affected by apartment and duplex defects, are facing huge bills of up to €68,000 for defects caused through no fault of theirs. They are the fault of Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael legislation which allowed self-certification and builders who abused that measure. The people in question were very disappointed that no Government representatives attended, despite repeated invitations. They had a clear message. We understand the Minister is due to bring a proposal to Government before the end of the year. If it is anything less than 100% redress, with full retrospection, it will not be accepted.The Minister will have a mica-style major protest movement on his hands. Is there a date for the scheme the Minister will propose coming into effect?

Some 28,000 homes were included in those surveys. We have a very good handle on the types of issues that have arisen and what needs to be done. The Taoiseach and I have said we need to grasp this nettle and that is what we are doing. I intend to bring recommendations to Government in advance of Christmas. The Deputy should also know that any scheme that is brought forward will have to be underpinned by legislation. I hope the Deputy will support it at that time because we are very serious about dealing with this issue. I engage with families all over the country on a weekly basis and keep in regular contact with the Construction Defects Alliance and its input into the work we have done has been most constructive. I will bring recommendations to Government in advance of Christmas.

Last weekend's Fine Gael Ard-Fheis included promises to tackle lengthy waits. Although the winter plan 2022-23 makes significant promises on additional capacity and improved pathways to care, I wish to raise the terrible situation of one of my constituents in County Louth. On 4 October, I emailed the Minister for Health about my constituent, John Evans from Dundalk, who, having previously undergone a kidney transplant and a leg amputation in 2020, has been waiting for months for urgent surgery to remove his fingers as a result of dry gangrene. Due to the long waiting times, the gangrene has spread to his other fingers. This man is in constant pain. He presented at the accident and emergency department in Drogheda numerous weeks ago and was sent home. Last week, he presented at an accident and emergency department in Dublin from which he was also sent home. I acknowledge the Minister for Health and his team helped to get the original date for Mr. Evans's surgery. However, surgery has since been postponed twice. This is inhumane. If admission is determined in accordance with medical needs, are this man's limbs not critical? He urgently needs care.

I have been informed that at least one of the two driving testers will move on at the end of December, which will leave the driving centre with skeleton staff. People who booked the driving test in Skibbereen two weeks ago were informed they would have a test three months from now. Those who try to book this week are told it will be at least six months. The Road Safety Authority, RSA, has clarified it is not closing the centre but, as of yet and in spite of queries, it has not quelled speculation that the centre may only open one week in the month. The Skibbereen driving test centre is the only such centre in west Cork serving people as far east as Innishannon, Bandon and Clonakilty and west as far as Castletownbere, Goleen and Kilcrohane. Parents and young people alike cannot wait six months for a test and nor can they be expected to travel to Cork or Killarney for a driving test. Not alone would this be a disaster for them but also for the local economy in Skibbereen and the excellent driving instructors there. Will the Taoiseach help the many thousands who will be affected by this and step in to get clarity from the Department of Transport on whether the Skibbereen driving test centre is to stay open five days per week from January 2022 onwards?

Six councillors voted against it, including Councillors Pat Dunne and Sophie Nicoullaud. I support their position. Between amendments and variations on vacancy refunds, the fundamental baseline of the budget is wrong. When the local property tax was introduced, it was clearly stated by the Government that the tax would assist in funding better services and that people in Dublin city and all over the country would see better services in their local authority areas. Despite that, Dublin City Council has taken in €94.5 million in local property tax, which is €12.5 million more than last year. This is due to a review of valuations and the equalisation fund being done away with. When that was announced, it was said there would be additional funding for local authorities. In reality, virtually all of that €27 million extra-----

A Barnardos survey recently revealed that 26% of parents felt they did not have enough food to feed their children over the past year and that the cost-of-living crisis had led to 41% of parents cutting back on food spending. I welcome our budget. In July 2022, the Government report, Food Poverty: Government Programmes, Schemes and Supports, told of €89 million spent directly to address food poverty, with €400 million spent on schemes that include food and poverty aspects. With the way things are at the moment, I wonder why we do not have a specific budget for food provision. I know we have done a lot. I welcome that many schools have DEIS status. However, people are not spending as much on food. I ask that the Government look at food provision and at soup kitchens, or food kitchens as we call them. St. Clare's Hospitality Kitchen in Carlow feeds more than 100 people a day, including children, women and men. There is no Government funding for it. Will the Government look at once-off funding for such kitchens?

The scheme is collapsing and is clearly in a state of decline. In 2020, there were 33 dentists participating in the dental treatment service scheme in the county. Now there are only 14. The people of Bunclody and Rosslare have no dentists at all operating under the scheme. New Ross has only two. In other areas such as Enniscorthy people are left in desperate pain as the dentists on the scheme in their areas are not taking on any new patients. In reply to a question I asked last week the Minister said "The HSE will assist patients who are still having difficulties accessing services and may provide emergency dental services directly to patients where necessary". When I rang the HSE about this I was told this was not the case. Has the Government contacted the Irish Dental Association, IDA, regarding this serious situation and is there a comprehensive plan to deal with it?

We are aware there is an issue in Wexford, and indeed in many parts of the country, where more and more private dentists have withdrawn from the public scheme. Through the budget for this year and next we are significantly increasing the funding. It includes an increase in fees for dentists. We are engaged with the IDA. What it is looking for and what we have agreed to is a discussion about the entire scheme and the entire provision. The additional funding we are putting in is aimed at helping in the short term but it is not a long-term fix. A more comprehensive approach is required and is something we will be kicking off next year with the IDA.

They can seek it for themselves but not for their children. The children must bring a separate case after the parent has died. The difficulty lies in section 48(2) of the Civil Liability Act 1961, which provides that in fatal injury cases - the Morrissey case falls into this category - only one claim for compensation can be made. This has created an agony of uncertainty for families who have already been badly let down by this State. The Supreme Court has recommended we legislate to rectify the situation. I listened to many fulsome verbal tributes to Vicky Phelan in the Chamber last week. Bringing this legislation forward immediately would be a tangible tribute.

I know of two providers, one being a hotel and the other a centre, that are owed over €400,000. This is not an isolated incident. The hotelier I spoke to this morning said he is considering his own position in hosting Ukrainians because of the lack of payment coming from the Department. I have been in contact with the Department about another case and I can get no reply whatsoever from it except for an acknowledgment. An acknowledgment will not pay the bills for these centres. This is very serious. I ask the Taoiseach and his officials to intervene here. It is a pay issue within the Department-----

There is a cohort that is not going to get this reduction, namely, students who have to repeat a year. In many cases, these students are more economically vulnerable and may have to work part-time to keep themselves in college. Can the Taoiseach explain why this extraordinary step has been taken to exclude this cohort from the promised €1,000 reduction as a cost-of-living measure? Can he please look at granting this cohort that small amount of funding?

It has become a go-to support system for the HSE with referrals from public health nurses and so on. The centre gets no funding of any kind. Could the Taoiseach bring this to the attention of the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, and the HSE, to see if any support could be provided?

This has been the case for many years. It is going to detrimentally affect family farms. The Minister's answer is that the farmers should mulch it. A mulcher needs diesel or petrol.

There is a variety of localised funding from the Department of Rural and Community Development that people could tap into. We will follow up with both Ministers to see what can be done. The danger is that once you start formalising grants and so on there is all sorts of bureaucracy and stuff. Whatever can be done speedily and quickly would be of interest.

I had a short courtesy meeting with European Commission Executive Vice-President for a Europe fit for the digital age and competition, Margrethe Vestager, on 30 September. This year marks 50 years since the Irish people voted to join what is now the European Union, and Ireland and Denmark became members on the same day, 1 January 1973. Executive Vice-President Vestager and I reflected on the impact of European Union membership in our respective countries over those years. Our discussion also focused on topical European Union issues. We discussed Russia's escalating war against Ukraine, and the resolute response of the European Union. I expressed Ireland's strong support for Ukraine and its people, highlighting the generous response of the Irish people, and our support for Ukraine's application for membership of the European Union. We also discussed how to ensure continuing effective support from the European Union to Ukraine, including our humanitarian response as winter approaches, and how we can support its immediate and future financial needs. We discussed the impact of the war on energy supply and prices and we agreed the need for a co-ordinated and effective response at European Union level to ensure security of supply and support for citizens and businesses. I acknowledged the importance of the temporary crisis framework that was adopted by the Commission in March to enable member states to use the flexibility foreseen under state aid rules to support the economy in the context of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We also discussed the economic outlook for the European Union and the risk of a sustained downturn. We agreed the need for the European Union to remain flexible in our response, while preserving its global competitiveness and the integrity of our Single Market. Next year will mark 30 years of the European Union's Single Market. Executive Vice-President Vestager and I reaffirmed the importance of the Single Market of over 450 million people, which is at the heart of today's European Union and is among its finest achievements. It enables free movement of people, goods, services and capital; reduces transaction costs for cross-border trade; facilitates the market-based competition that delivers greater quality and choice to consumers; and sets the strategic context and regulatory standards for innovation and productivity growth. I was pleased to have the opportunity on 27 October to deliver the opening address at the Ireland and the Single Market conference, organised as part of our national EU50 programme. In my remarks, I highlighted the strategic importance of the Single Market as a core foundation of Europe's peace and prosperity.

I want to follow up on two of them. The first is Russia's brutal war in Ukraine. There are reports today that the EU plans to confiscate the assets of Russian sanction evaders to provide support for Ukraine to rebuild. Will the Taoiseach consider removing the Government block on a Bill proposed by our colleague, Deputy Howlin, namely the Magnitsky legislation proposed by the Labour Party before the Russian invasion of Ukraine began? It would allow for the assets of those abusive of human rights to be seized. In particular, it would allow for assets held by Russians who are sanction evaders to be seized. Reports this year have stated that anywhere from €34 billion to €50 billion worth of assets are in special purpose vehicles in the IFSC. My second point concerns energy policy, a key focus of Commissioner Vestager's visit to Dublin. In the context of the Cabinet finally agreeing plans for a windfall tax, which is welcome, can the Taoiseach confirm that the solidarity contribution announced today on fossil fuel companies will also ensure that there is a windfall tax on the profits of the Corrib gas field which will cover all of the windfall gains it has made this year? Was he lobbied in any way by Vermilion Energy on the rate of tax will apply to Corrib and what the baseline profit rate would be?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	158	At the weekend, there was further evidence of the desire of Fine Gael to abandon Ireland's neutrality with its resolution to get rid of the triple lock arrangement and, essentially, create more flexibility for the Government to deploy Irish troops in military adventures and conflicts. That is an outrageous attack on our neutrality and is not in line with what the majority of people want. Could the Taoiseach comment on whether he supports this line of thought? Will we remove one of the important restrictions on any Government abandoning our neutrality and further galloping towards the involvement of this country in NATO or the project of EU militarisation?
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	159	Does the Taoiseach agree that COP27 was a dismal failure and that, in the words of the UN Secretary General, we are still on the road to climate hell and politicians and big business continue to have their foot on the accelerator? COP27 failed, yet again, to commit to phasing out fossil fuels or to meaningful measures to reduce emissions. It could not even commit to a weak proposal to ensure that emissions peak by 2025. It has become a process used by leaders like the Taoiseach to turn up for a photo opportunity, make a fine self-serving speech and return home with no intention of changing their actions. The one positive was the loss and damage fund. It took 30 years to make this small advance, but there is no admission of liability by the EU or US and no agreement on who will provide the funding, when it will be funded or who will fund it. It will be delayed again and again. We are headed towards absolute catastrophe. Will the Taoiseach take some action that recognises that?
#NealeRichmond	unknown-#NealeRichmond-party	unknown-#NealeRichmond-dob	unknown-#NealeRichmond-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	160	The crux of the conference the Commissioner attended concerned the Single Market and the impact on the energy crisis we are facing, in particular. One area of the Single Market to which we are all well attuned is the access that Northern Ireland continues to have through the protocol. Once again, at the weekend we saw more internal party politics and messing across the water regarding negotiations between the EU and the UK. In the discussions the Taoiseach held, did the Commissioner lay out where exactly there would be grounds for optimism and when exactly we can expect the British Government to make some tangible suggestions regarding the protocol?
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	161	In July, The Irish Times wrote, in reference to the European Court of Justice hearings on the Apple tax case, that a spokesman for the Department of Finance said it was expected that the hearings in Luxembourg would be held in the autumn and it was anticipated that the court would provide between four and six weeks' notice once it had decided on a date to hear the case. This month, the Tánaiste told me in the Dáil, "I do not have an update on the timing in relation to those cases. That matter is handled by the Minister for Finance rather than me". I would have thought the Tánaiste might have a better idea of what is going on with the biggest tax case in corporate history, given that the State has a direct involvement in it. Incredibly, it is still trying not to take any of that money. Maybe the Taoiseach is in a better position to provide that information, having met Commissioner Vestager, and to tell the Dáil how things currently stand on this matter.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	162	Commissioner Vestager is very accustomed to problems in the Irish insurance market, having overseen the investigation into the motor insurance industry over recent years for operating a cartel. That investigation and political pressure from Sinn Féin and Deputy Pearse Doherty led the Government to set out the 66 actions on insurance reform. The Government recently published a report claiming most of the actions have been, or are in the process of being, implemented. However, the director of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, Peter Boland, said all of the gains made are being pocketed by insurers and, in fact, premiums are increasing. This is particularly true for small businesses that are already being crippled by rising costs. Homeowners are seeing huge jumps in the cost of home insurance at a time when mortgage rates are going up and bills are skyrocketing. I am concerned about what is happening with home insurance. Construction inflation and the cost of rebuilding are major issues, but I am hearing about cases where insurance premiums have increased from €400 or €500 to over €1,000. Such increases negate all of the cost-of-living measures implemented by the Government.

I discussed the matter with the Minister for Justice. The view was that the Bill, as tabled, would have no real effect. The Prime Minister of Estonia first mooted the idea of confiscating Russian foreign reserves in respect of rebuilding Ukraine. There is a lot of merit in that proposal, and we support such a measure because the damage done to Ukraine by Russia is enormous in terms of economics and the destruction of housing and residential blocks, factories, the public realm and buildings. The costs run into the billions. Russia needs to know it will have to pay for a lot of the reconstruction of Ukraine. That is a very important principle. It is quite complex from a legal perspective and the matter remains to be worked out. I will speak to the Minister again in respect of the proposed legislation the Deputy's party colleague, Deputy Howlin, brought before the House. On the solidarity tax, it will include the Corrib field. Did Deputy Bacik raise that matter?

I do not know whether an email was sent. I was not lobbied in any way. I met the company some months ago regarding its plans for the field in terms of carbon storage and a renewable future post extraction, something that is currently under way. That is the position on that. Deputy Boyd Barrett referenced the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis and the proposal from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Simon Coveney. The Government has no intention of changing its current policy in respect of military neutrality. There is no galloping towards new alliances or anything like it. The Deputy consistently makes that false assertion in the House, but that is not the case.

There has to be reform of the UN and the Security Council. When we were on the Security Council, Ireland put forward a good proposal linking climate change with security. India and China were sceptical at the beginning. Both of those countries abstained. One country stopped what the overwhelming majority of the UN wanted, which was to link climate with security that Ireland was championing. All the small island states of the Pacific were pleased with Ireland following up on the commitments that we made in the election to the Security Council. Who opposed and vetoed it? Russia. There are issues. Deputies are putting their heads in the sand if they do not think there is an issue there. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is entitled to articulate a view on that. We still need a triple lock in regard to the General Assembly and so on. I have suggested that we need a citizens' assembly to discuss these issues in a more informal and deliberative way than has been the case to date. I do not accept Deputy Murphy’s view that COP27 has been a dismal failure. He mentioned politicians. He is a politician just as I am a politician. He opposes carbon tax. Some would say that is a dismal failure on his part in respect of climate change. Many politicians are sincere about climate change and good progress was made. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, deserves a great deal of credit for the extremely hard work he put in over the past two weeks. All the Irish team, including the civil servants in the climate section of the Department of Foreign Affairs, deserve great credit on loss and damage. Ireland was a leader on loss and damage. We have allocated funding under the global shield towards loss and damage, which was one small, concrete proposal around trying to prepare for that. Ireland is committed to that area and we remain committed.  Deputy Richmond raised the issue of the Single Market. I raised the question of how can we expand the Single Market. There is work not yet done in respect of services, for example, in the Single Market. We need to widen the Single Market in regard to services, which could help insurance costs and so on in the country. On the protocol, we discussed it generally in respect of where we were. At that time. Members will remember British politics was in a different space. The European Commission stands ready under Vice-President Šefčovič to move on the protocol issue and to be flexible. We want intensive talks to commence between the UK Government and the European Union.  Deputy Barry raised the ECJ. We did not discuss the Apple tax case. That is now with the courts and remains to be resolved.

It is important to put on the record that we did not discuss the Apple case. The updates are there to be had in terms of the proceedings of the court and the court's timetable. I can get the update for the Deputy and communicate that to him. Deputy Conway-Walsh raised a separate issue on the motor insurance industry more generally. The cost of motor insurance has come down and the Government has implemented the vast majority of the recommendations of the group it established to make recommendations on the insurance industry. Now it falls to the industry to reduce premia in other areas of insurance that have not yet been reduced.

The climate action unit is part of the economic division of my Department. The unit was established in 2019 and it supports me and the Government in dealing with the challenges of climate change and driving the necessary transition to a climate-neutral economy. The unit assists in co-ordinating a whole-of-government response to the climate crisis, including supporting the delivery of the Government's climate commitments as outlined in the programme for Government. It supports the work of the Cabinet committee on the environment and climate change, the Climate Action Delivery Board and a number of related senior officials' groups and interdepartmental working groups. The unit is responsible for monitoring implementation of the Government's climate action plan and prepares quarterly progress reports that are published on my Department's website following consideration by Government. These reports document the status of each of the sectoral actions that have been committed to by Ministers and Departments whether they have been completed on time or delayed, and the reasons for any such delays. The unit also supports the work of the Department's green committee established in 2019 to implement a range of actions to improve the management of energy, water, material and waste resources within the Department.

It is clear that the Government's retrofitting plan is deeply unfair in its design. It prioritises those with greatest means over those with greatest need. A wealthy household can access €25,000 in publicly funded grants for the deep retrofit while many with far greater need cannot access basic measures such as attic or wall insulation. Places such as north Mayo have some of the highest concentration of energy poverty in the State but north Mayo will not have the largest share of the retrofits. The better energy warmer homes scheme is one of the better designed schemes that targets the most vulnerable but it has been under-resourced. There are 9,000 people on the waiting list and it will take up to 27 months for people to get the very basics of the retrofitting. The prioritisation of wealthier households serves to add to the growing delays of those living in energy poverty. It is important that the Government looks again at the retrofit plan and assesses, measures and evaluates it properly in regard to who is taking up the grants and, moreover, who is not taking up the grants, such as people who desperately need them but cannot afford to access them.

Some in the House believe we should abandon those targets but I firmly believe we should focus all our efforts on reaching those targets and reducing emissions by 51%. A key part of that will be renewables and a key part of them will be both offshore and onshore wind but the pace at which we are rolling out wind energy is too slow. Part of the reason for that is issues such as foreshore licences. A myriad of foreshore licences are stuck in the system at the moment. We cannot even find out where they are and when a decision might be expected on them. I realise that Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, should be up and running in the early part of next year but these foreshore licences need to be decided upon. When MARA is set up and marine area consents are issued, applications will go on to An Bord Pleanála. I do not believe An Bord Pleanála is ready or resourced to deal with these applications at the moment. We need to ensure the board is resourced and that it has the right expertise to deal with these applications.

The real story of COP27 is the failure of measures to limit global temperatures. It is like saying to the people of east Africa, "We can starve 40,000 of you and give you a few bob" or to the people of Pakistan, "We can cause catastrophic flooding for 30 million of your people and give you a few bob to compensate". We come home at the weekend to find a gloating tweet from the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan. He wants to show his support for building a liquefied natural gas, LNG, facility in this State. The Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Éamon Ryan, before going to COP27 sanctioned a licence extension for Europa Oil and Gas, which said it hopes to extract about 1.5 trillion ft3 of gas. He gave the company the licence to do so. In the same week he also informed me that he will not allow the climate emergency measures to proceed on Committee Stage for fear it would cause existing offshore licence holders to take legal action against the State such as Providence and Europa Oil and Gas. Does the Taoiseach accept the science that argues we must leave the vast bulk of fossil fuels in the ground to deal with this catastrophic scenario facing us, and that the real failure of COP was to reduce the limit of 1.50C?

I wonder did he raise the point that the single biggest institutional emitter of CO2 emissions in the world is the United States military.

I find it amazing that the Deputy would even joke about something as serious as that. Did the Taoiseach ask for that? How does he tally his commitment to increase military expenditure and the EU's commitment to increase military expenditure when there is a direct relationship between the size of military activity, armies and so on and the level of CO2 emissions and climate damage?

It is just not true. The problem is seen if we look at the Taoiseach's speech in Egypt: fine words, and then he comes home and it is business as usual. I will give one example. The Minister with responsibility for local government has overturned the democratic decision of South Dublin County Council to ban new data centres for the duration of the next county development plan. It is a motion that was proposed by People Before Profit Councillor Madeleine Johansson and passed back in June. South Dublin is the data centre hub of Ireland and about half of all of the data centres in Ireland are there. We know that data centres in total are using 17% of our electricity now, more than all of the rural homes put together. To add insult to injury, the Government did not exempt data centres from the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, so we are going to be paying these data centres, which are consuming an inordinate amount of electricity, up to €30,000 a year, subsidising some of the biggest and richest corporations in the world. Does the Taoiseach not agree we need a moratorium? Will he not overturn the decision of his Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and reinstate the ban?

I welcome this. However, it was disappointing to see the lack of a commitment to cutting emissions faster and, once again, there was no agreement to reduce or even phase out the global use of fossil fuels despite the huge focus on the concept of a non-proliferation treaty for fossil fuels which had been so well flagged in advance of the COP27 meeting. The loss and damage fund is welcome and it promises financial aid from developed countries, but we have no sense yet of what level of money is involved. The question of who pays will not be agreed until next year and that is the critical issue. What extra money will Ireland be committing to the loss and damage fund? What proceeds will we use for this? Will the Taoiseach be seeking agreement at EU level for member states to lead on this internationally, as the EU led on the concept of a loss and damage fund? Closer to home, can the Taoiseach confirm when our own climate action plan will be published and will we have time to debate it in this Dáil?

Alok Sharma, the president of COP26, said with regard to COP27:Emissions peaking before 2025, as the science tells us is necessary. Not in this text. Clear follow-through on the phase down of coal. Not in this text. A commitment to phase out all fossil fuels. Not in this text. And the energy text, weakened in the final minutes.Of course, that is hypocrisy. His government signed up to the text. COP27 was a sure sign that the corporations that rule and rob the world and the governments that act as their puppets are part of the problem, not part of the solution. If the Taoiseach says any different, he can tell me this: why did the EU governments, fronted by a delegation led by the Minister, Deputy Ryan, sign up to this text? It is completely inadequate, so why did they sign up to it? Why did the Irish Government sign up to this text? Is that really the best it can do?

It is a very good retrofit programme and there has been a 130% increase in applications. It is about getting energy efficiency into our entire system. Its fundamental priority is energy efficiency and reducing energy waste. There are some very good schemes that are targeted especially at those on low incomes. There is an independent local government retrofit scheme for local authority housing and there is the Better Homes programme, which is for people on low incomes more generally, and that has expanded. There is the 80% grant for insulation, which is more general and is more for the first phase. There is also deeper retrofit. The issue is really about getting capacity up in the industry. It is very important that we give that certainty to the industry over the next ten years in terms of getting all the skillsets in place and all of the capacity to get moving. A lot of work is being done. It is not about prioritising the wealthy. That is an outrageous assertion that is made. This is about prioritising energy efficiency and getting a well-balanced scheme that does that. Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan raised the issue of our targets. I take his point in respect of the need to really get going at speed. That is why the new planning Act is endeavouring to try to streamline, codify and consolidate all of the planning Acts over the last number of decades and to have a more streamlined approach. The new Maritime Area Regulatory Authority Act is also coming in and between it, an Bord Pleanála, the local authorities and the courts, there should be a much clearer and more transparent system, with timelines in place for people who put in applications so they can expect outcomes within a specified timeframe. That is very important. With regard to wind, we need to move faster than we are moving. I will check about the foreshore licences. I was informed by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine that things had improved in that regard. I look forward to engaging with Deputy O'Sullivan and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on that issue because we need to move on it. Again, the European Commission is looking at a particular clause whereby it would be in the overall public interest to move forward on offshore wind and that would transcend other interests in terms of getting wind farms built. At the moment, it can take eight years from concept to the actual construction of a wind farm across Europe. That is not good enough, given the existential crisis that climate change represents. Deputy Bríd Smith raised the issue of loss and damage. I make a general point. Ireland is not responsible for the world.

There are legal constraints on the Government in terms of existing licence holders. This Oireachtas decided to ban, or recommended the banning of, the issuing of any future licences.

However, in terms of existing licences holders, of which there are just a few – one or two to the best of my knowledge – and in particular the case of Europa, the Department officials, independently of the Minister, examined that within the legal framework and we have to obey the law.We cannot break the law.

I get constantly interrupted as well, which is fair enough. I do not have an issue with it. Deputy Bacik referred to climate finance. Our commitment is €225 million by 2025 on a permanent basis. Within that, we allocated €10 million to the global shield. What are now required are concrete proposals and initiatives around climate finance that we can support. Our embassies, particularly those in Africa, are working bilaterally with governments and NGOs to see how best we can apply that money to climate finance issues. There is a need for integration across other files as well. We cannot deal with it in silos. It is difficult. The World Food Programme made the point that there is too much silo thinking across the entire aid programme now. We need more crop resilience and we need to invest more in all that. It is kind of part of climate finance. The food production systems are failing in many countries because of climate change. The question is to be answered is how we can make their food production system more resilient. That is where some of our climate finance could usefully be applied and allocated. We need to work with NGOs and like-minded governments across Europe because the European Union remains the biggest donor in this respect. It is probably the most constructive contributor to COP more generally, along with others. Deputy Barry again referenced Alok Sharma, the lead for COP26 in Glasgow last year, who did a fantastic job in what he achieved there. I do not believe his point in respect of corporations is correct. He referred to politicians acting as their puppets. I often wonder whether we have some useful puppets here for other jurisdictions, but that is another day's work because-----

As I set out in my statement to the House on 16 November, I attended a meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 20 and 21 October. Issues discussed included developments in Russia's war on Ukraine and its wider impacts, supply and price challenges on energy, economic issues, and a number of external relations issues, including preparation of COP27 and the upcoming summit between the EU and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN.  On energy, we agreed steps to take forward work to tackle the price and supply crises urgently, including improving the functioning and stability of energy markets, addressing spikes in prices, saving energy and accelerating deployment of renewables. Given the extent to which the issue is having a negative impact on citizens and enterprises, it is important that the European Union and its member states continue to work collectively to create stability in the market. We also discussed the latest developments in Russia's war on Ukraine, including its impact both in Ukraine and further afield. We condemned indiscriminate Russian missile and drone attacks on civilians and infrastructure, including the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, as well as the illegal annexation by Russia of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. The EU will never recognise these illegal annexations. We stated our intention to continue to provide political, financial and other supports to Ukraine for as long as it takes, and reaffirmed our commitment to hold Russia to account for its war crimes. The European Council condemned actions by Iran in support of Russia's war and we welcomed sanctions adopted on 20 October 2022 in this regard. We also called on the Belarusian authorities to stop enabling the Russian war of aggression by permitting Russian armed forces to use Belarussian territory. Through its tactic of weaponising food in its war against Ukraine, Russia is responsible for the global food security crisis. To counter this, the EU-Ukraine solidarity lanes have made the export of Ukrainian crops, agricultural products and fertilisers possible. Leaders expressed support for the call by the United Nations Secretary-General for the extension of the UN Black Sea grain initiative. On Iran, we condemned the unacceptable use of force by Iranian authorities against peaceful protestors, in particular against women. Women in Iran are being denied their civil and political rights. The meeting also held a strategic discussion on the EU's relationship with China, which is an important and complex one. We looked ahead to the EU-ASEAN summit taking place on 14 December 2022, which will be an opportunity to deepen our regional partnership in south-east Asia, and to COP27 on climate change, which I attended earlier this month, and COP15 on biodiversity, upcoming in Montreal in December.

Capping renewables at €120 per MWh is welcome but when we consider that the average wholesale price of electricity in August was €388 - it has gone down to €137 per MWh for October - we see how artificially high prices have been for such a long time. The question is: why have people not seen the reduction reflected in their bills? I first raised the need for this action last November when households and businesses were facing into a winter where energy prices were very high. I am glad the EU and the Government have seen reason but it should never have taken this long. When will the measure come into effect? Can the Taoiseach commit to keeping it in place for as long as gas prices remain high?The capping of the price of non-gas electricity, on which huge profits have already been made this year, is a step in the right direction. Will the Government also bring forward a windfall tax on the excess profits electricity companies made in 2022?

As it turned out, the EU played a crucial role at COP27. The Taoiseach addressed the conference on 8 November and outlined Ireland's position, which highlighted the importance of climate justice. As we know, COP27 has now concluded with a final agreement reached after prolonged negotiations. The agreement includes texts that finally recognise loss and damage caused by climate change. This is a breakthrough, although much work remains to be done in implementing the goal of setting up funding provisions. However, the final agreement, as we heard, contains nothing new as regards emissions targets or the phasing out of fossil fuels. The Taoiseach has already answered many questions on COP27 but does he agree that this latter point is disappointing? How does he view the outcome of COP27 generally? Does he agree that the EU Green Deal should continue to be central to our approach to these issues and that the block should be a leader globally in tackling them?

I did not see the Taoiseach there. We are consistent. He is right when he says we are against illegal annexations in eastern Ukraine by Russia. Nobody should facilitate such things; he is right. Next Tuesday, 29 November, is UN day of solidarity with the Palestinian people. Every single year, the UN General Assembly reaffirms its commitment to the Palestinian right to return of approximately 7 million to 8 million Palestinian refugees who are denied that right by the apartheid state of Israel. What sanctions will the Government take against Israel, or propose to the UN or the European Union, over their continued support to Israel, when it commits crimes against humanity against the Palestinian people and denies the vindication of their right to return under UN resolution?

He and Fine Gael claim this is in response to Putin's disgusting invasion of Ukraine. The truth is that Fine Gael has been pushing for this for decades. In 2003, it produced a policy document, Beyond Neutrality, that supported moving towards participation in a common EU defence policy and abandoning the triple lock, which it described as a political straitjacket. Fine Gael has been trying to erode what is left of neutrality for decades and is opportunistically using Putin's invasion of Ukraine to do so. In fairness, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has at least stated that his position is the triple lock should remain. What is the Taoiseach's position? He did not answer the earlier question. He made a vague reference to the UN General Assembly but it is the UN Security Council that agrees on the deployment of peacekeeping missions. Does he support the retention of the triple lock or not? If he does not, will he at least give us a referendum on it?

A little desperation is beginning to creep in. As we know, Putin is on the defensive against Ukrainian advances, in addition to the home front, which is an issue that is underreported. In recent weeks, many ordinary Russians have defied conscription, relatives of conscripts have held protests in at least six cities, some troops have refused to leave barracks and some soldiers have fragged, or killed, their officers. In these circumstances, the role of NATO is counterproductive. The larger the NATO shadow looms, the more Putin can point to foreign threat in an attempt to rally the population and cut across the anti-war revolt. Will the Taoiseach agree that this State needs to keep real distance from NATO and that this State has made a mistake under his leadership in being represented at NATO's Ukraine defence contact group over these last six months?

It is designed to make sure there will be no windfall profits arising out of the increased prices that have occurred. The Government has adopted the correct overall policy in respect of the cost-of-living package in that we did not go for what was proposed by the Deputy's party, namely, a cap to pre-2021 levels. We saw what happened in the United Kingdom fiscally and from a market point of view when that proposal was implemented by the UK Government; it had fairly devastating consequences for the UK economy. That is why the Irish Government did not go down that route in respect of the measures we took. On the issue of the wider windfall tax, that will come later as part of the European measures. The broader European measures will fall due to be completed but the EU energy market is very complex. We import most of our gas from the UK and Norway supplies the UK. It is not a uniform gas market but we welcome the decisions taken to try to decouple gas from electricity price increases. Deputy Haughey raised the issue of climate justice and COP27 generally. One of the key takeaways from COP has been the fact that climate change is now here in terms of worldwide devastation. The presentation by the Prime Minister of Pakistan was one of two events I attended. One third of all crops or arable land has been destroyed by floods in that country. Significant levels of disease are coming from stagnant water throughout Pakistan and hundreds of thousands of pregnant women, just over 600,000, are without homes and shelter. There is huge economic damage amounting to €30 billion in reconstruction costs. The presentations by Somalia, Sri Lanka and all the small island states of the Pacific indicated they are facing real danger. If there is some message for this country, it is that we have to do more on adaptation. We also have to do more, not just to get emissions down, but to prepare for coastal erosion. We have to prepare a whole range of measures to deal with that.

That is rarely said. I dealt with the issue of the triple lock. It is not in the programme for Government to remove the triple lock. I do not believe in removing it. I believe we should have a citizens' assembly to discuss all these issues in a more informed way, which I have said. I understand the rationale put forward by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in light of the Russian invasion and Russia's behaviour. It is now a problem that Russia is such a significant member of the Security Council. That the likes of Russia can veto any Security Council proposal, such as the one Ireland put forward on climate and security, is very retrograde. There is a problem there. We cannot put our heads on the sand.

Tírghráthóir le tiomantas agus paisean dá thír a bhí ann. Polaiteoir den chéad scoth ab ea é a thuig daoine timpeall air go rí-mhaith. Bhí sé uathúil, macánta agus ceannródaíoch ina smaointe. Fear gnó éifeachtach agus rathúil a bhí ann a thuig gnó ag leibhéal idirnáisiúnta agus mar ollamh acadúil ollscoile thug sé treoir iontach agus spreagadh dá mhic léinn. It is an honour for me as Taoiseach to have the chance to reflect on the life of our late colleague Brian Hillery. Brian passed away surrounded by his family on 19 January 2021. When The Irish Times published his obituary, it did so under the headline "One of the great gentlemen of Irish politics". It was a brilliantly accurate description of the man. His particular mix of personal qualities brought him successful careers in academia, business and politics. Brian and I were both elected to the Dáil for the first time in 1989 and were good friends. We were from different generations but we enjoyed our friendship nonetheless. By the time he was elected, he had already had more than a decade of national political experience as a Senator, had secured an MBA in the US, a PhD from UCD and had served as the first Professor of Industrial Relations at UCD and a visiting Professor at the University of California, Berkeley, to name a few of his achievements. However, he carried all of this very lightly and was always a very charming, warm and engaging colleague. During some turbulent times within the party, Brian was always a rock of sense. Never allowing the political battles to injure personal relationships, he was always someone who could see and understand the bigger picture. As a result, he was in much demand. Appointed to the Seanad by the then Taoiseach Albert Reynolds in 1992, he left politics in 1994 to become a director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London. A series of important directorships and chairman roles followed that, including the Central Bank of Ireland, the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission and Independent News and Media. He was, in short, a very accomplished man but he was also, first and foremost, a committed family man. He was born and raised in County Clare and it was there that he first met Miriam. They married in 1970 and throughout their life together, she was his closest and most trusted adviser. They were true partners. They had five children together: daughter Cliona and sons Conor, Eugene, Brian and Gavin. I know that each of them are very proud of their father's successes but also and probably more importantly, I know they are proud of the enormous and genuine respect and affection that he inspired in everyone he worked with. Miriam, Cliona, Conor, Eugene, Brian and Gavin - your husband and father was indeed a great gentleman. I feel lucky to have known and worked with him and so do we all. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

I will not attempt to name everybody. Professor Brian Hillery made a significant contribution to public life in Ireland. He did so not only in politics but also in the spheres of economics, business and academia. Following his passing in January 2021, President Higgins paid tribute to Professor Hillery saying, "those who served with him in the Oireachtas will remember Brian as always courteous, and as a warm and intelligent man." Indeed the common threads woven through Professor Hillery's life are the threads of integrity, thoughtfulness and a natural courtesy to people. He matched high achievement with admirable personal qualities that were recognised and appreciated by those of all political persuasions. A native of Miltown Malbay in County Clare, Professor Hillery was born into a household of strong Fianna Fáil tradition. His cousin Patrick served as President of Ireland from 1976 until 1990. Brian Hillery excelled as an academic graduating from UCD with a Bachelor of Commerce and later achieving an MA at the University of Georgia before returning to complete a doctorate in UCD. He would later be appointed to the staff at UCD where he went on to become the university's first professor of industrial relations. Following the general election of 1977, he was elected as a Fianna Fáil Senator to the Seanad on the Administrative Panel. He went to serve two subsequent terms in the Seanad as well as winning a seat in the Dáil in the constituency of Dún Laoghaire at the 1987 general election. Professor Hillery was also known for his principled opposition to the leadership of Charles Haughey. However, his fair, polite and civil nature and indeed his desire to be a calming influence saw him navigate well the choppy waters of internal party strife. Despite his genuine sympathy for Des O'Malley following his expulsion from the party, Professor Hillery chose to stay within the ranks of Fianna Fáil rather than join Mr. O'Malley in the Progressive Democrats. It is a testament to his integrity and honour and his standing amongst his party colleagues that he did so while maintaining his position on the leadership. Outside the world of politics, Professor Hillery made notable contributions in the areas of administration, finance and economic and industrial relations. He played a key role in trying to broker resolutions to significant industrial disputes during the 1970s where he was remembered for adopting a conciliatory, calm and pragmatic approach. Professor Hillery also held several successful roles and positions in the private sector, including in the areas of media, finance and banking. Following his departure from national politics, Professor Hillery was appointed as an executive director of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 1994 and served until 1997. In a rapidly changing world, it was a role he took very seriously and one in which he commanded sincere respect for his diligent work. He also served on a number of bodies advising the Government in the areas of public sector pay, pensions and education and he later became a director of the Central Bank and of the Financial Regulator. Those who knew Professor Hillery well repeatedly cite their admiration for his warmth, his decency, his intellect and the importance he placed on serving the public interest. It is right that the Dáil recognises his work, his achievements and his life. I express my sincere condolences on behalf of Sinn Féin to his wife Miriam and to his children Cliona, Conor, Eugene, Brian and Gavin; to his extended family and wide circle of friends; to his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party; and to all those who loved him. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

My sympathies and those of my Labour Party colleagues are with the family of former TD and Senator Brian Hillery, who died in January 2021.From conversations with a Fianna Fáil Member of this House, I know that the news of his death brought much sadness to all those who knew him during his long years of public service. Professor Hillery began his political career in the Seanad. He served there for many years until he contested and won a seat in the Dún Laoghaire constituency. It is clear that those who served with Professor Hillery in the Oireachtas remember him as a courteous and intelligent man. I understand that Eamon Gilmore, former Deputy and Labour Party leader, was elected to Dáil Éireann for the Dún Laoghaire constituency for the first time on the same day as Professor Hillery in the 1989 general election. In his words of commemoration, he described the late Professor Hillery as a gentleman. Accounts I have heard from those who knew him personally demonstrate this was an accurate descriptor. As well as serving as a Senator and Deputy, Professor Hillery was successful in several other fields. As an academic, he was the first professor of industrial relations at UCD. He also served as Ireland's representative on the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, EBRD, as a director of the Central Bank of Ireland and as a financial regulator. It was a career filled with accomplishments. He will be missed very much by family, friends and former colleagues alike. I note that his death occurred during a challenging time for the State, as grieving families were asked to continue to comply with Covid-19 restrictions and to cope with their bereavement in a very different way. Following the opening of society last year, I hope that members of Professor Hillery's family have been able to mark his impressive life in a way that helps them to heal. I further hope that the many testimonies to his kind personal qualities and his career achievements will have been of comfort to them. I send the Labour Party's condolences to Professor Hillery's wife, Miriam, and his children, Cliona, Conor, Eugene, Brian and Gavin, and his wider family. To his grandchildren who are here listening to these statements, I hope they will never forget this day when they were in Leinster House and Dáil Éireann listening to Members of the Oireachtas speaking so kindly and warmly about their grandfather. He served this country to the best of his abilities and that is a great testament to him and to his family.

Ba mhaith liom mo chomhbhrón a ghabháil freisin ar mo shon agus sr son Aontú agus an Ghrúpa Réigiúnaigh do chlann agus do chairde Brian Hillery. Ba chailliúint ollmhór é agus don chlann, go háirithe. I express my deepest sympathies, and those of my party and of the Regional Group to the family of Brian Hillery. People who knew him personally knew him as a gentleman. A gentleman recognised by all sides in this Chamber is an unusual thing. It is also important to state that Professor Hillery excelled in all aspects of his life, especially academically as a young man. He served as the first professor of industrial relations at UCD, as well as a Deputy and a Senator in these Houses. His expertise in industrial relations and as an academic guided him through his career. He proved to be a rock of sense and knowledge in the Seanad and Dáil. Despite significant internal party political pressures in Fianna Fáil, Professor Hillery stood up for what he believed in. This too is an outstanding mark of his credibility as an elected representative. He worked with multiple public bodies, including the EBRD and as a director of the Central Bank, in a lifetime of national service. Such a variety of high-level roles and the ability to deal with so many areas shows a very impressive intellect. We have heard from the many friends of Professor Hillery in politics and other fields. They have reflected on the calm and stable voice that he was in those tumultuous times in politics. They showed him as a kind and decent man who served his constituency well. Professor Hillery leaves an impressive legacy for his former party, his constituents and the country, but most of all for his family. When we lose a loved one to whom we are very close, we are left with the memories we have and the legacy left for us as we live our own lives. I extend our deepest sympathies to all the members of Professor Hillery's family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

Those who served with him in the Oireachtas have remarked on how he was always extremely courteous and a warm and intelligent man. Those who spoke of his legacy after his passing referred as fondly to his personal qualities as much as his achievements. He served as a Senator from 1977 to 1982, 1983 to 1989 and 1992 to 1994. He was also a Deputy for the constituency of Dún Laoghaire from 1989 to 1992. In signalling his strength of character, Professor Hillery opposed Charles Haughey during the three tempestuous heaves in the early 1980s, despite considerable pressure from constituency members to back the leader. Fianna Fáil was riven by dissension at the time and tempers were frequently frayed. Professor Hillery, however, managed to remain on good terms with the different strands of the party, while refusing to budge on his view that Charles Haughey should go. Outside the Seanad Chamber, Professor Hillery's skills were in great demand, whether this involved helping to bring about peace at the height of the industrial conflict in the ESB the 1970s, bringing about agreement on Army pay in the 1990s or dealing with hostilities between the largest shareholders in Independent News and Media, INM, in the 2000s. His calm and steady approach was vital in resolving seemingly intractable disputes. After a career in politics, he was appointed as the representative of Ireland and Denmark on the board of the EBRD in London from 1994 to 1997. He was subsequently appointed chairman of INM and of Providence Resources. He is survived by his wife, Miriam, daughter, Cliona, and sons Conor, Eugene, Brian and Gavin. On my behalf, and that of my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group, I offer our heartfelt sympathies to them all today.

The late Professor Brian Hillery served, as the Ceann Comhairle pointed out, as a Deputy for the constituency of Dún Laoghaire between 1989 and 1992. It is wonderful to have so many of the Hillery family with us today. This is the 85th anniversary of Professor Hillery's birth. Brian James Hillery was born on 22 November 1937 at the family home in Miltown Malbay, County Clare, to a strong Fianna Fáil family. He attended school locally before going to St. Flannan’s College in Ennis for his secondary education. He then took a bachelor of commerce degree from UCD. After graduation he worked with the Agricultural Credit Corporation, ACC, in Dublin, before winning a Rotary scholarship to the University of Georgia in 1965, where he earned his master of business administration, MBA. A distinguished academic, he joined the faculty in UCD in 1967, where he became the first professor of industrial relations in 1974. He was called upon several times during that time to help mediate several disputes, of which there were many. Widely published, he was visiting professor in industrial relations at the University of California, Berkeley, in spring 1977 and also a guest lecturer at the University of Warwick and the Wharton School. Professor Hillery married Miriam Davy in 1970. She is the daughter of the distinguished Irish rugby player, Eugene Davy. Together, Brian and Miriam had five children, Conor, Eugene, Cliona, Brian Patrick and Gavin. I welcome them, along with his sister, Joan, his brother, Tommy, and all the extended Hillery family, to the Distinguished Visitors Gallery. Brian and Miriam celebrated their golden 50th wedding anniversary on 18 July 2020. As the Taoiseach said, Miriam was a determined supporter and adviser to Brian who travelled the country with him and ensured his election to the Seanad in 1977 and 1983. With her support, he was elected to Dáil Éireann in 1987 to represent the Dún Laoghaire constituency, alongside former Deputy and Minister, David Andrews, in an exceptionally competitive and exciting campaign with former councillor and cathaoirleach of the county, Betty Coffey, which members still recall 35 years later. That tells us how exciting that was. Professor Hillery was appointed by the Taoiseach to the Seanad in 1993, where he served until 1994 when he stepped down as a Senator to take up an appointment as executive director of the EBRD, representing Ireland and Denmark until 1997.In later years he had a distinguished business career, serving as a director of many public and private entities while continuing his long history of public service as a director of the Central Bank and financial service regulator as well as chairman of the Independent News and Media, in which role, it has to be said, his mediation skills were called upon yet again. Speaking to colleagues who served with Brian here in the Oireachtas, they always remember him as a warm, intelligent and courteous parliamentarian, great company and a man who made a distinguished contribution in his life. On behalf of all the members of Fianna Fáil in Dún Laoghaire, I extend our deepest sympathy to the Hillery family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.

I did not have the pleasure of serving with Professor Hillery but I knew him by reputation, and because my family has through my wife very strong connections with Miltown Malbay, I knew him through family connections. It was always a pleasure to meet him on his frequent visits here to Leinster House over the years. It will have to be said, as encapsulated in the remarks of other Members, that he is someone the breadth and depth of whose service to this country can meet few parallels. Those of us who knew him were fortunate to know him. Those of us who enjoyed the benefits of his endeavours are fortunate to have had him working on our behalf.

As Deputies will be aware, the purpose of the Social Welfare Bill is to give legislative effect to the changes announced on budget day. Budget 2023 was framed in uncertain times. As the world emerged from the public health crisis caused by Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and the ensuing geopolitical instability has meant that inflation in this country is at its highest rate in a generation. The cost of living is rising and it is more expensive to do the weekly shop, fuel one's car, pay one's bills and make ends meet. That is why the Government compiled a budget that puts money back in people's pockets. Whether one is a pensioner, a carer, a person with a disability, a lone parent or a working family, the measures in this budget were designed to reach the people who need it most. This year's budget represents the largest social welfare budget package in the history of the State. It is important to point out that many of the social protection measures announced on budget day do not require primary legislation and, therefore, are not reflected in this Bill. These include the unprecedented eight lump-sum payments which we are providing at a cost of €1.2 billion to assist people with the cost-of-living pressures they are now facing. Deputies will appreciate that traditionally measures announced in the budget relating to social welfare normally take effect the following January at the earliest. That is not the case with these eight lump-sum payments. My Department has, just as it did during the pandemic, acted swiftly to ensure that people receive these payments now over the winter months when they need the support most. I am pleased to inform the House that six of the lump-sum cost-of-living payments have already been paid. These are the autumn double payment; the €500 disability support grant paid to all people receiving a long-term disability payment; the €200 lump-sum payment to people receiving the living alone allowance; the €400 lump-sum payment to all households in receipt of fuel allowance; the €500 lump-sum working family payment; and the double child benefit payment. The latter two payments are vital measures to support hard-working families. The seventh lump-sum payment, which is the special €500 carer's support grant, will be paid to over 114,500 carers on Thursday next in recognition of the vital work our carers do and the pressure they are under. The final lump-sum payment, the Christmas bonus, will be paid out in early December and will support our pensioners, carers, people with disabilities, lone parents and other vulnerable groups. Other measures announced by the Government on budget day but which do not require primary legislation in the Social Welfare Bill include the extension of access to the JobsPlus scheme to marginalised groups to support them into the workforce; enhancements to the reasonable accommodation fund to assist people with disabilities into to work; and the increase in the weekly earnings disregard for disability allowance and blind pension from €140 to €165. On budget day, I announced my intention to introduce a new over-70s fuel allowance scheme. Under the new scheme, a single person over the age of 70 can have income of €500 per week and a couple can have income of €1,000 per week and still qualify for fuel allowance. Deputies will appreciate that the immediate priority for my Department following the budget was to ensure we issued the eight lump-sum payments as quickly as possible. My next priority is to open the over-70s fuel allowance scheme for applications. Work is advancing well on developing the necessary IT systems and it is my intention to open the scheme for applications in December. As Minister, I recognise the contribution that pensioners have made to this country. After working all their lives, they have put in their shift. I do not want to see any senior citizen afraid to turn on the heat. I am pleased to pioneer the new over-70s fuel allowance scheme. This is not a once-off measure. It is a permanent change for the better to support our old people. I am pleased to have the opportunity to update the House this evening on these budget measures which are designed to support our most vulnerable. I will now turn to the Social Welfare Bill itself, by section. Section 1 provides for definitions of the relevant Acts. Section 2 is a measure to preserve the craft of making and fixing musical instruments of cultural significance to the Irish nation. The low number of uilleann pipe and harp makers in the State suggests that Government intervention is warranted to support these crafters. It provides that the first €20,000 of relevant profits for those who are wholly or mainly engaged in the production, repair or maintenance of harps and uilleann pipes will be exempt from income tax but continue to make PRSI contributions so that their pension and social insurance based benefits can continue to build up.  I am sure all Members of the House will agree that participants in community employment, CE, schemes do very valuable work in our local areas, whether it is meals on wheels, the upkeep of amenities or other vital local services. At a time of full employment, I know some CE schemes have struggled to find participants. Therefore, I am pleased that section 3 extends eligibility for participation on CE schemes to adult dependants, that is spouses, civil partners or cohabitants, of jobseeker's allowance recipients. This is a pilot project and, if it works well, I will look to extend it to other groups of people in the future. The weekly earnings of an employee determine the PRSI rate of employer contributions paid on behalf of that employee. Currently, employer PRSI is charged at a rate of 8.8% on weekly earnings between €38 and €410. Weekly earnings in excess of €410 attract employer PRSI at a higher rate of 11.05%. The earnings threshold increase from €410 to €441 in section 4 is designed to take account of the forthcoming increase in the minimum wage from €10.50 to €11.30 per hour. Employers with employees benefiting from the increase in the national minimum wage will continue to attract the lower rate of employer PRSI. It is intended that this section will come into operation on the same day as the national minimum wage increase, that is, new year's day 2023. This measure should continue to stimulate employment especially in the services sector. Section 5 provides for a €12 increase in the weekly rate of maternity benefit from €250 to €262 from 2 January next. Sections 6, 7 and 8 provide for the equivalent increases in relation to adoptive benefit, paternity benefit and parent's benefit, respectively. Section 9 gives effect to the increases in the graduated rates of jobseeker's benefit and jobseeker's benefit for the self-employed. The working family payment, formerly known as family income supplement, gives extra financial support to families with children on low pay. Section 10 provides for a €40 increase in the weekly income thresholds of working family payment for all family sizes. Of course, recipients of working family payment received a cost-of-living lump sum of €500 last week. This benefited 44,000 families, many of whom are lone parents. Partial capacity benefit is a very worthwhile scheme and I encourage Members to make their constituents aware of it. Partial capacity benefit is a scheme which allows people who have been in receipt of illness benefit for a minimum of six months, or invalidity pension, to return to employment or self-employment and continue to receive a payment from the Department if capacity for work continues to be reduced by their medical condition. The purpose of this section is to provide, like other PRSl-based benefit schemes, for an application window for claims. To encourage people with an illness or disability back to employment, it is a generous application period, from up to 13 weeks prior to commencement of employment through to three weeks after commencement of employment. However, similar to other social protection schemes, a deciding officer may relax these already generous time limits in exceptional circumstances. Section 12 provides for the long awaited ex gratia scheme for CE scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors. Deputies are aware that last December, CE supervisors and assistant supervisors voted to accept the terms of a settlement negotiated between unions and the Department of Social Protection on the ex gratia scheme. Section 13 provides for increases in the rates of social insurance payments. I am very pleased to say that there will be a €12 per week increase in the maximum personal rate of all PRSl-based benefits. The purpose of section 14 is to provide for an increase in the disregard in income from agri-environmental schemes applicable to farm assist, jobseeker's allowance and the non-contributory State pension. These schemes, for example the agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, will now attract a disregard of €5,000 from the new year. This provision supports Ireland's climate action agenda by removing a potential barrier for low-income farmers to participate in these agri-environmental schemes. Section 15 and Schedule 2 provide for increases in social assistance, or in other words, means-tested payments. They also provide for increases to qualified adults and to qualified children where relevant. Domiciliary care allowance is a payment in recognition of the additional burden involved in caring for children with a severe disability. It is not means tested. Section 16 provides for an increase in the rate of payment from €309.50 to €330. I am pleased to be the first Minister since 2009 to increase this payment. I am doing so in recognition of the significant and difficult role that family carers perform in Irish society. Domiciliary care allowance recipients will also receive the €500 carer's support grant this week. I might also take this opportunity to inform the House that regulations are being drafted which will allow a parent or guardian to receive domiciliary care allowance if the child remains in the care of the hospital after birth if the other conditions of the scheme are met. This measure, which I announced on budget day, is under the radar of many people but I know it is vital for the families it affects who find themselves in these very difficult circumstances. Section 17 exempts the ex gratia payment for CE supervisors and assistant supervisors from income tax. Section 18 is the Short Title of the Act. I believe this is a fair and balanced Social Welfare Bill. It will provide extra help to those who need it most and strengthen the social safety net. I commend the Bill to the House and I look forward to hearing Deputies' contributions. I might just add that last year during the debate on the Social Welfare Bill, the issue was raised of half-rate carer's payments and disablement benefit excluding people from fuel allowance. I do listen and I am pleased to say that both payments will be disregarded in the means test for fuel allowance from the new year.

It is absolutely essential given that it implements everything announced on budget day. As always, I welcome every increase to every payment and every move that is positive in the Bill. In my contribution I want to raise a number of issues. Some of these I have been raising for some time and there are others on which I hope the Minister might be able to give us some clarity. An issue I have raised many times is the additional needs payment. I have been unable to get a reply from the Department on the current processing times for additional needs payments. At this point I have followed up directly with the office three times and I cannot get the processing times. What I really want to know is how long it is taking today for the payments to be processed. They are supposed to be emergency payments. The most recent details I have are from September when 95% of applications were being processed within five to eight weeks. This is far too long. In this context, it would be appropriate if the Minister could give us an update on the additional 80 staff she recently said would be taken on. I would also like an update on the progress being made with putting this payment online to make it easier for some people who would find it easier to apply online. This option is important. It is something I raised prior to the summer recess. I understand work is under way. We really need to see movement on this. Community welfare officers, CWOs, are no longer in our communities. People cannot walk in the door the way they used to be able to. In my home town of Ballaghaderreen, the CWO worked out of the health centre. The family resource centre has raised this issue with me, particularly now when we have a lot of new communities. It used the example of somebody in a domestic violence situation who does not have ten or 15 minutes to be on the phone chatting to someone to explain the situation. When they went to the shop, they could pop into the health centre and see the CWO. This option is no longer available. This is very concerning. I ask the Minister to look at it. The social welfare rates are still not being set against anything that is evidence-based, primarily the minimum essential standard of living that the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice brings forward every year. Repeatedly every year the organisations on the coalface raise adequacy and the minimum essential standard of living with regard to social welfare rates. Will the Minister look at this? I know this cannot be done overnight. I know it will cost an awful lot of money but as access to health and childcare improve, the minimum essential standard of living will reduce. This will mean payments do not keep having to increase. I would like to see evidence-based social welfare rates when increases are announced. That way those who need it most will be targeted, and it will reduce poverty. If we do not have a social protection system that, at its core, protects people from poverty, it is a system that is not good enough. Far too many social welfare rates are set well below the poverty line. Unfortunately, Central Statistics Office, CSO, data are always behind so the latest data are for 2021. The rates of people out of work due to illness - under which category those with a disability are typically included - who are in consistent poverty and at risk of poverty and deprivation have increased across the board. Deprivation levels among lone-parent families are at 44.9%. Almost half of lone-parent families in the State are living in deprivation. What that means for households and children should be raising alarm bells for all of us. Lone-parent organisations, with which I engage a lot, were disappointed with the budget in that there was nothing specific for them, aside from the lump-sum payments, which they and I welcomed. Going forward, we must look at the one-parent family payment and consider moves we can make to reduce the poverty rate, which is consistent and far too high, deprivation and the risk of poverty for lone-parent families. Energy poverty is growing and is hugely concerning for everyone. We need an energy poverty strategy. The previous strategy was allowed to lapse in 2019 we have seen nothing since. Action needs to be taken in that regard. Changes were made to the fuel allowance for older people, which is important. It will make a significant difference for many older households and is most welcome. The Minister could have linked the working family payment to the fuel allowance, given that they are provided to low-income households. This should be looked at again. I ask the Minister to provide an update on the cost-of-disability research and the strawman proposal. Many issues have been identified in respect of long-term disability payments, including the blind pension, invalidity pension and disability allowance. I understand a review of those payments is under way as part of this process, and that is welcome. We need to see action on that as quickly as possible. I refer to the means of family carers and access to carer's allowance. There needs to be a comprehensive and detailed review of the carer's allowance. Three family carers came before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection, Community and Rural Development and the Islands recently, none of whom, bar one, were receiving carer's allowance because the husband or wife was working and their means were over the threshold, yet they were providing 24-7 care for children. We must look at this. When care is being provided on such a basis, they should be able to access some kind of support. That care should be recognised across the board. I welcome the Report of the Child Maintenance Review Group that was published last week. It recommended several important policy changes that will require legislation. Lone-parent organisations and I have raised these issues many times. I wish to focus on the first two recommendations on the removal of child maintenance as household means in social welfare supports, which could be included in the Bill. Lone parents have waited long enough. Child maintenance should never be treated as household income. It should always be treated as income for the rearing of a child or children. The review group was strong in its recommendations on that. In addition, lone parents are obliged to prove, typically through the courts, that they have sought maintenance in order to receive the few lone-parent supports available. The review group was strong in recommending that this needs to be removed. We have raised this many times in this House. I know the Minister is looking to introduce legislation on these issues next year, which is very important. Is this happening and can we have a timeline on that? I also ask that there be consultation with lone-parent organisations ahead of that legislation. When we are making these changes, at long last, it is so important that we get them right. That consultation is most important. I was disappointed the review group did not make a full recommendation on the establishment of a child maintenance service or agency. However, given all the work the group did - they did a lot for which I give huge credit - the majority of the group determined that a child maintenance service should be established and that child maintenance needs to be taken out of the remit of the courts. The Minister should consider this in light of the report. To conclude, I want to mention a couple of other issues I have raised throughout the year. I refer to Tracy McGinnis, who lost her son, Brendan Bjorn, earlier this year. I tabled an amendment, at that time, on disability allowance for young adults. Rather than the allowance ceasing immediately when a young adult passes away, it should continue for some time afterwards, as is the case with domiciliary care allowance, DCA. In July, the Minister said that officials were looking at this. I would appreciate an update in this regard. Disability allowance should be aligned with DCA in the context of the death of a child or a young adult. That is already a difficult enough time as it is without the financial cliff-edge. I have mentioned parental bereavement leave and benefit several times, which may be under the remit of the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman. However, the payment is paid by the Department of Social Protection so I ask that it be looked at. The timelines that are in place when a parent loses a child are not good enough. A couple of days off are provided. We need to see a payment introduced at a similar rate to parents' leave and benefit, and that two weeks would be given in the case of the death of a child, including stillbirth and miscarriage, as is in place in the North of Ireland. In the context of the Social Welfare Bill, we typically look at existing measures but we also need to look at what does not exist. This would be an important support and I hope the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is working hand in hand with the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, on that. I have asked about the few supports available to those who are working and paying PRSI. They may get a scale and polish, or an eye test. A lot of the time, people are paying PRSI and do not know what they are entitled to. I have suggested developing an app, which is in place in several countries. The app would allow people to see what they are paying towards PRSI and notify them when they are entitled to an eye test, or whatever, based on their PRSI contribution. That kind of information for workers who are contributing, as well as for the State pension, would be important. I ask the Minister to consider that and look at our proposal.

For some time now, the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice has been calling for a working age payment based on the minimum essential standard of living, and we support these calls. The consumer price index rose by 9.2% between October 2021 and October 2022. Even after these increases, people will still be chasing their tail as the cost-of-living crisis continues month after month. One issue we will seek to rectify on Committee Stage is a review of the current system of means testing for people in receipt of the blind pension or disability allowance. The system is far too rigid. It does not allow for any discretion based on individual circumstances. Assessment is based on the income of all the earners in the household, which can cause problems. The Government's report of December 2021 found that people living with disabilities face a higher cost of living, and we should have a system in place that rectifies this. We do not want a social welfare system that acts as a barrier to people with disabilities trying to access employment. The Report of the Child Maintenance Review Group, which was published last week, states that child maintenance requires radical reform as a matter of urgency. In 2018, Sinn Féin proposed the establishment of a child maintenance service. We outlined three basic principles for reform of the system, namely that the child or children would be central to all maintenance agreements, that lone parents would be assisted and supported throughout the entire process, and that maintenance would be treated as a means to lift children out of poverty and not as a source of household income. I hope the Minister and the Department will give these proposals serious consideration in light of last week's report.The expansion of the fuel allowance is welcome but it is limited. We in Sinn Féin seek to have it expanded to include those receiving the working family payment, for example. We also called for a discretionary fund to help those who are struggling but are not eligible. This is a missed opportunity by Government in that people are struggling with the cost of heating their homes but find no supports available to them. The final issue I wish to raise with the Minister is the difficulty people are having with the supplementary welfare and additional needs payments. Those applying for these payments are reaching out in desperation and we should have a process in place to acknowledge that. I welcome the awareness campaign the Department ran and I acknowledge she is addressing the backlogs but people should have the option to apply online for these payments. Many people feel embarrassed having to approach these services in their time of need. It is something cultural that needs to be addressed within the Department. It is the last line of financial support for those who are struggling and it should be compassionate in how it deals with people in their time of need.

There are close to 40 different social welfare payments. Our social protection system is wide and varied and, in all likelihood, everyone in the State will receive some form of social welfare payment at some point in their lives such as child, illness or maternity benefit, disability allowance, jobseeker’s allowance, etc. Wide and varied as the system may be, it is only as good as the adequacy of the payment rates. Unfortunately, as it currently stands and despite a growing cost-of-living crisis, social welfare rates are far behind where they need to be. Current rates leave vulnerable people at risk of poverty, especially older people and those with a disability. Current rates are not at the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, to protect people from poverty and provide rate adequacy across the system. The MESL is based on long-standing work by the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice. To this end, Sinn Féin proposed increasing working-age weekly social welfare rates by €17.50; pensions by €15 and by €17.50 for those living alone; disability-related payments by €20; and increases for qualified children over and under 12. The increases announced in the budget will not protect those who depend on social protection from poverty and does not recognise the impact of the cost-of-living crisis on those reliant on fixed incomes. As my colleague, an Teachta Kerrane said, the once-off payments are welcome. It would be great if poverty and being at risk of poverty were only once-off but they are a constant every day for people who depend on social welfare. What is more, they will still have to wait until January to see these increases. They should have taken effect immediately in order that people could see additional support. The people who need these payments are in crisis now. They need those increases. Sinn Féin called for the national minimum wage increase to start in October for exactly that reason. On that front, we called for a €1.50 increase in the minimum wage as a kick-start to delivering a living wage by January 2025. While I welcome that last year’s budget brought the number of weeks of parent’s benefit and leave available to parents following the birth of a child from five weeks to seven weeks, it is a pity that lone parents can only access seven weeks benefit and leave, while two-parent families can access the full 14 weeks. I hope the Government will examine and fix this anomaly. Finally, I wish to speak to the matter of the State pension. I was at the Connect Trade Union delegate conference at the weekend where one of the core motions passed by union members was for workers to have a right to retire on the State pension at the age of 65. Workers and voters have spoken on this matter. I believe they wish to be able to retire on a decent pension at 65 or have the right to continue working past 65 if they are able. The Government, by its actions, has proved it is dead set against this. The delegates at the Connect Trade Union conference were workers who are on their feet day in and day out. They work in construction and transport and are tradespeople. They simply cannot be expected to continue working beyond 65. They deserve the State pension at 65 and the Government should commit to doing so. It is ridiculous that two and a half years into its tenure, the Government has failed to deliver on this matter and it looks to me and the workers who spoke at the conference as though the Government never will. Exceptional needs payments have been raised by my colleagues, na Teachtaí Mitchell and Kerrane, which are emergency payments. They are emergency interventions that people require on a once-off, non-recurring basis because there is an emergency. In my constituency of Fingal, I speak to people who tell me they have to wait five weeks and longer for a decision but the emergency is today and while the awareness campaign is welcome, the Minister is making people aware of a service that is not at the standard it should be. When people are in crisis, they should be dealt with immediately. It is remiss of the Minister not to keep abreast of the delays and the time it is taking to process these payments. An Teachta Mitchell is correct in that people are embarrassed. They do not necessarily wish to have to ask for these payments but, when they do, they should be processed in a timely manner because they are in an emergency today. People need the payments today but they have to wait weeks. We say that if people have to wait years for an early intervention, the Minister has to stop calling it an early intervention. She cannot call this an emergency payment if it will not be there when the person is experiencing the emergency. I thank my colleague, an Teachta Kerrane, for all of the work she has done on aligning the disability allowance with the domiciliary care allowance when it comes to the death of a young adult who was in receipt of the disability allowance. It should be aligned with the domiciliary care allowance. It is not too hard. We are not talking about large numbers of people or considerable sums. It is the only compassionate thing to do.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18248	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	274	I welcome the Bill. We will support it and seek to amend it in places if that is allowable. I will start with the issue raised by the Minister regarding incentives provided for uilleann pipe makers and the exemptions that are proposed relating to income tax. The uilleann pipes, as I understand it, carry UN heritage status, which we all support. They are deemed to have UNESCO intangible heritage status similar to that of the hurley or, the hurl, depending on which part of the country one is from. In my part of the world, in Cork, they are called hurleys. We know there is a crisis with regard to ash and a considerable challenge in providing for hurling, which has UNESCO intangible heritage status. If the Minister could see fit to look at the game of hurling and the value of the hurl, or hurley, she would receive the broad acclamation of this House in devising a similar scheme for hurley makers. For some time now, we have been advocating for increases in the thresholds for the fuel allowance. All of us on the Opposition benches were carrying to the Minister stories of our constituents whereby they had become marginally over the threshold, in some instances by a matter of cents, and were deemed ineligible. This happened in the over-70s category in particular where there would have been a small occupational pension and, for the most part, people who were living in older housing stock with D and E BER ratings or exemptions in some cases. I welcome the move by the Minister to increase the threshold on the fuel allowance because it will bring many people into the net.In my constituency office, I field many queries about the fuel allowance and the increase in the threshold. We are teeing up an increase in the number of people who anticipate that they will apply. We are facing into Christmas. If there is any possibility that it could be fast-tracked to before Christmas, there would be many more applicants in the system. If there is any way to do that, I respectfully ask the Minister to consider it, given that we are in the midst of a fuel crisis. I realise it may not be possible. I acknowledge that the Minister has made a substantial change to fuel allowance policy to ensure that more people are brought into the net. That has to be acknowledged. I could use the cliché and say that I am glad the Minister listened to the Labour Party on this. The zeitgeist was captured and, knowing the Minister to be a sound constituency worker in her own constituency, I am sure she was listening to many people who were put over the threshold and took on board the views of people in her constituency and made changes accordingly. I would like to think we influenced the Minister in some respect with regard to this policy change. I would like to raise a broader policy issue. The debate on this Bill is the appropriate time and place to raise it. My colleagues and I are increasingly finding issues when people are making applications for schemes where medical evidence is necessary, there is a pro forma protocol to go through, with a doctor's letter or medical evidence depending on whether it is illness benefit, disability allowance, invalidity pension or partial capacity payment, or whatever else the payment is which requires medical evidence. The issues I am picking up when assisting people in our office to make applications involve a lag in getting medical evidence because of the challenges that people face in getting general practitioners, GPs. People will want something signed by the GP and will phone the GP's practice, then will speak to the gatekeeper, which I do not say in a pejorative way, the secretary or administrator. It can often take a long time for that form to be signed. That creates a follow-on lag time before people can benefit from a payment that they are eligible for anyway. Can we look at the need for people to go into pharmacies and get print-outs of their prescriptions, where they have to go to the GP surgery to get access to a signed form from a GP? Is there a way to streamline the process by making it more efficient, to facilitate the applicant, including with the option for a paper-based system in accordance with citizens' rights and wishes, and also to make it more streamlined for the GP, pharmacist, and person who is dealing with the case in the Department of Social Protection? I make that observation based on the dramatic increase in the number of applications that we are fielding in constituency offices where there are illness-related payments to be made and particularly in light of Covid, since we are seeing a greater preponderance of respiratory-related illnesses. One can call it long Covid. I perceive a significant increase in the number of people looking to claim disability allowance, invalidity pension, illness benefit and so on. I make that point in the hope that the Minister might respond to say that some internal work is going on to try to make it as streamlined as possible to ensure that the applicant can have a decision with a shorter lead-in time, if possible. While I am on the issue of medical assessments, some applications have to go to a Department-appointed medical assessor. Is there scope to appoint more medical assessors in the Department? What is the Minister's view on whether there is a sufficient number of medical assessors to decide on an initial application or on appeals? I perceive that it is taking longer now than it used to for caseloads to work through the system. I have great sympathy for employees in the Department of Social Protection, where it seems that caseloads are increasing. I am not sure whether that is because of a lack of additional staff being assigned to appeals. The Minister's perspective would be helpful. I refer to people who are carers and, wanting to use the right language, to people who are neurodivergent or who have an intellectual disability. When they are over 16, they are not eligible for a domiciliary care allowance but a carer's benefit or allowance may have been applied. Deputy Kerrane referred to this too. I share her view that there are circumstances where if somebody is caring for an adult and has been eligible for that carer's allowance or benefit heretofore, a spouse may work overtime, which then has a massive consequence for the carer. Carers lose carer's benefit because their household income has gone over a certain threshold and they lose medical cards too. There would be great sympathy and support if the Minister was to look at what I perceive to be a relatively small number of cases where people are caring for people and have lost benefits. They may have forgone career opportunities themselves, having decided that they wanted to care for the people who they are caring for. They wanted to ensure those people were cared for and, heretofore, the State recognised that in certain circumstances. However, the spouse will rightly have sought and benefited from overtime, and so the carer is kicked out of the system and loses everything. The Minister will be familiar with such cases. If that could be looked at again, it would be greatly appreciated. I ask the Minister to clarify the national minimum wage. With the cost-of-living crisis, we had a view that if the minimum wage could be raised to €12, it would at least go some way towards meeting the cost-of-living issues that workers have encountered. I refer also to PRSI thresholds and one school of thought. I defer to my colleague, Deputy Ged Nash, who I asked about this earlier. He said that as PRSI thresholds apply now, if there was an increase in the national minimum wage, the PRSI contribution that is due would mean that, in real terms, a person would not get the full benefit of that increase in the national minimum wage.I refer quickly to the Minister's contribution, where she stated:Weekly earnings in excess of €410 attract employer PRSI at a higher rate of 11.05%. The earnings threshold increase from €410 to €441 in section 4 is designed to take account of the forthcoming increase in the minimum wage from €10.50 to €11.30 per hour.I would like some clarification on that in case there is a real-term loss of income to a worker as a result of an increase in the national minimum wage. I would appreciate it if that could be addressed. The other issue is people who are on invalidity payments not being eligible for the bonus payment. There are so many categories of people in receipt of social welfare payments who will receive the bonus or who have heretofore and I do not understand why those on the invalidity pension do not seem to have been the beneficiaries of the bonus payments, though maybe I am misreading it.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	18248	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	276	I would like some clarification on that. I may, as I said, have it wrong and I put a health warning on what I am saying in that regard as well. Broadly speaking, we welcome the Bill. We will examine it on Committee Stage. We recognise those of us in Opposition are hampered in the types of amendments we can put forward but thems the rules, as they say. We will try to push the envelope as best we can in Opposition to try to promulgate on behalf of the people we represent. If some of the processes I have referenced for applications for illness-related payments could be looked at and streamlined, that would be welcome. There is also the gap that still exists with access to community welfare officers in certain parts of the country. There are people who could be availing of exceptional needs payments and urgent needs payments but they are not because they do not have access to that face-to-face contact with CWOs on the ground. I am lucky that in my area we have exceptional CWOs but there are parts of the country where there are still gaps. There are still people who - and I do not mean this in any condescending or patronising way - will not interface with technology or if they have to go on the phone find it challenging because they want to sit down and give context to the case they are making. We should not lose that in any way, if that can be helped.
#NealeRichmond	unknown-#NealeRichmond-party	unknown-#NealeRichmond-dob	unknown-#NealeRichmond-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	277	I greatly appreciate the opportunity to contribute on this Stage and thank the Minister for bringing the Bill to the House. We can all agree so many of our constituents are clearly facing tough times. They are worried about how they are going to pay for their shop at the end of the week, how they are going to keep the lights and heat on and keep so many bills at bay. Many of the people who are genuinely struggling will recognise that in the Bill we have a series of realistic, comprehensive and compassionate measures as part of a €1 billion social welfare package that follows on from a much wider budgetary package involving all Departments. The measures go to the core of how the Government can genuinely help people and provide the people who need the supports with such supports in these tough times. It is important to note again some of the measures announced in the budget and again this evening. These include increasing the social welfare weekly rates by €12, increasing the working family payment threshold by €20, a €30,000 increase in the savings disregard for the fuel allowance means test, extending eligibility for community employment schemes and increasing the domiciliary care allowance by €20. I welcome the comments by Deputy Sherlock, which were genuine and constructive. While he identified some issues that must be worked through, we can all agree there is much to welcome in this Bill. Sadly, the Deputy's contribution stands quite starkly in contrast to those of some of the previous speakers. I watched them with keen interest from the office and indeed it delayed me coming down because I did not want to miss anything. When we compare the opposing budgets, we see those on fuel allowance will be given an additional €400 before Christmas, while Sinn Féin wanted to give them just €60. An additional 80,000 pensioners will be included in the fuel allowance, but Sinn Féin did not want to do this. Carers are getting a €500 lump sum compared with €180 under Sinn Féin. It is important to be honest in what are debating this evening. We are trying to help people in a realistic way that will not just benefit the most marginalised and at risk in society but also ensure that if we must do more as part of the wider budgetary process, we can do so. We will not be a hostage to fortune through some wild energy cap and, equally, we have a reserve fund because we do not know when the war in Ukraine is going to end. We do not know when the inflation crisis is going to end or when the various impacts and global economic shocks are going to end. It is a responsible act that the Government has not only provided for people immediately, that is, before the January window, but also in a consistent manner that will last through the year and that there is a reserve fund that can be dipped into if needs be. This is good, prudent economics. We all know we face vast challenges in our society at the moment but if we do not face them responsibly and sensibly, then we have no chance of countering them. In conclusion, before passing to Deputy Dillon, I thank the Minister for her forthright contribution. Those of us who want to ensure we can iron this out and deliver this as best as possible would welcome her engagement on that.
#AlanDillon	unknown-#AlanDillon-party	unknown-#AlanDillon-dob	unknown-#AlanDillon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	278	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which is most welcome and will assist hundreds of thousands of people across many strands our society who would otherwise face a difficult time as we head into an uncertain winter. The eight lump sum payments that amount to more than €1.2 billion could be the difference between a happy and a miserable Christmas for many individuals and families across the country. The payments have helped parents of young children, those living alone, carers and those on disability, among others. While January can be a dreary month for many, a €12 increase in the weekly payment from the start of 2023 will represent the largest increase for more than a decade and will ensure a happy new year for so many. I welcome that initiative. Pensioners, those caring for their loved ones and the elderly in their homes, those with disabilities and low-income families will see the benefit of these measures in the coming months and the supports will help with the current increase in the cost of living. I welcome also the increase in the domiciliary care allowance, which is of vital importance for many parents of children with disabilities and is a vital support to these families. This is the first payment increase they have received in more than 13 years, which is a significant step. The expansion of the working family payment threshold means hundreds, if not thousands, of families will now qualify for aid with the increased cost of the weekly shop, car fuel, bills and generally making ends meet and, therefore, it is an important step. The CE scheme is important and has been of great assistance in reducing our live register figures and getting the long-term unemployed back into work. These part-time and temporary placements have become important to the social fabric. This is especially so in constituencies in rural Ireland such as the one I represent, where some fantastic work and important projects have been achieved. I am thankful the Minister has recognised the value of CE schemes by extending the eligibility criteria for participation in them to spouses, civil partners or cohabitants of jobseeker's allowance recipients. This is most welcome. Along with this, the lower employer PRSI rates as well as increase in the national minimum wage should boost employment figures. The shake-up of the farm assist last June has helped thousands of farmers who avail of the agri-environmental schemes because they did not have contributions from social welfare payments to reduce this. This will see a doubling in the income that can be derived from schemes such as the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, or agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES and will be of great assistance in ensuring the future of farming in rural Ireland. The expansion of the farm assist means test is vital to the survival of this industry in my constituency. I commend the Minister on her work and that of her Department in delivering the Bill, which demonstrates her and our party's compassion and empathy towards those who are struggling at this time. I commend the Bill to the House.
#RoseConwayWalsh	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-party	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-dob	unknown-#RoseConwayWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	279	It is very disappointing to hear Deputies, and the Deputy who has just left the Chamber in particular, trying to score points by saying people would be worse off under Sinn Féin. He quoted a lot of nonsense figures but left out the fact that in Sinn Féin's alternative budget, those earning less than €70,000 would get cash payments and there would also be payments for those earning less than €30,000. Social welfare increases of €15, €17.50 and €20 would kick in immediately. It is totally wrong, when people are suffering so much, to go on with that kind of nonsense. Deputy Richmond is part of the same Government as the Tánaiste. As he prepares to take over the position of Taoiseach from Fianna Fáil, I am reminded of his shameful vilification of social welfare recipients during the austerity years. We need a change in culture and approach. I believe this will only happen under a change in Government. This Government is so desperate to hang on. It is always telling us we need to be under it and that we must allow it to retain the power so it can dig us out. It is just so wrong. The 2023 budget did not go far enough to protect people from the rising cost of living. That is a fact. There were good initiatives but homeowners are getting house insurance bills that have gone up from €400 or €500 a year to €1,000 or more. That will get rid of every social protection payment that was made. We have to do everything we possibly can, collectively, to ensure some of the hardship people are going through is alleviated. Too many people are slipping through the cracks. The dedicated staff in social welfare offices need to be given greater trust and flexibility to support people in their communities. I am dealing at the moment with a man who was on jobseeker's allowance. He broke his leg and is now deemed unable to work so he has moved on to illness benefit. This means he has lost his fuel allowance and the one-off cost-of-living payment. We need to give flexibility to community welfare officers to be able to consider people's particular needs and help them in a more immediate way, and not ask them to wait six or 12 weeks. People should also be able to access payments online, particularly people in rural areas who may not have the money to travel to the social welfare office. They may also want the privacy of doing it online. There are some good things being done but there is always more to be done. Trying to score cheap political points is not the way to do it.
#GaryGannon	unknown-#GaryGannon-party	unknown-#GaryGannon-dob	unknown-#GaryGannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	280	I had not intended to but I will begin by referencing some of the commentary from a previous speaker, Deputy Richmond. He talked about how important it is to be honest and said that if the Government needs to do more, it will do more. It is an interesting proposition. How much suffering must a parent or family experience before the Government decides to step in? Is there a requisite level of hunger before the Government will say it has the capacity to intervene? It is a logic I want to confront. Deputy Richmond referred to it as being fiscally responsible but I am not sure if it is ethical. If we have the capacity to ensure a family, an individual or an older person does not go cold or hungry, or without the basic provision of a warm coat, why are we waiting to intervene? There was space in the budget for targeted interventions that would have offset the worst aspects of the very real poverty people are experiencing, which has been exacerbated by the cost-of-living crisis and all that goes with it. I fully appreciate that the blame for that lies with Putin's invasion of Russia but it also lies with consistent underinvestment in our social welfare system. If we have the capacity to intervene, I implore the Minister to do so before we see the worst excesses of that being felt in people's homes. When the pandemic first hit in 2020, the first Bill many of us dealt with was the one that introduced the pandemic unemployment payment. It seemed the State had finally accepted that the current core social welfare rates were entirely insufficient to live a dignified existence. We cannot unsee that reality. We must acknowledge the lessons around minimum income standards that came from that experience. Those lessons are more imperative than ever, given the rapidly increasing cost of living for families in meeting their basic needs, heating their homes, feeding themselves and their children and keeping basic provisions. I keep referring to having a warm coat because that is a very real way by which poverty is measured in this country. The cost-of-living crisis has been significantly exacerbated by the decades of underinvestment that preceded it. We must address the chronic deficits that exist in our public services, which have contributed to this. Increases to core social welfare rates are welcome and should be welcomed but we should go further. Changes to tax bands can help people in the short term but they will not solve the underlying problems that come with an absence of basic provision of public services. While emergency measures are necessary, and indeed welcome, in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, so too are steps that will bring down the cost of living not only over the short term but over the longer term too. It is hard not to agree with Social Justice Ireland, which called on the Government to raise all core social welfare rates by a further €8 a week through this Bill, bringing the total increase to €20. This call has gone unanswered. The organisation is correct that the €12 increases do not match up with the inflation consumers are experiencing. It is anticipated that that rate will continue to rise and with it so too will the hardship experienced. The Social Democrats believe in benchmarking social welfare rates to cover the cost of inflation, instead of waiting until we reach a crisis or the crisis being experienced in people's homes now is further exacerbated. We must move away from a style of politics that waits for people to undergo hardship, pain and strife before they are supported by the State. We have an ongoing poverty problem, which I and others believe is simply being ignored. Over half a million people in Ireland are living in poverty. That is one in six people and one in three of those are children. They go to school without a warm winter coat and often have to go to bed hungry. The State does not show compassion for those who need it most when they need it. Others who are fighting illness or have a disability and are unable to work because of it face the highest risk of poverty in Irish society. Nearly 20% of this group are experiencing poverty. This is completely unacceptable. There is an ongoing need for better assistance for these groups. Further investment in disability services is essential to reduce the likelihood of individuals falling into that poverty trap and all that goes with it. We talk about poverty and use the word too often but I am conscious that the very essence of poverty when experienced by the individual is beyond my capacity to even articulate at this moment in time. People contacting our office are cold and are going to become colder. They are hungry. A report from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul from last spring referred to the cost of survival. That report was released even before the war in Ukraine and all that has come with it. We talk of poverty but it is about the cost of survival for so many in this country. A recent report commissioned by the Department of Social Protection estimated that the overall average annual cost of disability is between €9,500 and €11,700, or between €180 and €225 a week. A comprehensive Government response must provide for these rising costs to level the playing field. The lump sums announced in the budget have fallen short of the assistance the most vulnerable in our society require to keep them from the edge. The current cost of living, perpetuated by the energy crisis, has made every day a challenge for more and more people. Members of our retired population make up over 12% of those living in poverty. These people have worked their entire lives only to be forgotten by those who should be representing them and a State that should be wrapping its arms around them. Poverty is corrosive to the human condition. At its very essence, it is about the basic provisions a person is asked to go without. However, poverty is not inevitable. Effective policies progressed by a Government committed to universal public services could improve the quality of life for the many families living on the margins. I will quickly refer to the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, as have others before me and I am sure others after will as well. This is a benchmark for social welfare rates to counter inflation. Many of us across the Opposition believe social welfare rates should be set in line with the MESL research, which currently sets core rates at €228 per week.More important, it should track inflation and costs to ensure that rates move accordingly. To ensure that social welfare supports maintain their real value, they must be adjusted in line with potential changes in minimum living costs. The estimated increase in minimal essential standards of living for the final quarter of this year is greater than the additional income provided by the measures ratified in the Bill. As a result, income inadequacy is forecast to deepen in the latter part of the year. The €12 increase to adult rates falls short of the €20 increase required to keep pace with the rising cost of living.  The €2 increase in the qualifying child rate is nothing short of insulting and the gradual progress that has been made in the past towards adequate income supports in this area will likely be reversed next year, falling below the MESL. I am conscious that one parent family groups called the budget announced a couple of months ago the most regressive for one parent families in the history of the State. The core rate of fuel allowance has remained €33 per week despite massive inflation and rising energy costs. Research from Meitheal shows budget 2023 has not protected core social welfare rates. The increase in rates is not keeping pace with the rising cost of living. It is, therefore, a cut in real terms. However, the adjustment to conditions for supports such as changes to the fuel allowance means test and an increase in the working family payment threshold are welcome. It is regrettable that a more targeted approach, one that focuses a greater share of available resources on low-income households, was not taken in the budget or even in this Bill. In order to ensure social welfare supports and the minimum rates of pay maintain their real value, it is imperative that they are adjusted in line with potential changes in minimum living costs. Another decision made in the budget and not addressed in the Bill is why those with disabilities participating in the National Learning Network have been excluded. I believe the Minister rectified this recently, which is welcome. I will table amendments to the Bill to deal with a couple of issues, if possible. In recent years, before and after I was elected to the House, I have taken great umbrage at the manner in which social welfare inspections are carried out. I have seen how that has impacted people, predominantly one parent families, not only in my constituency but around the country. I intend to bring forward a Bill that questions the practice over the coming months. Perhaps the Minister will respond to that or perhaps over the next couple weeks she and I could have a conversation about it. The legislation that enables a social welfare inspector to carry out his or her work is, we are told, only relevant in cases where potential employment or self-employment is taking place on a premises or a person has to prove he or she is resident at an address for the purpose of rent supplement. In all other cases those inspections should not take place. These are older, cruel practices that create a hostile environment in our social welfare system. I was recently made aware of a case where social welfare tried to contact a person and, for some reason, could not. It appears that recipients go to post offices where they previously received their payments but find their payments are not available and no explanation is given as to why that is the case. They then have to go to an Intreo office because, inevitably, they will not have any money and are living hand to mouth. They are told the Department has redirected their payments to another post office. In my constituency, post offices are relatively close to each other but in other constituencies they can be much further away. People have to get a bus or taxi to a post office or Intreo office to find out why payments have been redirected. They will then have to get a bus or taxi to a second post office to collect payments. That is happening in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis in which people are living hand to mouth. It is a cruel and unjust practice and needs to be eradicated. I intend to challenge it through legislation, if necessary, over the coming months.

It refers to buildings such as libraries or churches that provide a space for people struggling to heat their homes due to spiralling energy costs. It is a terrifying summary of where many people find themselves. Previously, we had food banks, another facility that emerged in response to chronic and consistent poverty. They are incredibly important services, often run by volunteers, but they also reveal the cold reality for many families and individuals in our society. They let slip the mask of neoliberal economics and a social protection system that should provide a safety net for all. People are experiencing one of the hardest winters in living memory. The cost-of-living crisis has left many families terrified. Households that have never had to seek State assistance or turn to local charities are finding themselves in that position now. The Government's budget is a missed opportunity to address the underlying issues. It prioritised universal one-off payments and tax cuts over investment in our public services and supporting ordinary people. Social Justice Ireland has shown that poverty rates in Ireland have decreased when budgets have given greater attention to improving minimum welfare payments or prioritising welfare dependent households. Conversely, of course, poverty increases when budgets favour tax breaks over social investment. Unfortunately, the budget and this Bill are the types of policy that will make life harder for many families this winter. First is the issue of core social welfare rates. Hundreds of thousands of pensioners, disabled people, carers, unemployed people and families are dependent on these measures. However, these payments are awarded on the whim of the Government rather than in any benchmarked and reliable manner. Core rates were increased for the first time in three years by €5 in the last budget and now, in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, there is an increase of only €12. In real terms, a significant proportion of the population is worse off under this and previous Governments. In our alternative budgets, the Social Democrats proposed an increase of €15 per week to the core rates which would have begun in October. We also prioritised and targeted those in the most severe fuel poverty by increasing the fuel allowance by €15, totalling €48 per week. We would have extended that eligibility to include recipients of the working family payment. Second is the issue of one-off payments. While we need measures to address the immediate crisis, universal payments are an imprecise tool. Temporary supports will not help people in the medium to long term. They will not provide sustainable relief to those who can no longer afford the soaring price of food, fuel, energy and rent. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul pointed out that the temporary measures will help people get through this winter, but next year people on low incomes will be pulled even further into poverty. This short-term thinking will particularly impact disabled people. They have received the €12 payment increase and a €500 one-off payment. Once-off payments mean little to people with long-term or permanent conditions. The Department of Social Protection's report established that it costs up to €12,300 more annually to live with a disability in Ireland. We we know that depends on the disability; the figure can be more. That was before the cost-of-living crisis.  Instead of producing a plan to tackle this massive gap, the Government has gone with a one-off payment. My motion in July proposed a package including a cost of disability payment of €20 per week, meaning people would have an increase of €1,040 annually. Instead, the Government is only giving a once-off payment of €500. Ireland, disgracefully, has one of the highest rates of poverty among disabled people in Europe. Some 24% of people who are not able to work due to illness or disability are living in consistent poverty compared with 6.7% of the rest of the population. Disgracefully, the budget is vastly insufficient to address this systemic discrimination. Next is the inadequacies of the Bill in supporting lone parent families and combating poverty. One Family has consistently highlighted that lone parent families had the highest deprivation rate in 2021, at 44.9%. The single most prominent factor influencing child poverty is belonging to a lone parent family. There are over 200,000 children at risk of poverty in Ireland and more than 90,000 are in consistent poverty. This means that they do not have guaranteed access to sufficient food, shelter, healthcare and other essentials that so many of us take for granted. These are truly shocking figures. There is hardly a greater avoidable tragedy in Irish society than that of child poverty. The scarring effects of living in consistent poverty as a child last for life. Eliminating child poverty requires a combination of child and adult income supports and access to quality public services. This budget has failed on all counts.Bernardos has pointed out that the €2 increase in the qualified child payment is wholly inadequate to cover increased costs for parents. The Social Democrats proposed an increase of €12 per week for a child over 12 and by €7 per week for children under 12. Publicly provided affordable childcare is a key tool to help single parents to access education, training and employment. However, the massive costs currently mean it is not economically viable for them to use childcare. The Government has proposed to cut childcare fees by 25%. That is welcome. We had planned a 60% reduction in the next two years and ring-fenced capital investment of €20 million for the creation of public childcare places. Child poverty is a massive social issue impacting all communities. This budget has utterly failed those families. Incredibly when we know that the single biggest determining factor as to whether you live in consistent poverty is being the child of a single parent, it is incredible that there has never been a real attempt to lift those families out of poverty. This budget is the latest example of that. The Bill is a disservice to the invaluable work of community employment, CE, schemes and the rural social scheme. These excellent programmes provide people with experience to gain work while also contributing to local communities. Many organisations in towns and villages in west Cork really benefit from these schemes. However, the top-up payment to standard welfare rates has only increased by €5 to a total of €25 per week. This is no way reflects the work and the role of these schemes in people’s lives and their communities. The Social Democrats called for an increase to the top up of €100 per week for participants in the rural social scheme and to reinstate the community employment budget to €500 per annum per participant. While I welcome the measures to extend eligibility for participation in CE schemes to spouses and cohabitants of jobseeker's allowance recipients, this budget could have done more for participants and workers in this scheme. This Bill symbolises the Government’s attitude to those less well off in society. It is eager to push headline-grabbing one-off payments while ignoring the structural causes of poverty and inequality. Disabled people, one-parent families, carers and many more people living in poverty need sustained, bench-marked payments with additional targeted measures to compensate for decades of failed economic and social policies.

It is in the context of the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill, of the announcements made on budget day and the resources this Government has been able to gather from the people of Ireland and those people who invest in Ireland to create wealth so that we can redistribute it. At the beginning of Covid-19 many people would have said it would be surprising if Ireland was in a position to make an €11 billion intervention without borrowing. We should not forget how the money arrived here. It was due to effective management of the economy. There is a once-off issue here which is the war in Ukraine. That is having an energy impact. Therefore once-off payments are one way to approach that because we do not know what will happen next year. We have left aside resources to deal with further increases if they are needed. In regard to how we protected people on energy price rises, Dr. Barra Roantree of the ESRI said:...the Government’s approach to insulating households from the recent rise in energy prices has been effective. Targeted welfare measures combined with universal household energy credits will do more for most lower income households this winter than had welfare payment rates risen in line with inflation both this year and next.We have done more than if welfare payments had risen in line with inflation. That is not to say that we do not understand the pressures that increasing energy costs place on families. On increasing energy costs we have effectively doubled, between extending weeks and additional payments, the fuel allowance in the time that this Government has been together. I also welcome the increase in the fuel allowance eligibility thresholds for those over 70 to €26,000 annually for an individual and €52,000 annually for a couple. That is an incredibly welcome intervention. That will have a real impact. Many people who did not believe they would ever get fuel allowance will now be able to apply, that is almost 81,000 people. They will also be able to get access to the Better Energy Warmer Homes scheme. That means they will be able to insulate their homes for free. That is real action in tackling the energy crisis. Of course we have already seen the increases with the double payment for child benefit in November, the €500 cost-of-living payment, the €500 disability support grant and in December we will see the Christmas double payments. I welcome all those measures. I also welcome drawing a line under the CE supervisors’ claim for pensions which this Bill does. As the Minister knows we have spoken about it many times. Many people will be unhappy with this arrangement. I am happy that finally the Government has acknowledged in this payment that we should make a contribution to pensions with an average payment of €11,000 to 2,500 beneficiaries for that period between 2008 and 2023. Some will be cut out by that who perhaps worked until 2010 and might only get two years. I feel sorry for them because if you are a meals-on-wheels service and you have a limited company established by a CE supervisor to carry out that meals-on-wheels service that is funded by the HSE that really should not be in the Minister’s Department. That should be a HSE service delivering meals-on-wheels. We should think about that as a proper pensionable position. Overall this is about protecting people who live in this State. It is about managing the economy and making sure that we as a Government do our very best.

We are operating in difficult times. You never get perfection but must spend the money wisely. In the limited time I have I will touch on a few areas. The Minister will be aware that there was an anomaly in the fuel allowance whereby people had to be in receipt of a social welfare payment to qualify for it. For the over-70s it is based on means alone. The Minister ensured that clarity was brought to bear so that it is now based on means alone for the over-70s. That has been hugely well received by people in that age-group, many of whom were border-line for fuel allowance. They will now qualify. People are coming to us saying it has major add-on benefits. It is necessary to have the fuel allowance to qualify for the warmer homes scheme. I commend that. The Minister will shortly announce the application process for that. She might give us an indication on that. It is not specifically in this Bill but it will be brought in by way of secondary legislation effective on 1 January 2023. There are also eight once-off lump-sum measures to spend. However, there are many core changes as well. Social welfare is going up by €12 a week. The working family payment threshold is now €40 a week. I feel very strongly about that. Working people on lower incomes are under pressure. Ensuring that threshold is higher in order for them to qualify for the working family payment, historically known as FIS, is positive. Domiciliary care allowance is going up by €20.50 per month. That is very welcome. The core payment for child benefit is going up by €2 a week. It is important that we increase the lower PRSI rate commensurate with the increase in the minimum wage. In summary, one can never get everything absolutely spot-on but the choices made in this budget both with the once-off lump-sums and the core payments, in the circumstances as presented is a good judgment call on the Minister's part.It will benefit people on the ground who I represent in Limerick city and county and north Tipperary.

As I have not been speaking in the House since the Ceann Comhairle returned, I welcome him back. It is great to see him back in the Chair. I welcome the increases. At the time of the budget, I said that I welcome the changes in the means test for the fuel allowance because many people fell outside the fuel allowance by a small margin, so that is very good. The reason I want to speak this evening is to raise three important points with regard to waiting times. The first point concerns community welfare. Just today, I had to contact the Society of St. Vincent de Paul for somebody who has been waiting 12 weeks for an answer from community welfare. The whole idea of community welfare is that it is an emergency; it is called an exceptional needs payment, so people cannot wait 12 weeks. This is putting unnecessary pressure on the scant resources of the St. Vincent de Paul. We have to do something in regard to the timeframes for community welfare. In many areas, particularly rural areas, people cannot get in to see a human being anymore. They have to leave a message on a mobile number and they may or may not be contacted. I understand everyone is under pressure but people going to community welfare are under pressure and that is the reason they are going there. There have been serious delays in the processing of the fuel allowance and waiting times average ten weeks for the people who are coming in to us. Again, fuel allowance is for fuel that people need now, for this week or next week, and it is not something they can afford to get in a lump sum. We are in the winter now and people need that money. The other issue I want to raise concerns the delays in the processing of the working family payment. I specifically raise these three issues because they are payments that people need immediately, or at least within a two-week timeframe, and, as I said, community welfare is for an emergency situation. With regard to working family payment, there is this crazy situation with social welfare where people will be sent a form for an exceptional needs payment and told to apply for that in the interim. However, once they are working, they are not going to qualify for that, so while they are waiting on their working family payment, they might be living on just two days of work. We need to address the waiting times for those payments, including fuel allowance. Those are three areas where people need that money nearly immediately, or certainly within a reasonable timeframe. I believe two weeks is reasonable. For community welfare, we need to figure out a system where people can go in and speak to somebody. That was the system a number of years ago and it was great because people could potentially get money there and then for their situation. A huge number of people are being rejected for community welfare as they are being told that it does not fall within the guidelines and that it is something they should have budgeted for. That does not take account of the massive increases we have all seen in everything. People last year might have been able to budget but this year they cannot due to the increasing costs. There needs to be a review of the waiting times for those three payments. Community welfare in general needs to become more adaptable. That is why we need to go back to having someone for people to speak to, so they can explain the situation. That is easier because the CWO will often understand more when speaking to the person.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	286	I was not going to start in this way because it sounds sort of Dickensian, and it is, but having listened to some of the Government Deputies eulogise the budget, I want to start by reading a letter I got in my constituency office from a neighbour who lives on the road near me in Ballyfermot. It reads:I went to my parents’ home at 9 p.m. tonight. My mam had the bottle gas fire right in front of her and my father had his housecoat on him and was in bed. I can’t stand back or stay quiet. My parents need urgent help. My dad is almost 73 years old. He has COPD. My mam is 66 years old. The house has no heating at all and the hot water takes hours as it is coming from an immersion, which costs a fortune. The boiler recently broke down and they haven’t got the money to have it repaired. My dad recently retired and the money that he has from a small pension puts him slightly over the right to the fuel allowance.They want me to come to see them and I will be visiting this home either tonight or tomorrow night. I want to contrast that with the idea that, somehow, this is an amazing budget that is going to lift people out of poverty, that we are a great country of egalitarians and that this House sees everybody as being equal and treats them equally. Actually, we do not. This is the third wealthiest country on the planet and all the wealth is in the hands of a few. Although somebody on the other side of the House talks about sharing the wealth equally, we are far from it. I want to go through some of the issues in the budget that I thought were worth raising. First, on an obvious point, having come out of the Covid period, when this country recognised that everybody needed at least €315 per week to survive, and everybody got that payment, the Covid payments were then removed and we are back down to the basic welfare payments. What do we get in the budget of this year, in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis that we have never seen the like of before in the history of this State? We get a €12 rise in basic social protection payments, when €12 is not anywhere near the figure for inflation. What would be required to be inflation-proof is something like €25 per week on every social protection payment. We recognise that the once-off payment measures have given people a bit of breathing space, and they have certainly given the Government a bit of breathing space. I would describe them as palliative. They will keep the pain away for the few months in the lead-up to the post-Christmas period but, after that, the energy hikes will continue, the food hikes in particular will continue, and people’s social protection payments and basic income will not see them through. I particularly think this is true of people with disabilities, and many Deputies have referred to this. If we, as a State, believed that everybody needed minimum pay of €350 a week to live on, to survive and to keep them out of poverty, then that is particularly true of those with disability payments because of the extra needs they have in terms of getting over the everyday challenges they face. That needs to be looked at again and perhaps we need a mini-budget that would really address the need to improve the lot of people with disabilities. There is quite a high rate of people with disabilities in this country. Other Deputies mentioned the exceptional needs payment. This will be part of the discussion with the family I am going to meet in the next day or two. In all of our experiences, we know the wait is way too long and the refusal rate is way too high. I have looked back at some parliamentary questions that Deputies around the House have asked about the exceptional needs payment in their own areas. The national figures are rising and rising. In April there were 6,500 applications for exceptional needs payment, in July that was 17,000, and I do not know what it is now. The average processing time is eight weeks, and it can be 12 weeks or more, as Deputy Funchion said. That has to change. If they are exceptional needs, then they are needed now, like the case of this couple who have a boiler that needs fixing. I got my own boiler fixed recently and it was €2,500 just to get it fixed and another €500 for the labour, but I have that because I am a Deputy and I am paid handsomely. However, if someone is living like that couple who live around the corner from me, then there is huge discrimination and huge challenges to be faced. The other point to mention is this idea that the fuel allowance is all sorted. It is not. There are a number of exceptions to getting the fuel allowance that are going to stand in the way of many people. One is if somebody lives with a person who is not on a qualifying payment. I know of the case of a blind man on an island off the coast of Cork who came to me because he knows me from the past. Somebody who lives with him and helps him has been refused carer's allowance. Now, he has been refused fuel allowance for the first time because she is living there and she is not entitled to any payment from the State. She has no income and he has been cut off fuel allowance. None of these things make sense. We need to have a system where we look at individual cases and they are dealt with in a fair, compassionate and timely manner. There are other reasons someone would not be entitled to fuel allowance, for example, if a person is on jobseeker’s, enhanced illness, occupational illness, maternity or disablement benefit.A person getting any of those payments is not entitled automatically to the fuel allowance. That creates a real barrier in the context of other rights people might have, such as to Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grants. I have been contacted by dozens of workers who have retired with a tiny pension that may throw them €6, €5 or €3 over the limit and have been cut off from all benefits from the SEAI. That is shocking and needs to end. I emphasise that we need social protection increases that keep track with inflation. Inflation has not gone away. It is predicted to be at least 7% next year. The situation is particularly bad when it comes to items such as food, which is something on which people who depend on social protection spend most of their income, and they do so in the here and now. Food inflation has gone crazy, particularly when it comes to basic items such as dairy products. I do not understand the inflation in the cost of dairy products, particularly in Ireland, which has the biggest dairy industry in the EU. Dairy inflation is at 26%. There is no explanation for that other than profiteering and price gouging. The same has happened with energy companies. I know the Cabinet is talking about bringing in a solidarity tax and a windfall energy tax, and it is not beyond time for that to happen, but there is still profiteering taking place while the poorest and most marginalised are struggling to survive.  The issues I have raised need to be considered. We need a system that is timely and compassionate and can deal with the hardest of cases in the hardest of winters in a long time as a result of the level of inflation and the various crises we are facing. That leaves aside the need to address the biggest crisis the State is facing, namely, the housing crisis. Many of the people in this cohort are facing the dual challenge of housing as well as poverty. The budget should not be eulogised by the Opposition, especially in a country that is so unequal and where there is clearly a big hollow between the very wealthy and the very poor.

Much of the debate on the Bill has been good. I do not know whether anybody has eulogised the budget. All Members across the House have pointed to aspects they believe are good. Deputy O'Donnell acknowledged that no budget is perfect. I take issue with some of the language I have heard, with reference having been made to cruelty, systemic discrimination or it being an utter failure of a budget. I do not think all 160 Deputies are universally good people, but there are not very many cruel or bad people here. If there are such people, I am sure no particular party or side of the House has the monopoly on that. Most people are here to try to do a good job and represent their constituents as best they can. We have differences in terms of political philosophies when it comes to how that can be achieved, even within the coalition, and we acknowledge that, but most people are here to try to do the best they can by the constituents they represent. This statement may be contested, but this is a progressive budget It is the third such progressive budget. It has been analysed and shown to be progressive. I acknowledge some of the points raised in respect of lone-parent groups, but in successive budgets we are making headway on this. Research commissioned from the ESRI by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Joe O'Brien, considered that issue of poverty and found that the working family payment is possibly the most impactful tool in terms of tackling poverty within that cohort. In that context, we have to acknowledge the significant progress that has been made in the budget in respect of the working family payment. It will impact many people who are affected and in that poverty trap. The Minister outlined the 11 lump sum payments. We know there are two elements to the budget. There is the element whereby we are trying to increase social welfare payments across the board, but there is also those one-off payments. We acknowledge that. The additional €12 on social welfare payments is a substantial increase but we have to acknowledge that it does not keep pace with inflation. The one-off payments are designed to help to fill that hole but I agree with some of my colleagues on the other side of the House that in the longer term we have to consider benchmarking those payments, possibly to the minimum essential standard of living, MESL, or looking at the income-smoothing approach outlined in the Pathways to Work document. That is something towards which we have to begin moving. An issue that may not belong in the Bill but does belong in the Minister's Department is the extension of the free travel pass to people who are precluded from driving. I was contacted by Epilepsy Ireland in that regard. It made a good and detailed pre-budget submission. When it factored in all of the people who suffer from epilepsy - not all of whom are precluded from driving at all times - it arrived at a figure that is not an enormous sum but could make a substantial difference to many people, particularly those in rural areas, such as the one represented by the Minister or the one that I represent. If a person living in a rural area is precluded from driving, that makes a difference to how he or she lives life and accesses services. That is something the Minister may be able to consider outside the parameters of the Bill. As Deputy O'Donnell stated, no budget is perfect. This is a good one, however. It does its best to be kind and fair to those in society who need help from the State at this extremely challenging time.
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	288	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Bill. I echo the words of Deputy Ó Cathasaigh. The budget is fair and equitable and has shown that the Government is acutely aware of the pressures this cost-of-living crisis has placed on people. The rising cost of living is ever prevalent, but there is recognition of that through the movement on social welfare rates, for example. It is the largest increase in well over a decade and certainly the largest in my time - almost 12 years - in this House. There have been increases to parent's benefit, the core weekly payments, which I mentioned, and the working family payment, as Deputy Ó Cathasaigh rightly pointed out, in addition to an increase to the domiciliary care allowance. There have also been changes to PRSI treatment for those in receipt of the national minimum wage. A fact of which I am very proud is that this is the ninth occasion on which this Government, of which I am a supporter, has increased the minimum wage. Come January, that increase will kick in. Of course, the biggest part of the budget was the one-off supports to cover families and individuals against the rising cost of living, including the increase in the fuel allowance. Hundreds of thousands of people across the State will benefit from one-off payments in areas such as carer's allowance, living alone allowance, double payments of SUSI grants, the waiving of SUSI fees and the working family payment. Those are on top of the recognition of the rising costs of getting around in light of increases in the cost of diesel, other fuel and other transport costs. I listened to the entirety of the debate thus far from my office. It would be remiss of me not to mention the doublespeak I have heard from the Opposition, specifically Sinn Féin, this evening. Its alternative budget does not even come up to the bar that has been set in this social welfare budget by the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and the rest of the Cabinet. It is indicative of a party that has been found, yet again, to be a dollar short in its ambition. The Government has set out a budget that has supported and insulated hundreds of thousands of people across the State. We have never claimed that we will be able to cover all cost-of-living increases but we have done our best to ensure that the money we have available thanks to the prudent economic management of the State through the past decade has been brought home in the run-up to Christmas in ensuring that families across the country receive the benefits they so rightly deserve.

I welcome the opportunity to talk about this on behalf of constituents who experience particular hardships, when they find the system either slow to respond or not responding to their circumstances. I will refer to the additional needs payment. While I appreciate the Department has taken some action to address the limited timeframe involved, many people are still faced with unacceptable delays. The many constituents who have contacted me about this have invariably said they have been waiting five or six weeks. It is not unheard of for people to wait between six and eight weeks and that remains a problem. While I understand that community welfare officers are under an increased amount of pressure, more needs to be done to assist them and the people they are trying to help. If a family has an immediate need, for example, if their washing machine, boiler or other appliance breaks down, they cannot wait for a month, let alone two months. Additional needs payments are, therefore, emergencies, which by their very nature need a swift response. I urge the Minister to identify the resources that are needed and to respond accordingly. Too many people find themselves left in limbo facing bills and awake at night thinking about how they can buy more time before they pay those bills. The qualifying criteria for carer's allowance is another issue that must be addressed. Many people are putting their lives on hold to look after a loved one or a neighbour and the time and work involved does not allow them to get on with their lives as they otherwise would. However, time and again, people who are genuinely carers are being refused the carer's allowance. This causes undue hardship for those people but also poses uncertainty for people being cared for, as they cannot be sure whether their current unpaid carers will be able to stick with them. Carers were the unsung heroes of the pandemic. They are also the unsung heroes of any day of the week. Whether the Department considers them carers or not, the fact remains too many people are working day in and day out with no recognition, only to be told the State will not recognise them for the work they do. I urge the Minister to review the criteria that will leave a carer worthy of some small payment and to address this shortcoming. We also need to see some reform of disability-related supports. Current means testing results in some people losing or having adjustments made to their blind pension or disability allowance because of a change in the income of their partners. We are not calling for the removal of means testing altogether but we need to see it applied in a fairer way that takes account of the challenges faced by the applicant. The higher daily cost of having a disability is also not given proper consideration. The Government has spoken about addressing this within the social welfare system yet nothing has been done. If we are to recognise the imbalance that exists properly, the Government needs to act urgently and address the inequality that continues to exist.

I compliment people working in the service that is available to our office and many other offices throughout the country. I recognise the good work they do and are doing in an efficient and effective manner. As with all services, there are a minority of people who will take advantage and create issues for the system. I also recognise the many people who are working but qualify for nothing. They work hard and often feel they should qualify for more assistance, as they believe they are the squeezed working class. For example, when two people with a child are working, their costs include inflation, rent, mortgage, insurance and even education. When they look at all the bills that come in, they see there is nothing left, which is disheartening for them. It is also very discouraging for people who go out to work. We talked about carers who look after our vulnerable, such as people who are disabled. We look at all these people who cannot afford to put food on the table, even though they are working. There are also escalating fuel costs for people who are working and the issue of home help. From a carer's perspective, for nurses working in hospitals and people going to nursing homes to care for people, we are again looking at fuel costs, which the Government has not tackled. On electricity costs, it is not yesterday that we asked the Government to help out on the energy crisis. We asked the Government to help 12 months ago, but it is late coming to the table every time. We now see that energy companies have made more than €1 billion in profits. The Government will sign up for €120 per kilowatt hour, when Wind Energy Ireland has predicted it can produce wind energy for €50 per kilowatt hour. We are still €70 off from giving energy at a good rate in order to bring down people's electricity bills. The Government has given a €600 credit to be paid in €200 instalments but that is inclusive of VAT, which means the credit is actually €550. Every time we ask the Government to help, it is coming to the base in second and third place. We have to push and push it all the time. It is as if it is disconnected from the working people of Ireland. Every time the Rural Independent Group asks the Government to do something, it tries to make it its own idea. The Impaired Farm Credit Bill will come before the House for a vote tomorrow night. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, rejected it and did not even want to amend it to allow for the protection of the family home from vulture funds. Members of the Government will come to the Chamber tomorrow night representing counties. I am looking across the Chamber at Deputies who represent counties. They will be watched tomorrow night, if they vote against their county, the farming community and the family homes of people who put them in the House to represent them. Every one of those Deputies will be watched tomorrow night to see what they do to vulnerable people in this country. That is what the Government should look at, not the protection of banks and vulture funds. It should come down to earth to working class people on the ground who are paying through the nose for everything. All the Government does is to create inflation, which is bringing more hardship on them. Three butcher shops have closed in Newcastle West due to energy costs. I visited one butcher recently who told me his family had 100 years of tradition as butchers but he is close to closing his doors. He said he can either raise prices, which he knows people cannot afford, or close the doors. People will then go to the big supermarkets where there is a monopoly. This is about small and medium enterprises. I was in Limerick the other night where we have seen SMEs flourish, but we have small companies and businesses that are crying out for help. The people on the ground and the grassroots are looking for help. I ask the Minister to look at the people the Government represents.

While I welcome the extension of the fuel allowance thresholds, I asked the Minister by way of a Topical Issue matter a year or so ago about those people who are left outside the scheme and do not qualify for it because they are on welfare benefits. For instance, a pensioner living with a cancer patient on illness benefit will not qualify for the fuel allowance. People on contributory payments, such as jobseeker's benefit, illness benefit, enhanced illness benefit, occupational injuries benefit, maternity benefit or disabled benefit will not qualify either. I raised this issue previously with this Minister. This situation is entirely wrong and not acceptable. These people would not have received benefit payments if they had not paid stamps in the first place. To think that they are ruled out of qualifying for fuel allowance is very hurtful to some. They are constantly making it known that they are being left behind. The cost of fuel is hurting and hitting so many people.The Government says it will do something about a cap but it is far too late and it is not enough. Electricity companies are raking it in. Their profits have tripled. Does this mean that the Government is taking three times the amount of tax?  Pensioners living on their own are still struggling. Perhaps a couple on two pensions are barely surviving but pensioners living on their own are really struggling to pay for everything such as a car, especially people in rural Ireland who have no public transport. As has been said, young families where parents are working must leave their children in crèches and pay baby-sitters. They are paying for fuel and everything else. Anyone on the road is murdered with extreme costs. Fuel, be it diesel or petrol, costs more than €2 per litre. It is not acceptable. The Government promised it would do something about that in the budget but it did not help those people at all. Those people are paying for us in this House while facing taxes of every creed and description. They are being driven down to the ground.  When we press the Taoiseach about a category of people who are under pressure, he invariably tells them to go to their community welfare officer as they should be entitled to the supplementary welfare payment. There are so many people who are trying to access this payment but cannot access their CWOs because there are reams of people, some of whom are coming from other countries, and they cannot get inside the door. If there are more people outside the counter, the Government must put more staff inside the counter to deal with them. It is just common sense. Telling people living in rural Ireland in places like Lauragh and Gneevgullia to come back to their social welfare office tomorrow is not satisfactory for them or for me representing them. It is not good enough. If the Government is ensuring there are more people going to community welfare offices, it needs to put more people on the other side of the counter but it has not done that. It has not provided more doctors in communities when thousands more depend on them. We were already struggling. The Government has done nothing to address that. It is not good enough to just provide a roof and a bed for people. You need to have services as well.

The measures announced such as the extension of fuel allowance thresholds, electricity credit payments, double child benefit payments and the once-off €500 payment to recipients of the working family payment will go some way to reducing anxieties and alleviating the fears of those on low incomes regarding their ability to afford daily necessities. However, it is bitterly disappointing that social welfare increases will not match rates of inflation and in the medium to longer term, this will mean that more families could struggle next year as their finances do not stretch as far. While we strongly welcome many of the measures introduced in budget 2023 to help protect families this winter with essentials, we fear these measures do not go far enough to alleviate the financial struggles families are facing. We hear first-hand from families across the country who are anxious about whether there will be enough money for food, heat, electricity and clothing.  The reality for people who apply for a disability payment is that they are waiting well over eight weeks before they are turned down for the payment. They then have to appeal and must wait for weeks and weeks again. I heard from one lady who has been waiting for well over nine weeks for a disability payment. One lady who came to see me in my clinic two weeks ago told me that the budget did nothing for her. She was very critical of me for not putting up a strong argument. She had cancer last year and is only able to work three days a week. She does not want to go and there are "X"s and "O"s and social welfare continuously chases her to get full-time employment. She is trying to live on €300 per week. She said she is getting nothing - nothing to fill the oil tank at home and to put fuel in the car and insure it. She said: "I'm getting nothing." She said she is falling between every crack. She is earning €300 per week. She is happy with her job and is happy to work. If she could work full time, she said she certainly would but she does not have the ability to do so. Unfortunately, for many reasons, she is falling between the cracks.  Carers receiving carer's allowance, which is means tested. It is mainly women who are carers. Many carers spend hours every day taking care of the patient. When they are means tested and if their spouse or partner is working, their allowance is reduced. This payment should never be means tested. If a person takes on the role of carer, he or she needs to be paid accordingly. But for carers, our overflowing hospitals would be in dire straits. Carers need to be paid without being means tested. What they get is a pittance compared to what a hospital, home help or nursing home would cost the State. While we welcome the increases, we believe they do not go far enough to protect the most financially vulnerable. That was why the Rural Independent Group Deputies called for a €20 per week increase in all weekly social welfare payments. The reality is that the cost-of-living crisis is having a profound impact on the high proportion of individuals in Ireland who are unemployed, have a long-term illness or disability, live alone or are single parents. This is because such households spend a greater proportion of their income on essentials, which exposes them to price increases in the shops and hikes in energy prices.  Core social welfare rates were not increased in two out of the past four budgets. Older people are living in fear this winter. That fear stems from not knowing whether they can afford to light or heat their homes or put food on the table. This is why the Rural Independent Group sought an increase of €20 per week in our pre-budget submission and, therefore, we are disappointed that the Government has chosen not to protect older people's weekly spending power sufficiently. A €12 per week increase simply will not give pensioners the same spending power they had in January 2022.  The pension rights of CE scheme supervisors were mentioned in the debate. They should get these pension rights. Even though there has been some rectification of the wrong done to them for years, many of them have not received their payments. Some of them came to see me in my clinic last weekend. Some have received payments and others have not, which is unfair. This needs to be rectified urgently because it has been going on for years.  I was contacted by an accountant yesterday. Businesses are struggling. Many of them are on their knees. One accountant who deals with quite a lot of businesses in west Cork told me yesterday that he paid their electricity bill himself. I know this will not last for long. They are meant to get the subsidy in February 2023. He pleaded with me to urge the Government to bring that forward because quite a lot of these businesses are on the brink. They are café owners, restaurant owners and pub owners. They are telling him they are on the brink. One business would have gone to the wall yesterday morning but for him writing a cheque himself. This cannot continue. That is what is happening.

There are certain elements of it that are most welcome. However, the one thing of which we must be very mindful is the ever-increasing rate of inflation. In terms of what €100 will do in terms of spending power, we are not very far away from a bag of coal costing €50. In many cases, it is already over €40. Everything is so expensive. There has been a massive increase in the cost of electricity. Despite the allowances certain categories of people might have, it is still not near enough because the cost of a unit of electricity is gone through the roof. People are struggling to keep pace with inflation, which is so difficult. We are talking about people who are unemployed, people with disabilities, people living alone and pensioners on the contributory or non-contributory pension. There is an awful anomaly when it comes to getting the fuel allowance. The fuel allowance is so important to people; it is vital. There are people who might never have needed it previously but they certainly need it now because fuel poverty is becoming a real issue.Regarding what the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications is trying to do, previously, people were able to go along and get a bag of turf easily and accessibly in their local shops. Thanks to this Government, they cannot do this now. At a time when heat and looking after people are so important, surely this was a stupid and wrong decision. Nothing will ever stop us from saying how stupid and wrong it was. One thing I want to do in the short time I have, and I know the Minister will be interested in this because she prides herself on what these people do, is to thank the people in County Kerry who work in our Intreo offices and deal with people every day. These are our representatives who explain things in the best way they can. There are, of course, times when they have bad news for people, in that they cannot give them an allowance or what they are looking for, but these officials are extremely kind and diligent people. I will not start naming them, but several individuals, in Killorglin, for example, retired recently who were what I would call the real, sound ambassadors for the State in that they always did their best for their clients, as we call them. They always assisted and helped and were kind in every way they could. They went far beyond the call of duty in trying to help and assist people. I again publicly thank those people. They are so important to the system because they are the representatives on the ground dealing with applicants. Returning to the situation on the ground, we must do more because of inflation. There was a time when it could have been classed as meaningful if the pension went up by a fiver a week and as something people could do something with. Where would a pensioner be going now, for God's sake, with a fiver? The cost of everything has gone through the roof so much that we must be meaningful in the changes we make in future. We must consider every way we can assist people, especially vulnerable people. There are people, such as carers, working in the community and helping to keep people in their own homes. If people want to be kept in their own homes, let us consider the cost the State would have to bear if those people were instead inside in community or district hospitals and we were trying to take care of them there at enormous cost. This type of work is invaluable and we must try to ensure that we pay the carers and make it easier and more accessible for them to get a payment. This should be done in such a way as to allow them to be able to provide this much wanted and needed service to those people who want to stay in their own homes for as long as they possibly can. In future, we must always try to remember the less well-off. We must try to think of making their lot better. We must try to ensure we have a greater understanding of how difficult it is for people. Recently, I highlighted a case very publicly of a person who had a couple of lumps of coal in her fire in her house. This woman was aged over 80 and was sparing the bit of coal she had outside in a bag in the hallway leading into the house because of its cost. To be honest with the Minister, it was very sad to see a person in that type of vulnerable situation. This woman was living, sleeping and eating in that room and trying her best to keep that room warm. As we say at home, it would be easy to make a shirt for yourself after looking at a situation like that. I want the Minister to understand this point.  I thank her for always being very understanding in her role and for having her feet firmly on the ground concerning this issue.

It is good to see the goals of our recent budget fully realised and put into the legislation. After all, families who rely on welfare need as much help as they can get, and sooner rather than later. We can see the rising costs in the context of prices. Even for the immediate future, we are seemingly going to have a very harsh winter inbound. I welcome the €283,000 in social welfare supports paid to people in County Carlow so far. This direct financial aid to those in need has been impactful, especially when combined with the upcoming Christmas bonus, the double payment for those on welfare supports, ensuring that families will receive a double children's allowance payment before Christmas, alongside an increase in the rate of fuel allowance. All this is so important, but children must be a priority for the Government in future. Some areas do need improvement, namely, the exceptional needs payment, to which others have referred. While I welcome it in principle, it just takes too long to implement. Is there any other way to speed up the delivery of these payments to those who need them? People are coming into my office regarding a freezer, a fridge or even a bed. I also compliment the staff in the Department of Social Protection. They are doing their best and there are many payments to go out. Will the Minister look at this?  It is vital that people suffering from the impact of unforeseen complications be cared for quickly and effectively, rather than getting access to these payments when it may be too late. Many people are waiting and telling me they are going to try to save their money and buy the item themselves. They may not have the money, but they have to do something. It is important that we look after the most vulnerable in our society and I welcome the supports listed in this Bill. I also compliment the Minister on her commitment and dedication and on the work she has done on this legislation.

I acknowledge the work of the Minister and her officials in County Clare and throughout the country in respect of what the Department has done to support our most vulnerable people. Little did we think we would have a war break out on the Continent, and an illegal war at that. God knows when it will finish. The Government needs to respond to this situation. I believe strongly that the Minister has shown great leadership. She made a strong plea for her Department In budget negotiations. She put us in a position whereby we could give unprecedented supports, particularly regarding the targeted measures incorporated in the budget and, indeed, in this Bill. I support her in this regard. These are difficult times. If we had more money available, we could have given more, especially for the weekly payments, but these are set to increase in the new year. This is welcome. I note as well, however, that the Opposition parties did not have any targeted measures included in their budget submissions. The Government has led the way on this issue, just as it did during Covid-19. The Minister has been solid on this and I compliment her. I look forward to the Bill passing with my full support.

I compliment the Minister on the work she is doing and the co-operation in all the work she is doing in the Department. I and many others greatly appreciate it. I wish to raise several issues. One is the disregard of the half-rate carer's allowance. This is an important aspect. It must be acknowledged that this was an issue in respect of the fuel allowance. Turning to the issue of the CE schemes, and the brief mention of the supervisors in this context, the eligibility criteria for these schemes make it difficult for communities to get people to participate in them. Keeping people aged over 55 on these schemes should be explored in this context. I refer in particular to vulnerable people who have been on these schemes previously. Perhaps there might be a little flexibility in this regard. People use as much flexibility as is possible within the schemes, but there may be scope here for people who are on a scheme and would like to stay on it. They may not have an alternative of going into full-time employment, and these may well be vulnerable people. There is something that can be examined in this context. I spoke about people with disabilities. The disability allowance is welcome. It is, however, a means-tested payment. Schemes are coming, and I refer especially to the development of social farming schemes, and participants joining those. A new scheme should be brought in for people with disabilities. They are going on different schemes now, such as work placements, social farming or their equivalent in different communities. A flexible scheme, with income disregard, in which people can participate, should be brought in.Time out of number at the Joint Committee on Disability Matters on a Thursday morning advocates and, indeed, people with disabilities talk about how if they go into work they would lose the medical card or the disability allowance. There is scope. I know that the departmental officials and the Minister would examine how that could be looked at. On the carer's allowance and the carer's benefit, the carer's benefit was an innovative scheme. At this point, it is payable for two years. Is it possible to have the carer's benefit extended? I constantly say that we should look at it from the State's point of view because the services are being provided by carers and that it should be care-assessed rather than means-assessed. When people are providing full-time care, that will cost big money. At this point in time, it is something that could be looked at because it would benefit people who give up full-time employment to look after a parent, a sibling or a child on a full-time basis and they have no income after two years. There is something that could be examined, or maybe extend the carer's benefit. I compliment the Minister and the Government on all the work they are doing and the extra money that is desperately badly needed to continue the good work.

Listening to the Government benches today, one would swear Sinn Féin did not produce an alternative budget. One would swear Deputy Kerrane did not go and fully cost an alternative budget when it came to social welfare measures. It was fully costed by Departments of Government. Listening to what has been thrown across, like much of the stuff that the Government is trying to put in, it does not add up. We are in the middle of one of the toughest cost-of-living crises we have seen since the days of Fine Gael austerity. This cost-of-living crisis affects all people on this island but it affects those who are most vulnerable the most. Increases in social welfare payments are welcome during these times but the measures in budget 2023 are not enough to meet the rising costs of food, fuel and rent. Those who are the most vulnerable are squeezed the most and any steps taken by Government to address this must put these people front and centre. When it comes to emergency payments, they are not emergency payments at all they take that long for people to access. I have constituents who have applied for fuel allowance who were refused because one individual in the household does not have a qualifying payment. There could be three people with a qualifying payment in a household, but one without, which disqualifies the whole household. One person in a family who is on minimum wage disqualifies the rest of the household from getting fuel allowance. These are the families who are struggling to heat their homes this winter. Sinn Féin has called for a discretionary fund to be established to ensure workers and families who are not eligible for fuel allowance but are struggling with utility debt can receive assistance when they need it. The advice given to them is to contact their local community welfare office and apply for supplementary welfare allowance. It takes up to eight weeks. It is not an emergency payment. Up to eight weeks is nowhere near an emergency payment. Time and again, the Government is not responding properly to the emergencies in society, be that in housing, health or the cost of living. Another constituent of mine applied for the supplementary allowance because they were unable to afford clothes for their children. They were refused on the basis that they did not have a medical need. This should not be a reason to refuse the supplementary allowance, particularly as they supplied the budget, as they were requested, of their outgoings demonstrating their need for support. I have raised this issue with the Minister by email on two occasions. I have an acknowledgement from her but I have not received an answer to that query. I would appreciate if this could be followed up today. I will finish on this because it is welcome but it does not go far enough. The Bill will roll out a gratuity payment for former CE scheme supervisors. Many people in my area would welcome this as they feel that they were ignored for a long time. This was agreed last year but many former CE supervisors are still waiting for their gratuity payments to be made. When will this payment for these crucial workers within our communities be made and when will they receive these payments?
#JoeFlaherty	unknown-#JoeFlaherty-party	unknown-#JoeFlaherty-dob	unknown-#JoeFlaherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	307	I congratulate the Minister on a very progressive budget. It epitomises her view and approach to politics and society generally. The Minister has done Herculean work in the Department over the past two plus years and that is reflected in this budget. However, there are a couple of issues I will pick up on. One of them is the exclusion of the recipients of the disablement benefit payment from the €500 disability support grant, which has been paid. Many of these people are probably among the most vulnerable in society. There was a genuine expectation that they would have been included in this payment when it was announced but, unfortunately, they have not been. I have corresponded with the Minister on it and I would hope it is something that she can have a look at. In the teeth of the escalating cost-of-living crisis and soaring fuel costs, these people are adversely suffering. They were especially disappointed to see that the disability support grant was restricted to recipients of the disability allowance, invalidity pension, blind pension and carer's grant. I ask the Minister to have a look at this and see if something can be done for these people. When she sees issues, she reacts well and she changes. We had an issue with course participants, for example, with Rehab, who would have moved off their disability payment to get a training allowance and the Department responded quickly and addressed that. That was most welcome because a large number of people who were involved in fulfilling and worthwhile courses could have exited them because they would lose their payment. That epitomises the way the Department works and the way it can react when errors and oversights are made. Hopefully, the Minister can have a look at the disablement benefit for me as well. It is great to see the progress on the fuel allowance. I will not rehash, but many people have made valiant points about it, most particularly where there is a family member in a house who does not receive a qualifying payment. This is a progressive budget. It is not a final budget. Hopefully, the Minister will have another couple of budgets in the lifetime of the Government and she can address those issues for us in them. A couple of key points before I finish up relate to staff. Many people have mentioned the community welfare offices. In Longford, we probably have the best community welfare office in Ireland. We have three outstanding staff members there: Ms Patricia Doyle, Ms Bernie Quaine and Ms Jacinta Keogh. Not only in the cost-of-living crisis but right throughout Covid, these people have been on the front line and at the epicentre of it. I was disappointed that a case was not made for the Minister's community welfare officers to receive the Covid payment. They were probably more on the front line than many. Everybody who gets the payment is perfectly entitled to it but these people worked tirelessly throughout that period. It has to be said that the system is creaking. It is under an awful lot of pressure. I can hear the strain in these people's voices when I contact them. They are incredibly accessible. If one telephones them, one will always get them. Indeed, I must say that for the entire Department of Social Protection team. That is indicative of the Minister's leadership as well that she has such a responsive and effective team. My final point relates specifically to the Minister's staff. With regard to the 4% cumulative back pay most civil servants received recently, there is an issue within the Department where some staff have moved from a weekly to a fortnightly salary. Some of those have not been picked up. They have only got it for the period when they were on a weekly salary but when they changed to a different pay type, that was not picked up. They have been told the issue will be resolved in February but I would like that addressed before Christmas. I imagine it is a small cohort of people. As an employer, and particularly given the employees that we have there who are very much on the front line and doing Herculean work for society generally, the Minister can look after and address that for us.

During the course of that debate, he was asked a very straightforward question as to whether he believed we were experiencing a housing emergency. I have to say the Minister's response not only astonished me and the journalist interviewing us but it astonished most people watching the programme. The reason is that in the months leading up to the television programme house prices had reached historic highs, higher than any other period before, and were continuing to rise. Rents had reached historic highs and were continuing to rise. Homelessness had reached levels we never thought possible. It is interesting to reflect for a moment on what has happened in the intervening two weeks. The Minister published a report for his housing plan for the third quarter of the year with no updates on the delivery of social or affordable rent or affordable purchase homes by that time. The reason, of course, is that as of the end of the third quarter, he is behind target. We had documents released from the Department stating that rather than needing 33,000 new homes to underpin the plan, the figure is in fact at least 42,000. Only last week, we had the Central Statistics Office, CSO, property price index showing house prices continuing to rise out of control at 10% State-wide, 14% in the midlands and 17% on the western seaboard. We also had, within a matter of hours of this, the Department releasing the latest commencement data showing commencements are falling by 14%, which is a very significant drop. Probably most astonishing of all, the Sunday Independent got access to a Cabinet memo which showed that at the end of the third quarter, the Minister was behind the expenditure expected by that period by almost €500 million. Interestingly, one of the other things included in that newspaper report was that Lorcan Sirr, who has done very detailed analysis of the Minister's plan, stated that even if all of the targets are met, home ownership as a percentage of the total housing stock will continue to decline over the coming years. On top of it all, this morning we had the latest Daft.ie rent report. Rents are at the highest level of increase since Daft.ie records began in 2006, at 14% State-wide. Most counties in the State had increases in the high teens and a number had increases of 20%, 22% and 24%. In Dublin, where the Minister and I represent the electorate, the cost of an average new rental is €28,000 a year. This is truly astonishing. Of course, behind all of these figures is a human cost. There is a social and an economic cost. We are speaking about schools that have no teachers to teach children. We are speaking about hospitals that do not have nurses to care for our family members. Medical centres are without young GPs. We are told that in some cases students are giving up college courses because they cannot find accommodation. Children are sleeping not only in hostels but we are even seeing increases of children sleeping in cars and tents. As the Business Post reported the weekend before last, we now see young people with a good education and good job prospects actively considering emigrating. This is why the level of public anger at the failure of the Minister's housing policies is rising every day. This is why the Raise the Roof campaign led by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the entire trade union movement, civil society, homeless organisations, housing organisations and Opposition parties will be on the streets of Dublin, having met at Parnell Square at 1 p.m., to tell the Minister very clearly his housing policies are failing and we need to see change. What is very important about the Raise the Roof demonstration is that it is not just a demonstration of anger and frustration at the failure of the Minister and his colleagues. It is also a march of hope. One of the things that Raise the Roof is trying to do, and the Minister will hear this from all of the Opposition today, is to say there is an alternative. The Taoiseach stood in front of us during Leaders' Questions and said there is no alternative to the Minister's plan. I have to say, as somebody who has been in the House for six years, there are many alternatives, which the Minister has ignored, and we are giving him some tonight. The first is to declare an emergency. Yes, it is a symbolic act and a statement of intent but if the Minister declared an emergency and the House declared an emergency, then as night follows day emergency actions must follow. What are these emergency actions? Given where rents are at, particularly rents not covered by rent pressure zones, we have to ban rent increases for an emergency period. There is no other way to protect renters. We also have to give renters a real refundable tax credit that puts up to one month's rent back in their pockets and not the ill-conceived and ill-designed relief the Minister has belatedly proposed. We also have to introduce an end to no-fault evictions whereby those who are abiding by their contracts can remain in place. We need to see a doubling of Housing First as 240 tenancies a year is not enough. We need at least 500. We need to increase dramatically the tenants in situ scheme. Many local authorities, including mine, are still not buying properties because the Minister has not given them adequate instruction and guidance. We need to ensure that properties such as Tathony House, where there are social renters and potential cost renters at risk of mass eviction, are purchased subject to the structural integrity of the property and the price. We have to increase and accelerate the supply of social and affordable homes. The Minister's targets are too low. He is not meeting them and he needs to be more ambitious. Year after year, we publish detailed alternative fully costed budgets setting out what this looks like and how we would deliver 20,000 social and affordable homes every year, with 4,000 affordable rental and 4,000 affordable purchase. We need much more serious action on vacancy. There is no reason we could not be taking at least 4,000 vacant and derelict properties a year if the schemes were properly designed and introduced. We need to use high-grade, long-term, good-quality modular building technology. At least 1,000 new permanent homes year could be done. Of course, all of this could be done if the Minister grappled with the red tape and bureaucracy of his Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, gave local authorities the funding in advance, took off the shackles and let them build the capacity at a more accelerated rate than he has done to date. The Minister will often tell us that none of this can be done. What he actually means is that he does not have the political will to do it. It can be done and it must be done. The opening sentence of what must be the longest countermotion in the history of the Oireachtas, running to five pages and almost 2,000 words saying virtually nothing, is that the Minister states his plan is working. What he means is he will carry on regardless, irrespective of the cost to workers, families and children. I have said on number of occasions that it is clear the Minister will not listen to the Opposition. He said when he took office that he would listen to constructive ideas and engage. In fact it is very difficult even to get him to the housing committee to give updates on reports, unlike his two predecessors. It is clear the Minister is not listening to us. Let me say this to all of those people who will hear the debate and the message from a united Opposition, trade union movement and NGO sector today. If the Minister will not listen to us, he will have to listen to the voice of the people. This Saturday in Dublin, and on future Saturdays into next year, people in their thousands, including Sinn Féin voters, Opposition voters, Government voters and non-voters, will tell the Minister loud and clear that his plan is not working, that it is failing and that it is making people's lives worse. The Minister has very simple choice. He can join with us and declare an emergency and finally accept he has to change the housing policy. If he does not do so, the people will change the Government. It has happened before and it will happen again. I urge everybody, irrespective of their political views, if they are directly affected by the housing crisis, if their friends, family or community are affected by the crisis, they should be on the streets of Dublin on Saturday at 1 p.m. at the Garden of Remembrance behind the Raise the Roof banner to demand a change of housing policy. After two and a half years, the Minister is out of time. We urgently need change.

The average cost of new rents in the State is now almost €1,700 per month, touching €3,000 per month in Dublin. The situation is getting worse and not better. Today's report from Daft.ie shows the highest increases since records began. That is an emergency. House prices are out of control. The cost of buying a house has increased by 128% since 2013. This situation is getting worse and not better. Couples who in any other generation would be living in their own homes are instead sleeping in the box rooms of their parents' houses. This is an emergency. Homelessness is out of control. There are now almost 11,000 people in emergency accommodation, the highest number ever recorded. The situation is getting worse and not better. Every month the figures are rising as men, women and children throughout the State find themselves the victims of a merciless housing market that has been carefully fostered by successive Governments. This is an emergency.In a nutshell, we are living in the middle of a housing emergency. One of the reasons for this emergency, and among the few people who failed to recognise this, is the Minister with responsibility for housing. He tells us that things are getting betting under his watch when all the evidence tells a different story. The Taoiseach tells us the Government's housing plan is working despite the testimonies of thousands of workers and families who tell us every day that it is failing them. The Tánaiste's helpful contribution was to tell our young people, who have no place to live, that rents might be higher in New York. The Government lacks the ambition, policies and determination to turn this emergency around or to embark on a public home-building programme on a scale that is necessary to resolve the source of the problem. In the meantime, the Government should reduce and freeze rents to give renters a break. It should face up to the vultures and cuckoo funds that have turned our housing market into a cesspit of profiteering. We are halfway through this Government's term in office and one thing is crystal clear: we do not need a change of Taoiseach. We need a change of Government and we need it quickly if we are to prevent the loss of another generation to forced emigration due to Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael's failure to recognise the scale of this emergency and address it with the required measures.

Students are being forced to defer courses or to live in wholly unacceptable arrangements. The last three budgets of this Government did nothing for student accommodation, despite there being projects that could deliver 3,000 student beds that were just sitting on the shelf, as the Minister knows. The attitude of the Government, which students and I despair about, is to take our time. There is no sense of emergency in what the Government is doing. We spent the past two hours listening to Government Members lauding themselves for the few pennies they gave to people on social welfare, and yet rents continue to rise. In Mayo, new rents have increased by an average of 18.5% this year. Over the past two years, I have raised the need to expand rent pressure zones in Mayo, particularly in Westport. On top of this, Mayo is left out of the affordable housing scheme. The Taoiseach will come into the Chamber and say nobody has given him any ideas to do anything. The Minister justifies this by claiming that Mayo does not have an affordability issue, but people are being pushed into poverty and homelessness. The Minister has told the people in Mayo, on several occasions that this is no emergency. A few months ago, I pleaded with him to extend the existing housing policy. Imagine one's rent going from €970 to €1,650 per month, as happened in Westport. Last night, I attended another pyrite meeting in Westport and listened to homeowners in despair about what is ahead of them with rebuilding and finding alternative accommodation, with no houses to rent when they want to move. Will the Minister give money to Mayo County Council to build modular homes in Westport to allow people to leave their homes, on a temporary basis, so that their homes can be rebuilt? In addition, will they be able to rent from people they know, not necessarily landlords because there are none in Westport, so that they can move out of their houses? I speak on behalf of people in Mayo, and in other counties, who are living in social houses impacted by pyrite. They are watching the houses fall down around them, while other such houses are vacant. They need the money to get those houses fixed or rebuilt. Anyone who thinks there is not a housing emergency should come to Mayo and talk to the people there.

When it comes to housing, we are at it. Our Uachtaráin, a man who is never at a loss for finding the right word, called it a "disaster" when he visited my constituency of Kildare North a few months ago. A decent home is normally an indication of a decent society, but it has become a privilege under Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, while they stand over the cruel status quo they have created over the past 100 years. The Green Party stands idly by, as the Labour Party did before it. We in Sinn Féin ran a housing survey in Kildare. A hardworking couple with two young children responded:We have moved nine times since our five-year-old was born due to the insecurity of private renting. Our rent has increased by €600 since our first rented accommodation. We barely see each other as we are working alternative shifts for the children to be minded because childcare is so expensive. We have debt we cannot afford to pay back. We have no security blanket to fall on if one of us were to become unable to go to work. We have had to cut down on groceries, go weeks at a time with no oil as we cannot afford the increase in price, yet we wear ourselves out working just to get by. We make too much for social housing and nowhere near enough to ever afford a mortgage or even pay off the debt we took out on our car. We have struggled since we left college and we are still not stable. Our children have no home.This family is not alone. In north Kildare, people in their 60s are sofa surfing or sleeping in box rooms or in their cars. Younger people, who are parents, are now back living with their parents or grandparents, who thought they would have the house to themselves. The Government has had its chance on housing multiple times and it has failed and it still has the support of "I'm alright Jacks". If you are not an I'm alright Jack or Jacqueline, if you believe in society and community, if you believe that a home is a human right, or if you believe it is not alright for people not to have a home in a modern economy in the 21st century, come out on Saturday and show solidarity at 1 o'clock, Parnell Square, and raise the roof.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	313	We are asking the Minister to declare a housing emergency. It is not just about declaring the emergency, but it is about taking emergency action to resolve the crisis that exists in every constituency across the country. In my constituency of Sligo-Leitrim, rents have risen an average of 6.6% per quarter in the past year. Rent is €1,098, on average, in County Leitrim, which is where the lowest rents of the country are. That is unaffordable for the vast majority of working people. The increase in Sligo is even higher. This is happening across the entire country, yet the Minister and the Government are trying to tell us that their plan is working. Who is it working for? It is not working for the people who come into my constituency office. It is not working for the woman, a single mother with two children, who rang me last week. She received a notice to leave after the house she was renting was sold and she had to leave. She could find nowhere to go. She moved in with her sister and her sister's husband. She is now living in a spare room where she will spend Christmas. She has no options or choices. She cannot get on to the council housing list because she works in a nursing home and is slightly above the income threshold of €26,000. These issues are not being dealt with by the Government. The so-called housing plan is a plan for big developers and corporate interests to come in and buy up houses across the country and charge huge rents to ordinary decent people who cannot afford them. There are people who cannot survive without intervention and that intervention has to come from the Government. It is clear the proposals tabled by Sinn Féin and the Opposition umbrella group are seeking change. The Government must look to a different way forward. It has to find a new way that will deliver for people. That way forward must include the building of more social and affordable houses, and to make sure they are truly affordable. A house that is way beyond the reach of ordinary working people is not affordable. The Government continues to call them affordable. When Sinn Féin councillors from different parts of the country express concerns about this, the Government says they are objecting to houses. The only people who objected to houses in my constituency were Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors. There were ten social houses being built in my town of Ballinamore. When they were being proposed at the council meeting, local Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors were the only ones who objected to them. Yet, the Government continues to trot out this idea that somehow the Opposition is the problem. The problem is the Minister's policies, because he is failing not just this generation but the next.

and €1.3 billion will be spent on affordability measures, supporting homeownership in 2023; and— in spite of shutdowns in construction due to the Covid-19 pandemic, economic headwinds and supply chain issues due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, 2022 will see the highest overall housing delivery, highest social housing delivery, highest affordable housing delivery, highest Cost Rental delivery and highest number of first-time buyers in over a decade;further notes that, with regard to:— the delivery of social housing:— the 2021 Summary of Social Housing Assessments showed that there was a 4.3 per cent decrease in the number of households assessed as being qualified for, and in need of, social housing support in 2020 and there has been a 35.3 per cent decrease in the social housing waiting list since 2016, when the first annual assessment was conducted;— despite the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, over 23,300 households had their housing needs met in 2021, when 9,183 social homes were provided even though most residential construction was halted for a 13-week period from January to April;— this year will see the largest social housing delivery in generations; and— in addition, at the end of Q2 this year, over 77,500 household tenancies were supported under the Housing Assistance Payment and the Rental Accommodation Scheme;— income eligibility for social housing:— the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has recently approved changes to the social housing income eligibility bands for five local authorities – Carlow, Clare, Galway County, Laois and Westmeath – with the baseline income threshold for these areas increasing from €25,000 to €30,000, these changes came into effect from 1st October, 2022; and— the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has subsequently further approved an additional nationwide €5,000 increase in all Social Housing income bands with effect from 1st January, 2023;— affordable housing delivery: — its continued roll-out is key to improving our housing system, and acknowledges that 2022 is the first full year of affordable housing delivery in a generation;— Cost Rental housing – a new form of State-backed secure, long-term rental tenure through which rents are aimed at a minimum of 25 per cent below open market rates – is being delivered at scale, and that hundreds of Cost Rental homes are now tenanted; — the Government's new First Home Shared Equity Scheme, which was introduced in July, is proving very successful, with already almost 700 applications approved for first-time buyers;— the Government's new Croí Cónaithe (Towns) Fund Scheme, a vacant or derelict property grant of up to €50,000, has received over 400 applications to date, and the scheme has been extended to cover city centre and rural areas this month;— local authority-provided affordable purchase schemes are also being delivered, enabling people to purchase homes at discounted rates in return for the local authority holding equity in the home; and— the Local Authority Home Loan scheme, for first-time buyers and fresh start applicants on low or modest incomes who cannot get sufficient funding from commercial lenders, has been expanded;— tackling supply and affordability issues in the rental market:— the Government has strengthened renters' rights and controls on rent increases, and in Budget 2023 the Government is making a €500 credit available to every renter, backdated to 2022;— tenancy protections have been enhanced, including for those in student specific accommodation, under a number of recent Rental Bills providing stronger rent controls and security of tenure:— from 11th December, 2021, a cap of two per cent per annum pro rata applies to rent increases in Rent Pressure Zones (RPZs) when the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices inflation rate is higher; rent reviews outside of RPZs can, until 2025, occur no more frequently than bi-annually; and this provides rent certainty for tenants outside of RPZs for a minimum two-year period at a time;— since August 2021, the total amount that a tenant is required to pay to a landlord by way of a deposit or an advance rent payment to secure a tenancy has been restricted (i.e. any deposit cannot exceed one month's rent and any advance rent payment cannot exceed one month's rent), therefore, a restriction of the equivalent of one month's rent is also placed on the amount that a tenant is obliged to pay as a regular advance rent payment to a landlord during a tenancy; and— to enhance security of tenure for tenants, all new tenancies created on or after 11th June, 2022 will become tenancies of unlimited duration once the tenancy has lasted more than six months and no valid Notice of Termination has been served on the tenant;— furthermore, from 6th July, 2022:— extended notice periods, by approximately two months, are to be given to tenants when serving a Notice of Termination (where there has been no breach of tenant obligations) in tenancies of less than three years duration; and— the period from the date of receipt of a 'no fault' Notice of Termination for a tenant to submit a dispute to the Residential Tenancies Board for resolution is increased from 28 days to 90 days; and— the Government intends to commission a comprehensive review of the private rental sector to take account the significant regulatory changes over the past several years, some of which is detailed above; and the review, which will be complete by the end of June 2023, will ensure that our housing system provides an efficient, affordable, safe and secure framework for both landlords and tenants; and— student accommodation:— in October, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science updated the Cabinet Committee on Housing and received support on initial plans for policy development for the provision of student accommodation, and the Minister and his Department are actively progressing a new policy that bridges the challenging gap between the viability of delivering purpose-built student accommodation and subsequent rental affordability for students; and— this will include, for the first time, the State assisting with the cost of building student accommodation beds and unlocking projects which have been postponed in return for affordable rents for target students; and detailed work is currently being advanced with a section dedicated to student accommodation having been established in the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science;acknowledges that the increase in homelessness seen in recent months is a serious concern for Government, and this is being actively addressed:— by legislating for a temporary measure that protects renters who are facing homelessness by deferring any 'no fault' tenancy terminations from taking place this winter; and while this emergency measure is necessary and provides assistance in the short-term, the long-term answer to these accommodation challenges remains an increased and sustainable supply of new homes, such as through the State-led expanded social and affordable housing programmes operating under the Housing for All strategy; and— Budget 2023 provides funding of over €215 million, an increase of 10 per cent on last year, for the delivery of homeless prevention measures, emergency accommodation and to support households to successfully exit homelessness;the Government is progressing a number of specific actions to address the housing needs of these households and those at risk of becoming homeless, through a wide range of support programmes, including:— a new voids programme for 2022 with increased funding;— reinstating delegated sanction to allow local authorities to pursue appropriate acquisitions;— modifications to the Repair and Leasing Scheme, to open up more opportunities to include conversion of commercial units to residential, increasing the number of 'Housing First' tenancies for those entrenched in homelessness;— expanding outreach services;— the National Homeless Action Committee has been established, which ensures the continued coherence and coordination of homeless related services, policies and actions; the new Housing First National Implementation Plan 2022-2026 has also been published and expands Housing First targets, with over 1,300 new Housing First tenancies to be introduced over the next five years; — Ireland has signed the Lisbon Declaration on the European Platform on Combatting Homelessness, committing to working towards the ending of homelessness by 2030; — the Youth Homelessness Strategy 2023-2025 was published by Minister O'Brien on 9th November, 2022; and— in the immediate term, in Dublin, there are over 400 additional beds due to come on stream through a combination of new short-term leasing agreements, the opening of a new family facility and the re-opening of a facility following temporary closure for essential works; and over half of these additional beds will be operational in the coming weeks, the remainder in the coming months;furthermore, acknowledges that, with regard to:— supporting the delivery of Traveller-specific accommodation:— capital funding was fully drawn-down by local authorities in the past two years, amounting to €14.5 million in 2020, and €15.5 million in 2021, with the capital funding for 2022 amounting to €18 million for Traveller-specific accommodation, ensuring that funding is on a sustainable path for the provision of timely accommodation to meet the needs of Traveller families and funding will increase further in 2023 to €20 million; and— a mid-term review of local authority Traveller Accommodation Programmes 2019 to 2024 is currently being undertaken by local authorities, and this Government, working with the local authorities, will continue on its objective of delivering Traveller-specific accommodation, now within the framework of Housing for All strategy and ensuring that a range of accommodation options are available; — housing supports for disabled and older people:— the new National Housing Strategy for Disabled People 2022-2027, commits to ensuring that affordable, quality housing with an appropriate mix of housing design types provided within social housing, including universally designed units, is available to everyone in Irish society, including those with disabilities and older people;— an implementation plan for the strategy will be published by year end to include actions for three Departments and a number of agencies; and a comprehensive eight-month consultation period informed the development of the strategy and identified the key policy and practical steps that need to be in place to achieve its aims; and— disabled and older people are entitled to all of the housing supports and have access to all schemes in like manner with other citizens; returns from local authorities indicate an increase year-on-year in allocations of social housing to households with disability as a primary basis of need; and in 2016 there were 1,179 such households accommodated increasing to 2,093 households in 2020 representing 11 per cent of total allocations for 2020, while data for 2021 is currently being compiled by the Housing Agency; and— planning:— the first comprehensive Planning Consolidation Bill in a quarter of a century will be brought to Government in December and will streamline, simplify and accelerate planning;— innovative new Kenny report style powers will be introduced in a new Planning Bill in December; and— the overhaul and resourcing of An Bord Pleanála will be legislated for in the coming weeks; andthe Government remains fully committed to the implementation of Housing for All strategy and achieving the targets set out within, and the Housing for All action plan update, published on 2nd November, allows the Government to redouble its efforts on priority measures to activate and accelerate the delivery of housing supply."Nothing is more important to this country than tackling the housing crisis head on. After a decade of under supply, rents are too high. We know that. The level of home building is too low and too many young people cannot buy their own home.Far too many of our most vulnerable are without a safe and secure roof over their heads. That said, there is cause for optimism and hope. Housing for All is the biggest housing plan in the history of our State. It is the single biggest intervention that any Government has made in housing. It invests more than €4 billion per year, an unprecedented amount, to build 300,000 new homes between now and 2030. It is a fundamental step change in housing policy on a scale we have not seen before. Capital funding was only €400 million in 2016 and next year, it will be €4.5 billion. In addition, we are overhauling our planning laws to cut red tape and streamline approvals to help get Ireland building. For the first time, there is a fully funded, whole-of-government approach which encompasses every single Department. We need all hands on deck to address this crisis. After a decade of undersupply, completions and planning permissions are up and first-time buyer levels are at the highest level since 2008. Those are facts. The plan is starting to work and will deliver 300,000 new homes by 2030 to finally help to solve the housing crisis we are in. More than 27,000 units were completed in the past 12 months alone, with planning permission for more than 44,000 granted. The scale of the challenge is enormous. Housing is an emergency for all of those people who are homeless, struggling to pay rent or trying to find somewhere affordable to buy. I have repeatedly said that. There is light at the end of the tunnel, however, and Housing for All will get us there. It is important to put on the record of the House some of the key measures that have already been brought forward. We have established the game-changing first-home shared equity scheme to help people who are stuck in a rental trap to buy their own home. We expanded the help-to-buy scheme, with €30,000 available for first-time buyers, and introduced a new grant of €50,000 for vacant and derelict properties to help people with the cost of buying those homes. The first affordable purchase homes in well over a decade have been delivered through local authorities this year, with starting prices of €166,000 in Dublin. We have established the fresh start principle in State housing schemes to support divorced and separated people and introduced a renter's tax credit worth €1,000 in 2023 for each renter. We have made cost rental a reality, after it had been spoken about for years, with rents at least 25% below the market price and tenants now in place. We have expanded the tenant purchase scheme eligibility to include pensioners, passed our first Affordable Housing Act and revamped and capitalised the Land Development Agency, LDA, to focus on affordable and social homes. We have banned co-living and will end build-to-rent only apartments. We have capped rent increases and brought back 6,000 voids already and we will bring 2,500 more voids this year. We have expanded the very valuable Housing First programme to 1,300 new tenancies for vulnerable homeless people and, recognising the extraordinary pressures people are under, we have brought forward and introduced a winter eviction ban. I assure the Dáil that I will use every weapon in our armoury to get bricks and mortar on the ground for homes that working people can afford and support those without adequate shelter. Unfortunately, today's motion is about semantics rather than action. Housing for All is a plan for the next decade but one that Deputy Ó Broin threw out after just one day. However, neither the Deputy or any other Opposition Member has produced any detailed plan comparable to Housing for All. Sinn Féin has been way behind the Government on policy decisions. It called for €2.8 billion in capital funding, which is much less than the €4 billion Government is providing, yet it will still say it will build more homes for less money. That does not add up. Sinn Féin did not even specify how much money it would invest in housing in its pre-budget submission just a couple of months ago because it knows it would be less than the Government has provided, which combines Exchequer, Housing for All and LDA funding. I take it the Deputies opposite do not wish to see schemes such as Shanganagh Castle, which is under way and will produce 600 cost rental, affordable and social homes, because they oppose the LDA and voted against it.

They followed the four Dublin councils and Cork, Waterford and Limerick councils, with more councils to appear before us in the new year. All of these councils are telling us the story of public homes being built in increasing numbers. Two and a half years ago, local authorities including my own in Dublin city only had two options. They either built large, concentrated, low-income communities with insufficient staff and funds or they sold to developers with no certainty on affordability or delivery. That was not good enough. In those two and a half years, we have legislated for and activated nearly every possible supply stream in order that local authorities have more staff and a €20 billion budget. Local authorities can build council housing, affordable rental and affordable purchase homes for the first time in a decade and partner with the LDA, which we capitalised and established, or an approved housing body. They finally have the power to build mixed-income communities. Councils now have all the tools and financial resources they need to build public housing on public land. That is how to deal with a housing emergency. Those homes may not yet be built but the Government is doing everything it can to make sure they are built. There are 25 different publicly funded and owned sites in my constituency alone, from small infill sites right up to new communities. This is public housing on public land delivered by Government Deputies who voted for budgets and Bills to deliver and respond to a decade of undersupply. Councils now have the power to have an owner-occupied guarantee on private sites. We have a double-lobby obligation on developers on private sites. Where they are not viable, we will sell homes €100,000 below the cost of construction. We will do the same on council-owned sites and sell homes at €100,000 below the cost of construction. We will between €30,000 and €50,000 is provided to turn around derelict properties. All of this is being done within a more democratic planning system by abolishing strategic housing developments, SHDs, and restoring local authorities. We have introduced a vacant homes tax and a residential zoned land tax, capped rents and deposits and, when it was possible, we protected people from eviction.

He must think we are crazy. We know where the country was left when Fianna Fáil had unfettered control. We know tens of thousands of people emigrated when Fianna Fáil collapsed the economy with its friends, the builders and developers. When the Minister publishes his legislation and we see it, we will scrutinise every word, dot and comma of it. The Minister has to build trust if he wants the Opposition to support him. The Minister says there is no housing emergency and that his plan is working. Rents have risen for the eleventh consecutive quarter. They increased nationally by 14%. In Limerick city, there was an incredible 17.1% year-on-year increase, if people could find a place to live at all. Today, two one-bedroom apartments are available, one at a cost of €1,200 and the other at €2,000. One two-bedroom apartment is available for €2,400. Three three-bedroom houses are available, starting at €1,600 and going up to €2,500. Most people cannot afford those prices. There are record levels of homelessness and house prices have increased further, beyond the affordability of the average working family, but the Government parties say there is no emergency and that the Minister is doing a swell job. This is how far they have departed from the reality of living in Ireland in 2022. They want people to believe this despite the struggles that people face in securing homes for themselves. The parents of younger adults are affected. Many continue to host their children who have little prospect of owning a home, yet the Minister says there is no emergency. A generation of young people cannot move forward in their relationships, cannot plan for children and cannot even get a quiet night in front of the television because too many people live in the house, but the Minister says there is no emergency. There are record numbers of people, including children, seeking emergency accommodation. In Limerick, there have been a number of cases in recent weeks where no spaces have been left in emergency accommodation, but yet again, the Government says there is no emergency. The current Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has been in situ for two and a half years. In that time, we have had the Housing for All plan, a lofty title that delivers housing for very few. The plan set low targets for home delivery and the Minister has failed to deliver on them. Incredibly, in the midst of an emergency, he left €500 million of the housing budget unspent. Every local authority could grab some of that money if the Minister cut through the bureaucracy and enabled funding to reach local authorities. The Minister cannot reach his targets, having missed his targets for social and affordable housing in 2020 and 2021, and he is now on course for a hat trick of missing his targets again in 2022.

Fianna Fáil has been in bed with Fine Gael and facilitated four years of confidence and supply before forming a Government alongside the Green Party at the last election. For years, we have listened to housing Minister after housing Minister and Taoiseach after Taoiseach tell us that the housing crisis cannot be fixed overnight. Budget after budget has been branded as being the budget that would fix the housing crisis. Eleven years on, we know that none of the parties in government can fix this crisis, because if they could, they would have done so a long time ago. Instead, we have had missed targets and false promises by the lorryload. Young people are looking to airplanes as their hope for the future. The Tánaiste's comments over the weekend about the grass being greener fell flat on their face. He was left looking even more detached from the reality of what young people face in this country. Government spokespeople bang on about delivery, but all they have delivered have been record rents, record house prices and a record level of homelessness. That is the mark of this Government's delivery. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage does not acknowledge that we are in a housing crisis. This is a housing emergency for those who cannot afford their rent. It is an emergency for the workers and families who are locked out of buying their own home because institutional investors have been allowed to run riot by the Minister's Government. It is a housing emergency for the thousands of children who will not lie in a bed they call their own tonight. The Government must declare a housing emergency now.

It seems to be an affliction on that side of the House where it talks about Sinn Féin all the time. Maybe the Government should worry about its policies for a while. While the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage may not think there is a housing emergency, for many people across Tipperary and the nation, the crisis is very real. Daft.ie has revealed the average listed rental cost across the country has hit €1,688, with a record increase of 4.3% on the previous quarter and 14.1% over the year. In County Tipperary, like other counties, there are people living in cars, tents, or sleeping on couches. The average rent increased by 12.8% since this time last year to an average monthly rent of €1,133, on top of an inflation rate of over 9%. One of the latest revelations from Tipperary is that, for 661 people in the Clonmel area, there are only ten vacant homes and only one is ready to let. That is a failure on the Minister's part and an emergency. On daft.ie, there were 17 places listed for rent in all of Tipperary this morning, with eight in the south and nine in the north. People who have approached me include a teacher living in a car, others living in a shed and a man who dropped into my office after spending a night in a tent. There are also people living in scandalously poor conditions with mould and damp. They find themselves having to stay there and keep quiet because there is nowhere to go. I know of one case of a young woman and young child living in these conditions. After over two years with the current Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, we have 10,000 homeless people and 4,000 of them are children. That is a failure on the Minister's part and it is an emergency. The issues do not just include rents. The costs facing young people are plainly out of reach for many. We need 20,000 public homes a year but the Government cannot deliver half of this. As Deputy Kenny said, the Minister blames Opposition parties for objecting to all developments. I ask the Minister to inquire about my town, Cashel, and which councillors objected to a scheme to build 146 houses. A crisis needs a crisis response. Our public housing targets would deliver 20% from existing, vacant and derelict stock, and reform the approval process to accelerate the delivery of public houses. If the Minister is not ready to listen to us, then listen to the Raise the Roof rally in Dublin on Saturday, 26 November, at 1 o'clock. I encourage people to come out in significant numbers for that.

Things have got much worse under the Minister's wardship. The Minister's failure to see this as a housing emergency is a slap in the face to the many people who come into my constituency office daily. They may be trapped in back bedrooms, on long waiting lists for social housing, or unable to afford housing. They may earn too much to be on the social housing waiting list but they cannot afford to rent because of the failed policies. Even this morning, we see on daft.ie that the increase in rents is the highest since daft.ie started to produce records. We have record levels of homelessness, with almost 11,000 people who are homeless. The Minister should look at the facts and declare a housing emergency. Next month will see a change of Taoiseach as Fianna Fáil willingly hands the baton to Fine Gael. It is happy to hand over responsibility for the housing crisis to a party that has been in government for 11 years. Passing the baton from one failed Taoiseach to another failed Taoiseach will not fix the housing crisis. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. The incoming Taoiseach said from his ivory castle last week that the grass is not greener when it comes to the thousands of young people who are being forced to emigrate. He basically questioned our young people's intelligence with this remark. Young people will research housing, wages and the cost of living before they decide to emigrate. They make informed choices. Sinn Féin wants to see our young people come home. We want to put policies in place that will entice them to come home. If he was the Minister responsible for housing, Deputy Eoin Ó Broin would deliver 20,000 public homes to meet social and affordable housing needs next year. This would stop multiple generations of families from living under the same roof as has happened under Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. Cost rental and real affordable purchase schemes would target those who earn too much for social housing support who cannot rent or buy at the market rates.Putting one month's rent back into renters' pockets and introducing a ban on rent increases for three years would give renters the ability to breathe and take some pressure off the spiralling increases in rent. It is time for the Minister to do his job and accept the reality of the crisis he is overseeing. This motion also urges people to support the upcoming Raise the Roof rally in Dublin on Saturday, 26 November at 1 p.m. in Parnell Square.

[as costs rise]"; "‘Housing crisis is putting education system at risk,' say unions ....". Those are a flavour of the headlines we woke to this morning. Yesterday was a typical Monday for me, and probably most other Deputies, as it started with a weekly clinic. One young women with three kids and a partner was at her wits' end. She received an eviction notice in October. She is out of her rented home in April with nowhere affordable to rent. She is going to have to split up the family. She has been on the council housing list nine years and there is no sign of anything from the local authority. Another woman is single and living in a substandard two-room flat in a building with three men. She is scared stiff with fear because of the aggression and intimidation she must experience from one of them, and the landlord does not care. She has nowhere else to go because there is nowhere else to rent that is affordable. At the rate of building she could be on the housing list for at least another four years. That is the time it took to house somebody, from their application to the conclusion of the process, when I became a public representative back in 1999. Sometimes it took three years but it was four at the higher end. Most heartbreaking of all was a case I dealt with directly last week. A women and her two young children were being evicted from their home. They are on the council housing wait list a few years. In order to help, I found myself speaking over a period of days with the woman's son, who is a young child in his teens. He was advocating for his mother. Since last week he and his sibling and their mam are some of the 11,000 people who are homeless in Ireland. I am certain the Minister agrees no child should have to grow up that fast and take on the responsibility of advocating for his family who are being made homeless, but it is the reality. It is where we are now and it is shameful. Despite this, the Government still refuses to mouth the word "emergency". "Crisis", "disaster", "emergency" - Ireland's housing situation is all these things. We need only ask the people I do my best to represent. It is nothing short of a catastrophe for them. I do not care what it is called. I do not think anybody in here really cares what it is called, and how we describe it, so long as it is fixed. However, it is not getting fixed and it is nowhere close to being fixed. The Taoiseach's response to Deputy Bacik's questions at Leaders' Questions today was revealing. The Labour Party leader had the temerity to remind the Taoiseach it is the Government that bears responsibility for ensuring everyone has an affordable and secure home. It is a role the Government is failing to perform. Deputy Bacik welcomed the Government's U-turn on the adoption of Labour Party policy on an eviction ban and rightly welcomed last weekend's reports of impending, if belated, changes to income limits for local authority housing. Yet the Taoiseach bizarrely hit back by claiming we had no plans to fix the housing crisis and we were not being constructive. Just because he does not like our plans and does not agree with them does not mean we do not have a plan. The Taoiseach is running out of road, as is the Government, and the facts do not lie. Housing for All simply is not delivering the rate of building we need and now the Taoiseach has resorted to blaming the Opposition for the abject failures of Government housing policy. You could not make this up. It is absolutely delusional. A plan with an underspend of almost €500 million in a year when we will see the ignominy of the highest rates of homelessness ever recorded is not a plan that is working. A plan that has in the year to date failed to spend €228 million of the money the Dáil allocated to the housing budget this year for council housing is not a plan that is working. A home is not an investment and should not always be viewed as a commodity. The Government must stop seeing housing primarily as something the market will fix as a commodity and an opportunity to merely profit, which for too many it is. I will share another experience from my constituency with the Minister. Just two weeks ago in Drogheda we rumbled a landlord who was openly advertising up to 20 bunk beds for rent in what was a standard, slightly extended, family home. The price was €500 per month for a bunk bed in a room shared with three or four other people in a house that would be absolutely rammed. At our behest, the council intervened and took a form of action. That disgusting, greedy enterprise has now collapsed, but with record rents to collect and no explicit laws on overcrowding, in that there is no legal definition, there is nothing to stop someone else from trying this on. This is the reality of housing in this country in 2022. It should come as no shock to the Government that these failings on housing are being exploited by far-right xenophobes across Ireland for their own disgraceful ends. The Government has overseen rents rising by 14% in one year and all it takes is a look at the Government's own recent report to see that Housing for All is failing, and failing ordinary working people. We know 11,000 people are recorded in informal homelessness figures and that is rising. Some 60,000 people are on social housing waiting lists. There will be more when the income thresholds are adjusted, as they ought to be. Housing insecurity is pervasive across all parts of Irish society. Even those we assume to be well paid are crippled under the weight of the rental sector and the most vulnerable are drowning in it. The State has abdicated its responsibility and placed its trust disproportionately in private landlords and the private sector, that is, the market, to deliver. However, only the State has the authority, scale and mandate to crack an emergency of this scale and seriousness and definitively deal with it. It is why we said in our alternative costed budget, which we produce every year, that an additional €1.5 billion should be spent next year on social and affordable housing and ramping up cost rental. The State must revolutionise its approach by drastically scaling up and prioritising social, affordable and cost rental homes, reducing its reliance on the private sector, moving HAP tenants into social housing and bringing an end to no-fault evictions. Our support for this motion goes way beyond the demonstration organised by my colleagues in the trade union movement on Saturday. It goes way beyond ending no-fault evictions and far beyond a rent freeze and eviction ban. It goes to the very core of Irish housing policy. The Labour Party and our fellow Opposition parties are calling for a fundamental shift in how the State views housing. There will be no tinkering around the edges because that has all been tried. It must be a fundamental shift, for that is what is required. We make no apologies whatsoever for affirming housing is not an investment but first and foremost, and always should be, about a home. We will always prioritise the rights of tenants and people to safety, warmth and shelter over the ability of landlords in the private market to make a fortune passively off the backs of vulnerable people. The State has a moral duty to care for its people. It is the very essence of the social contract; it is the glue that binds that contract together. People agree to abide by the norms of society in return for protection and the vindication of their rights. When the State fails to vindicate their rights, the Government cannot expect everyone to be quiet and docile and to move on. We therefore urge everyone to join us, our trade union colleagues and everyone who is serious about a step-change and a revolutionary change. It is a change that should not be considered revolutionary but it is nonetheless, when compared with the policies of this Government. We want everyone to join us to raise the roof on 26 November in Dublin. We must show the Government something simple, namely, that Housing for All is failing whether the Government likes it or not. The evidence shows that. The experience shows that. The State must step up and build the homes we need, reduce rents and value housing as a home and not an investment.

Of course, in a democratic system people have a right to put in planning submissions if they wish. For absolute clarity, the vast bulk of political representatives who submit objections to housing in my constituency are in Fianna Fáil. It is an absolute objective fact that anyone can check. The second point is that the councillors on South Dublin County Council who voted to dezone land earmarked for 100 social homes were in two parties, namely, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.Those are just two objective facts to start with. We need as many people as possible to come to the Raise the Roof demonstration that is taking place on Saturday at 1 o'clock at the Garden of Remembrance on Parnell Square. I would encourage as many people as possible to do that and to bring their families and friends to that demonstration and protest. In order to put this Government under pressure, it is very important that everyone who is affected by the housing crisis, and everyone supporting those people, unites as much as possible, especially behind this campaign. That includes older people, younger people, renters, students, people with disabilities, members of the Travelling community, people who are homeless, people who are struggling to buy their own home and people seeking international protection. If all of us unite, there is strength in that. Ní neart go cur le chéile. There is no strength without unity. There are five things the Government has been telling us about housing that simply are not true, and to which I want to draw the House's attention. To be constantly told things by the Government about housing that are simply not true is a form of gaslighting of people who cannot access the housing they need to have a safe, stable and secure life. The first thing is the Government tells us is that its housing plan is working. Clearly, it is not. It is not working for people who are stuck living at home. Last year alone, the number of young people aged 25 to 34 stuck living in their childhood bedrooms increased to a staggering 41%. That was a staggering increase in just one year of the Minister being in office, from 33.5% to 41%. You would not see an increase like that anywhere else in Europe. That is an incredible part of the Minister's record. People's lives are being put on hold so they cannot live independent lives. This affects their mental health, their relationships with their parents and their families, and their relationships with their partners and children living with them. The Government's housing plan is not working for renters. Rents have doubled over the last decade. Today, Daft recorded the largest ever increase since it started collecting data, at 14.1%, as well as a 4.3% rent increase nationally just over three months. That has never been seen before since Daft has been recording those data. The housing plan is not working for people who would like to buy a home. The Government says it believes in home ownership, yet home ownership levels are continuing to collapse under this Government. As Lorcan Sirr and others have pointed out, even if the Housing for All plan met its targets, which it has not, home ownership levels would continue to collapse because the plan is based on more and more housing provision by investment funds at rates that people cannot afford. The housing plan is not working for people who have become homeless. There are record numbers of people living in emergency accommodation, not to mention all the people living in tents or sleeping on floors and couches. The number of children living in emergency accommodation has increased by 43% in the last year, while the Minister has been in office. It is not working for broader society. It is not working for people trying to run schools, hospitals and healthcare services, or all manner of businesses trying to recruit and retain staff that are finding that very difficult because of the accommodation crisis. It is not working for parents who are sick worrying about what will happen to their child's development if they get an eviction notice. The second thing the Government has been telling us that simply is not true is that housing commencements are up. Both the Minister and the Taoiseach have been saying this in the House in the last couple of weeks. In fact, they are down 14% over the last year. The Government has been telling us that it will spend €4 billion of capital expenditure on housing this year. It is nowhere close to doing that. In fact, it is almost €500 million behind its projected spend for the first nine months of this year. The Government promised us that 9,000 new-build social homes would be built this year. The only figures we have show that in the first half of this year, 1,765 new-build homes were delivered. Drilling down into those figures, that figure is not even correct. In Dublin, for example, across the four local authorities, the number of new-build homes delivered by local authorities in Dublin in the first half of this year was zero. That is the figure behind all the hype. With regard to the social homes delivered by not-for-profit housing organisations across the four Dublin local authorities, the majority shown in the Government's figures as having been completed in the first half of this year were not actually completed and finished. That has been confirmed by the not-for-profit housing organisations that were involved in building and delivering them. The Government tells us the State is the biggest actor in housing. The Taoiseach in particular keeps telling us this. A fact-check published on thejournal.ie today found that this claim, which is repeatedly made, is in fact false. I welcome the purchase of homes when landlords give notices to quit in order to keep tenants in situ. We were told by the Minister that this scheme is in place and is operating around the country but then we were told by local authorities at the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage today that they will not be buying any more homes under that scheme unless they get approval from the Department. They were very clear on that and said there is no certainty on that scheme going forward. That is what they told us today at the housing committee. We are told by the Government that things are getting better, just not at a fast enough pace. Rents have never been so high in this country. House prices have never been so high. Homelessness is at record levels. At the same time, the profits of some of Ireland's largest developers are soaring. The Government is busy patting itself on the back and saying what a great job it is doing but in terms of housing delivery, even this year's prediction of 20,000 new-build homes does not come anywhere close to the more than 40,000 new-build homes that everyone agrees we need every year. We are told by the Tánaiste that young people will be paying higher rents if they emigrate. This is absolutely delusional. According to EUROSTAT, Dublin is the most expensive capital in the European Union for renting. It is more expensive than Paris, Copenhagen, Luxembourg, Stockholm, Helsinki, Berlin, Madrid, Vienna, Lisbon, Rome and Brussels. The list goes on. Yet, we are told by the Tánaiste of this Government that people will be paying higher rents if they emigrate abroad. Is the Government that unaware of the situation in Ireland? Is it that unaware that rents have gone up 4.3% nationally just in the last three months? Is it not aware that we are the only country in Europe where rent increases are heavily contributing to the rate of inflation? That is not happening anywhere else across Europe. Is the Government completely unaware of this? There is no shortage of solutions to these problems. There were 35,000 empty rental homes on census night, a lot of them short-term lets. To date, the Government has still failed to properly regulate short-term lets, which are disrupting the supply of rental properties available to people. This is leading to people being evicted so the rental home can be converted into a short-term let and the landlord can get a higher return. Yet the Government has failed to do anything on that. There were reports at the weekend of new-build apartments up on Airbnb for rents that would work out at about €6,000 per month. That can happen because the Government has failed utterly to regulate that area, something it could do straight away. Other measures are also needed. We need to build at least 20,000 public homes a year. The Social Democrats have provided detailed and costed plans on how that could be done. We need to introduce the Ó Cualann model and expand it across the country to make affordable purchase homes available. We need to end subsidies for developers and put that money into affordable purchase, cost rental and social homes.  I urge everybody to come to the Raise the Roof protest this Saturday at 1 o'clock, meeting at Parnell Square. I urge everyone to unite behind that campaign.

In the middle of a debate on an unprecedented and utterly dire housing and homelessness emergency, the Minister responsible for housing said there is no emergency and has now left the debate before it is over.If people did not have enough reasons to come out on the street this Saturday for the Raise the Roof demonstration, that show of contempt for the people who are suffering as a result of the failure of this and the previous Government to deal with a crisis that is causing so much trauma, hardship and suffering for tens of thousands of families should give them a reason now. They should get out on the streets because, frankly, people are fed up, sick and tired of the spoof, dishonesty and denial from the Government. I urge them in the strongest terms to get out on the streets this Saturday in their thousands and, it is be hoped, tens of thousands, assemble at Parnell Square and march to this building to frighten the living daylights out of a Government that does not seem to understand the pain and suffering its policy failures are inflicting. It is an insult for the Government to deny there is a housing emergency. Nearly 11,000 families, including 3,000 children, are in homeless accommodation. Rents have gone up another 14% in the past year. Record house prices mean the vast majority of young and working people can never dream of owning their own home. There is no protection for tenants against unfair and unjustified evictions. There are 122,000 families on various housing waiting lists. In many cases, they are waiting up to 20 years for homes. The Government has said we do not have any solutions, but the solution is staring it in the face. There are 166,000 empty homes in the country. Very often they are in the hands of vulture funds, investors and speculators who make more money the worse the housing crisis gets. That is the essence of this crisis. I have mentioned St. Helen's Court in Dún Laoghaire many times. It comprises 17 apartments and the landlord is trying to bully and intimidate the remaining tenants until they leave. Such developers are making money every day the housing crisis gets worse because their property becomes more valuable. They know that and are allowed to act in that way. Let us consider the response of the Government to that. In my area, there are 4,226 people on the housing, HAP and RAS transfer lists. Another 2,825 people will join those lists during the period of Housing for All. Over the next five years, 7,051 people alone will need council housing. However, the Government is planning to build 2,318 units. There will be more people on housing lists in Dún Laoghaire at the end Housing for All than there is now. There will be more suffering, people homeless and trauma and neglect for families and children. I do not have the time to read most of a letter to the Minister, who has just walked out, but I will read a bit of it. He will receive it shortly. The letter states:We are being evicted. I am 55 years living in my home. My parents are living in it since 1958. They are since deceased. I was led to believe all my life we were safe as long as we were lifelong tenants. When we were in a position to buy our home we were told it was not for sale. The woman that is now selling it does not even know me or my family. I need your help because we cannot fix this situation and we are running out of time. So when you are at home this Christmas sitting having your Christmas dinner and sitting back enjoying your family please have a picture of my family sitting in our car at the side of the road having no Christmas because we do not have a home. My darling beloved husband will be put into an early grave as he is a broken man, dad and husband.That is what we are putting people through, and this Government shows nothing but contempt for them.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	400	The Government says there is no housing emergency. What world is it living in? In this country, figures today show that rents have risen by 14% in the past 12 months, the largest increase ever recorded by daft.ie. We know the average rent is 120% higher than in 2011. There are 11,000 people homeless, more than 3,000 of whom are children. There are 166,000 properties sitting vacant, 50,000 of which have been vacant for at least six years. The crisis is an absolute catastrophe for ordinary people in this country, except those for whom it is an opportunity. They are not ordinary people, but rather developers, landlords and those sitting on properties who are making massive profits. Responsibility for the housing crisis, emergency and catastrophe does not lie with people who are fleeing war and persecution. Rather, it lies with developers who are, in many cases, sitting on vacant land and the big corporate landlords who are hiking rent as much as they can. It lies with all of those who are acting to maximise their profits. It lies with the Government that presides over a system which encourages all of that.  I am sure some of those big landlords and developers are delighted to see some protests targeting refugees and saying they are responsible for the crisis because that takes attention away from them. It is divide and rule, the oldest tactic in the book. Instead, we need to unite ordinary people, regardless of their colour or where they come from, come together and fight for homes for all, bring rents down, use vacant properties and build public homes. That is why we should be on the streets this Saturday at 1 p.m. at Parnell Square.

Average rents are €1,700. Apartment building is down 29% and housing builds are down 23% in the three months to the end of October. There are 11,000 people living in emergency accommodation. Tens of thousands more are homeless, couch surfing, etc., and are not counted in those figures. How many more will be counted this Friday? The record of the Minister and the Government is a disaster. People need to get out on the streets on Saturday to raise the roof and protest, and the Minister and Government have to go. Cork is a black spot for teacher shortages, as are Dublin, Galway, Wicklow and Kildare. Some 91% of secondary school principals and deputy principals recently surveyed by unions said they experienced difficulties hiring qualified teachers in the past six months There are several reasons for this. The lack of graduates in certain subjects is a factor, but the major factor is the housing crisis. What chance does a teacher on a contract of indefinite duration have of renting a property anywhere near a school in a big city? The ASTI, INTO, TUI, Irish Federation of University Teachers and the SIPTU education branch have all joined with Fórsa in calling on teachers to join the protest on Saturday. We are losing teachers and housing policy is a major part of that. Last weekend, the Tánaiste told his Ard-Fheis that the private sector is not investing in housing because it is "not viable". In other words, there is not enough profit in it. The Taoiseach said the State is now the main actor in housing. It needs to be the main actor in housing, but it is not. That is not true, and thejournal.ie said as much. Its fact check today found that as the State builds home directly, it invests less money than the private sector and has delivered less social housing than the private sector has delivered in terms of private homes in 2021 and so far this year. The Taoiseach's repeated claim, therefore, that the State is the biggest player in housing has no basis in fact. How embarrassing.  The State needs to be the biggest player in housing. The market has failed. We need housing, but not for profit. The Government and market failure in housing have to go. I hope thousands join the demonstration on Saturday.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	402	At the Ard-Fheis at the weekend, An Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, pledged to make home ownership affordable again. However, an entire generation of people are locked out of secure and affordable homes. The median selling price for a house in Ireland during quarter 3 stood at €301,000, that is €26,000 up on the same period last year. That is only going to rise due to the impact of inflation and higher interest rates. The promise of social and affordable homes for purchase or rent aims to eliminate homelessness and address waiting lists through the housing for all scheme yet homelessness is at a record level with child homelessness up by 51% since April 2021. On top of this people are queuing down the street for a room. People are being priced out of buying a home and nearly half of people's wage are being paid in rent. The number of people being made homeless is unreal. Waiting lists for social housing are too long and eligibility thresholds remain too low. I acknowledge that the Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, announced an increase in the threshold for social housing by €5,000 from next January. That will mean many more people across the country will qualify for social housing. However, what about those homeless his winter and Christmas? Not a day passes without someone coming into my constituency office who is in that situation. It could be due to a husband and wife separating or someone in the home who has an addiction and their parents cannot put up with them any more. In Louth 68% of homeless adults in emergency accommodation are long-term homeless. I commend the homelessness section in Louth County Council. We ring it nearly every day and in fairness the staff do their best. Many of the homeless people who come into my office have an addiction problem. Emergency accommodation is a good place to go but most of them refuse to go there because they maintain that drugs are available there. This is something we must examine given the amount of money the Government is spending on emergency accommodation. Louth is not alone in experiencing longer times and rising costs for property re-lets. Given the current crisis it is not good enough that any house would be left void for any period of time. Two weeks ago I offered a solution to the housing in Dundalk. A local developer has planning permission for more than 500 houses and is willing to put up between 150 and 200 modular homes. I invited the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy O'Brien, to come to my home town of Dundalk to visit the site and the factory that manufactures modular homes which is about ten miles from Dundalk. In fairness to the Minister and his Department we have spoken several times in the past few weeks and in the next day or so I will receive a date from the Minister on which he will meet the developer and the manufacturer of these modular homes. This is definitely a step in the right direction. At the moment people only talk about modular homes for Ukrainians. However, modular homes are shovel-ready, electricity, sewers and gas infrastructure is ready and there are schools, shops and everything else in the vicinity. These are three- and four-bedroom, fully fitted family homes for people who could be on the waiting list of Louth County Council for as long as ten years. People come into my constituency office daily. They would be delighted to have a roof over their heads. They do not want to rear their children in apartments. They want them to have a normal life in a safe environment. We have to facilitate all construction types. Modular homes take between four and five weeks to put together. The company is willing to put a team together to facilitate these 150 to 200 homes. If we get the first projects off the ground people will develop more confidence in this form of housing. As homelessness is at record highs at the moment this would be a win-win for all. As home ownership declines and no further homes are available to buy it is important we do this. The current cost to rent a property in Dundalk and the Louth area is €1,420 and that is the cheapest. The scale of the housing needs is such that we have to make progress on planning permissions and on housing projects that are well designed. I submitted a priority question recently regarding planning permission in rural Ireland. Daily I meet constituents who are being rejected left, right and centre, sometimes for very vague reasons. I do not understand this. There have been too many objections over recent years and these objections do not match the crisis. Everybody needs a change of mindset in view of the enormous challenges facing us in housing. While the Government's ten-year housing plan may bring relief in the long-term more immediate action is needed to relieve the burden on renters. Many people pay more in rent than they would if they had a mortgage. Many students are at breaking point amid the accommodation crisis. It is forcing some students out of third-level education or to go abroad. Recently the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, co-ordinated a students' walk-out in protest at the lack of accommodation for those attending further education. The Government must listen to these students. The market has failed to deliver accommodation for those renting and seeking to attend college. The resulting hardship and financial burden placed upon young people in Ireland merely to obtain an education will cost this Government in the long run. The Government needs to act now because if nothing is done we will lose our emerging talent to overseas countries that offer significant incentives and a better standard of life. It should be acknowledged that the Government is committing €8 billion to the national retrofit programme which will make houses warmer, reduce energy bills and bring down emissions in line with our climate targets. I have had many inquiries from constituents about waiting times and decision timeframes. There are currently more than 9,000 homes awaiting works under the better energy warmer homes scheme, BEWHS, with a wait time of 27 months. That wait time is shocking. I ask the Government to consider the immediate approval of allocations received under the national retrofitting scheme. Retrofitting both public and private dwellings is a central part of the EU climate plan. Falling behind is simply not an option. We need to help the people now by providing greater investment in retrofitting houses as a matter of urgency. The fact that so many homeowners have already applied to upgrade their homes should be welcomed but external factors such as inflation and supply chain constraints are proving problematic. It is crucial that we iron out these issues as much as possible in the short term in order to meet our ambitious target of 500,000 home energy upgrades by 2030. The Government should ensure the grant scheme can meet the demands and reflect the increase in construction cost in order to meet our target for emissions reduction. The upper limit grant should reflect the increase in the cost of construction. If we are to tackle this issue we need to take a much more direct route. I raise also a concern that current and new housing developments in my constituency of Louth and east Meath are still installing gas lines instead of heat pumps. These new developments are going to cost us in the coming years as they will have to be replaced. The Government must look at long-term cost and implement regulations now. We all agree that housing is the biggest issue facing us coming into the Christmas period. There is a housing emergency. Nobody wants to be homeless at Christmas. Nobody wants their child on the streets at Christmas. We need to do more. I have today offered a solution. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, and his Department will follow up on their promise to come to my home town and meet the developers and the modular houses manufacturers. What I ask is that instead of us all playing political football, that all of us in this House work together. To reiterate a few points I made earlier, people are being priced out of buying a home; nearly half of their wages are being paid in rent. They are paying more in rent than they would pay on a mortgage. That is an absolute disgrace. There is too much red tape to go through for people who are homeless. People who come to my constituency office being made homeless say they cannot get on the council housing list nor HAP because they need to have an address and utility bills. Also there is a serious situation in emergency accommodation regarding the drug situation. I plead with the Minister to meet with the local authorities and the HSE. This is a very serious issue. Young people of 18, 19 and 20 years of age come to my office who are addicts and who want to get help for themselves.However, by going into emergency accommodation, it is going to get worse and worse. The situation is serious. I plead with the Minister of State. As I said, if we all work together, we have a chance of getting this crisis sorted out.

I thank Sinn Féin for bringing forward this very important motion. Every week, we seem to have a debate about housing. I am beginning to worry that the debate is mainly about the capital city or the largest cities. Places like Kerry, in particular rural Kerry, seem to be left behind as far as social housing is concerned. There are 171 vacant houses in County Kerry and in Killarney alone there are over 30. There are people who have been on the housing waiting list for 14, 15 or 16 years, which is not satisfactory. The Department is demanding that €70,000 be spent on some of the houses and that they must be retrofitted, yet the Department will only allocate €11,000 for this. If the house has been a void in the past six years and got money before, no funding will be given to it. The five-year extension for planning was dropped because the Government wanted to force people in Dublin to build big developments of houses, but people with permissions for one-off houses in Kerry lost that five-year extension. Many of them came through the virus and found it tough to get money together to build a house, and they now have to go through the planning system again. The Government is trying to prevent short-term lets or force owners to rent long term but they will not because they want to have control of their houses, and they are entitled to that. The Government will not get one extra house out of that. People cannot find places to rent in Killarney. They are paying anything from €1,100 to €1,300 or €1,500 a month and they cannot find a place. We hear talk from the Government about building modular houses. Will it build them for our own people? The Government is talking about refugees but will it build them for our own people?

For houses, we need infrastructure, and infrastructure is water and sewerage systems. We can see across the whole country that Irish Water has taken over the services but there are no adequate sewerage or water systems in County Limerick. Irish Water went around to different areas and said it was going to upgrade the existing sewerage systems, but it was not going to allow for any extra capacity in the towns and villages around Ireland, including County Limerick. We look at people who want to build a one-off house, who are paying thousands of euro - so much per square foot - to build a house in their own area, putting in their own sewerage systems and their own water systems, and the Government stopped that and made it unaffordable for them to do it. On the one hand, people want to build a house but the Government will not let them because it prices them out of the market and, on the other, people who want to move into towns and villages cannot do so because there are no sewerage and water systems. Millions of euro are being spent up here in Dublin and it is bursting at the seams. People cannot get into or out of Dublin, yet the Government is looking at more and more investment in Dublin. I ask the Government to shove it out into the counties and to put in investment. Do we have to take it out of the hands of the Government and Irish Water to give us infrastructure in Limerick? Do we have to take it away from them and get investors to come in to make an investment in our county? We need investors who want to see the people of County Limerick housed. Do we have to do that? All the Government is doing is putting up walls to stop us from doing it. The Land Development Agency has not built one house in Limerick, with all the promises it made, and it was only building houses in the city. The city of Limerick promotes the county, and the county of Limerick promotes the city, if the Government puts in the infrastructure for both, but it has done nothing. Why? It is because the Government does not understand what it is doing. All it understands is letting the Departments block people at every avenue when they try to help, and it tries to make out that everything is its own idea. That is the problem. Go to people who know what they are talking about and let people invest and get their counties up and running.

The demands placed on the entire housing system from accommodating Ukrainians and the record numbers seeking asylum in Ireland, on top of housing policies that are simply not working, are creating this nightmare situation for so many people. Like many other Deputies, I am inundated with people looking for somewhere to call home. Every weekend, I hold clinics all over west Cork and nearly 70% of people are there to see if I can help them to get a home. There are people from all walks of life, including people on low incomes and on social welfare who qualify for HAP, but still there are no houses available for people who have full-time jobs but just cannot afford a mortgage. They have no hope of ever getting a mortgage but they cannot qualify for HAP as their so-called income is too high. We then have other people who are living in a toxic environment but who cannot leave their family home as there is nowhere to go. There is somewhere available for 12 weeks but what happens after the 12 weeks are up? They still have nowhere to go and some end up going back to the toxic environment they were first in. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage has consistently claimed that Ireland does not have a housing emergency. He should try telling that to any one of our 11,000 homeless people or the 130,000 people who are left to languish on social housing waiting lists. The simple reality is that his policies are failing the public and his assertion that an emergency does not exist is completely disconnected from reality. The Government and the Minister have made much noise about the fact their Housing for All plan provides for an annual €4 billion budget. I appreciate Sinn Féin bringing forward the motion. I need to use my remaining time to raise the issue of planning in rural Ireland. We need solutions. What we have has created problems even with regard to planning on islands. I was talking to a gentleman from an island during the week. He had a family member who spent €10,000 trying to get planning and in making sure every report was carried out. At the last minute, it was turned down because there was a bit of heather on the ground, apparently. It is an astonishing situation if a local person spends that kind of money when that kind of codology is going on in planning. There are huge problems and the Government has not got it right. The length and breadth of west Cork, there are towns and villages where raw sewage is going into the tide after all these years. The Government is pointing the finger at the poor farmer the whole time when it is the housing situation in this country that is the problem.

It is very important work. I want to declare an interest in the provision of a lot of different types of accommodation. I want to speak of the example of the town of Kenmare. People cannot get planning for anything in Kenmare. We have inadequate services there so we cannot build anything now or for the foreseeable future. We have a situation where a land tax is being levied on people who have land and the Government thinks that is going to solve the housing crisis because it thinks it is going to force people. For example, if a farmer in Killarney town is farming and his land is being used for the purpose of growing grass, and if he has not budged during the last boom or bust, he is not going to go booming or busting now either. We cannot force people to make a change in their life. If a person is structured for farming and if they are using their land for that, we cannot make them. It is the same as coming along and getting the local authority to send out letters to people involved in Airbnb, telling them they must change and rent that accommodation, that flat, that apartment or that extra room in their house long term. They simply will not do it. What the Government is doing is cutting off a further supply of housing. Between the whole Ukrainian issue and the fact people are going to be getting out of short-term lets and not getting into long-term lets, what the Government is actually doing is making the situation a lot worse than it already is. Everyone seems to say that modular homes are the way to go. I have been speaking to people who know what they are talking about - builders who are building houses every day of the week - and they say it makes no sense to go down the road of modular homes and that this is not a quick-fix solution.The right thing to do is simply, in the old-fashioned way, to go into fields and build houses and give up the nonsense. If the Government had half the number of reports, surveys and studies, it would still have too many. All it does is talk about this. For God's sake, ten, 20 and 30 years ago we were building houses. All we are doing now is talking about it. That is why there is such a homelessness problem. I thank the people in the housing and homeless housing sections of Kerry County Council who are dealing with that problem every day.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	408	Here we go again, wishing the senior Minister was here, while acknowledging the bona fides of the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan, who is present. It has come to a point where the Green Party must make a decision. What is the homelessness figure at which it will recognise that Government housing policy is utterly failing? The figure for today, while this debate is taking place, is 10,975 people recorded homeless, of whom 3,342 are children. That number is going up. It does not record the homelessness of people surfing on couches or in refuges and so on. I listened carefully to the Minister's speech and that of the Deputy who was beside him at the time. I thank Sinn Féin for tabling the motion and allowing us an opportunity to speak on it. The whole gist of the Minister's argument took the form of a to-and-fro with Sinn Féin - I was going to say it was on a schoolboy level but that would be insulting schoolboys - rather than dealing with the issue. Housing for All is housing for some. Rebuilding Ireland was rebuilding it in the name of developers. What we have now is the result of failed policies. In the context of the homeless figures I mentioned, I received an email to tell me that a person has been on the list since January 2010, waiting for a house for more than 12 years. That person will be going into their 13th year on the list in January. The response of the council is simply that, due to the shortage of accommodation, it has no idea when that family will be housed. Ahead of that person who has been waiting 12 years there are 150 to 200 households on the east side and 150 to 200 households on the west side. We set up a taskforce in Galway city and I welcomed it at the time. However, I have no idea what it is doing other than getting presentations. It was to give an annual report. Perhaps the Minister could confirm tonight whether that urgent taskforce has ever submitted an annual report on the situation in Galway. The Simon Community has been locked out of the market and is continuously telling us the situation is getting worse. Not a single house is available in Galway city under the discretionary scheme or the original HAP scheme. For the Minister then to engage in the to and fro to which I referred is an insult to those who are waiting for housing. It is a failure to acknowledge that it is the policy of this Government and previous Governments that has created this mess by treating homes as a commodity to be bought, sold and traded on the national and international markets. The second thing the Minister did was to blame objectors. I do not look on people making submissions in respect of housing as objectors. Indeed, in the environmental area, they and the courts have saved us. People are entitled to make submissions. The planning system should be sufficiently robust and resourced to deal with those submissions within a reasonable and adequate period and then issue a decision. When we have the senior Minister, with almost 12,000 people homeless, telling us that is because of the objectors, there is a serious dilemma for the Green Party. I do not like to go down that route but since 2016 I, along with my colleagues, have repeatedly appealed to successive Ministers to please declare an emergency, acknowledge there is a housing emergency and let us do something about it in terms of public housing on public land rather than the hypocrisy about a mixture of tenure. The in-built snobbery that is going on in the context of housing is disgraceful. Let us have public housing on public land. Let us deal with the waiting list and then extend the income limits so that lots of people can avail of the houses. The Government should be proud to be part of the market, balancing it and bringing down prices. It is an insult to speak about affordable housing. The concept of it is nuts. It bears no relationship to what the average person is earning. We want the declaration of an emergency and the provision of housing on public land. In Galway, there is a ridiculous situation where a deal is being done with the LDA in respect of the docks, while something else is being done in respect of Ceannt Station and something else again in respect of Sandy Road. There is no overall master plan for the common good that sets out what is necessary in Galway. Such a plan does not exist.  Then we go to HAP, brought in by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. Any of us can make a mistake but there is no acknowledgement by the Labour Parry or Fine Gael that they ever made a mistake with HAP, which became the only game in town. In case there is any misunderstanding in that regard, in an article published in Eolas magazine back in 2017, members of the Department were falling over each other to congratulate themselves on this wonderful scheme, with one stating, "Landlord payments are growing at over €1 million per month while the rent run is increasing by €150,000 per month." They go on to say it is a fantastic scheme. The article states, "The Housing Agency’s Jim Baneham believes that HAP is making a real and positive difference in helping to address Ireland’s social housing challenge." It goes on. Many more names are quoted. I wonder where those people are now and what the two parties that brought in HAP are saying about it now that it is well over €1 billion or whatever the figure is. At this stage, it is Monopoly money. All this while the housing crisis continues to grow.  Then we had the Minister telling us about the help-to-buy scheme and saying that Sinn Féin and other members of the Opposition such as ourselves have failed to appreciate how good the scheme is. It has cost four times the original amount. We are onto the third or fourth report. Mazars tells us, "The scheme promotes demand for new housing in a market where the problems that exist are unequivocally supply constraints." It has cost four times more than was anticipated. Indeed, the Department of Finance failed to make proper projections in respect of the scheme. One third of the people availing of this scheme which the Minister has praised did not need help with their deposit, and so on. It has come to a point where one could despair but those on the streets, in hotels or various bed and breakfasts who have no hope need us to give them hope.

It is the defining issue of our generation. It is the one with which we deal most, by far, in my office. The shambles of a health service is a close second. Under successive Governments involving the parties now in office, housing attainability in my constituency has deteriorated and housing need has skyrocketed. In speaking about County Clare, I will provide figures for perspective. According to a landmark report by Clare Public Participation Network, PPN, there are 2,847 families on the housing list in the county and, of them, 175 have been on the list for more than seven years. As Deputies are aware, the number of properties accepting HAP is decreasing all the time. The most recent Locked Out of the Market report, published by the Simon Community in September, indicates a year-on-year reduction of 82%. In County Clare, 1,288 households receive HAP. This represents 38% of the total number of private tenants in the county. My constituency is in band 3 of HAP, meaning that a couple with no children, for example, is eligible for just €400, while the average rent in the county is now €1,167. According to the latest quarterly report by Daft.ie, which was published today, rents in Clare are up 9% on this time last year, and rising significantly year on year. Since the start of the month, Clare County Council has received 54 planning applications. Unfortunately for those applicants, many of whom are young families trying to get on the property ladder, once they get through all the red tape the planning laws are tied up in, they will be paying 5% more for concrete products than they would have paid last year, all thanks to the concrete products levy. There are 10,281 vacant properties in Clare, of which 4,912 are holiday homes. These properties could be viable homes for families but, instead, they lie idle, and will continue to do so because the Government's vacant homes tax is flimsy and ill thought out. With that context in mind, the Government will tell us there is no need to declare a housing emergency, a position with which I fundamentally disagree. Last month, facing into a brutal winter, there were no emergency beds available in County Clare.This is a scathing indictment of a failed housing policy. It is easy to list these problems but what are the solutions? We need to conclude the Housing Commission's work as a matter of priority and put a referendum to the people on the right to housing. We need to abolish no-fault evictions and improve security of tenure. This would establish the private rental sector as viable long-term housing. According to Threshold, nine in ten tenancy terminations are landlord-led and seven in ten are no-fault evictions. According to the Simon Community, the true reality of homelessness is that 290,000 people experience hidden homelessness. We must legislate to ensure the Government numbers reflect this. In this House, we all know that language is important. It is important this Government declares a housing emergency, end of and full stop.

On Deputy Connolly's question regarding the report, the Galway task force will follow that up for her. A couple of Deputies have mentioned an overreliance on HAP. That is something the Government is addressing by trying to reduce that overreliance. On Deputy Wynne's point, the wording for the referendum on housing is being formulated at present. A number of Deputies raised the issue of modular homes during the part of the debate I attended. Some Deputies raised the issue of the housing of refugees as well as general housing issues. We have to address both. There is no doubt about it that these are unprecedented times. We have to help those families who are fleeing such terrible war and persecution. It is critically important we do not try to muddy the picture on that. Those are the main points I took from the part of the debate I sat in on. Housing for All represents the most ambitious housing plan in the history of the State. This Government is committed to building an average of 33,000 homes per year over the lifetime of the plan. Critically, it returns the State to a central role in the provision of social and affordable housing through the largest ever State-led homebuilding programme. The plan is backed by secured and sustained levels of investment to the tune of more than €4 billion a year, providing the sector with the certainty it needs to deliver on the ambition of Housing for All. Let me be clear, and to reiterate what the Minister said, I do not support the proposed motion in calling for the declaration of a housing emergency. The motion fails to acknowledge the considerable and effective action currently being taken by the Government. To further stress our position, the action being taken by the Government is working. Supply, which as we all know is key to improving our housing system, is increasing In the 12 months to the end of September, more than 55,000 homes were either commenced - 27,417 - or completed - 27,773. The number of completions in the first three quarters of 2022 was greater than the total for 2021 or any full year since the Central Statistics Office completion series began. This year, we expect to meet, if not exceed, the overall target of 24,600 new homes as we progress towards meeting the annual average target of 33,000 new homes envisaged under Housing for All. Over the 12 months from July 2021 to June 2022, planning permissions were granted for more than 44,000 residential units. These key indicators show real progress has been made as a result of Housing for All. We are also ensuring the increase in supply is supporting home ownership, one of the four pillars Housing for All is built upon. In May 2021, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage issued guidelines aimed at preventing multiple houses and duplexes being sold to a single buyer. Analysis of these guidelines shows that 16,000 residential units have been ring-fenced for individual buyers, a clear example of this plan working. The motion states the social housing waiting lists are too long, yet in 2021, the summary of social housing assessments showed a decrease of 4.3% in 2020 in households assessed as being qualified for, and in need of, social housing support. Furthermore, there has been a 35.3% decrease in the social housing waiting list since 2016, when the first annual assessment was conducted. The official figures show we are helping more and more of those people who need it most. The motion also states the social housing income eligibility thresholds are too low. The Minister has recently approved changes to the social housing income eligibility bands in five local authorities: Carlow, Clare, Galway county, Laois and Westmeath, with the baseline income threshold for these areas increasing from €25,000 to €30,000. The motion references the affordability of housing. The Government has worked extremely hard to lay down the right foundations required so we can deliver affordable homes at scale. As committed to under Housing for All, cost rental homes are now beginning to come onto the market, with hundreds of cost rental homes already tenanted. We are further supporting delivery of cost rental homes by increasing the cost rental equity loan from a maximum of 30% to a maximum of 45% per project. The first home scheme, launched in July, will support up to 8,000 affordable home purchases over its lifetime. Since its introduction, more than 800 applications have been received with more than 600 approvals issued. This shows the Government's determination to increase home ownership is more than an empty slogan. Earlier this year, the enhanced local authority home loan scheme was launched and is aimed at supporting first-time buyers on low or moderate incomes who are unable to secure the mortgage they need from a financial lending institution. Since February 2018, under the previous and current iteration of the loan, more than €471 million has been lent, which has helped some 2,860 households achieve their dream of home ownership. Budget 2023 guaranteed €250 million for lending under the loan. The help to buy scheme has also extended current rates until the end of 2024. The scheme has been a significant support for first-time buyers of new homes. Since the scheme's commencement in 2017, 35,000 people have benefited from help to buy. Through a combination of Exchequer and other funding provisions, €1.3 billion will be available to support the delivery of affordable housing in 2023. All of this shows the Government's commitment to delivering affordable housing for all. Challenges do exist. The increase in homelessness seen in recent months is a serious concern to the Government. We are doing our utmost to help those at the sharpest edge of the housing crisis. As stated in Housing for All, we are a signatory to the Lisbon declaration, committing to ending homelessness by 2030. An allocation of €215 million will be made available to tackle homelessness in 2023. This will make sure local authorities can provide homeless prevention services and emergency accommodation. It supports the households experiencing homelessness to exit homelessness to tenancies as quickly as possible. The temporary winter eviction ban will protect renters who are facing homelessness this winter. This emergency measure is necessary and provides assistance in the short term. The long-term answer, as the Government has said all along, remains an increase in the sustainable supply of new homes. The Minister has been very clear on an important prevention measure: where a family or individual is at risk of being evicted into homelessness as a result of a landlord selling a home, a local authority will be supported by the Government to purchase the home, should that be appropriate. This, and the winter eviction ban, are proof that when it comes to the extremely pressing issue of preventing and eradicating homelessness, all options will be considered. Housing for All commits to building 29,000 homes next year, of which 9,000 will be social and more than 5,500 will be affordable. Increasing our housing stock will not only reduce numbers in emergency accommodation but is the answer to relieving the pressure on the private rental market. In addition, funding of €31 million will enable 1,900 void homes to be remediated and brought back into use for allocation to households on social housing waiting lists, further relieving this reliance and pressure, which is an issue that has been raised by Deputies. Considerable work has already been completed in strengthening protections for renters. The Government has introduced rent increase caps in rent pressure zones, restricted deposit amounts, extended notice periods and introduced tenancies of unlimited duration. As a short-term measure, the Government is introducing a new rent tax credit valued at €500 per year. Some 400,000 people are expected to benefit from this credit. However, and most importantly, to address the private rental sector in the longer term, the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage will also review the operation of the private rental sector. It will take into account these enhanced protections and the changes in legislation over recent years and will ensure our housing system provides an efficient, affordable, safe and secure framework for both landlords and tenants. The motion also references student accommodation. In October, the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science, Deputy Harris, and his Department, will actively progress a new policy that bridges the challenging gap between the viability of delivering purpose-built student accommodation and subsequent rental affordability for students. This will include, for the first time, the State assisting with the cost of building student accommodation beds and unlocking projects that have been postponed in return for affordable rents for students. We could go on and there are many policies we could discuss. I will close by reiterating the core point: homes are being built at record rates. It will take time for many of the measures set out in Housing for All and for this additional supply to make the difference needed. There is no overnight fix to the issue we face. The Government remains determined to implement Housing for All fully and has brought forward additional measures in the Housing for All action plan update, which was published on 2 November, prioritising those that will activate and accelerate the delivery of housing supply.The foundations that have been laid during the first year of Housing for All have set us up for success. We will see the full effect of affordability initiatives as they build and maintain momentum over coming years. We will also see the wide-spread delivery of cost rental, which is a true game changer for the rental market. Most importantly of all, we will continue to implement, review and revise the plan as needed and adapt it to the ever-changing environment in which we are operating in order to solve the housing crisis once and for all. We need the support of all of this House to continue that good work.

It seems to be a common thread. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is missing every time I talk about housing. The dogs in the street know the Government is presiding over a crisis in housing. Whether we call it an emergency, a crisis, a mess or a disaster, it all adds up to the same thing. In the words of President Higgins when he spoke in Kildare earlier this year, it is the greatest failure. I have met with the county councils in Kildare and Laois on a number of occasions. Kildare County Council appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage this afternoon. In the past, I have been told that the decisions on funding have been slow and that there is a lack of certainty regarding funding schemes. The director of housing in Kildare County Council told the committee today that she was not sure if a scheme to allow the purchase of houses with HAP in situ will continue into next year. This is simply not good enough. Behind all the statistics are real people who are suffering because of the failure of successive Governments to work in favour of ordinary workers and families instead of vulture funds and vested interests. In the space of a couple of hours last Friday, three women contacted my office in tears because their prospect of having a safe, secure and decent-quality roof over their heads is a faraway dream. One of the ladies is living in a small attic space with her husband and child. Another has not seen her children for five weeks because they stay with her ex-partner and she has nowhere to live. She has lived in Ireland for over two decades but had to return to her parents' home in Great Britain as an alternative to sleeping rough. The last lady who called is living in a substandard rented home, her husband is seriously ill and the conditions in the accommodation are making his illness worse. This is what we are dealing with day in, day out. Three women at breaking point in extremely stressful situations contacted me within three hours. Their mental health is suffering greatly. This Government must look beyond the numbers and focus on people. The people in the eye of the storm know that this is an emergency. It is time for the Government to wake up and put a credible plan in place to alleviate the suffering.  Homes should be built for need, not for greed. We in Sinn Féin are at the coalface and know how bad things are. We have solutions. In government, we will deliver 20,000 public homes to meet social and affordable housing needs.

If you are in emergency accommodation with your children, you do not feel you are living in a housing emergency; you are in a housing emergency. That is the fact. The Minister of State came in here and opposed our motion because we did not acknowledge what the Government is doing. This is what we will acknowledge. This Minister and this Government have been in place for two and a half years. The Minister spoke earlier about the facts and the reality. The reality is that under his watch, we have the highest rents in the State, the highest house prices in the history of the State, the highest homelessness figures, the highest number of people living at home and the longest social housing waiting list. These are the facts. Is the Minister living in any reality? I will be honest. I have no confidence in this Minister or the Government. Shame on the Green Party for keeping them in there. I know members of the Green Party who really care about the issues ordinary people face and who do not believe the Green Party is doing the right thing. The definition of emergency is a serious, unexpected and often dangerous situation requiring immediate action. Well a housing emergency requires immediate action. During the last financial crash when I was in Cork City Council, members of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael said the 300,000 young people who were emigrating would be back. A lot of them never came back. The young people who are now leaving might not come back either and that is on the Government's watch. What the Government is doing is a shame and a disgrace and this Minister should go

We are disappointed the Minister did not stay for the entire debate. This is a profound emergency across the State and the Minister who is responsible to this Oireachtas for housing did not stay more than half an hour so he was not here to listen to Members for an hour and a half. I appreciate the Minister of State being here and perhaps he can convey what I am about to say directly to the Minister when he speaks to him. It is about the emergency in Donegal, the west of Ireland and possibly 13 or 14 counties caused by defective blocks. A major conference was held in Donegal last week attended by experts from Canada, the US, Norway, Switzerland and the UK who examined the laboratory tests of blocks from Donegal and diagnosed what is really happening. It is their expert opinion that pyrrhotite, which is an iron sulfide, is the actual cause of what is happening even though European regulations have been in place for about 20 years and the damage iron sulfides can do if they are not regulated properly in quarries is known internationally. This crisis and the responsibility of the Government and the State for it are worse that we understood originally. It is getting worse. I ask the Minister of State to discuss what I am about to discuss with the Minister tomorrow. This State needs to ensure the testing of foundations. In the state of Connecticut in the US, pyrrhotite in foundations has led to a major initiative where the foundations of hundreds of homes had to be removed. We need to test the foundations of homes now. That is the clear scientific advice from these experts. The Government has put in place a scheme that does not provide for the testing of foundations, which is incredible, even when there was testimony and evidence presented at the Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage as part of the legislation passed earlier this year. Even then, it still has not been agreed to. The Government is potentially wasting millions of euro of taxpayers' money where it could be asking people to rebuild their homes on foundations that are not stable. If in doubt, test the foundations. That is the clear advice of these experts and I am appealing for this to happen.  Dr. Andreas Leemann, an internationally renowned expert from Switzerland, visited the home of Sharon Moss, which is one of the affected homes in Donegal. I have been in that house too. You would not ask any human being or animal to live in a house such as this. There is black mould on all of the internal walls that interact with the external walls all around the house. After 20 minutes, Dr. Leemann said he was coughing and we expect human beings to live there. Animals should not be living in a house like this never mind human beings. This family is stuck. It cannot get financial assistance to relocate.  This brings me to my next point. I am begging the Minister of State. For God's sake, how can we allow dozens of families to live in homes that are not fit for human habitation? How many weeks do I have to come into this Chamber and beg Ministers to intervene and to get the Housing Agency and Donegal County Council to meet these families and get them out now? Why is the Government forcing families to live in houses with black mould strangling them and their kids? Why is the Government doing this? Why is it asking families to live where masonry could fall on top of them at any minute? It is only the mercy of God that it has not happened already. This is an emergency now in Ireland. It is an earthquake happening in slow motion. I beg the Government to undertake an initiative to get these families out of these homes. Will it take us being shamed? International experts toured these houses last week. They appeared on RTÉ and said this was the worst example they have seen in the world. The US, Canada, Norway, Switzerland and the UK, all these countries, have experienced this problem, but the worst experience is here. Will the Government please get this sorted? Whatever about the wider housing emergency, will the Government intervene as soon as possible here, talk to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, and get this sorted out?

I ask the Minister to outline the Government's response to the escalation in the conflict in Ukraine, particularly the targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure.

The Russians have complete belief in hybrid, asymmetrical warfare and we need a response.

It is crucial that international law is respected and Ireland has been to the forefront of efforts at the United Nations to hold Russia accountable and to bring an end to the war in Ukraine as soon as possible. We have been consistent and vocal at the Security Council in our condemnation of Russia's actions and in calling out Russian disinformation. Ireland will continue to use our seat at the Security Council to call for an end to Russia's war of aggression, to push for the protection of civilians and to demand real accountability. Ireland welcomed the eighth EU sanctions package against Russia on 6 October and has called for consideration of further measures to cut off the Kremlin’s remaining sources of revenue. The measures we have imposed are having a significant impact and we will continue to work together with EU partners to maintain this pressure.  The recent large-scale attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure in Ukraine constitute another unacceptable escalation of the war and civilians are paying the highest price. Those responsible must be held to account. The Government remains deeply concerned by the humanitarian situation in Ukraine, particularly as winter approaches and in light of Russia’s ongoing attacks on critical infrastructure. We are grateful to the UN and other partners for their ongoing efforts. We know there is only one way to end the suffering in Ukraine, and that is for Russia to end its illegal war, withdraw its forces from the territory of Ukraine and restore peace.  Ireland’s solidarity with Ukraine is steadfast and resolute. We remain committed to supporting the people and Government of Ukraine for as long as it takes.  Ireland has to date provided €20 million in humanitarian support and has committed almost €70 million in non-lethal assistance to Ukraine. I will shortly be announcing an additional bilateral package of assistance to Ukraine to help address immediate financing needs.

People were killed in Poland recently, and, unfortunately, this is what happens in war. The Irish people have shown significant solidarity with those dealing with Russian munitions daily. Things are not going particularly well for Vladimir Putin in the war, but the problem in this regard is that he has taken aim at civilians. He has tried to operate any level of asymmetrical warfare or hybrid operations that he thinks will have an impact. We have seen the attacks undertaken and the increase in the number of refugees who we will be dealing with in the near future. This is something Europe must deal with across the board. We have our issues here in this regard as well.

We may have seen up to 250,000 people killed already, and perhaps 200,000 of those have been military personnel on both sides. It is hard to know what the figure is in respect of civilian losses, but it could be anything between 40,000 and 60,000 people, or maybe more. This is horrific. We know the brutality with which civilians have been treated because we have, unfortunately, seen their corpses and mass graves. Many of these people were tortured and brutalised, some with their hands tied behind their backs. This is a horror show in the context of human suffering and this is why Ireland has taken such a clear view concerning this war and why we will continue to take a very clear view in respect of accountability for the war crimes that are likely to have taken place. We will continue to support Ukrainians who have had to flee. Here in Ireland, we now have about 63,000 or 64,000 refugees and this number will continue to grow. Through the European Peace Facility, EPF, we will continue to support the Ukrainian military to defend its people and country. We will also continue to increase the supports we provide from a humanitarian perspective to help the Ukrainian people, or as many as we can, through what is going to be a very difficult winter.

Hopefully, there will be a time when a straight player, such as Ireland, will be able to play a role in this regard. We all accept this opening does not seem to be there now, but we must live in hope and be prepared for such a situation. On a European basis, and beyond, we must deal with the energy crisis. I refer to the specific difficulties we have across Europe, but beyond this I mention as well as the particular issues occurring now in Ukraine as the Russians attempt to freeze people out. We have also had low-level-type hybrid operations undertaken by the Kremlin and the Russian Embassy here. I call for the Russian ambassador to be given his ticket home. I accept this might not be the line the Government is going to espouse, so are we looking at anything from a diplomatic perspective regarding dealing with this embassy?

I can understand this anger and frustration when we see images daily of civilians and infrastructure being targeted and homes, apartment complexes, shopping centres and hospitals having been targeted and hit with missiles, drones etc.I understand that sentiment, but my job is to be a Minister for Foreign Affairs who tries to think ahead and tries to ensure that we have diplomatic channels open, if and when they may be useful in the future. We have at least 200 people living in Russia. There are probably more, but 200 registered with our embassy there. The embassy in Moscow is also responsible for a number of other countries bordering Russia. Like virtually every other country in the world, maintaining diplomatic channels while at the same time being clear and critical of the role that Russia is playing in this war, the illegality of it and the brutality of it, is the appropriate way to continue our efforts. One cannot call for Ireland to be ready to make a diplomatic intervention and at the same time shut off diplomatic channels of communication. The two do not go together. Having said that, I understand the frustrations and the sentiment behind that ask.

The numbers affected by hunger are rising globally, and the food security situation in the Horn of Africa is particularly acute, including in Somalia where experts are warning of an imminent risk, as the Deputy clearly outlined, of widespread famine. I saw for myself the devastation in the Horn of Africa during my recent visit to the region. In response to the rapidly deteriorating situation, the Government is providing more than €100 million in assistance to countries across the region this year. This includes €30 million in immediate emergency funding, which the Minister, Deputy Coveney, worked on for the budget this year. Of this additional funding, a significant portion will go directly to our partners who are active in Somalia to meet the needs of those affected by the worsening humanitarian crisis in the country. This will build on the €65 million in direct humanitarian funding provided by Ireland to Somalia since 2012. Ireland contributes to the humanitarian response in Somalia through funds such as the UN Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF, which responds to crises as they emerge. The CERF has contributed over €76 million in emergency relief in Somalia since 2021. Ireland has been a long-standing champion of global efforts to reduce hunger and malnutrition. At the December 2021 Nutrition for Growth Summit, Ireland pledged €800 million over the next five years for nutrition programmes. At the UN in September, we pledged an additional €50 million over three years to fight acute child malnutrition, in collaboration with the United States Agency for International Development, USAID, and United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF.

After three days of visiting camps and meeting starving people, she broke down and wept at a press conference in neighbouring Kenya. People will remember that. Thirty years later it is happening again, only on an even greater scale. In a year of unprecedented hunger, according to the World Food Programme, 828 million people will go to bed hungry tonight. In the Horn of Africa, four consecutive failed rainy seasons with the potential failure of the fifth means that 22 million people are at risk of starvation. The three decades of civil war combined with climate change has brought an unprecedented catastrophe. I welcome the allocations of money but we need to do more to ensure that the conflict that has existed for 30 years ends too.

I very much remember the then President's visit to Somalia. What I saw in the Horn of Africa first-hand is that there is one difference and it is something we need to be so conscious of more than anything else. In previous times, there was a failure of rains over a period of years and those rains may return. What we are looking at now is the first complete failure caused by climate change. This is a situation that has been brought about where there will not be a return to a pastoral life for the people who live in that part of the world. There will not be a return to the climate system that was there. One of the key things we are addressing, particularly through climate adaptation finance and through our development programme, is not only putting in place the immediate humanitarian aid which is needed on the spot to prevent the fact that 1.5 million children are acutely malnourished as we speak but to put in place the support mechanisms that will enable those people to change the way in which they are living. We are funding programmes that specifically will allow for a different type of agricultural existence to take place there where people will be able to remain and continue to live because we are never going back to what we had because of climate change.

Both the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have a clear focus on the issue of hunger. Ireland has championed, with the United States, hunger at the United Nations as an absolute priority but now 22 million people face starvation in the Horn of Africa. There is an immediate issue that needs to be resolved as best we can, ensuring that that does not happen and those people do not succumb and that they survive. Of course, the Minister of State is correct that the larger issue of climate change fundamentally alters matters. That is why I welcome at least that element of the Sharm el-Sheikh conclusions that there will be a resilience fund to support countries such as Somalia but we need to, as I say, have an immediate and urgent response as well as the medium-term response the Minister of State describes.

That is why most of that will go into Somalia and will go into our partners who are on the ground in a position to immediately deliver on that. I thank the Deputy for acknowledging there is incredible work being done by Ms Samantha Power in USAID in terms of this. With ourselves, they are probably to the forefront in highlighting the issues involved and in putting the supports and structures in place to try to make a real difference on the ground. We need to continue to advocate strongly for more involvement. I will be raising this with my ministerial colleagues at our next European Council of Ministers meeting because this is the number one issue we are facing in Africa in terms of the potential for catastrophic famine. We need to act now before the famine and before those images that we all remember with such horror are a day-to-day occurrence on our television screens.

We all have been deeply shocked by the killing of Ms Mahsa Amini. We have seen the bravery of the protestors. A large amount of people have made the ultimate sacrifice because of this. We have seen the bravery, particularly of Iranian women. I want to get the Government's response on this. We even saw the Iranian national team show solidarity with what is happening at present in Iran.

Ireland has consistently raised our concerns around the high number of executions in Iran, including though the Universal Periodic Review process at the Human Rights Council. I urge Iran to declare a moratorium on executions, and to consider alternative sentencing. The vast majority of those who have been arrested by the Iranian authorities in recent weeks, by some estimates more than 15,000 people, were by and large exercising their fundamental rights to freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.I commend the courage of the Iranian women and men who continue to exercise their fundamental rights. The Iranian security and police forces have continued to respond with lethal force and the level of violence perpetrated against protestors has only continued to rise in recent weeks. Ireland raises human rights issues with Iran at every suitable opportunity, including in our direct contacts with Iranian officials, in contributing to EU policy on Iran, and in international fora such as the UN General Assembly and the Human Rights Council. I have spoken directly to my Iranian counterpart about these issues, most recently in September at the UN and on 6 October directly by phone. I reiterated Ireland’s position when I summoned the Iranian ambassador to Iveagh House on 20 October. In 2022, as in the past, Ireland co-sponsored the annual Canadian-led resolution at the Third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which was adopted on 16 November. The resolution addresses a broad range of issues related to severe human rights violations in Iran. Ireland has also supported the call to hold a special session of the Human Rights Council on 24 November to discuss the concerning human rights situation that continues to develop in Iran. This is an evolving situation. It is very worrying. Many protesters are in a very vulnerable situation. The resolve of the Iranian people, particularly younger generations, has been extraordinary in recent weeks and I expect it will continue.

The level of force and lethal force employed by the Iranian regime to a degree shows the level of resolve. We are aware of a phenomenal level of violence and it is probably very difficult to get the full numbers. A very large number of people have been killed. We are told a number of them were children. It is vital that at every level and forum we are able to bring this to the fore. Will the Minister go into some detail on his interactions? We know the Iranian regime has also put out its own story on how it presents these protests. I imagine, not to put words in the Minister's mouth, that at times he has had need to call it out on this.

This is because of our role on the Security Council. We are what is called a facilitator of Resolution 2231. Effectively, this means we put reports together for the Security Council on the progress, or lack thereof, on what is called the Iranian nuclear deal or the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA. This is something Ireland volunteered to do at the start of our term on the Security Council. To be honest, it was one of the impossible files. Since the change in President of the US, there has been a real effort in recent years to try to rebuild what President Trump deliberately collapsed. This was a deal whereby the western world would remove sanctions on Iran in return for complete transparency in the Iranian nuclear programme. I have visited Tehran twice in this regard. I have spoken to the Iranian foreign minister many times on it. The relationship that has been built up around the JCPOA has allowed me to speak directly on our concerns about the human rights abuses of protesters. We have called for an independent investigation into what happened to Mahsa Amini. We are concerned that Iran has provided Russia with weapons that are now targeting civilians in Ukraine. These are straight conversations where Ireland is calling out breaches in international law. There is also a very concerning situation if Iran continues to support Russian efforts targeting civilians in Ukraine.

He has a level of access to the regime in Iran. This is down to vital work done to build up relationships. For the want of a better term, I suppose it is normalising the situation as would benefit all of us internationally in making this world a safer place. It had been scuppered by President Trump. What is happening now has to be called out for what it is. It has to be made absolutely clear to the Iranian regime that there can be no acceptance whatsoever of what it is doing at present. There needs to be an independent investigation into the killing of Mahsa Amini. Beyond this, as the Minister said, the protesters are in a very difficult set of circumstances and they need to be protected. We need to ensure we are not looking at a further crackdown or even executions, which would be utterly unacceptable.

We have had access beyond what we normally have because of involvement in a completely different issue. Of course, issues are all interlinked when it comes to bilateral relationships and relationships with countries in the UN and elsewhere. We have supported targeted sanctions against those responsible for the inappropriate treatment of protesters in Iran. We have supported those targeted sanctions at EU level. Ireland will continue to be very much at the centre of the conversation at EU level on the relationship with Iran. I have to say it is strained significantly at present given what we are seeing, particularly young girls protesting for a right to be themselves. There is support throughout the European Union for these aspirations. There is also the very concerning imagery of Iranian-made drones being used in Ukraine. Obviously this has to be subject to evidence but I believe the evidence is there. This has created a worsening relationship. I hope Iran will reflect on the aspiration to improve relations over time.

It is to ask what engagement the Minister has had with his counterparts in other EU countries on the recent draft resolution, on which Ireland voted in support, by the UN Special Political and Decolonization Committee requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice on Israel's occupation of Palestinian land since 1967. The resolution is very detailed. It is nine pages long and includes serious language.

We were one of the few EU countries to do so. I believe we were one of only five. Others either abstained or voted against it. I wish to convey my heartfelt sympathy and condolences to the families of those killed or injured in the tragic fire in the Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza a few days ago. Turning to the Deputy’s question, I welcomed the adoption by the UN Fourth Committee of the Resolution on "Israeli practices affecting the human rights of the Palestinian people on the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem". This resolution addresses a number of key concerns that are consistent with Ireland’s long-standing position, including calling for urgent measures to ensure the safety and protection of Palestinian civilians and demanding that Israel cease all of its settlement activities. It has been supported by Ireland in successive sessions of the General Assembly, including this year. An important new element in this year’s resolution was a request to the International Court of Justice, ICJ, for an advisory opinion on issues arising from Israel’s continuing occupation of Palestinian territory. The ICJ is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations.Advisory opinions of the court, while not legally binding, can nevertheless contribute to the clarification of international law and, therefore, given the authority of the court, may carry significant weight. The deteriorating situation on the ground in the occupied Palestinian territory is deeply concerning and it is important that the international community supports Palestinian efforts in seeking legal responses to the occupation. Ireland is a firm supporter of the ICJ and welcomes the increased recourse of states to its advisory role in clarifying international law.  In accordance with normal practice, there has been regular and structured co-ordination between EU member states on the ground in New York, on this and other resolutions to be acted upon by the UN General Assembly. While a common EU voting position was not possible for this resolution, I welcome the constructive engagement between the Palestinian observer mission to the United Nations and the EU and its member states on all resolutions related to the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory.

On the matter of Palestine, I know the Minister is on record as being a strong advocate of the Palestinian people but while that is the case, it seems that we wait for Europe on an awful lot of occasions to see what its position is. On this occasion, the position is divided, although I see 98 countries voted in favour of it, 17 against, and 52 abstained. I ask the Minister, while on the UN Security Council - temporary and all as it may be - to stand up for the Palestinian people. I say this in the context that a year has elapsed since the designation of the six organisations as terrorist organisations. During that time, a joint statement from ten EU member states, including Ireland, said that no substantial evidence has been provided by Israel in respect of designating them as terrorist organisations, yet they remain terrorist organisations.

I remain seriously concerned by Israel's designation of six Palestinian NGOs, including Irish Aid and EU partner organisations, as terrorist entities. This designation has the potential to affect not only these six organisations, but civil society more broadly across the occupied Palestinian territory. It could seriously undermine vital humanitarian development and human rights work. This issue continues to be a priority for Ireland. In the context of the UN Security Council, Ireland has repeatedly raised this matter in monthly meetings of the Security Council, stressing our continued commitment to and support of civil society. We have asked, over and again, for the evidence that forms the basis for this designation and we have yet to see anything credible that links these NGOs to terrorist activity. I think the EU, as in its institutions, has taken the same position. Obviously, different countries within the EU take different positions. I can only speak for Ireland. We will continue to raise this issue. It is so important there is a strong presence of civil society and non-governmental organisations across the West Bank and in Gaza so that people can speak the truth and legally challenge certain decisions. That is how democracies work. We will continue to support the organisations we have been working with.

The organisations that have been designated as terrorist organisations have been directly affected. They have been raided, ransacked and forcibly closed, with their equipment confiscated. How long more are we going to wait before we do something about that designation? It has to be lifted. How long more is the Government going to wait before it gives a response to the Amnesty report that said Israel operates an apartheid system? When are we going to get the considered opinion from the Minister and the Department on our official reaction to that? We were told in June of this year that it was being considered. There has been no substantive response. Correspondence of 21 June states that, with regard to the recommendations and conclusions of the Amnesty report, Ireland will continue to engage with these to influence our approach. If they are not weasel words, Minister. There is an Amnesty report with damning conclusions and findings. What is our official, considered response given the lapse of time since the report's publication?

Ireland is one of the most credible voices on the planet in regard to the Palestinian-Israeli issue. We continue to be at the centre of debate within the EU, trying to make progress where that is not easy. Getting any form of consensus across the EU on new thinking and action in respect of the Middle East peace process has proven very difficult. Believe me, we have been trying and will continue to do so between now and the end of the year. I have spoken to several other foreign ministers, who have a similar view to Ireland on these issues, to see if we can build consensus in trying to introduce some new thinking in a way that can support democracy across Palestine and raise serious questions with a new Israeli Government in terms of its responsibilities. That is how we make a difference, rather than making grand statements or issuing press releases in response to reports, by changing something on the ground in terms of the EU's approach on this issue and our relationship with the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority.

It is very difficult to get over the fact that the World Cup is being held at this time of year. Questions have been raised on how the tournament ended up being in Qatar. The questions are fairly obvious as regards FIFA. We are all aware of the treatment of women and members of the LGBTQ+ community in Qatar, as well as the disgraceful way migrant workers have been dealt with. We would probably all agree with Roy Keane in respect of the failure of some people to mark these issue.

My Department is liaising closely with EU and international partners to provide the most accurate advice possible for citizens travelling to Qatar for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.  Comprehensive World Cup travel advice for Qatar is available on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and citizens are urged to consult this for information on entry requirements, safety and security, local laws and customs etc.  Before departure and during travel, citizens are advised to monitor this advice and to follow the Department on social media for the latest updates.  The Government advises all citizens travelling to Qatar for the World Cup to obtain travel insurance prior to departure. For the duration of the tournament, the Embassy of Ireland in the United Arab Emirates, UAE, which is accredited to Qatar, will have a presence on the ground in Qatar to provide consular assistance to any Irish citizens who may require it.  Any Irish citizen requiring consular assistance while in Qatar, can make contact through the Embassy of Ireland in the UAE. Details of the phone number is available on the website. We are putting a system in place that can help Irish citizens if they get into trouble or if they need advice on the ground. As ever, when travelling to a country that has very different customs and laws to what we are used to in Ireland, people should inform themselves before they travel. Of course, if there are difficulties on the ground, we will be there to help and support Irish citizens.

I get many football fans might see this as an opportunity to see Brazil play. I assume not too many will wish to see England play but who knows? It is obviously vital fans would monitor advice and it is good to see consular assistance will be in place. However, I will go through the questions again and ask about the view of the Minister and the Government. There is a certain element of dismay that the World Cup is in Qatar but FIFA has many questions to answer over many years. There are the particular issues in Qatar which include the treatment of women and the LGBTQ+ community and the absolutely disgraceful treatment of migrant workers. I will put it out there; is the Minister in agreement on what Roy Keane said? There probably was a failure by many from a football point of view, in that they could have at least marked this. There are particular issues that need to be dealt with.

The reason I put down this question is my concerns about Irish citizens who might travel to Qatar for the World Cup and may not be used to the situation there. Even though we are not qualified for the World Cup, Irish fans may travel. There are very few sporting events around the world where one would not see a fella wearing a Kerry jersey. It is only a matter of time before we see one on the television screens and I share Deputy Ó Murchú's concerns. My first concern is over the awarding of the World Cup which I believe was born out of complete corruption. My second concern is over the treatment of women and the LGBTQ+ community at this World Cup and, of course, it goes with out saying, the treatment of migrant workers in the run-up to the World Cup as well. The Minister cannot solve those problems but I thank him for his response and it is obvious the Department has been proactive in putting people on the ground. It is welcome and certainly allays my concerns.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	447	There are a number of human rights issues of concern with regard to Qatar including its treatment of migrant workers, as people have said, women's rights, LGBT+ people and, of course, the use of the death penalty. Promoting respect for human rights is one of the core principles of Irish foreign policy. In countries where we have concerns over human rights, including Qatar, we raise these concerns very clearly both in direct contacts with the governments of those countries and in the appropriate international forums. Officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs regularly raise concerns bilaterally with the Qatari authorities. Ireland regularly discusses these issues in various EU forums and works closely with other member states to ensure human rights issues in Qatar are addressed. Since 2018, the EU has held four formal human rights dialogues with Qatar including, most recently, on 13 September in Brussels where the EU underscored the importance of safety for LGBTQI+ persons and labour rights in the context of the World Cup. The EU also liaises with the International Labor Organization, ILO, on these issues and I am pleased that the ILO office in Doha will continue to operate there after the World Cup. Ireland also addresses these issues in international forums, notably at the UN Human Rights Council. In 2019, at Qatar's most recent universal periodic review at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Ireland called on the Qatari Government to abolish the exit permit requirement for migrant workers. I was pleased Qatar moved to end this requirement in January 2020. Qatar has made some notable labour reforms, including to its kafala labour system, but these reforms must be sufficiently implemented and permanent in order for them to be meaningful. Other issues raised at the periodic review of Qatar's human rights record included discrimination and violence against women, the death penalty and migrant workers' rights. I absolutely understand the scepticism and concern that have been expressed in the context of hosting this World Cup but I can reassure the Deputies that we have raised the issues in the build-up to the World Cup on all of the platforms on which we have an opportunity to do so. This is not just an issue about the World Cup. Qatar is not the only country in the world where we have concerns with regard to human rights abuses and so on. However, of course, when one hosts something as enormous as the World Cup, one has to expect the international spotlight to be on one and on how one treats people and visitors. That is why Qatar is now under that spotlight.

The one good thing that can come from this World Cup is that the spotlight is on Qatar, the human rights abuses there and whether we will have any movement on it. However, I wish to see a greater level of courage from some of the football associations and some of the footballers in particular. There was considerable talk beforehand about what they would do to highlight these issues. That has not happened. I welcome that the Government has drawn attention to the human rights abuses across the board on many occasions. That needs to happen. This will leave a deep stain. Western hypocrisy will be thrown out many times but it is straightforward to say I am not just sure Qatar is where this World Cup should be happening. I suppose FIFA has the biggest questions to answer but we need to highlight the changes that need to happen. That is the only good that can come out of this. Unfortunately, it will probably impact on the enjoyment of the World Cup as a football spectacle.

My most immediate and pragmatic concern is that any Irish fans who travel, from this country or others, to the group stages or the subsequent knock-out stages in the coming weeks should, first, be well-advised before they travel about what is expected of them and the potential risks. Second, we have seen people get into trouble in countries such as Qatar through no fault of their own and support should be there. It is important the support remains on the ground right up to the end. I encourage the Minister to engage with the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, with regard to disseminating some of the information to its grassroots level platforms and as many other levels as possible to reach soccer supporters who are based here and our diaspora. We certainly do not wish to see any of the Irish football supporters, who travel to that country to enjoy the World Cup, getting into trouble and finding themselves in difficult positions. That said, many people find themselves in trouble through no fault of their own in countries such as Qatar. We need to avoid that as much as possible.

The team is second to none internationally. We do not have an embassy in Qatar but we have an embassy very close by and a team on the ground in Qatar to help Irish citizens should that be required. With regard to the links between sport and politics on this issue, in some ways, it is unfair to criticise players. They are sports people rather than politicians. Of course if they wish to make a political statement, they should be allowed to do so as should anybody else. However, it is absolutely extraordinary that FIFA has effectively chosen to lean on national football associations in different countries to prevent players wearing an armband to support LGBT+ rights. That is a political intervention by FIFA to limit freedom of expression, which is worthy of significant mention and criticism. We will talk to Qatar about the whole other range of issues. That part of the world is very different from this part of the world and one will see these tensions when there is a clash of civilisations and so on. However, to say a player who wishes to wear a rainbow-coloured armband in the context of the concerns they may have about LGBT rights in that part of the world or, indeed, any other rights that are consistent with international law will be punished on the pitch is, from a FIFA point of view, pretty poor form to put it mildly. However, that is what we have seen in an effort to try to avoid even a small symbol of political concern in the context of some of the issues that have been raised in the build-up to this World Cup. It is very regrettable and shows FIFA in a pretty poor light to say the least.

We have time to tease out exactly what is happening in Iran and the information being circulated by the Iranian ambassador here, which many of us will have received, and the ongoing struggle, as the Minister said, of young people and women in taking a stand against oppression. I am interested in the Minister's view.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	459	I propose to take Questions Nos. 80, 87, 104 and 105 together. While the protests in Iran started with the tragic death of Mahsa Amini in September, many more young women and men have died since, simply due to the fact they were exercising their fundamental right to freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. I wish to extend my condolences to the loved ones of all those who have died during the protests. The protestor's slogan of "Women, Life, Freedom" is clear and I know it is a message that has resonated with many people in Ireland and across the EU. The slogan was seen during the World Cup in a banner behind the Iranian goal at their first match. In addition to my contacts with the Iranian foreign minister in September and October, as I said earlier, I summoned the Iranian ambassador on 20 October and condemned Iran’s oppression of peaceful protests and supply of weapons to Russia. I made it clear that Ireland expects Iran to uphold its international obligations, particularly the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action. These instruments enshrine the rights of freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, and the fundamental and inalienable rights of women and girls. The EU has significantly expanded its human rights sanctions regime to target those involved in the death of Mahsa Amini and the response of the security forces to protestors. At the meetings of the EU's Foreign Affairs Council in October and November, the EU adopted sanctions against a further 40 individuals and seven entities. The EU also adopted sanctions on 20 October against Iranian individuals and entities involved in the supply of drones to Russia. At UN level, the Security Council held a meeting on Iran’s transfer of drones to Russia on 19 October. The supply of drones to Russia is a serious violation of Iran's obligations under UN Security Council Resolution 2231, which endorses the Iranian nuclear deal. Under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, Iran is prohibited from the export of drones. As Deputies know, Ireland is facilitator of Resolution 2231 and we will present our final facilitator's report in December. There will also be a special session of the UN Human Rights Council on 24 November, which I mentioned earlier, which Ireland has supported, focusing on the situation in Iran. Officials from my Department will continue to monitor developments in Iran and to raise our concerns directly with the Iranian government. We will continue to co-ordinate closely with our partners in the EU to ensure there is a joint, co-ordinated, and clear response to the actions of the Iranian authorities across a range of issues which, whether we like it or not, are interconnected.

While others did not take a stand, they risked their safety by taking a clear stand against their own government yesterday on a fundamental issue. The Irish Times reports that at least 58 Iranian children have been killed since the anti-regime protests began, following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini, including a 9-year-old, Kian Pirfalak, who was one of seven people killed last Wednesday in the city of Izeh. The individual stories and videos that we have all seen online demand our support and solidarity. The Minister called in the Iranian ambassador to Iveagh House. Will the Minister tell us exactly what he said and what the ambassador said to him? How will we deal with the misinformation that the Iranian ambassador is providing?

I attended a very civilised protest in Galway a few weeks ago. We were asked to ask the Minister, as a member of a Government which has a place on the UN Security Council, to call on the Islamic Republic of Iran to immediately stop the use of lethal force and unlawful suppression, to stop subjecting Iranian citizens to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and to stop unlawful and arbitrary arrests and detentions. The figures are rising. Deputy Howlin already mentioned some of them. Some 410 protestors have been killed, with a caveat that those figures are higher. Some 58 children have been killed in the unrest and more than 17,251 people have been arrested. According to media reports, in November, six of those detained in the protests have been issued death sentences. This number is expected to rise. Iran executes more people annually than any other country apart from China, although I understand that in the last week, Saudi Arabia executed 17 people.

He said some of the protests were not peaceful and the Iranian Government had a responsibility to restore order to its streets and cities, which is what it was trying to do. I found that explanation less than credible, given the age profile and behaviour of many of the protestors, including children, girls and students. No country should look back at the management of protests and the death of nearly 60 children and say it was an effort to restore order. It was a straight discussion. I hope I expressed the concern, revulsion and condemnation of this House about some of the images we have seen. I also asked the ambassador about the supply of drones to Russia following some of the images we have seen. From an EU perspective, it is part of a convincing body of evidence that Iran has supplied drones to Russia that are now being used to target civilians and civilian infrastructure. He gave a clear rejection of that and said that Iran has not provided drones to Russia before this war or during it. Since that meeting, I understand that Iran has accepted that it has supplied a limited number of drones to Russia in advance of this conflict.It was a necessary, blunt discussion to express our concern at what I think is a shared criticism in this House of how Iran is behaving in responding to legitimate protests in its own country and the supply of weapons that have been directly targeting civilians in Europe.

The Minister has told us, basically, that in that interaction with the ambassador, he was told falsehoods. That is very worrying. Has the Minister summoned him back since to ask him to correct and give accurate information? Surely the role of an ambassador is to ensure the presentation given to a host country where he has diplomatic status is factual at least? What are the next actions the Minister proposes to take to deal with what is ongoing, namely, a protest movement subject to brutal suppression, including the use of lethal force?

On the Human Rights Council, I understand there will be a special session on the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran on 24 November. I understand also that we have observer status at that special session. Will Iran be represented at that? On the UN Commission on the Status of Women, there have been calls by countries, including America, to have Iran removed from it. I do not agree with that straight up because Afghanistan is represented on that, along with other countries that a have terrible record in their treatment of women. Has the Minister a viewpoint on that? Returning to the first question on Palestine, we must have a credible, consistent approach to all countries when they breach human rights law. It is extremely important. I took back the weasel words. They were not necessary and I should not have used them, but we need a consistent voice and we are not consistent.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	467	On Palestine, which we often talk about here, we are pretty consistent. Ireland is one of the most consistent countries in the world when it comes to what we say about Palestine. I have certainly tried to be during the five years I have been in this job. I point to my very clear criticism of settlement expansion, of demolitions, of forced evictions, my criticism of the human rights situation that is allowed to continue in Gaza, my strong criticisms of the targeting of civilian infrastructure in Gaza when that has happened, as well, of course, as rocket fire out of Gaza, of which I have been very critical. I have travelled to Israel and Palestine many times in those five years. I would like to think I am being consistent there and I hope I will continue to be. As I said, my involvement with Iran has been an unusual one in recent years because of the specific responsibility around the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, JCPOA, and the Security Council. This has allowed me to have many more conversations with two consecutive Iranian ministers of foreign affairs than I would normally ever have. This has permitted me to have very direct conversations on more recent concerns. What happened with the meeting with the ambassador was he gave me a written document on the official response from the Iranian Government on the accusation of Iranian supply of weapons to Russia. To be fair to him, he just handed it over and that is, in many ways, the role of an ambassador. We have of course challenged the accuracy of that document since then. On the Human Rights Council, we have been very supportive of having a debate on 24 November at the council on the developing situation in Iran.

#ColmBrophy	unknown-#ColmBrophy-party	unknown-#ColmBrophy-dob	unknown-#ColmBrophy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	469	At COP27 I met representatives from developing countries who outlined the existential threats to their societies as a result of climate impacts. The key priorities for Ireland in international climate negotiations are finance for adaptation to climate change and financing to respond to loss and damage associated with climate impacts. On loss and damage, Ireland was engaged in advance of and throughout COP27. Our delegation took a leadership role within the European Union and in the EU’s negotiations with other countries. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Ryan, played an incredible role in that. We worked hard to build consensus on an outcome that addresses the needs of the most vulnerable countries and communities. We were pleased the outcome last Sunday included provisions, for the first time ever, for financing mechanisms around loss and damage. These will include, but are not limited to, a new fund. Modalities for a new fund will be agreed over the next year. Critically, the mechanisms will be targeted primarily towards the most vulnerable and there are provisions to broaden the donor base. That was a key part of what Ireland and the EU pushed for from the very start on this. We are really proud to have played a key role in driving through the deal and that particular aspect of it. On adaptation finance, progress was made on a call by developing countries to establish a dedicated space to develop a roadmap for meeting the COP26 target to double the level of adaptation finance for developing countries. The Department of Foreign Affairs has been taking a leading role on enhancing the quantity and quality of adaptation support. Our climate finance is mainly focused on adaptation. Ireland is a founding member of the international Champions Group on Adaptation Finance. It is important to state that years before it was the main focus of attention with climate finance, Ireland pushed this in particular, and to rebalance that situation between the finance for mitigation and the finance for adaptation. As far as where we need to be is concerned, adaptation is what we must focus on. It is within that context that loss and damage will come in because there are whole aspects in terms of the ability of developing countries to access the adaptation finance. It is the key and what we must work on.

I take the opportunity to commend the Department officials on the sterling, incredible work they did in the last two weeks at COP. They are a credit to the Minister and Minister of State, to the Department, the Oireachtas, the country and the EU. They have shown the power of small countries as well. The influence this country has on the international stage is a point the Minister makes frequently, but we saw evidence of that in Egypt. It was a historic agreement and a first step towards addressing this key issue of loss and damage. I welcome the Minister of State's answer. He said Ireland's focus will be on the adaptation. The challenge is so vast but we are going in the right direction now. Back in 2015, €100 billion was pledged by 2020. For context, that is 37 days' worth of profits for the oil and gas industry if we take an average over the past 50 years.

I put on the record of the House the achievement of Ireland and especially of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, at COP27. He was instrumental and central in finding a compromise wording that came from the EU that ultimately was the basis of brokering a deal. There is often criticism of the size of delegations and so on. Consider what was achieved by Ireland at COP27 and at COP26 as well. It was there that the Minister, Deputy Ryan, became the central figure in co-ordinating the EU approach towards loss and damage.He built on that this year. There were other important contributions at COP27 from the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Brophy, and others but I do not think this has gotten sufficient focus in Ireland. The role the Minister played politically, with a competent team of people around him from multiple Departments, including my own, was instrumental in getting the initial EU agreement and the subsequent global one on what will now become a loss and damage fund over time.

I share the view, and I am sure it is shared across both Houses, of the Minister's influence on this key subject. History will show that this was a turning point. COP26 and COP27 are a turning point in how we address the damage being caused to countries that have not caused this problem. We have caused the problem, in the West in particular, and it is only right that we seek to pay damages to help adapt to the serious consequences of climate change, as well as to mitigate climate change. As I said, we are only at the very start but I think it is a very good start and a positive step forward by this country and by the European Union.

There is a mechanism there which we must ensure the success of. To repeat something important I said at COP, we have played an incredibly strong role. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, has played a strong role and the European Union has come to us in terms of what we can do. Implementation is key. When talking to the actors right across COP and outside it, there is one thing they will say to us. The challenge, particularly for developing countries, is to take the two weeks of COP and ensure we progress it so that when we next meet at a COP summit, we are not re-stating what was stated before. There is such a level of achievement in what the Minister has led on with loss and damage. If done right, it will enable quick access to finance, which was a critical thing that was missing for developing countries. That is key but we must do the implementation.

That was a solemn agreement made between the British and Irish Governments and the political parties represented in Stormont. That agreement had the capacity to make progress in dealing with very important and sensitive issues. Progress on legacy has been delayed for far too long. It is a retrograde step that the British have proposed legislation that is totally unacceptable to replace the Stormont House Agreement.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	475	I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 109 together. I met with the Secretary of State most recently on 2 November and the progress of the UK's Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill was one of the topics discussed.  In all of our discussions, I have been frank in my view that this Bill, as it stands, is not fit for purpose. It represents a clear move away from the Stormont House Agreement.  There is near universal opposition to this Bill in Northern Ireland, including from the five main political parties, those representing victims, their families and survivors, as well as a wide range of other groups. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission has expressed serious concern about the Bill, as has the UK Parliament’s own joint committee on human rights. The Government has serious doubts about whether this Bill is compliant with the European Convention on Human Rights.  We have raised our profound concerns about this Bill directly with British Government, at official and political level, and in the relevant multilateral fora, including the Council of Europe and, most recently, at the universal periodic review of the UK by the UN Human Rights Council. Chief among those concerns is that the Bill provides for the granting of immunity by the proposed independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery for gross violations of human rights and the remarkably low threshold for the granting of this immunity.  The proposed immunity has profoundly upset families, with many believing that this legislation would protect the perpetrators and deny victims a path to truth and justice, particularly where evidence may exist. The Bill provides for the proposed "independent commission" to conduct "reviews" rather than investigations of legacy cases. The status of these reviews, the significant powers invested in the commission and the chief commissioner, and the role of the Secretary of State raise questions of independence. All remain matters of serious concern. Under the proposed legislation, all criminal investigations and inquests that are not at an advanced stage and civil actions would cease.  The Government will remain fully engaged on this issue. I have discussed the matter with political parties in Northern Ireland and in my recent engagements with senior US politicians in Washington DC. I also recently met with the Northern Ireland Commission for Victims and Survivors and members of the Victims and Survivors Forum. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has indicated that he is open to addressing concerns raised about the Bill and to increased engagement with all stakeholders. It was agreed at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in October that officials would meet and discuss the main elements of concern. However, I have been clear that any amendments would need to be radical and fundamentally change the substance of this Bill for it to address our concerns. The Government is aware of calls for consideration of the initiation of an inter-state case against the United Kingdom before the European Court of Human Rights in relation to this legislation. Any future examination by the European Court of Human Rights as to whether this Bill, if enacted, is compliant with the United Kingdom’s obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights will depend on the precise terms of the legislation as enacted and the factual circumstances pertaining at the time. In this light, a decision as to the referral of an inter-state case to the court by Ireland concerning the Bill, which remains subject to amendment, is, in the Government’s assessment, premature. However, the Government continues to keep this matter under review. The Government’s approach to legacy and reconciliation has always been that it should be a victim-centred approach, taking the Stormont House Agreement as its starting point. This is a process that was agreed by both Governments, and most political parties in Northern Ireland, with the support of victims' and survivors' groups. I have had a constructive discussion with the new Secretary of State on this issue. I do not know whether it will be possible for us to come to an agreement on amending and changing this legislation fundamentally. On an issue as sensitive as legacy, given the trauma and pain that it is linked to for so many thousands of families, this is something the two Governments, working with parties in Northern Ireland and with victims' groups, should try to agree a common approach on. Unilateral action and moving ahead without the support of virtually anybody is a real mistake by the British Government, if it chooses to do it. I welcome the conversations I have had with the Secretary of State, Chris Heaton-Harris, who has shown a willingness to look at possible change. I hope that will be possible.

It has united all the political parties on this island, all advocacy groups and all groups that have worked with victims over the years. As the Minister quite rightly said, it is perpetrator-focused. It is not victim-centred. We cannot successfully deal with legacy issues unless it is victim-centred. It has to be victim-focused. I welcome the recent statements by the archbishops of Armagh, who made a very cogent and strong argument against the legislation. This British legislation proposes that perpetrators of heinous crimes, be they murderers from paramilitary organisations or murderers from the British state forces, be able to give themselves an amnesty from the most heinous crimes, including murders, bombings and maimings of innocent people.Any legislation of that sort cannot be accepted.

I have been holding the line on this issue because I believe that not to do so would be to dishonour the commitments we have made to victims on all sides. I have repeatedly said to victims' families that we cannot support legislation that shuts off the opportunity to take a case should there be an evidence base that allows for that to happen in the future. The idea that we would effectively introduce an amnesty so that people who perpetrated awful crimes could potentially talk and write about that, glorify those actions in the future and have no possibility of a case being taken is not protecting victims or helping Northern Ireland to move on into a period of reconciliation. Privately and publicly, I have appealed to the British Government to work with us on this. We will try to accommodate some of its concerns, but it needs to listen to victims in particular.

I commend the work of Joanna Cherry MP, other MPs and Members of the House of Lords in the context of their strong condemnation of the British Government's proposals. The Minister will recall that we had many discussions in private, in the House and at committee regarding the Dublin-Monaghan bombings of 1974 and the terrible bombing at Belturbet in my constituency in December 1972 in which two innocent teenagers were murdered. I, along with families, have campaigned for decades to get to the truth. People have gone about with great grace and dignity to try to get the truth about who carried out murders and serious crimes against their loved ones. Under no circumstances could any democratic government put a proposal to families that they abandon everything they fought for over the years and decades. Some people have been fighting for half a century. I want the Government to continue its strong opposition to the proposal in question. We cannot accept a situation whereby murderers would be given a de facto amnesty. The Bill should be dropped entirely. We should go back to the Stormont House Agreement that has the potential to deal with the campaigns for justice for the Dublin-Monaghan and Belturbet bombings and the families we all want to assist.

If the British Government moves ahead with what it is doing, however, we cannot and will not support it. On that basis, we cannot provide the cross-Border co-operation that is needed to establish truth and justice for people who are seeking that where it is possible to do. For many reasons, we need the British Government to rethink its approach in the space. If it does, it will find that the Government will work constructively to help it.

We know the EU side has been willing to compromise; it has already shown that. We need a similar spirit of compromise from the British side. If that is forthcoming, then we can find a way between now and the end of the year, or shortly thereafter, to get a middle-ground position in terms of landing zones on some of the outstanding issues that are very problematic, such as how we treat goods coming in from Great Britain into Northern Ireland that we know are staying in Northern Ireland in terms of purchase and consumption. We have to treat such goods very differently from that we know are in danger of travelling on to other parts of the Single Market. As Vice President Šefčovič said, by working to try to make checks virtually invisible, we can resolve the issue. That is the kind of thing that many in the unionist community have been asking for, namely, that we respect trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland to the greatest extent possible, while protecting the integrity of the Single Market and how it functions. That is the core of the deal. Other issues need to be resolved around VAT, state aid, the role of the European Court of Justice and so on, but the core of the deal is to dramatically reduce checks on goods that are staying within the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and are not at risk of travelling on to other parts of the Single Market. Is it going to be easy to do that? No, it is not. If it was, it would have been done long ago. The difference is that we now have a Prime Minister who wants to negotiate a solution. I am not convinced that his two immediate predecessors were in that space, particularly because of the pressure they were under internally within their party and the fact that the politics of tension with EU have not always played well. There are other considerations in terms of economic and cost-of-living pressures. The partnership approach between the UK and EU is something that both sides are looking to develop positively. On the back of the conversations I have had, there is a definite effort from the British Government to improve relations with Ireland and the Government here. We are responding positively to that.

Thankfully, there is now political stability at Westminster and a more pragmatic mood prevails. As the Minister said, there is some optimism that agreement on the protocol can be reached. The Minister dealt with the issue of trade, but the Northern Ireland protocol also deals with commitments concerning the non-diminution of rights under the Good Friday Agreement. There are obligations concerning the functioning of the single electricity market. The protocol also specifies the need to maintain the conditions for North-South co-operation on the island of Ireland. These two matters need to be monitored. Are these commitments being considered as part of the current negotiations? I am conscious of the fact that there is a provision for the Northern Ireland Assembly to vote on the protocol in 2024. All of these issues are becoming more urgent. I welcome the positive tone of the Minister's response and how relations between Britain and Ireland are developing in respect of these matters.

We could rise and fall on the basis of comments from British politicians over the past number of years. We all want to see matters being streamlined and the protocol issue being taken off the agenda in terms of there being no possibility of a hard Border and, beyond that, facilitating unionism to get off the hook it made for itself. I will be quite honest about that. There are outstanding spectres, such as protocol legislation, the Nationality and Borders Act and, as the Minister said, legacy amnesty legislation.The difficulty there is I do not believe Britain is ever going to want to address its involvement in its dirty war in Ireland. 
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	488	There were many sides to that dirty war. It was not just one side. Our focus now has to be on trying to be positive about getting to solutions. That is my focus and the Taoiseach's focus. There is not a proposed deal from Prime Minister Sunak. There has been a variety of commentary about Swiss-style arrangements and so forth, much of which is not accurate. Time and space are required for two experienced negotiating teams to work through the areas, which both sides understand very well, in regard to reaching landing zones using pragmatism and flexibility within the confines of the protocol, because the legal wording of the Treaty, which is now international law, is not going to change. However I believe the protocol can be implemented in a way that is different from what many people perceive to be a negative impact on trade from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. We can improve the implementation of the protocol significantly. I believe the EU is willing to do that but it needs a partner that is also willing to compromise and to ensure there is proper, real-time sharing of data and so on, in order that the risks the EU has to manage in regard to the integrity of its own Single Market - this is not just about Ireland and Northern Ireland but about the Single Market for all 27 countries in it - can be managed as well. Unfortunately, time is dragging on and running out. There are not that many weeks left between now and Christmas, by which time many people had hoped we could get a deal. In many ways, the less megaphone diplomacy we have on this issue and the more honest and detailed interaction between the two negotiating teams in London and Brussels, the better at this stage. What is needed of course is a green light politically to both negotiating teams to get the job done through sensible compromises.

I congratulate the Minister for Justice and the Government on the publication today of the Policing, Security and Community Safety Bill. That is landmark legislation that marks a new departure for policing in Ireland. I will focus on community safety. It is central to the reforms in the published Bill today. It talks about ensuring that people are safe and feel safe. For decades, sociologists all over the world have recognised that the fear of crime can be as damaging and in some cases more damaging than crime itself. It is not always clear that the fear of crime is associated with actual crime rates. It is associated more often with social and physical vulnerability factors than with actual crime rates. Some studies show that community policing where police interact even briefly with residents and business owners the fear of crime reduces significantly within such neighbourhoods. Lowering fear of crime enhances the well-being of residents and business owners. This is where the Garda Reserve has a huge role to play. On 19 October 2021, the Garda Reserve Strategy 2021-2025 was published. I congratulate the Commissioner and his team for producing a strategy with measurable objectives and a clear timetable. It is an excellent document. It speaks to diversity and inclusion. In the foreword, the Commissioner talks about the delivery of a proactive high visibility policing which contributes to keeping people safe. That is why I would like to see recruitment to the Garda Reserve starting as soon as possible. After all, it is more than a year since the strategy was published. On 25 October 2021 I was informed in a reply to a parliamentary question that Garda management and the Government were committed to increasing the number in the Reserve to 2,000. A year ago the number in the Reserve was 439, now it is 389, so the numbers are falling rapidly. I understand there was a pause in recruitment while the strategy was being developed. The Policing Authority, in its Policing Priorities 2022-2024, sees Garda visibility as a key area in supporting and ensuring community safety and that one of the areas of measured success will be the implementation of the Garda Reserve strategy. In March last year, the Minister told me by way of a response to a parliamentary question that recruitment to the Garda Reserve would be launched later in 2022. On 24 May last, the Minister told me it was anticipated that a recruitment process would be launched in late 2022 or early 2023, predicated with the Public Appointments Service, PAS, as to the timetable for the recruitment process. On 20 October last, I was informed that a new recruitment campaign would be formed in the second half of next year, that is, 2023. That will be almost two years since the excellent strategy on the Garda Reserve was published. I think that is too far in the future. My purpose here this evening, while of course recognising the exclusive responsibility with the Garda Commissioner for the recruitment, training and deployment of Garda members and members of the Garda Reserve, is to respectfully request that the recruitment campaign for the Garda Reserve begin early in 2023 as originally anticipated. The Garda Reserve has a great range of functions laid down in legislation. We actually debated this quite a number of years ago. I was here at the time. The Houses saw the value and importance of the Reserve, and that is why I believe that putting off the recruitment process until this time next year is too far away. I would like to see it starting in the new year. The more visibility we have on the streets of people in Garda uniforms, the better. It helps the Garda. There are people who want to be part of the Garda Reserve and give back to the community by being part of it. The Commissioner recognises that in the strategy. I ask that the Commissioner, who I hope is listening this evening, and his team, would take note of this and would work together with the Department to ensure the recruitment begins as soon as possible in 2023.

The Deputy will appreciate of course that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the allocation and distribution of resources. However, I can inform the Deputy it is anticipated that the Garda Reserve recruitment process will launch in the coming year. As the Deputy may already be aware, the launch of a new Garda Reserve recruitment campaign is a priority of the Garda Reserve Strategy 2021-2025, which is an important element of the Government’s plan to modernise and strengthen An Garda Síochána under the plan set out in A Policing Service for Our Future. The strategy is informed by an internal review of the Reserve and sets out key commitments including recruitment, training, development, deployment, governance and evaluation. A priority is the new recruitment campaign next year, on foot of which new reservists will be appointed for five years initially. The campaign intends to target a broad and inclusive range of candidates in keeping with the Reserve’s role as a visible form of community engagement. There is ongoing engagement between the Department, An Garda Síochána and the Public Appointments Service to ensure that the recruitment campaign is inclusive to diverse and under-represented groups with the intention of removing perceived barriers. An Garda Síochána recognises the Garda Reserve offers policing experience to a wide range of people from diverse backgrounds and communities. Fostering and increasing diversity and inclusion in An Garda Síochána will improve service delivery by harnessing the unique talents and life experiences of people from all backgrounds. I am advised that An Garda Síochána is utilising established outreach forums and recruitment campaigns in line with the organisation's workforce plan. Consideration is also being given by An Garda Síochána to ensuring the Garda Reserve can serve as a pathway to future recruitment competitions for Garda members where individuals have a desire to progress on to that position. The strategy further aims to ensure that members of the reserve are fully supported by local Garda management and that the role is recognised and promoted throughout the organisation. The Department of Justice is currently engaging with An Garda Síochána on revisions to the Garda Síochána (Reserve Members) Regulations, SI 413/2006 and governs the reserve ahead of the commencement of this recruitment process. The Garda Commissioner has established an implementation group and oversight committee to ensure the strategy delivers on its objectives. The Minister looks forward to working with him to increase the number of members of the reserve and realising its full potential as a valuable resource in visible policing and in providing a pathway to full-time membership of An Garda Síochána, including from minority communities.

As a former Minister of State at the Department of Justice, I can see where this is coming from. I agree with everything the Minister of State has said. The only thing that is missing is a date for starting the recruitment, which the Minister of State has not addressed although it was the main point I made. One issue I recognise in the Minister of State's response is the pathway to full membership. The reserve strategy acknowledges this when it states that the Garda Reserve provides an opportunity to experience a career in policing and may encourage some individuals to pursue a full-time career as a member of An Garda Síochána. The internal review found that while reserve gardaí have access to a specific stream during recruitment campaigns, the benefits to the individual and the organisation are limited. It goes on to state that the strategy proposes to examine the opportunity to develop the recruitment stream for reserve gardaí, taking account of their operational experience. Therefore, there is a way to achieve this. For 23 years, I was a member of the Army Reserve, the FCA. We often lost the best and the brightest to the Permanent Defence Force, although I do not know how they missed me. They got a taste of Army life, they liked it and they joined up. The same can happen here with the Garda Reserve, which can be a pathway to full membership. We know there are challenges at the moment to Garda recruitment and that is another reason I would put forward as to why we should begin this as soon as possible. It would help with enlistment into the Garda. I was previously told that we cannot have both at the same time but, with respect, I do not agree as that is to talk about two different groups of people. If we get people into the Garda Reserve, they will not all want to join the full-time police force, but a certain number of them, younger people in particular, may join up, get a taste of it and make a career choice based on that. If they make that career choice to join the full-time gardaí, the chances are they will stay there and make a full-time career of it. I rest my case. I hope the Minister, the Garda Commissioner and the Department can work together and move on this early in the new year.

I have listened carefully to his initial comments and it is clear he has been following up on this issue, which is close to his heart. He can see the benefits of the Garda Reserve and he has been persistently trying to follow up on when the recruitment campaign will start. The information I have been given is the information I have passed on to him, but I can pass on any further questions to the Minister. I agree with the Deputy's view that this can lower the fear of crime. My experience with the Garda Reserve is that when we meet its members, it is a different experience from meeting more experienced gardaí. I certainly met people who did not look like they were gardaí and who came from different ethnic communities. I think that helps in building connections with communities. Part of the objective is also that if gardaí are understaffed in an emergency situation, they can draw on extra resources. It seems to be working in that way. This can serve as a pathway to further recruitment. Clearly, it can act in the same way that an apprenticeship does in that members of the Garda Reserve can realise it is a career they enjoy, they can see the full-time gardaí at work and decide it is something they want to apply for. It allows a period of trial and testing. As the Deputy said, it is a similar experience in the FCA before people go on to the Army. There is certainly a place for both. There is a place for people who are volunteering within their community, although we always have to make sure they are volunteering for the right reasons and there have to be checks and balances about that. There is also room for people who are full-time traditional gardaí and who are fully paid, and so on. I understand the Deputy wants to know when the recruitment campaign is starting. The information I have is that it is starting in the new year. I will pass on the Deputy’s concerns to the Minister, Deputy McEntee.
#JimOCallaghan	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-party	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-dob	unknown-#JimOCallaghan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	495	I wish to raise the associated issue of what I will refer to as the recruitment crisis in An Garda Síochána. At present, we have approximately 14,300 attested members of An Garda Síochána. In my opinion, that is not enough and we need to closer to 16,000. The reason I say that is not simply because of the ever-increasing population in this country, but also because of the ever-increasing number of crimes that are being created as a result of laws being made by this House. Sometimes, Members of the Oireachtas do not recognise or acknowledge the fact that when we make criminal laws, we are creating greater work for An Garda Síochána. The reason I say there is a recruitment crisis in the Garda is because, this year, we have only been able to recruit 90 members. In fairness to the Government, it recognises that we need to get garda numbers up. In budget 2022, we provided for the recruitment of an extra 800 members of An Garda Síochána, and in budget 2023, we provided for the recruitment of 1,000 extra members. However, when we look at the fact we have only been able to recruit 90 members this year, it emphasises that we have a recruitment crisis. I want to propose to the Minister of State a number of proposals which I think will be effective in seeking to tackle this recruitment crisis. If we do not tackle it, we are going to find ourselves in a situation, perhaps next year, where we simply do not have sufficient numbers. One of the things we could do quite quickly is to look at changing the retirement age of An Garda Síochána. At present, we lose many qualified, experienced and knowledgeable members of the force because they are required to retire at 60 years of age. If we are having difficulty in recruiting members, we should look at increasing the retirement age for a period of years, and that is obviously something that can only be done in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. A second thing we could do is build upon what Deputy Stanton said in his previous contribution, when he spoke about trying to recruit members from the Garda Reserve. The reason we need to recruit more members into the Garda Reserve, as Deputy Stanton noted, is because that will necessarily provide another flow of recruits into An Garda Síochána. I also think we need to look at a proper recruitment campaign. When we look around this city, we see the effort to recruit people to work in the health service in Australia. We need a much more active and vibrant campaign when it comes to recruiting people into the Garda. Another point we cannot shy away from is that this has become a much tougher job and a much less attractive job than it was many years ago. I am not going to talk about the specifics of the horrific incidents we saw over the weekend in parts of Dublin, when gardaí were being attacked but, unfortunately, many people do not find the job as attractive as it was previously. As a society, we need to start emphasising more the importance of the special role gardaí play in protecting our communities. It is a difficult task but it is a task we cannot shy away from. We must also recognise that in order to make it a more attractive job, we need to ensure there is better protection for gardaí. In particular, I am concerned about the fact I hear body cameras will not be provided to An Garda Síochána until 2024. We need to expedite that. It is essential that we put together a policy that formulates how we are going to recruit more people into the force. If we do not do that, we are going to find ourselves in the very difficult position, because of ongoing and consistent retirement, that we simply will not have sufficient numbers to police the country and to enforce the laws we make. I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say in response.
#OssianSmyth	unknown-#OssianSmyth-party	unknown-#OssianSmyth-dob	unknown-#OssianSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	496	On behalf of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for raising this issue. While recruitment to An Garda Síochána has faced challenges in recent times, this has been due in the main to public health restrictions in place during the Covid-19 pandemic. The effect of the restrictions has been a slower than anticipated flow of new entrants into the Garda College. While the Minister for Justice has no direct role in the recruitment of Garda members, she and the Government are committed to building stronger, safer communities and to continually supporting and strengthening An Garda Síochána. As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Commissioner is responsible by law for management and administration of Garda business, which includes the recruitment and training of Garda members and staff.The Minister, Deputy McEntee, engages regularly with the Commissioner and senior Garda management on the issue of recruitment and wants to ensure every support is in place to deliver on Garda recruitment. I assure the House that the Government is committed to ensuring An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs, with record funding of more than €2.14 billion allocated to the Garda Vote in budget 2023. This includes provision for the recruitment of up to 1,000 additional Garda members and 400 Garda staff in 2023 and will enable sustained ongoing recruitment of Garda members and staff. I am advised that 369 new gardaí have been attested so far this year. A further intake will enter the college this month, with all of those trainees coming from the 2022 recruitment campaign. Those who commence training later this year will attest in summer 2023. In total, more than 460 trainees will have graduated from the Garda College or started their training in 2022. I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are currently 14,283 Garda members across the country, representing an increase of almost 12% since 2015, when there were 12,816 Garda members. The substantial increase in the number of Garda staff has allowed for more than 870 Garda members to be redeployed to front-line duties where their policing experience and training is of the greatest use to the service and the community. The Minister was pleased that, in response to the recruitment competition held earlier this year, more than 11,000 people indicated an interest in joining An Garda Síochána, more than double the level of interest in the previous campaign, in 2019. This shows there is still enormous interest in policing as a profession in Ireland. I encourage all those called from the current competition not to defer but, rather, to make sure they are fully fit and ready to take up the opportunity.  I have been advised by the Garda Commissioner that a new Garda recruitment campaign will be launched in early 2023 and this will ensure a steady flow of recruits into the Garda College, with 200 new recruits planned to enter Templemore every three months, starting from January.

As regards the statistics he provided, he said that 369 recruits were attested this year. I am conscious that the Minister of State is not at the Department of Justice. My understanding is that many of the gardaí who were attested this year were recruited last year. There can be little doubt that we need to get the numbers up in An Garda Síochána. The Minister of State made the point that approximately 11,000 people expressed interest and he stated that they should get themselves fully fit. My understanding is that, notwithstanding the interest, many of the applicants are not passing the fitness test. I am concerned about that. We may need to reconsider that fitness test. Is it too strenuous for those undertaking it? If a significant number of people are failing the fitness test, it should be reconsidered. I am conscious that the Garda Commissioner is ultimately responsible for matters within An Garda Síochána and recruitment, but that will not happen unless there is Government action to ensure we recognise a problem that is coming down the tracks. We, as a Government, need to get more involved in actively encouraging the Commissioner to get involved in recruitment. I welcome the amount of money the Government is making available to An Garda Síochána. I do not think the Government can be criticised for the fact that in the budget this year it has provided funding for 1,000 new gardaí. However, as I said, the numbers are not adding up in that regard. If one looks at the numbers attested last year, one will see it was not the case that the 800 gardaí for whom funding was provided in budget 2022 were attested. I am concerned that, notwithstanding the provision of a budget for 1,000 gardaí to be recruited next year, there will be difficulty in reaching that number. We need to recognise the problem and ask the Commissioner to address it. Let us run a public advertisement recruitment campaign to get people into An Garda Síochána. It is a great career.

He mentioned that we in the Oireachtas are good at creating laws, but we have to take into account that those laws have to be implemented and that every law we pass creates new requirements and burdens on the Garda. Where possible, we should remove some of the laws that are on the Statute Book. He made the point that any recruitment campaign we run should be vibrant. Such campaigns should be competitive with other positions for which people might apply. The State, although perhaps not the Garda, can certainly be accused of having a more functional style of communicating with the public than a commercial entity would have. The Deputy made three specific proposals, which are good to hear. First, he suggested that the retirement age be increased to over 60. Obviously, that would take industrial relations and negotiations to achieve. Second, he proposed that we recruit from the Garda Reserve and that we should have a more vibrant campaign. He also suggested that the fitness test and whether it is preventing people from entering the Garda be considered. I have to make the point that I, as much as anybody else, am horrified and shocked to see videos of gardaí, including female gardaí, being beaten in the street. I would hate to see that repeated. I am sure many actions will be taken to protect those who are tasked with protecting us, and that such events will not happen again.

I cannot find an email from the office of the Minister, or from anybody else, to say that the Minister wanted to defer the matter. I have been waiting weeks to have this matter taken. That decision is at the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle and I accept that. However, I find it totally unsatisfactory that when I eventually get what is a very important issue taken, I find that all I am going to get, with no disrespect to the Minister of State who is present, is a standard answer with no feedback. We changed the Standing Order so that a Deputy can get the Minister in if he or she believes it is an issue that needs to be addressed by the Minister. I ask the Acting Chairman to pass on to the Ceann Comhairle that I am very disappointed the Minister is not here, that I am dealing with the matter now under protest and that, on the next occasion, I expect to be treated in a courteous manner and in accordance with Standing Orders in respect of this matter. The issue I wish to raise is a serious one. Under the LEADER programme before last, a LEADER company was delivering the programme in east Galway, another was delivering it in Connemara, including all the Gaeltacht, and a third, based on Inis Oírr, was delivering LEADER for all the offshore islands not connected to the mainland by a bridge or causeway. More than half the island population of the country live in County Galway. Under the most recent programme, everybody involved in LEADER in Galway was shocked by a high-handed decision that Galway would have only one LEADER company and one sub-regional group. That decision was opposed on the ground. Eventually, the LEADER programme was delivered by two companies, namely, Galway Rural Development in east Galway and Forum Connemara in Connemara. We lost the battle on the islands, however. It is important to point out to the Minister that, geographically, Galway is the second-largest county. Not only that, one could almost say it is two counties geographically. A person cannot get from Connemara to the huge area east of Galway without going through another local authority area, that is, through the city, unless one takes a boat across the lake.Connemara is cut off completely and the area from Ballinasloe to Clifden is 166 km long. Galway is also a very long county from north to south, stretching on the east side from Dunmore in the north right down to Gort and Portumna in the south, and on the west side, from Cornamona, where I live, and Cong in the north all the way down to south Connemara. There was a huge protest the last time. The people there got the two companies but, amazingly, the Department has decided that this will be one subregional area again. I find this extraordinary. The Department has also told the islanders they will be part, and a very small subpart, of the county LEADER programme. This has a significant effect because the way the money is being divvied out is by subregional area. For example, Cork, has three such areas - south, north and west - while we have only one for this huge county. The way the money is divvied out is that €3 million goes to each subregional area. We claim that since we have two companies, we should be getting two allocations of €3 million and the rest should be divvied out on the basis of rurality, or density of population, and disadvantage, against which we have no argument. We ask the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Humphreys, to reverse two decisions before it is too late. One is that she declares that Galway is now two subregional areas, one for Connemara, which is the way it will be delivered one way or the other. The companies and people have agreed that and everyone wants it. I ask, therefore, that we get it delivered that way and that we get the reinstatement of our island LEADER company.

LEADER is a key programme within Our Rural Future and, as announced recently, the expression of interest stage to select the groups to deliver the next LEADER programme is now open. The allocation for each LEADER area was also announced as part of the process. The programme has made an immense contribution to the development of rural Ireland, including the offshore islands. The funding allocation commitment of €180 million for 2023 to 2027, when taken together with the allocation of €70 million under the transitional programme for 2021 and 2022, shows that all LEADER areas have an increased allocation of core programme funding compared with the core programme funding allocated for the corresponding seven-year period of 2014 to 2020. Importantly, all of the €180 million will be allocated up front to LEADER areas. This is a change from the 2014 to 2020 programme where €30 million was withheld to fund initiatives delivered at a national level, such as the LEADER food initiative. The subregional area of County Galway has been allocated €9 million for the 2023 to 2027 period. When taken in conjunction with the transitional funding for County Galway of €3.6 million for 2021 and 2022, this gives a total LEADER allocation of €12.6 million for the period 2021 to 2027. This represents a 3.55% increase of approximately €430,000 on the 2014 to 2020 period. A number of factors were considered when deciding on the funding allocations. Along with minimum allocations, these factors included population density and deprivation index. This approach is similar to the approach taken in the previous LEADER programme, with the relevant population and deprivation figures updated to take account of the passage of time. This approach ensures the funding is targeted in a transparent and fair manner to the rural communities most in need of LEADER support. As is the case with the current LEADER programme, the subregional areas for the new LEADER programme will correspond with county boundaries. This alignment will help to ensure coherence of LEADER funding with other initiatives and policies delivered on a county basis and so help to deliver the best impact and value for money for LEADER. The offshore islands will continue to be aligned with their relevant subregional area. However, as island communities have particular needs and priorities, within the context of the emerging national islands policy, it is envisaged that the LEADER programme can play a key role in delivering on these needs. In recognition of this, a number of important elements will be included in the model for the new programme. Any local action groups, LAGs, selected in an area that includes island communities will be required to identify in their LEADER strategy specific actions, developed in consultation with the island communities, to cater for the challenges faced by those communities. These LAGs must include indicative budgets in their LEADER strategy for the implementation of such actions. In addition, a representative of the island grouping in each subregional area must be included in the decision-making body of the LAG. It is now important that the key public and private stakeholders in communities throughout Ireland come together in partnership to deliver a LEADER programme that will be coherent with, and build on, existing rural development policies and initiatives throughout the country. The Minister looks forward to seeing the new programme being implemented and to ensuring LEADER can continue to deliver real benefits to rural communities throughout Ireland.

[to] county boundaries." The Acting Chair can tell him that the LEADER programme in Cork corresponds to the county boundaries but in three parts, which are contiguous. I will address the matter of Galway in the context of the county boundary and leave aside the islands for a minute, which are a separate issue. Leaving the islands aside, we are saying we will stay within the county boundary but we want two subregional areas because our two subregional areas will have two companies that are not contiguous. They do not physically touch each other on land. The difference, of course, is €3 million. That is a significant difference to the county. I will not get into an argument or be drawn down blind alleys that will go into funny money games in terms of this LEADER programme versus the last. The Minister of State is absolutely right that the last LEADER programme was not great. The next issue I will address is that of the islands. We all love the islands. Everybody says they love the islands. People are still crying after the loss of the Blasket Islands, Inishark and other islands and their populations. When it comes to the islands, however, we often have the talk, and people will talk the talk but will not walk the walk. The reality is islanders are underwhelmed by all these complicated provisions that mean nothing to development on the ground. They will tell you that the last LEADER programme did not work as the previous ones did. It was not funded as the previous ones were. In one sentence, four things are wrong with the programme; money; headquarters that mean employment on the islands, which is very hard to come by; an island plan for islanders; and the fact this is what the offshore islands want because the islanders know what is good for them for their survival into the future.

I have been told there are now requirements that these subregional groups specifically include actions relating to the islands, that they have a specific budget for the islands, and that they have representation from the islands. I presume that is on foot of the Deputy's requests or demands. I am not sure whether that was present in the last round. His point is that there is only one subregional area for Galway and there should be at least two on the basis they are not contiguous and are separated by Galway City Council. I will bring those comments back to the Minister. Leaving aside the fact the islands do not have a subregional area, the Deputy made the point that there is much more talk than action, that we should do beart de réir ár mbriathair and that talk is cheap. Galway is a very large county at more than 160 km. I come from a county that is 10 sq. km, so I understand where the Deputy is coming from. I will take his comments on this matter back to the Minister for comment.

These emails did not come out of the blue.The issues and these concerns have been building for years and have culminated in record numbers of people on trolleys - proportionately the worst in the country when you compare them with the number of beds in the corresponding hospitals and the ability of the hospital to absorb the number of people on trolleys. This is the tip of the iceberg. That is what is visible. Underneath all of that is totally inadequate hospital infrastructure. The hospital has a single CT scanner. When it is out of action when it is being serviced as it needs to be, there is no scanner and that is the most basic requirement for any acute hospital. There is an ageing MRI scanner that is supposed to provide an imaging service for a quarter of a million people in the north west. There are many more shortcomings but I do not have time to go into them. The emails from the consultants spell them out in shocking detail. SUH is losing its staff and is finding it difficult to recruit. There is no doubt it is reaching a tipping point. There needs to be immediate systemic action first of all to refocus funding allocations to Sligo within the Saolta University Healthcare Group to begin to rebalance the imbalance that is there. Second, there is a need to prioritise the provision of fully operational medical equipment and sufficient amounts of it. Third, there is a need to accelerate the 42-bed block in parallel with surgical, maternity, paediatric, emergency department, radiology theatres and ICU.

We have the highest percentage of over-65s in the country, which means we have the greatest demand. We have a bed occupancy rate of about 110%, which is well over the national average of 90% and very dangerously over the acceptable international level of 85%. In other words, people in Sligo are dying because we cannot live up to rates that can be guaranteed to be below 85%. That is a fact. An unprecedented number of senior consultants serving the catchment area from SUH have shared the despair they are suffering at the hands of our inaction and ambivalence and our inordinate talent for filing reports, doing surveys, researching, agreeing, planning, talking, debating, discussing and finally delivering nothing.  I acknowledge the commitments given to me during the motion of no confidence last July and to Dr. Donal Murray and cardiologists at SUH on improvements the Minister was prepared to provide and the money was provided in the recent budget. I also acknowledge that the 30-plus staff needed to open the already ready-to-go four additional ICU beds at SUH are provided for in this budget but, as Deputy Harkin rightly said, we cannot attract people to Sligo. If you talk to the Irish Hospital Consultants Association, it will tell you things were advertised for six months or a year but nobody responded. We need critical and urgent action this time. 
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	507	I thank Deputies Harkin and MacSharry for raising the issue of staffing and services at SUH. I was sitting here today when Deputy Harkin raised it on Leaders' Questions. SUH is a model 3 hospital with a 24-7 emergency medicine service. It delivers a wide range of local and regional services on an inpatient, day case and outpatient basis, including a range of specialties such as cardiology, medical oncology, critical care, cancer, maternity, paediatrics, radiology, acute medicine and acute surgery, as well as a number of regional specialties provided on an outreach basis to Letterkenny University Hospital. As the House is aware, the Covid-19 pandemic led to an unprecedented interruption to normal health services both in the community and acute hospitals system across the country. The HSE, hospital groups and individual hospitals continue to plan for the challenges of providing health services while maintaining patient safety in a Covid environment. This includes planning for winter, planning for service resumption and waiting list management as well as the ongoing Covid-19 response. The HSE winter plan for 2022 to 2023, which was published in October, will support acute and community services this winter to respond to anticipated high levels of emergency attendances and admissions across the acute sector, long waiting times in emergency departments and high occupancy rates across acute hospital settings. This Government recognises that SUH has a critical role to play in services in the north west. This is reflected in the significant increase in resources allocated to the hospital. In 2022, the budget allocation for the hospital was €160.8 million, up from €130 million in 2018. From the end of 2020 to the middle of 2022, staff had increased more than 12%, including 71 nursing and midwifery staff. In July 2022, 1,885 whole-time equivalent staff were employed by SUH, which is a 12.5% increase on the end of 2020. This included 72 nursing and midwifery whole-time equivalents notwithstanding the issues raised by the Deputies.  This Government also recognises the capacity issues at SUH. As a result of the 34 senior consultants emailing the Minister for Health, the Minister met with consultant doctors from the hospital yesterday evening to hear their concerns. The emergency department is under sustained pressure. Between January and October, there were more than 37,000 attendances, up 4.8% on the same period in 2019 and 12.2% higher than the five-year average. Associated metrics such as waiting times in the emergency department and trolley numbers are also increased on previous years. Hospital management, in concert with the Saolta University Healthcare Group and the wider HSE, has advanced several capital projects in order to address such capacity issues. These include an emergency department modular unit, additional ICU isolation rooms, a 42-bed ward block extension, a second CT scanner and MRI replacement and a new emergency department surgical block. In particular, the proposal for a new surgical and emergency department block will involve construction of a new multi-storey extension to the hospital. This facility will provide the consolidation of theatres, provide surgical and maternity wards together with a new emergency department, radiology and integrated paediatric departments. In 2022, funding was allocated to appoint consultants to complete a strategic assessment report-preliminary business case. As this would be a major capital project, this is one of the steps required to progress this project under the public spending code. This Government recognises the valuable work done by the staff at SUH and aims to support the ongoing development of services.

She spoke about the winter plan. Seven of the ten actions involve recruiting extra staff for SUH. When I wrote to the HSE asking how many extra staff had been recruited, I received a response not two weeks ago that told me that it was expecting to start recruiting soon. We are in the middle of winter so there is no winter plan here. Second, the Minister of State tells me that the budget allocation in four years has increased by 25%. I do not know how much the health budget has increased by but I guarantee that it is way more than that so giving us raw figures without looking at how they compare elsewhere is meaningless. I did not have time to check those figures but I will.  Finally, the Minister of State spoke about the new surgical block. To be fair, the Taoiseach said today the issue from hereon is delivery and whether we can accelerate the timeline for construction. The question is, will we?

They are accountable but through our failure, we are leaving them vulnerable in terms of their accountability and endangering patients' lives. That is a statistical fact. The Saolta University Healthcare Group is too Galway-centric. This is a major issue. Take the example of the four ICU beds. The Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy Feighan, Deputies Harkin and Martin Kenny and myself were trying to get them opened. They will be opened. However, at the very last minute at the pre-budget stage, the Saolta University Healthcare Group with HSE management tried to take two out.There is a disconnect between what we are looking for, what we are hearing from patients and consultants and what the Minister of State is telling us, what HSE management is doing and where within the Saolta group resources are being allocated. This needs to change.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ó Cheannairí - Leaders' Questions	510	I thank both Deputies. I could hear the passion in both their voices as they spoke about this issue, and the genuine concerns they both have. The HSE winter plan for 2022-23 will support community services this winter to respond to anticipated high levels. Specific initiatives for SUH include three healthcare assistants to support community services on the chronic disease hub, three administrative staff to support referral pathways between SUH and the community, one clinical nurse manager to act as GP liaison, three emergency medicine consultants and one registrar to assist with pre-admission patient flow. In keeping with the principles of Sláintecare, the Government will continue to support the strategic development of SUH. I am glad that the Minister met with the consultants last night. When 34 consultants put pen to paper and write to the Minister about their genuine concerns, I am glad he acted so quickly and that he met them. As I outlined earlier, there are several capital developments in train at the hospital, but I know that the two Deputies are really concerned about the here and now and the challenges of the winter we are facing into. I was struck by the fact that Deputy MacSharry said that the highest number of over-65s were in there. I also take on board the point he made about the CT scanner, the MRI replacement and the single point of failure when there is only one machine and it does not work. I will pass on the Deputies comments to the Minister. The Minister was in the house earlier when the Deputy raised this matter. I will certainly raise all of the concerns expressed with him. I thank the Deputies for their time.
