#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	0	At present over 92% of children in care have an allocated social worker.  In May 2012 there were 6,282 children in care compared to 6,015 children in care in February 2011.  The figures reflect an increase over the period of 267 in the number of children in care, adding to the challenge for the HSE in ensuring that all children in care have an assigned social worker.The allocation of a social worker is prioritised by the HSE to ensure children entering or about to leave the care system, those in a residential care placement or those experiencing a change of placement always have a social worker assigned to them.  A principal social worker may decide to prioritise such cases over long term stable foster care placement where there is a temporary gap due, for example, to a social worker being unavailable because of extended leave or while a new appointment is awaited.  In such situations there may already be a HSE link worker, who is also a professional social worker, supervising and supporting the foster carers and visiting the placement and the foster carers and the child should have information on who to contact should an urgent need arise.Differences between care settings are evident from our data, with much higher proportions of children in residential care, including special care and high support, having assigned social workers.  Over 97% of those in residential care have social workers assigned.  In general, those children in residential care tend to have higher levels of need compared to others such as those in long term foster care.  Addressing this issue is a priority for the HSE and progress has been made in recent months.  Since the end of March 2012, the number of children in care without an assigned social worker has reduced from 507 to 476.  This was over a period when the overall number of children in care increased by 46.In May 2012, 476 children or 7.6% did not have an allocated social worker.  In February 2011, 326 children or 5% did not have an allocated social worker.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.In both January 2011 and March 2011 the percentage of children in care without a social worker was 6.3%, while previously significantly higher numbers of children in care did not have social workers assigned.  As recently as 2009, for example, some 17% of children in care did not have a social worker.  Of the 476 children without assigned social workers in May, 458 were in foster care or foster care with relatives.Notwithstanding the recent improvement and the more positive position in relation to residential care, efforts are required to bring about further improvements in this area.  The HSE's 2012 national service plan identifies this as a priority deliverable.  In this context the Government has made additional budgeting provision of €19m for child welfare and protection services compared to the funding made available last year.  The funding will assist in addressing expenditure pressures from budgetary reductions made in previous years and growth and demand for services due to demographic and other factors.  In overall terms, the 2012 provision is designed to support the HSE in meeting its obligations with regard to the welfare and protection of children under the Child Care Act 1991, together with a range of priorities set out in the HSE national service plan for 2012.  As mentioned, these priorities include improvement in relation to a reduction in the numbers of children in care without an assigned social worker.My Department will continue to work closely with the HSE to ensure that further progress is made over the remainder of the year in the key priorities set out in the national service plan.

I think she will agree that in light of the publication of the report of the child death review group in the past couple of weeks, the job of ensuring we provide the best possible protection to children who come into the care of the State is essential for the Government and one it must not shy away from.  It must take the hard actions to achieve that.  The report of the child death review group showed that many children were failed by the State and that, in many cases, the reason for that failure was the lack of resources and the pressure on our social workers to achieve goals and provide the care children required of them.When the Minister came into office in February 2011, some 94.6% of children in State care had an assigned social worker.  Having an assigned social worker is essential to ensure the child has a point of contact and someone from the State to look after him or her and to ensure he or she gets the service he or she requires.  A year and a half later, the percentage has dropped to 92%.  The Minister said the increase in the number of children in care has added to that.  What has also added to that is the fact the Minister did not achieve her target of hiring an additional 60 social workers in 2011.  In fact, the number hired was 14.The exemption from the recruitment embargo, which existed when the Minister came into office, is no longer in place.  Will she put that exemption from the embargo back in place and outline her plan of action to ensure each child in the care of the State has an assigned social worker?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Since March of this year, I am very pleased to say we have seen an increase in the number of children who have a social worker.  The number is steadily going in the right direction.  One can take any period of time and parse and analyse it but what we need to do is look at the overall situation.  It is true that 2011 was a very difficult year for the HSE child and family services.  It was faced with a €14 million cut in the Estimates for 2011 as a result of the last set of budgetary decisions taken by the Deputy's party when in office.  As he will know, I got an increase of €21 million and one is beginning to see that come through in the increased allocation.This is an important issue and it is extraordinary to think that as recently as 2009, some 17% of children in care did not have social worker.  However, the number is going in the right direction with the vast majority - more than 90% - having a social worker.  There is a legal obligation for children in care to have a social worker.  We must ensure that figure increases as part of the overall reforms we need to implement, despite the pressures that exist.  With the increased budgetary allocation and the recruitment of approximately 262 social workers that is under way, we are seeing more social workers in place.  This is despite the recent changes and the numbers who retired in February last.  That will all help.There is a historic problem of the services not allocating a social worker.  I agree with Deputy McConalogue with regard to the priority this area should be given and that we need to put child protection at the centre.  All the reforms I am working on have as their goal the provision of a child protection service that delivers and truly protects children.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	3	The Programme for Government 2011 - 2016 states that the referendum on children's rights is a priority and that the wording of the proposed referendum will be along the lines of that proposed by the all-party Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, JCCAC.  From the outset of deliberations on the constitutional amendment on children's rights, the need for all-party consensus on this topic was highlighted.  Having been a member of the JCCAC alongside Deputy Ó Caoláin, I can attest to the level of all-party co-operation afforded the then Government in the work of the committee.  I pay tribute to the work of the Chairman of that committee, former Deputy Mary O'Rourke.Both myself and officials of my Department have engaged extensively with the Attorney General and her officials to formulate a draft wording for the proposed constitutional amendment.  Contact in that regard is ongoing and, as part of normal process, will involve consultations across the relevant Departments in advance of presentation of a proposed wording to Government for consideration.  Integral to the passing of the proposed amendment will be a change as regards adoption law in the position of children of marriage and married parents.  To ensure that the public are fully informed of the nature of the proposal and the consequences of approving it, the proposed amending legislation in the area of adoption will be published along with the wording of the amendment.Publication of the referendum Bill will have regard to the need to allow an appropriate period for the proposal to be fully debated and considered by the public and by the Oireachtas.I have already undertaken informal consultations with the political parties and others and I intend to continue to consult with Opposition spokespersons as the preparations which are currently under way progress.  I also envisage that the issue will be dealt with in the Joint Committee on Health and Children.The Government has yet to consider the matter of the precise referendum date but it has already decided that it will take place later this year and will be held on a stand-alone basis.  The significant and complex work currently being done is geared towards this timeline and objective.

There is concern that slippage may occur.  We are a little over a week away from the summer recess and the House will not resume until September.  The referendum is to be held in the autumn but much can happen in the intervening period of weeks.  I am sure other Opposition Deputies are of the same view as myself and are anxious to have a direct engagement with the Minister.  I would be available throughout August and early September if an opportunity presented.We are all, understandably, anxious that an all-party supported proposal be put to the people.  I note the Minister said the wording of the proposed referendum will be along the lines of that proposed by the joint committee.      Nevertheless, the absence of hard information gives rise to justifiable concern that what we agreed during the course of that long engagement in committee may be emaciated by a variety of departmental considerations and the Attorney General's fears.  If the Minister is not in a position to provide certainty regarding the date of publication of the facilitating legislation for the referendum and the changes to the Adoption Acts to be presented in tandem, will she indicate her willingness to meet spokespeople on children's issues in this House either over the course of the recess or early in September?  I hope she will understand fully the anxiousness I am describing.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	5	As the Deputy will be aware, this was a priority for the Government and we have not put off a decision on holding the referendum.  We have made it clear that it will be held this year and, given its importance and the range of issues to be addressed, that it will be a stand alone referendum.  That is an indication of our commitment and such a timely response has not been seen from a Government previously.I assure the Deputy that I will liaise directly with him and with Deputy McConalogue on an ongoing basis between now and September.  I am also happy to brief them fully on the adoption legislation.  These are complex issues.  There is all-party agreement on them and I want to continue that agreement.  I will certainly facilitate ongoing consultation and discussion on the referendum and the accompanying adoption legislation.

I acknowledge that we have spoken previously on the matter but it is important that our engagement is ongoing.  She will understand that in the absence of detail from not only our own parts, but also a range of external interests in this area, the clamour of concern is growing.  We must have faith in what she and her Department are proposing.  I have had faith heretofore and I want to be able to respond to concerns with the certainty I had when we concluded our deliberations and report in committee more than two years ago.  It must be acknowledged that the delay is inordinate and this gives rise to understandable concern.  The Minister would go some way towards addressing this concern by keeping others in the House informed as best she can.  I hope we will be consulted prior to the Cabinet agreeing to the wording.  Surely that would best inform the final proposition to be put before the people.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I understand the point the Deputy is making.  I do not accept that the delay has been inordinate.  On the contrary, this is a priority issue for the Government and our actions reflect that.  My Department and the Office of the Attorney General is doing detailed and committed work on the issue and it is subject to considerable interaction and discussion between the Attorney General's office and me.  Considerable progress has been made but the Deputy will appreciate that further work is required in terms of painstakingly examining the wording that was considered by the committee to see how it can be translated into a constitutional referendum.  I will continue to brief Members because I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin on the importance of co-operation in this area.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	8	In response to the publication of the report of the independent child death review group, I reaffirmed my view on the importance of children in crisis, no matter where they are, having access to 24-hour social work assistance.  I recently discussed this issue with Mr. Gordon Jeyes, national director for children and family services in the HSE.  I expect the HSE to bring forward an implementation plan for the roll-out of a national service model later this year for implementation by the new child and family support agency.The Health Service Executive already provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area through the crisis intervention service - which I recently visited in Dublin - and outside the greater Dublin area through the emergency place of safety service.  The crisis intervention service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years who are in crisis.  That service operates across the greater Dublin area, including counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow.  Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours - that is, gardaí, hospital and ambulance service personnel.Outside the greater Dublin area in 2009, the HSE established the emergency place of safety service whereby gardaí can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out of hours.  This is a great improvement compared to the previous service.  The current service involves the placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  As part of this service, gardaí have access to advice and information from a non-HSE social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis.I pay tribute to the work of the Garda Síochána over the years in this area.  Now is the time to support that work in having new procedures in place.  In 2011, the HSE commenced two out-of-hours pilot projects, one in Donegal and the other in Cork.  Both projects were evaluated by the HSE, which then commissioned an independent external assessment, undertaken by Trinity College, Dublin.  On the last occasion, I was asked about this by Deputy McConalogue and said that the report was being undertaken.  It has now been completed and presented to Mr. Gordon Jeyes.  My Department has recently received a copy of the report whose findings will inform further decisions in the coming months on progression to a national out-of-hours service model.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I thank the Minister for her reply.  As she knows, this is an area that has given rise to considerable concern and continues to do so despite the various emergency proposals that have been put in place.  While they are an improvement, they are neither adequate nor appropriate.  Over the years, numerous serious incidents have occurred out of hours but had these services been available, things might well have been different.Is the Minister satisfied with the proposal, and the commitment given by Mr. Jeyes and the HSE, concerning the roll-out of the service she has outlined?  Is she satisfied that the roll-out will take place prior to the end of this year?  There have been promises in the past about this matter, but they have not come to fruition.  In view of the various reports that have been prepared, including the most recent report on child deaths, it is vitally important that this service should be put in place immediately.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I want to inform the House that the existing pilot projects that were running in Cork and Donegal will continue in 2012.  Clearly, whatever model emerges will need to address the challenges of the varying demographic demands in rural and urban settings.  For example, the number of referrals to the Cork pilot project was 29, while the Donegal pilot only received eight referrals.Building on the Cork and Donegal projects, and the lessons which we must learn from them, the HSE will be designing comprehensive national arrangements which can be implemented by the new child and family support agency.  I would expect that around September or October we will have that national plan for the model that needs to be used.   I do not believe it will be the same model in all parts of the country as needs vary.  We must ensure we put in place a model which ensures access to social work intervention.  The format within which that will be provided may and should vary depending on the demands of different areas.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I assure the Minister that we will be monitoring the situation closely.  It is hoped that, as stated by the Minister, a national plan will be ready for implementation in September-October.My understanding is that non-replacement of social workers on maternity, sick and annual leave is giving rise to serious concern not alone in this area but in a range of other areas.  I would welcome the Minister's view on this.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Given the current financial situation resources is a key issue.  Replacement of social workers is outside of the embargo.  The director of child and family services has the authority to replace social workers within the resources available to him.  These are greater than previously.  There is a great deal of demand in this area although not so much in terms of out-of-hours services but in general.  There are many pressures on the services given the financial situation.  The Deputy will be aware that we have recruited an additional 262 social workers.Retention of workers in the health service and in particular in the area of front line social work, which has been the subject of many studies nationally and internationally, is an ongoing challenge.  However, issues can be acted upon to address this, including, for example, the provision of more support to front line social workers and more supervision.  The new plan, which has been put in place by Mr. Gordon Jeyes, in regard to the amalgamation of child protection and family support services and ensuring families are referred to the appropriate services will, along with the new agency, help in the provision of better and more effective services.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I indicated when I published the report of the Independent Child Death Review Group that I welcomed its findings and recommendations and that I fully accept the need for action in the areas identified.As advised at a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, following consultations with the Taoiseach, I am putting in place an implementation process for the Gibbons-Shannon recommendations.  Many of the recommendations of the review group's report echo recommendations made in previous reports and actions are already under way to implement these as part of the reform programme under way in children and family services.  Where recommendations give rise to a need for new actions my Department will incorporate these within the implementation process.My Department is currently preparing a detailed project implementation plan for the reform of children's services.  Linked to this, it is preparing a single database of various report recommendations over recent years to streamline reporting to me on these matters.  Reporting on the Gibbons-Shannon recommendations will form part of his streamlined reporting mechanism.  It is my intention to bring regular progress reports on my Department's reform programme to Government, the relevant Cabinet sub-committee, this House and relevant committees.On the content of the recommendations, as stated, many of the actions and reforms identified by the review group are already under way as part of the Government's reform programme, the most radical reform of child welfare and protection services ever undertaken in the State.  I believe the review group report will add further impetus and support to this comprehensive change programme.As I have often stated, it is my contention that child and family services have for too long competed with other priorities within the health services.  This was a critical factor in the decision by the Government to establish a dedicated child and family support agency.  The agency, which will report to me as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will on its establishment in early 2013 carry forward key elements of the change programme.

This is the first occasion since publication of the report of the Independent Child Death Review Group that I have had an opportunity to discuss it with the Minister on the floor of the House.  I commend the authors of the report, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon and Ms Norah Gibbons, on their dedication over the past 18 months in teasing through the detail of each child's case with a fine-tooth comb and highlighting what went wrong with the State services.  Tragically in the cases of the 196 children who died in the care of the State, including 112 who died of unnatural causes, much went wrong.  That makes it all the more important that each of the recommendations in the report is implemented with no dilution.  I specifically refer to the recommendations to change the  in camera rule, having mandatory after-care for children leaving the care of the State at the age of 18 and the establishment of a death review panel entirely independent of the HSE.  When can we expect to see that implementation plan?  Will the Minister state that she will accept nothing less than the full implementation of all the recommendations in the report?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I join the Deputy in thanking the authors of the report for their work.  It is pretty devastating to read a report on the deaths of children.  In this House just two years ago there was a lack of clarity even on the figures.  With this report we now clearly have increased transparency.  Clearly the kinds of reforms needed in this area will not take place overnight and a great deal of work remains to be done.  There are significant legacy issues in putting the child and family protection services on the kind of basis we would want to see and that is very clearly illustrated in the report.  The question of interagency work needs to be taken very seriously not just by my Department but by a number of other Departments and by a range of agencies as well as statutory agencies.  That is a very big challenge.I have already started discussions on implementing the recommendations and I intend to continue discussions over the summer on the development of the child death independent review mechanism.  Yesterday I met representatives of HIQA and began discussions on roles it might play.  I will also meet representatives of other relevant bodies.  I want to develop a mechanism.  In many ways very good work is already being done by Dr. Helen Buckley and her team.  The HSE and Government had obviously established a service.  The implementation group suggested a new way to develop that independent child death review mechanism and I intend to examine that and see how its recommendations can be implemented.  I have already outlined that the child and family support agency legislation will deal with the after-care issues that arise from the report.  I have already started work on a number of the areas.  We need the database I outlined to the Deputy in order to streamline the various recommendations.  We have the implementation of the recommendations from the Ryan report, which is progressing.  I am confident that each of the recommendations will be progressed in the coming months.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Will the Minister give a commitment that the recommendation for mandatory after-care will be implemented in full?  Unfortunately the report showed that children in after care were failed to an even greater extent than any other children in the care of the State.  Nothing less than mandatory after-care is required and I ask the Minister for an assurance on that.  As the Minister rightly points out the challenges still remain.  Since the period covered by the Shannon-Gibbons report published last week, 40 children in the care of the State died up to May of last year.  It is an area that requires much attention by the State and is very difficult.  We must ensure that our services are as safe as possible.  On the issue of a mandatory after-care policy, I ask the Minister to give a commitment today that she will introduce mandatory after-care provision and not something short of that.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	17	In regard to any deaths in the recent period, the Deputy will be aware that reports have been published and information is in the public arena on how many of those deaths were natural deaths.  It is important to remind ourselves that non-natural and natural deaths of children under the age of 18 occur.  They are reported on now immediately by the review mechanism and panel that is in place in the HSE, and that is only right.  We are talking about further developing that mechanism.In regard to after-care, it is important to acknowledge that the numbers receiving after-care have increased hugely from 847 in 2009 to 1,340 as of March 2012.  Far more young people are receiving after-care and, clearly, more budgetary resources are being given to young people leaving care.  After-care was an issue that was identified in the report.  I intend to bring legislation forward, with advice from the Attorney General.  As I said, I will bring it forward in the Bill to establish the Child and Family Support Agency to ensure that all children in care have an assessment of needs carried out before they are 18 years of age and that all children in care should be entitled to the supports they need.  I have legal advice on this, as the Deputy will be aware, and I have discussed this matter with the Deputy and with Deputy Ó Caoláin on a number of occasions here and the position is that at present that obligation is on the HSE.  Not every young person leaving care after the age of 18 will need after-care.  The question is one of assessing those who do and ensuring that they get the service.  I will seek to further clarify the obligations of the HSE in regard to after-care in further legislation later this year.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I thank the Deputy for his question on the in camera rule in the courts.  This was clearly identified in the child death report as an issue and it was felt that there was a need for more transparency.  I believe that there is scope for more transparency in regard to the private nature of court proceedings relating to child welfare and protection cases.  We certainly need to put in place a mechanism to ensure that the learning from such cases is shared across the system while continuing to protect minors’ interests and maintain anonymity.  I have had discussions with the Minister, Deputy Shatter, on this and he will be bringing forward legislation in regard to the in camera rule.There is a provision in the Child Care Act which permits me also to specify a class of persons to publish reports of proceedings under Part III, IV or VI of the Act, once I am satisfied that the publication of reports prepared in accordance with subsection (5)(a) by such persons is likely to provide information which will assist in the better operation of the Act, in particular in relation to the care and protection of children.  There is a useful parallel under the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 which allows, subject to direction of the court, bona fide researchers and lawyers to attend hearings for the purpose of preparing anonymised reports on the proceedings and court decisions.  That was the basis, as the Deputy will probably be aware, of the work that Dr. Carol Coulter did in this regard under the auspices of the Courts Service.With this in mind it is my intention to bring forward regulations to allow for the reporting on child welfare and protection proceedings.  The exact nature of those regulations will be informed by consultations with my Department, the other relevant Ministers, the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Courts Service.  The date for introduction of any regulations will obviously be contingent on the outcome of those consultations.  I am keen to progress this matter as quickly as possible.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The Child Death Review Group maintains that keeping a shroud of secrecy around child care cases does not necessarily mean that the interests of minors are always protected as well as they can be, as practices which may need overhauling are shielded from scrutiny.  If we are to truly commit ourselves to reform of child welfare and protection services, then this matter must be adequately addressed and it is my intention to do so, in consultation with the Minister for Justice and Equality.

I welcome her indication that the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, is to facilitate bringing forward a change in this regard.  Is the Minister in any position to advise us when that might come about?  Are we likely to see that proposed change any time soon?  Will it be in the autumn schedule of legislative change?  Is the Minister able to elaborate in any way as to what change will be proposed?  She is aware that the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan, has highlighted the difficulties in accessing information.  She was significantly curtailed in an investigation into one of those cases highlighted in the said report of September 2008 to which we both referred.  The in camera rule is being used continuously as a means, a barrier, to full exposure of the details in any particular case.  She indicated that the excuse proffered by the HSE at the time was the restrictions on the in camera rule.  This excuse has been and is being used.  At least up to last month, she was facing four legal challenges to investigations, not all before the courts but all challenges relating to specific investigations which the Office of the Ombudsman for Children, was undertaking.We must recognise that the operation of the in camera rule is very problematic and we must ensure that the whole area of child care and provision is not invisible to us because of other elements of the Statute Book.  I would welcome any elaboration the Minister can offer about the Minister, Deputy Shatter’s proposal.  I emphasise that in line with her own commentary earlier this year that this should be done as quickly as possible.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, about this issue today.  I cannot give the Deputy an indication of precisely when this legislation will come forward but the Minister is actively considering it.  That is progress because this issue has been around for many years and has never been dealt with.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter will bring forward legislation to deal with it.  I am in a position to inform the Deputy that I will introduce regulations so that child care cases can be reported.  The shroud of secrecy has not been in the interests of children.  It is important to protect the identities of children and the identifying details of cases but there is a way to do so, as Dr. Carol Coulter showed in her research.  The Deputy rightly states it is important to make children visible in the courts in the same way as the constitutional referendum should make children visible in the Constitution.  Likewise, this issue is relevant with regard to a discussion of court hearings involving children.

I thank the Minister for indicating that she intends to address this matter within her own portfolio, the means of which allows her to progress it.  Let us hope that between both we will see a situation where the practice heretofore of some hiding from proper and full scrutiny will be at an end.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	22	As I indicated to Deputy Healy in my earlier response, the current arrangements for out-of-hours services are that the Health Service Executive provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area through the crisis intervention service and outside the greater Dublin area through the emergency place of safety service.  I have had discussions with Gordon Jeyes, national director for children and family services in the HSE, on the roll-out of the  national service model.  It was clear in the recently published report on child death that young people who leave care are vulnerable.  I expect the HSE will bring forward an outline model for this service later this year.It is important and critical that children in crisis, no matter where they are, have access to 24-hour social work assistance and supports.  I am in agreement with the director on this point and we are working towards its implementation.  I am committed to a service that the new child and family support agency can implement.  The current arrangements for out-of-hours services are those in Dublin and the crisis intervention service outside Dublin.  The nationwide model will be informed by the ongoing work on the pilot projects, which will continue this year.  We have the reports and the evaluation is also completed.  Mr. Gordon Jeyes will examine the pilot projects, the evaluation of them carried out by the HSE and also the outside evaluation which is now available.In the Donegal area there were only eight referrals, nevertheless important referrals, and in Cork there were 29.  Clearly, there is a demand for the service.  Equally, the foster care arrangement now in place throughout the country is a huge improvement on the way these issues were dealt with previously, where gardaí were left to deal with very difficult crisis situations involving children.  Unfortunately, these situations arise and they also arise out of hours.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The report of the independent child death review panel highlighted the inadequacy of our social worker service and the fact that in many parts of the country there is no service outside the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. should it be required.  There is no control over the timing of when such a service is required so there is an urgent need for the Minister to direct the HSE to take every step required to ensure that a 24 hour social worker service is established as a matter of absolute priority.  The Minister indicated that the numbers are small in some cases, but it is crucial that in cases dealing with vulnerable children a social worker is available out of hours when required.  There must not be any delays relating to evaluations.  We know this is required and it is crucial that the Minister prioritises it.  I realise this is difficult in a situation where there is pressure on social worker services, but could the Minister give a timeline for when we can expect to have a 24 hour service across the country?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	24	As the Deputy said, access to a service is important.  The form in which that will be provided can vary, but it is access to the service and to the right type of assessment that is critical, so that somebody can assess the crisis and ensure the right action is taken.  The evaluation has shown that there is clear potential for such a service nationally.  I am told it can be relatively inexpensive.  It is important to note that usage is and has been low in the pilot schemes.  I agree with the Deputy it is an important addition to the range of child welfare and protection services in Ireland.  The director is committed to developing an appropriate service in urban and rural areas.  The service in place at present is much improved on the previous situation but there is a need to have a national plan.As I have repeatedly said with regard to child and family support services, the area has been bedevilled by a lack of national planning, and this is another example.  There has been no national planning for out-of-hours services.  The Deputy is correct that we must move towards a national plan.  A national protocol will have to be established with regard to how this service will operate to ensure there are more standardised procedures and supports around the country for people who need services.  That work will have to be done.  It will be greatly aided by the two pilot projects and the evaluation Trinity College conducted of those projects.  That material must be brought together and we must do it quickly and ensure the plan is in place in September or October clearly outlining what a national service would look like and how it can be moved forward in the best possible way given the restraints that exist, as we must be realistic about the resource issue in the context of current resources, to ensure a service is available for those in crisis.

While the Minister cited the number who have taken up the opportunity, it is important to assess awareness.  Having accessibility without awareness does not address the issue.It ought to be a no-brainer that accessibility for 24 hours per day is extremely important.  It is of little doubt to any of us here that the times of greatest risk are during the evening, at night and at weekends.  Social worker support is not just a matter of provision from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. from Monday to Friday.  This does not address the real need.  We need to assess the real need and ask whether the pilot projects have identified it.  Has the Minister further information on awareness?  Does she accept that everybody wishes to see the service rolled out as early as possible?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The Deputy's point on people's knowledge of the service is very reasonable.  I understand it is addressed somewhat.  An issue arises as to members of the Garda and relevant personnel knowing the service is available.  This clearly needs to be addressed, and it should be addressed in the national protocol that will be rolled out.The review recommends a joint protocol for the HSE, An Garda Síochána and the placement providers.  That would need to be developed.  It would include the private, voluntary and statutory providers such that there would be a broad range of common practices around the country.  There is clearly work to be done but it has started.  We can benefit from the pilot projects and the evaluation.  We need to learn the lessons to be learned and develop the road map for the development of the service.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The HSE compiles a monthly census of employment in the public health and social care sector.  The latest data available, which are in respect of April 2012, indicate there were 1,190 whole-time equivalent, WTE, child and family social workers employed in the HSE and in directly funded agencies.The latest HSE records indicate there are 32 social workers on career break, with a WTE value of 26.54.  The numbers of social workers in child services on long-term sick leave or secondment for three HSE regions are six in HSE Dublin mid-Leinster, one in HSE Dublin north east and eight in HSE west.  I do not have information from HSE south but I have asked the HSE to furnish it.  On receiving it, I will forward it to the Deputy.The national director of children and family services, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, will continue to apply discretion to the filling of social work vacancies, taking account of recent early retirements and identified need, subject to services being delivered within available resources.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I would have liked to have had the relevant detail before me.  Sometimes it can be difficult to absorb the information, particularly when it is in statistical format such as that presented.Much has been made of the employment of new social workers.  This is always very welcome but there is continuing confusion as to the number of social workers actually working in the system.  I was trying to establish the real picture on sick leave, sabbaticals and secondment to other Departments.  Has the Minister a breakdown for these three elements alone or has she just a single figure applying to three of the four HSE areas?When one considers the report of the child death review group, one notes there is a case to be made for further social worker posts, despite the economic difficulties we all face today.  Has the Minister any projection for the number of social workers that will be needed once the Children First guidelines are placed on a statutory footing and once the Criminal Justice (Withholding of Information on Offences against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill is passed?  Will we have difficulty coping with all the additional needs I and others believe will arise on the basis of current numbers?  The current position is not sustainable.  Can the Minister give us further news on the creation of new social worker posts?  This was a key requirement according to the recommendations of the Ryan report.I have listened very carefully to the exchanges between the Minister and my colleague spokesman on children, Deputy Charlie McConalogue, and have noted there are two very different views on the number recruited over the past 12 months.  This does not help us to understand the full facts.  We need a full complement based on established need.  I want assurances on projected need.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	29	The position is very clear; the current number of social workers employed in child and family services is 1,190.  This figure includes 258 of the 263 posts recruited to date in line with the recommendations in the Ryan report.  The report analysed this matter and its authors suggested the recruitment of an extra 270 social workers in total.  In recent months, a significant number of vacancies has arisen, primarily as a result of retirements but also due to career breaks and extended leave.As I stated, the HSE's national director has been given the authority to fill key vacancies.  The HSE is recruiting 57 social workers to fill recent vacancies that have arisen across all care groups.  The posts are at various stages of recruitment.  In effect, we have the number of social workers that were in place previously.  Additional social workers are being recruited and this process is ongoing.  There was some movement in and out of the service, as will be the case given the kinds of numbers that obtain in a national service.There is a point I need to make that was made by Mr. Gordon Jeyes in response to questions asked of him at a committee meeting on resources.  He stated in response to questions from Deputies Ó Caoláin and McConalogue that he remained unconvinced that we are making the most effective use of resources.  He told the Deputies that while he was deeply conscious that the system was under pressure, he was not prompted to say more resources comprise the only solution.  He told the Deputies the current financial circumstances should lead to a debate on prioritisation and that work should be prioritised within the resources available.  That is not to say that if there were more resources available, all else being equal, they would not be used effectively in this area.  I have no doubt that they would be.When there were many resources available to the State, it was quite clear that with regard to the kinds of changes needed to have the kind of national service we have been discussing, be it in respect of after-hours service or national high support and special care services, key policy decisions were not taken.  Some of them have considerable implications for finance.  Therefore, it is not just a question of increasing the number of social workers but of determining what they are doing, how other agencies are interacting with them, how the work is referred among the many services we are supporting financially, including voluntary services, and how the work is being organised among the voluntary and the statutory services.  There are many issues that enter this discussion.

That was very clear.  As with Mr. Jeyes, I accept it is not just a question of the further recruitment of social workers.We are all supportive of greater efficiencies within the cohort currently engaged and within the systems in place.  That is important.  However, the Minister is not the person tasked with the recruitment of the additional number of social workers.  How efficient is it that, in July 2012, she still refers to ongoing recruitment in respect of the 57 posts?  It has been ongoing for how long and for how long into the future?  It reaches a point at which it can no longer be an ongoing process.  It needs to come to an end.  The cohort of people identified and required should be in place and giving of their professional services.

Numerous times last year, the Minister assured the House that she was working towards recruiting 60 additional social workers in 2011.  At the start of this year, she needed to admit to us that she had only recruited 14.  These are the Minister's figures.  We may argue the case, but the proof lies in one of the Minister's previous replies.  She indicated that, as of February 2011, 94.5% of children in the State's care had assigned social workers but that the figure has since dropped to 92%.  This is a reflection on the pressure in the system and on the fact that the State has failed in its commitment to follow the implementation plan of the Ryan report.At the beginning of last year, there was an exemption to the recruitment embargo and each position that had become vacant was back-filled.  The Minister should reinstate that exemption.  Otherwise, the decline in the number of children in State care who have assigned social workers will continue.

The least that we can do is put in place the lessons learned from the report of the child death review group.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	37	As I told the Deputy the last time we discussed this matter, his figures are incorrect.  Of the 263 additional posts recommended by the Ryan report, 258 have been recruited.  As I mentioned to Deputy Ó Caoláin, a significant number of vacancies have arisen due to retirements, career breaks, extended leave, etc.  The national director has the authority to fill those positions, as they lie outside the embargo-----

The 57 recruitments will take the normal course.  Some have already been offered and some staff are already in place.  The recruitment is going ahead.  There is no embargo.However, I take the Deputy's point.  This is an area in which there is high demand, the work is challenging and social workers require support.  I pay tribute to the front line work being done, but difficult issues have emerged over many years, as the Deputy knows.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	40	Fewer children have been assigned social workers.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	42	For example, inexperienced social workers on the front line are often asked to undertake complex work without the kinds of supervision and support that are required.  This situation cannot be turned around overnight.  I am impressed by the new management system that the new director has put in place.  The number of managers has been reduced, a more national approach is being taken to the collection of data and clearer risk assessments.  This last was called for by the child death report.  Other agencies, in particular child, family and mental health services, need to be involved in supporting the efforts of social workers.One can parse and analyse any period of two or three months, but the overall trend in the recruitment of social workers is upward.  That demands are also increasing is without question.  Mr. Jeyes will continue to analyse the precise number of social workers that he wishes to see in place to deal effectively and diligently with these complex cases.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	43	The task force that I established to advise on the necessary transition programme to set up a child and family support agency has undertaken a considerable body of work.  I met the task force at its 18th meeting last month for an update on this work and I anticipate that the final report will be submitted in July.  The report will be brought to the Government, laid before the Oireachtas and published.  It will contain advice on a number of key issues that will inform the preparation of the necessary legislation to establish the new agency.  In particular, this will include a vision for the agency, proposed governance arrangements and advice on the services that the task force considered appropriate for inclusion in the agency's remit.The commitment to establish a new child and family support agency is at the heart of the Government's reform of child and family services.  The establishment of a single agency, underpinned by legislation and incorporating key children and family services, will provide a focus for the major reforms that are under way.  This reform programme contains a number of critical elements, those being, the need for a comprehensive change programme to improve the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services; the introduction of legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis; and the establishment for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and family services, providing transparency and accountability for the use of resources to meet national priorities.  Previously, the budget formed part of a larger budget and underwent a great deal of movement, particularly at the end of each year when demands were made by hospital budgets, for example.  The reform programme will also involve the transition of existing HSE child protection and welfare and services into the new agency; the merger of the existing Family Support Agency, which has a budget of more than €26 million, into the new agency; and consideration of the potential for further rationalisation of services for children under the new agency.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.A comprehensive change programme is being implemented under the leadership of Mr. Gordon Jeyes, national director of child and family services.  The change programme is designed to enhance the level and consistency of child welfare and protection services significantly.  This change process will continue into the new agency, of which Mr. Jeyes will be the first chief executive.Extensive work is under way in my Department, the HSE and through the task force that I set up last September to prepare for the agency's establishment.  I am satisfied that we are making excellent progress in terms of the preparatory work required to meet the Government's ambitious timetable, which will see the agency assuming full statutory responsibility for services for children and families early in 2013.

Will we have an opportunity to peruse it?  Will the Minister circulate it upon receipt to Opposition voices so that we can have time to inform ourselves?  Will she indicate a facilitation to address the report's content on the resumption of the new Dáil session?  The child and family support agency will be a major step in the new year.  It should be a given that we would all have an opportunity to engage properly with the report of the task force at the first opportunity.  Clearly, that opportunity will not present before the end of next week, but perhaps soon after.  Will the Minister indicate that we will have that opportunity and will she let us know that we will not need to wait until the resumption of the Dáil to have sight of the content of the report?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I can confirm that I will publish it on receipt and will circulate it to all Members in the House.  It will also be available for people to read and respond to.  I welcome a debate both within and outside the Houses on the work.  Great care has been taken and much hard work has been put in by the members of the task force since last September, when I appointed them.  It has taken submissions from a very wide range of statutory and non-statutory bodies, seeking their views on how best to deliver services to children and families.  It also considered how best to organise services in order to meet the needs of children and families; it is about meeting their needs rather than the needs of the services or the professionals.It will address those key issues and I look forward to hearing the views of the Deputy and Deputy McConalogue on the task force.  It has given us its best thinking on how to progress the development of the agency.

As the Minister knows, this is not just about setting up a new agency but how the agency operates and what exactly it does.  We went from a position in the past where social work and child protection was the responsibility of health boards to where it came within the HSE's ambit.  There were many problems with that agency so setting up a new body will not necessarily mean the problems will not happen again.  It is absolutely critical that this is done correctly.  I welcome the Minister's commitment to lay the report before the Oireachtas.This is the last Question Time for this Minister before the recess.  She received the fifth report to the Oireachtas of the special rapporteur on child protection in April and as yet, we have not had it laid before the House.  That is not acceptable as it is a report to the House.  I ask that at the very least, the Minister would ensure it is laid before the Houses go into recess.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	49	I take the points made by the Deputies on the importance of this report and that we have a comprehensive discussion on its recommendations.  It suggests the potential blueprint for the establishment of the new agency and, as such, it is critical to have a good discussion on its recommendations and the implementation of same.  With regard to the report of the special rapporteur, the procedure is that when the report is received, it is sent to other Departments for comment.  That is the normal procedure as it would refer to work done by other Departments.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Preschool services, including child minding services, are currently regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.Operational responsibility for the management and delivery of health and personal social services, including the inspection of child care facilities, was assigned to the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004.  The notification and inspection service is managed by the preschool inspection teams of the HSE appointed by the executive as authorised persons for this purpose.  These teams also provide an advisory service to the services which are statutorily required to notify in order to assist them in achieving and maintaining the appropriate standard.  They also provide information to interested persons, including parents, on preschool services in the area.Following inspection of a service the inspectors provide the service provider with a report on the outcome of the inspection.  I understand the HSE is committed to working towards the on-line publication of the standard inspection reports of preschool facilities and I welcome that.  In the meantime the HSE is encouraging child care providers to share the information in the reports with parents when requested, and that should happen.I understand from information supplied by the HSE that 2,789 inspections were undertaken, 704 review and follow-up inspections and 755 advisory visits were made to child care facilities in 2011.  By international standards, that is a high proportion of visitation, at 61%, to child care facilities in any one year.  Some other countries have a procedure with a roll-over of inspections so that one facility might be inspected every two or three years.The early years sector has grown significantly over the last decade and in parallel with this new quality and curriculum frameworks have been introduced.  In light of all of these developments, the regulation of the sector will be reviewed as part of the early years strategy.  For the first time we will have a national strategy and I recently appointed the group to work and develop the policy.  It is being developed to cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life such as health, family support, learning and development and care and education.  It will identify the structures and policies needed to improve early years experience in Ireland and examine child care issues.

That emphasises the importance of ensuring there is a good inspection regime and every effort is made to ensure there is quality in the provision of child care facilities.  One of the issues highlighted related to one person looking after 22 children in one crèche.  The vast majority of crèches run very well but we must ensure there is a robust inspection regime and every service receives a visit in a year to reassure parents that children are being cared for appropriately in a safe environment.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I agree that we must have a very clear focus on quality and standards in early years.  Significant improvements have been made but there must be ongoing work to ensure there is a robust system of regulation and inspection.  That is one of the reasons I have included in the terms of reference of the new early years group to review the inspection regime and make recommendations on how it can be strengthened and how the standards which should be met can best be achieved.  We also need more consistency in the inspections currently being done.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	56	Today the Dáil is launching, via resolution, the constitutional convention.  Before the election, both of the Government parties promised very radical political and constitutional reform within 12 months.  We know the timeframe has slipped but, more seriously, the ambition has shrunk very significantly.  What we are being presented with today in reality represents a sham compared to what was promised.The issues of the voting age being reduced from 18 to 17 or the presidential term of office are not earth-shattering and do not need referral to a convention of this kind.  What is perhaps more surprising is the referral of marriage equality to the convention, particularly given that the Tánaiste has described it as the civil rights issue of this generation.  Some would suggest the issue was referred to the convention to buy time and perhaps to avoid having to make a decision on the issue.  In referring it to the convention, the Taoiseach raised the prospect of there never being a referendum on marriage equality during the life of this Government and Dáil.I believe in marriage equality and it is important that a referendum would take place.  Last week, journalists attempted to ask a question of the Taoiseach on that basic issue.  A melee developed afterwards-----

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	58	-----and the only thing that emerged subsequently was a letter from the press secretary to the management of TV3 and the political correspondent stating the collective behaviour of journalists in attendance was disgraceful.  The Taoiseach can clarify in his own time who authorised what and what his attitude was to the response.  If a simple answer had been given there would not have been any melee.  Will the Taoiseach clarify his position for once and for all on marriage equality?  Is he in favour of same-sex marriage?  Will he confirm for the House that a referendum will be held on the issue during the lifetime of the Dáil?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Deputy Martin did not attend any of the briefings I gave to all of the parties in respect of the constitutional convention, although his party was represented and I grant that.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	60	He was too busy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	61	It may well be that he was otherwise busy.  The Government was elected with a particular mandate and, comprising two parties, set out its programme for Government very clearly.  The programme for Government includes the establishment of a constitutional convention to review named aspects of the Constitution and aspects relevant to it.  When it is functioning the convention will have an opportunity to make a case for other issues that it considers important or of sufficient priority to be given consideration with a view to action by the Government or not as the case may be.What is important is that the constitutional convention, on which I expect to move the resolution after these questions, will consider a named list of issues and will reflect on them on behalf of the Government.  It is important to note the Government, unlike its predecessors, has committed to giving an answer on each of the convention's recommendations within a four-month period.  If the Government's answer is that a referendum will not be held on a particular issue then so be it.  If the Government's answer is that a referendum will be held, the Government will set out a timeline for when it might be appropriate to hold such a referendum.Deputy Martin is well aware by now that in respect of the convention we decided to examine two issues in the first instance, which are very clearly not earth shattering but are important in their own way.  It will also be pretty easy to determine a "Yes" or "No" answer in respect of these issues, which are the reduction of the service period for the Presidency and the possibility of reducing the voting age.  The reason for choosing these two issues is to see whether the convention works efficiently, whether it would need enhanced powers and whether its structure is appropriate as it will be comprised of politicians and citizens determined by law and selected by an appropriate polling company.One of the other issues for the convention mentioned in the programme for Government is equality of marriage or same-sex marriage.  The process set out by the Government for which I speak is that the convention will reflect on the question of same-sex marriage, give its recommendation to the Government and the Government will respond on whether a referendum will be held within a four-month period.  If a referendum is to be held the Government will set out the timescale on when it would intend to hold that referendum.  Deputy Martin is aware that within the past 15 months we have held four referenda, three of which were carried and one of which was not.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I do not need a random selection of citizens to tell me whether I favour marriage equality and neither does the Tánaiste.  It is a matter on which the Oireachtas could decide tomorrow morning.  I can understand if the Taoiseach wants to go through different electoral systems, and people have different perspectives.  This is something on which every citizen has the right to decide.  They will not be told or given recommendations on this issue by a random selection of citizens.  This is not the type of issue that lends itself to this determination.  Governments must lead on these fundamental issues.  This should never have been referred to the referendum commission.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Timelines are very important.  If this is the civil rights issue of a generation then referring it to the convention opens up the very real possibility, or dare I say probability, that there will never be a referendum on this issue during the lifetime of the Government because the first two issues will take the guts of the year.  The issue of Seanad Éireann is not being referred, which one could argue is a complex issue-----

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	102	This week, the Minister for Health was officially named on the debt defaulters list in Stubbs Gazette for failing to pay debts resulting from a business deal involving a private nursing home in Tipperary.  Will the Taoiseach confirm the Minister for Health will come to the Dáil tomorrow to make a statement on this matter?  Is fíric í go bhfuil an tAire Sláinte ag glacadh le cinneadh chun tairbhe do sheirbhísí cúraim sláinte príobháideacha.  Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach sin, agus is fíric í go bhfuil an tAire Sláinte ag druidim leabaidh san earnáil phoiblí.The Minister, who has taken decisions to close 296 public nursing home beds from January until May, has a commercial interest in a private nursing home.  In my constituency, Drogheda Cottage Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital in Ardee are under threat.  One of the critical issues for the HSE is the shortage of public nursing home beds to allow for the discharge of 600 elderly patients from public hospitals.  Does the Taoiseach agree there could be a conflict of interest here and does he agree that the Minister needs to clarify his relationship with Greenhill Nursing Home?  Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that the Government's policy and that of the previous Government was to encourage privatisation in the health service, provide tax breaks for private nursing homes and provide for the closure of public nursing homes?  The Minister has a personal investment in private health care.  Will the Taoiseach ensure he comes into the Dáil and clarifies these matters?

Business in this country is perfectly legitimate.  This judgment has been properly registered, but that does not mean that the moneys involved are not to be paid by both recoursed and non-recoursed investors.  The Minister for Health has assured me that his affairs, in so far as his business interests are concerned, are entirely in order and in compliance with the code of conduct for officeholders.

The Minister has already given power of attorney, in proper circumstances, to have his interest in this matter handled in an unfettered way and at arm's length.  I spoke to the Minister this morning and he has no difficulty at all with regard to making a statement to the House.  This matter has been in the media previously.  While a person cannot be a director while a Minister, there is nothing to stop the person resuming a practice when no longer a Minister.In so far as the Minister is concerned, this is a registered judgment, but that does not mean the amount will not be paid.  The Minister has assured me it will be paid.  He is a minority investor in this matter and has no control or direction over the process.  Power of attorney has been given to legal personnel to deal with his interest in an unfettered, arm's length fashion.  The Minister has no difficulty with regard to responding to the House.  However, he will not be back until tomorrow evening to respond to the Private Members' motion.

I am simply asking that he come in and make a public statement to the Dáil.  I thank the Taoiseach for the commitment for him to do that.I understand that the Minister and the others owe €1.9 million as part of this deal.  Furthermore, I understand this money was borrowed from the Bank of Ireland, which as we know was bailed out by-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I must interrupt the Deputy.  It is not a practice or custom to deal with private matters relating to individual Members of the House.  We can deal with issues where the suitability of a person for office can be dealt with by way of a motion, but it has not been a practice allowed by my predecessors to permit the questioning of legitimate transactions by individual Members, unless there are serious grounds for doing so.  The Deputy has asked for a statement and it would be wise to keep to the tradition of allowing the Minister to come in and make a statement to clarify any outstanding issues.  I ask the Deputy to co-operate in that regard.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I will co-operate, although I do not quite understand the Chair's ruling.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	113	It is a long-standing precedent.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	114	I want to make a political comment and to ask the Taoiseach a question.  The Minister for Health has closed down 296 public nursing home beds and he has an investment in a private nursing home.  This raises a legitimate question and the Minister can come in and explain that, if he can, tomorrow.Another issue which should concern the Taoiseach is that one of the Minister's business partners is a former Fine Gael councillor, Anne Devitt, who was found by the Mahon tribunal to have behaved inappropriately in respect of planning matters.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	115	The Deputy is going way beyond what is normal practice in this House.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	116	This Government said it would be transparent.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	117	It would be wise if we allowed the facts be put on the record by the person in question.  It is not fair to ask the Taoiseach to discuss private matters as a matter for Leaders' Questions.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Let me try again.  I will abide by the Chair's ruling, but I think it is entirely appropriate for me to stand up here and ask the Taoiseach whether it is appropriate for a Minister who is closing down public nursing home beds to have an investment in a private nursing home.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The Minister for Health has taken on what is probably the most unenviable task in Irish politics, to sort out the jungle that has existed for so many years in a health system that has been dysfunctional in many areas.   All of the Minister's work and commitment is focused on that so that patients get the best level of care and attention possible.  This is not easy as structures have had to be changed and the Government is focused on introducing a single insurance system, with strong primary care systems backed by community care.  He must also deal with the spectrum of strong vested interests that have been around for some time.  The Minister is making substantial headway in a difficult situation.  Meeting the challenges in the health area requires enormous commitment from everybody, as evidenced at the end of February when so many people exited the health sector, yet the hospital plans signed off by each hospital manager involved changes of rosters, people travelling long distances and showing exceptional commitment as part of clinical and medical teams.  The code of conduct set out for every Minister means Ministers do not conduct a business while serving in a ministerial capacity and the Minister has assured me that all of his affairs, in so far as his many business interests are concerned, are entirely in order in respect of the code of conduct of officeholders.I suppose Deputy Adams could tell me about the Northern Bank or something else.  I do not know what he knows about those things, but I am not in a position to answer questions about individuals.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Taoiseach should answer the question without mentioning rubbish.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	121	We will have a public debate on a health issue this evening and tomorrow and the Minister will deal with the Deputy and his claims in so far as nursing home beds being closed are concerned.  I noticed the Deputy got a little tetchy at the mention of bank credit and status, so I would be very careful of going down that road.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	122	What about the €900,000?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I assure the Deputy that the Minister has assured me - I spoke to him this morning - that in so far as his business interests are concerned he is a minority investor in a particular nursing home in County Tipperary.  There are 13 investors in all.  He has complied with the requirements and has given power of attorney to legal representatives in an unfettered and arm's length way.  I assure Deputy Adams that Deputy Reilly has stated that when the judgment has been registered, the amount involved will be paid by the investors, although they may have internal matters to decide themselves before that happens.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Before and after the general election, the Taoiseach and the Government parties made strong commitments to cystic fibrosis sufferers and their families that they would deliver the new 100-bed special unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, which would include 34 beds for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  On 8 April of last year, the Taoiseach made a speech at the AGM of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland at which he said: "But I can tell to you that the new Unit in St. Vincent's Hospital is on track, on time, on budget and it is my intention to make sure it remains that way."  He also said: "You and your families have waited far too long for this project to open.  It can never be forgotten that cystic fibrosis patients are fighting for their lives... you don't have time for broken promises."In February of this year, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, said the unit would not open until June and in April, he said he could not commit to the 34 beds and that he was reducing it to a 20-bed minimum and a 34-bed maximum.  A protocol was agreed between the HSE, consultants and the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland on how to do this but, since then, the manager of St. Vincent's hospital has refused to sign off on it.  Obviously, the unit remains unopened.As someone who has been strongly associated with the issue, will the Taoiseach intervene directly in this matter to ensure the cystic fibrosis patients and their families are given a clear commitment as to when the new unit will open and that St. Vincent's hospital management signs off on the protocol so that people have access to the 34 beds?  Will he also assure me that, given the reports in today's The Irish Times about the HSE being written to by the Department of Health, telling it to make savings in the face of the current budget crisis in the HSE through delaying projects or taking any opportunity to reallocate resources, the delay being faced by the cystic fibrosis unit is not as a result of budget cuts or pressure on the health service to make cutbacks or defer projects?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I thank Deputy Boyd Barrett for raising a matter of serious import, which is very sensitive to people who have to deal with it.  I was proud to wear the T-shirt for cystic fibrosis in Kerry last weekend.  Sometimes when the political process makes decisions that things should happen, political personnel expect to see them happen.  I do not know what the problem in St. Vincent's hospital is that the protocol will not be signed off on, but I will find out for the Deputy and for everybody else.  Through the political process, one expects that when money is voted for particular projects or strategies, it is followed through, timelined and delivered on time.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett is aware, in a range of areas around the country, that has actually happened to great effect, in particular, in road development.  I assure the Deputy that, similar to the issue to which I referred in response to Deputy Adams, the nature and scale of the change that has to be made in the health area to bring about an effective health system for every patient irrespective of his or her need must be delivered with the greatest efficiency and competency and that people get the treatment they expect.The question of accountability through the HSE is one that concerns me greatly because for years massive budgets of taxpayers' money have been allocated by this House and where evidence of full accountability has never been evident at political level.  I am not suggesting anyone ran away with it in fraudulent fashion but the diversion of money from where it was intended to go in the first instance has happened on so many occasions that it is no longer a joke.  That has to, and will, change because there has to be serious accountability as to how money is spent right down through the system as distinct from what we have had in the past.  I do not know the detail of why this cystic fibrosis unit at St. Vincent's hospital has been delayed but I will find out and will inform the Deputy and the House.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.The letter from the Secretary General, which I saw referred to in the media, speaks of a HSE response to dealing with the situation we have now that is not acceptable to the Department of Health and, in the vast majority of respects, is not acceptable to me either.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	126	I thank the Taoiseach for his response.  I appreciate his commitment to look into this matter.  The cystic fibrosis sufferers, families and the association want to hear as soon as possible that there is a date for the opening of that unit and that the protocol will signed be off on.  Will the Taoiseach also look into why the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has not really been engaging with the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland on this issue?  It has contacted his office to try to get a response from him but it is getting nothing.  Similarly, it is getting no engagement whatsoever from the management of St. Vincent's hospital.  It will be greatly assured if the Taoiseach can come back as soon as possible so there can be a clear announcement as to when the unit will be opened and the 34-bed maximum allocation for cystic fibrosis suffers will be available.  Will he assure us that these delays are not resulting from what the media reported today as pressure from the Minister's Department on hospitals and on the HSE to make savings through schemes that are in development and are not yet in place, which can be delayed or deferred, or any opportunity to reallocate resources?  That is what the Department is saying to the HSE.  Is this delay in the cystic fibrosis unit possibly as a result of that pressure coming from the Minister's Department?  Will the Taoiseach assure us that is not the case and that the unit will open as soon as possible?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	127	Long before this current situation arose, the decision was made to have a cystic fibrosis unit in St. Vincent's hospital.  It is very badly needed and whether it is a minimum or a maximum is an issue for medical people to make a judgment on.  I spoke at the AGM of the Cystic Fibrosis Association of Ireland in Westport and said the unit was on time, on track and on budget.  When moneys are voted through for these kinds of projects, one expects them to be delivered on time.  I do not know the reason that has not happened to date but it is appropriate that the Minister for Health has the opportunity to respond in the Private Members' motion on health and I will see that he refers specifically to the question of the cystic fibrosis unit in St. Vincent's hospital.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.I have been advised by the Office of the Attorney General that, as of 30 June 2012, the number of staff serving in the office was 122.2.  Two competitions are under way to fill essential legal positions, so it is expected that the staffing level will increase to 129 in the coming months.  The number of staff serving is regularly reviewed with a view to ensuring that there are sufficient resources available to carry out the necessary functions of the office.  The current competitions arose from such a review.  Further, in the context of the public service agreement review mechanisms, the office regularly updates its targets and objectives and part of this process is to address efficiency.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	129	I have two specific reasons for asking this question about staffing.  The Taoiseach may recall that last November, he agreed to meet Opposition leaders to discuss demands for an independent inquiry into sexual abuse allegations in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda.  At that time, the Taoiseach said he was taking advice from the Attorney General but that he would meet Opposition leaders.  Dúirt an Taoiseach go mbeadh an cruinniu sin againn roimh Nollaig.  That did not happen.  I asked for a meeting in January but it did not happen.  I again raised the issue in March.  On each occasion the Taoiseach said he would meet Opposition leaders on the matter.  I also asked the Minister for Health a series of written questions and to each he replied that he was consulting with the Office of the Attorney General.  The last time I raised this issue was in May.  The Taoiseach has given me and other Opposition leaders four or five commitments to meet us, but we have not met.I ask the question because I am concerned there may be a capacity issue in the Office of the Attorney General.  It is 17 years since complaints of sexual abuse in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda were first made.  The longer the matter remains unresolved the more the victims are traumatised.Can that meeting be held?  What has the Attorney General been saying about these matters and what has delayed the process?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	130	The point the Deputy makes is not directly relevant to the question he asked about the number of staff currently employed in the Office of the Attorney General and whether or not assessments of staff numbers and efficiencies have been carried out.  I have answered both those questions.There are matters relating to the issue raised by the Deputy that I do not wish to discuss in public.  I will give the Deputy a private briefing on the difficulties that arise in this case.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	131	The point is fully relevant.  I was told at the different times I raised these issues that the Government was waiting for advice from the Attorney General.  Not having been advised otherwise, I was concerned that there may be pressures on that office.  The Taoiseach also noted on a number of occasions that there are pressures on the Attorney General's office due to the demands of the EU-IMF programme.  At one point, he noted that this meant that vitally important legislation, such as comprehensive legislation on domestic violence or to recognise the collective bargaining rights of workers which was promised in the programme for Government, was delayed.  These are issues that have no sensitivities attached to them.  They are commitments made by the Government.  What steps are being taken to deal with these outstanding matters?I thank the Taoiseach for his answer that there is no problem of pressure in the Attorney General's office.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	132	As Deputy Adams is aware, the Government publishes a list of proposed legislation to be drafted, adopted, published and dealt with in the House.  The vast majority of that legislation comes through the Department of Justice and Equality.The staff of the Attorney General's office is in two sections, the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel and the legal advisory section, serviced by a common administrative secretariat.  The same personnel vet and prepare legislation.  They have been working continuously for the past number of months dealing with a range of legislation that has been published.  Some of that legislation is required by the troika and therefore time-pressured but some is to comply with the requirements of Ministers wishing to push through priority legislation that is part of the programme the Government.  We try to achieve the best result from that list but it is not always possible to do so.  Some of these things, when one delves into them, are discovered to be more complex than was previously envisaged.The staff of the Attorney General's office does extraordinary work.  There are two vacancies to be filled in accordance with a normal competition.  The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel has 29 sanctioned positions and arrangements are being made to recruit two assistant parliamentary counsel, grade 2, and one legislative editor, which will bring staff levels in that office up to its full complement.  The office has met the challenges presented in recent years to produce significant amounts of legislation.  Last year, for example, the office drafted 55 separate pieces of legislation.  It produced 52 Bills in 2009 and 39 Bills in 2010.  This year it has, so far, produced 24 Bills.  The complexity and extent of the Bills varies.  That takes up a deal of time.It is proposed to comply with the Government's published list of proposed legislation.  Both sections of the Attorney General's office are working exceptionally hard, often at weekends, to meet the requirements here.A review is carried out on a regular basis to see that staff numbers are at maximum level and that staff give of their best, which they do.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.As I have stated on many occasions, while this Government does not support a return to the social partnership model, we recognise the value of constructive dialogue with representatives of all sectors of society as we continue to work through the many difficulties facing the country.Since the Easter recess, I have met with representatives of the IFA on 25 April and 4 May.  I spoke at the IMPACT annual conference on 18 May in Killarney.  I addressed the IBEC business breakfast on two occasions, and met with representatives of IBEC on 21 June. I also intend to meet with the Croke Park agreement implementation body, which includes representatives of the public service trade unions, later this week.  In line with the Government's approach to social dialogue, relevant Ministers continue to have bilateral contact with social partners on issues of concern to them.In addition, the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which comes within the remit of my Department, continues to provide a forum for multilateral dialogue on the economic, social and environmental challenges facing the country.  The council continues to meet on a regular basis.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Some employers do not want to waste a good recession and many workers have been denied rights.  The Taoiseach spoke eloquently about the Vita Cortex employees in Cork and said that what they wanted was respect.  We saw similar situations in La Senza, Lagan Brick, Game, Vodafone, Irish Cement and Diageo.  I understand that 25 workers currently occupy a call centre company, Éist agus Cuidiú Teo., in Gaoth Dobhair, County Donegal, which has received substantial State funding.  Has the Taoiseach raised any of these issues with the social partners or discussed steps that could be taken to avoid issues such as these?Last week, a large delegation of workers from Lagan Brick was brought to Leinster House by Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin.  The workers had been on strike for 206 days and they received unequivocal support from Deputies and Senators in all parties.  A big company, Lagan Brick, refuses to give workers the dignity and respect they deserve.  They are not asking for anything extraordinary.  They are asking for their entitlements.  The company needs to engage with the workers' union representatives and to agree to pay them their redundancy entitlements.Has the Government discussed these issues with the social partners?  People are being denied redundancy payments to which they are entitled and deserve.  Has the Taoiseach discussed these matters with the social partners?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	135	No one likes to see people out on strike.  The machinery of the State has been well tried over many years in difficult circumstances, not least of which was the Vita Cortex incident to which Deputy Adams referred.When a dispute arises the facilities of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation are available to assist in the resolution of the dispute.Deputy Adams will be aware that last July the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, announced his intention to reform the State's industrial relations machinery and to replace the five existing employment rights bodies with two bodies.  One body will be responsible for dealing with first instance complaints and the other will deal with appeals.  He has undertaken two public consultation processes on the matter and this month he intends to seek Government approval on drafting the workplace relations Bill.  It is the intention to have the Bill enacted in the autumn and the new system up and running by the beginning of next year.It is most unfortunate to hear about the case which the Deputy mentioned and the period of time that the workers have been on strike.  I do not know the details of the case but the machinery of industrial relations and the co-operation of the Department in so far as the Minister is concerned are available at all times for attempting to resolve these difficulties, whatever the nature of the actual problem.I will meet the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the public service unions tomorrow regarding the report on the Croke Park agreement.  This issue will obviously be referred to in the context of those discussions.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	136	My question was about the social partners and the Taoiseach's engagement with them.  Have the Government's plans to amalgamate the five employment rights bodies been discussed with the social partners?  Will the change improve the entitlements of workers?  I think we will see more of this.  I sat with Members of the Taoiseach's party as we heard from the Lagan Brick folks, who have been on strike for 208 or 209 days.  A spouse of one of the workers described the difficulties she faces in making ends meet.  This is a very profitable company which has public contracts with local government and, for all I know, with Departments.The processes favour the employers and especially the big employers.  A fine of €1,000 is a pittance for an employer but it is a huge amount to take from the pocket of a worker and his or her partner.  It is no accident that workers are taking over their workplaces.  In my opinion they are doing so because they have nothing else to lose.  The Taoiseach acknowledged that the workers in Vita Cortex wanted respect.  They should not be required to endure strikes for almost six months to get that respect.  They are not asking for anything extravagant, like big bonuses or breaking the ceiling on pay.  They are asking for appropriate redundancy payments.  Where should they go given that the State's mechanisms are not functioning in support of them or their rights?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	137	Deputy Adams will be aware that, in the case of reform of the joint labour committees, JLCs, and registered employment agreements, REAs, the process of making employment regulation orders, EROs, was found by the High Court to be unconstitutional, together with an identified lack of adequate Oireachtas scrutiny of the process.  That supports the case for the main features of the recommendations for reform put forward in the Duffy Walsh report.  Following the High Court ruling of July 2011, the Government's priority has been to prepare and deliver a comprehensive reform package because the implications of the judgment are not confined to the joint labour committee system.  A programme of reform of the JLC and REA systems is required to address all the recommendations for reform put forward in the report, as well as the broad implications of the High Court ruling in the John Grace Fried Chicken case.There was a constructive Second Stage debate in this House and following further consultations with the social partners and other interests a number of amendments were introduced on Committee Stage to strengthen or clarify certain provisions of the Bill.  These include provisions dealing with the principles and policies applying to the framing of REAs and EROs, the timeframe for those provisions and the granting of temporary exemptions from the obligation to pay the terms prescribed under EROs and REAs.I would like to think that the work the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is doing on structural reform will be in the interest of everybody because it will provide a resolution process where a complaint is lodged.  To a great extent the Croke Park agreement has delivered industrial peace.  A number of cases have been ongoing for some time but the agreement has to be implemented in full and expedited to meet our own targets.  We want a process that is clear, straightforward and works so that where legitimate complaints arise they can be resolved satisfactorily and people and businesses are allowed to conduct their affairs in the interest of the economy, the country and both workers and management.  That is why the machinery of the State has been tried and tested in severe circumstances over the years and it is always available to deal with concerns or disputes such as those mentioned by Deputy Adams.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	138	The existing resolution mechanisms are not working in the current climate and they did not work for the Vita Cortex or Lagan Brick workers.  These disputes require a strongly proactive approach on the part of the Government of the day.  There was no need for the Vita Cortex dispute to persist as long as it did.  It could have been resolved much earlier if a more proactive approach had been taken.  The existing mechanisms simply do not work in situations like that.  We need a process that cuts to the chase.Engaging with the social partners on these issues can lead to new mechanisms, which are needed because in the current economic collapse these situations are arising with greater frequency and workers are being left behind.  In many instances they are the last to be considered in such circumstances.In the context of social partnership talks, has the Taoiseach discussed with farming organisations the need for immediate support in the context of the appallingly wet weather and the damaging impact it is having on agricultural incomes and farming and harvesting generally?  Across all sectors of farming it has become a serious issue.  This is a vital industry and I ask whether the consultations entered into by the Taoiseach have focused on the need to help the farming community in its hour of need.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	139	When I meet the social partners and the public service unions I intend to ask their views on where the machinery of the State falls down.  It works in the vast majority of cases and, as Deputy Martin will be aware, at the end of the day in disputes like the one in Cork it is a case of the resolution of the people and an understanding on the other side that the matter has to be ended.  State machinery or no State machinery, there will be resolution of these disputes if there is a willingness to engage and deal with the problems that arise.The Deputy mentioned the difficulties that the atrocious weather has caused for the farming community.  The losses have already been substantial.  I have seen tractors bogged down in fields after they attempted to cut silage.  The fact that more rain fell in June than during the preceding six months speaks for itself.  It has been an extraordinary year for bad weather and rainfall.  I have discussed the issue with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, who is in constant contact with the farming organisations and is investigating how he might be able to help.  The farming organisations have requested early payment of part of the single farm payment.For now, however, there is an immediate crisis where fodder is required and substantial losses are being incurred by farmers.In respect of the flooding that occurred in Deputy Martin's county, including Douglas, Glanmire and Clonakilty, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government hopes to receive a report on it this week.  He will examine that report to see if he can assist in any possible way those whose businesses or houses have been flooded.  It is a terrible thing to happen.  I note from media reports of the topography that even early warnings were inadequate, given the extent of rain that fell in a short time.  There is evidence of this happening also in Britain and to an even more serious extent in Russia.The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, is well aware of the losses to the farming industry because of the disastrous weather.  His colleague, the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is expecting a report on the flooding issue in Cork and will try to respond in the best way possible arising from that.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	145	Let me give the Taoiseach some figures, if I may, for him to cogitate on - these are from the Irish League of Credit Unions.  Some 1.8 million citizens have less than €100 per month to live on, after bills are paid.  Some 50% have had to borrow to pay household bills in the past, with 10% of them using moneylenders in the past 12 months.  Some 17%, or over 600,000 citizens, have nothing left each month when the bills are paid.We sometimes wonder why people become disenchanted with and alienated from electoral politics and parliamentary systems.  This is all as a result of austerity and if we were all in it together-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I am sorry, Deputy, but this is a straightforward question about the number of civil servants employed in the Taoiseach's office and the cost.  We cannot get into other matters.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	147	Can I just finish my point, a Cheann Comhairle?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Yes, but please stick to the question.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	149	We also have a situation in the Department of the Taoiseach where a ceiling for special advisers is set at €92,000, yet some of the Taoiseach's special advisers, including one who was in the news recently, earn almost twice that.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I am sorry but that is an entirely separate matter.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I consciously did not name the persons involved, a Cheann Comhairle.If there are to be cuts - we are approaching a winter of cuts - they should start at the top.  They should start in the Taoiseach's office with the man who is in charge of the Government and the staff he employs there.  That is how we will get an end to the inequality that austerity is reinforcing, as well as a narrowing of the social gap which is being widened daily by austerity policies.I ask the Taoiseach to show leadership on this issue by implementing the pay cap that his own Government introduced.  Are any of those five staff, who the Taoiseach says are working on constituency matters, being paid above the Government's cap?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	152	The Deputy seems to suggest that these people are all on excessive salaries.  The total of their annual salaries is €289,151.  That is a gross figure, which is about €450 net on average per week.I note the Deputy's comment about the report by the Irish League of Credit Unions, which is by no means to be discounted.  We all know many families who are seriously challenged in these times.  We are not the only ones in Europe who are now so affected.  The Government is well aware of this, however, which is why we reversed the minimum wage in the memorandum of understanding.  That is why we brought thousands of families out of the universal social charge requirement.  We did not increase income tax or taxes on employment in order to give the best opportunity to business and employment creation.  We downsized the scale of the banks and required the two pillar banks to lend €3.5 billion of new loans this year so that these opportunities can be implemented.The Deputy asked me the number of civil servants employed in my office and I have answered him.  I note that some people seem to think that one should not have a constituency office for the benefit of constituents at all.  Whether one makes no representations or many, these matters become the focus of public attention.  If somebody stops Deputy Adams on the street and says, "I live here in Dundalk, I've applied for the disability benefit and I'm on appeal for the last three months", is he supposed to say, "Sorry, I can't deal with your query here.  That's a constituency matter"?  My constituency office, which I rarely attend due to the business of Government, constantly deals with queries from people all over Ireland but mostly from the western region.  They are normal constituency queries that come in about everything one could think of.  These staff work exceptionally hard and give an enormous commitment to dealing with people's problems.  As I said, their average net income is €450 per week.I am not discounting in any way the impact or relevance of the report conducted by the Irish League of Credit Unions.  The Government is well aware of that.  The budget for 2013, which will obviously be challenging, will be framed in a way that is seen to be fair, equitable and affordable.  The drive has to be not to penalise employment and work, but to provide opportunities whereby businesses can flourish and jobs are created.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	153	My Department's role in relation to the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad will be the usual one of a sponsoring Department, including preparing proposals for legislation for the referendum, liaising with the Attorney General's office in the preparation of the legislation and support for Government when the legislation is being debated in the Oireachtas.The proposal to abolish Seanad Éireann was signalled by the Government parties prior to the general election.  The Dáil and Seanad will have an opportunity to fully debate the necessary legislation when it is published.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	154	Is that it?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	156	It is 15 months into the Government's term of office and this is a promise the Taoiseach made with great solemnity well before the last general election.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	158	We did not.  Actually, we made none.  We deliberately made no promise before the election.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I said at the time that this was no time to make promises that one could not fulfil.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	161	Deputies should address their comments through the Chair, please.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	162	Unfortunately, the Taoiseach made too many of them and the people now know that he could never fulfil them.  He has lost a lot of trust and credibility as a result.  Coming into government, there was no document, preparatory work or research.Over the past 15 months, we have had various announcements about this matter and now the constitutional convention is being established.  I asked earlier about marriage equality but the Taoiseach refused to answer any question on that.  He has decided to refer that issue to the convention but, in his own wisdom, not the Seanad question.   The Taoiseach has given the distinct impression that a great deal of work has been done but that proposals are far down the road.  Perhaps he will outline for the House how much work has been done on the proposal to abolish the Seanad, how many Articles of the Constitution will require amendment-change in this regard, who is overseeing that work and the timeline in respect of the holding of a referendum on abolition of the Seanad.The referendum on children's rights is promised for the autumn, which we are all agreed should be held on its own.  The constitutional conventional agenda will also be dealt with this year.  As such, we are looking at 2013 at the earliest in terms of a referendum on abolition of the Seanad, or are we?  It is time the Taoiseach produced some evidence of work on this issue.  Is it his intention to publish a position paper on the abolition of the Seanad and has a great deal of technical work been done that could, for example, facilitate debate on this issue by the Oireachtas?  I would have thought the convention a good forum for discussion of this issue given people have differing views on whether there should be one or two Chambers in our Parliament.  The original intent of the convention was to bring about radical reform in terms of how we govern ourselves.  However, it will not now do this.  It will not deal with this Parliament or with the relationship between it and the Executive or with whether we have a bicameral or unicameral system.  It appears that all concerned could have done with that type of reflection.  Nonetheless, the Taoiseach is ploughing ahead.Perhaps the Taoiseach would respond to my questions on how much work has been done, how many Articles of the Constitution will require amendment, who is overseeing this work and when he expects the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad to be held.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	163	Unfortunately for Deputy Martin the Government intends to fulfil its programme for Government, which commits to two issues, which will be outside of the constitutional convention, being decided by referenda.  The two issues concerned are children's rights and abolition of the Seanad.  The question in regard to the holding of the referendum on the fiscal stability treaty was not envisaged at that time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I am asking about the Seanad.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I am coming to that matter.  The presidential election and two referenda were held last year.  We need now to reflect on whether it is good to hold more than one referendum on the same day, taking into account the simplicity or complexity of the issues involved.I can assure Deputy Martin that a great deal of work has been done on the proposal in regard to the abolition of the Seanad.  This will require the deletion of all references to the Seanad in the Constitution.  In addition to deleting all Articles which establish the Seanad it will also be necessary to amend Articles which primarily deal with other matters but which vest specific constitutional functions in the Seanad or in its members.  The types of functions which will have to be considered in this context include, for example, the Seanad's role in triggering the process for determining whether a Bill constitutes a money Bill, motions for early signature of Bills by the President and membership of the Cathaoirleach of the Presidential Commission.  This work is being overseen by the Department of the Taoiseach.  A great deal of that work has been done.Deputy Martin asked when the referendum will be held.  Perhaps he might offer a suggestion.  The children's rights referendum will be held in the autumn.  It is hoped that ongoing work in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs will enable publication of the relevant legislation following the Dáil recess, at which time a date for the holding of that referendum will be fixed.  It is a complex issue and should be dealt with by way of stand-alone referendum.   Ireland holds the Presidency of the European Union from 1 January to end June 2013, during which time the Government and Ministers will be required to focused on dealing with issues affecting this country and on issues relating to the responsibilities of our Presidency.  Deputy Martin will be aware that in terms of Presidency of the European Union Ireland follows Cyprus and precedes Lithuania and Greece.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	166	The Taoiseach is filibustering.  We know all this.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	167	No, I am not filibustering.  Does Deputy Martin suggest the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad should be held in February, March, April, May or June, during which time we may well have to deal with the conclusion of the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020, namely, the budget for the European Union?  Were I to agree to such proposition from Deputy Martin he would be the first to say we cannot do it then because we will be tied up with the Presidency of the European Union and all that involves and means for the Irish economy in terms of dealing with the range of issues that have been around for a long time.I assure the Deputy that a great deal of work has been done on the question of the abolition of the Seanad.  As I stated, this will require the deletion of reference to the Seanad from every relevant Article, with no loss on the corresponding side in respect of the rights of citizens in so far as the Dáil is concerned.  I will not make a pronouncement as to when that referendum will be held.  However, I can assure the Deputy that it will be held.  The people will be asked the question of whether they want the Seanad to be abolished.  I believe it should be abolished.  I understood from Deputy Martin's comments prior to the election that Fianna Fáil was of the same mind.  However, the Deputy appears to be rowing back on this now.  This is not the first time someone in his party has done so.  However, that is a matter for his party.I again assure Deputy Martin that the programme for Government is clear on this issue and that the commitment therein on this issue will be carried through.  It is only a matter of deciding the appropriate time to do so.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	168	The Taoiseach is assuring me of nothing.  The setting of a date for this referendum is continually being pushed out.  I recall the Taoiseach being equally as adamant a year ago that it would be held this year.  The Taoiseach definitively said then that it would be held in 2012.  He now says it will not happen during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union because he does not want anything to spoil that party and has suggested that it will be held in the latter half of 2013.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I asked the Deputy to make a suggestion but he did not answer me.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I will deal with that now.  Unlike the Taoiseach, I have no need to filibuster.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	171	The Deputy should answer my question.

Reducing the number of Dáil Members by eight and abolishing the Seanad while doing absolutely nothing to change how we behave is not radical reform.  It is optic politics and playing to the gallery.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	215	Not now, but at the appropriate time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	216	Why?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	217	The other fact is that, as the Deputy knows, a reduction of the Dáil numbers by eight is the limit without holding another referendum.  The constitutional convention is to look at the electoral system - whether we have multi-seat constituencies-----
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	218	But I am asking-----
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	219	-----single-seat constituencies, the French system or whatever.  It will be very interesting to see what the constitutional convention will come up with in that regard.  That will be part of a broader electoral reform package, which I know the Deputy wants.  What he wants to do is to try to restructure this in such a way that his party might have some fleeting chance of getting back into office again.  That is also a matter for the people.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	220	We have been led to believe that an incredible amount of work is going on behind the scenes.  Could the Taoiseach share that with us?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The Deputy asks a question to get an answer.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	222	We cannot get an answer.  That is the point.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	223	The reduction by eight seats and - if the people decide to approve it - the abolition of the Seanad will reduce the overall Oireachtas size by 33%.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	224	The Taoiseach is on the way to abolishing democracy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	225	All this information will be out there at the appropriate time - we have a lot of stuff to do now.  In respect of the question of the Seanad being abolished, I will give all the information to everybody when it is appropriate on the lead-in to the question being asked of the people.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	226	We are being asked to discuss seven items in the constitutional convention, including gay marriage, equality, electoral systems-----
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	227	And others.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	228	We will not go through that now.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I am not going to go through that.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	230	We are talking about the abolition of the Seanad.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The point about the Seanad is as follows.  What is the objection to sharing all the background work on what it takes to abolish the Seanad with everybody in the Oireachtas?  Why not do that now?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I do not want to confuse the Deputy with an overload of information.  He can believe me that there is a great deal of-----
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	233	The Taoiseach might confuse himself.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	234	-----interesting material there.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Is there?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	236	There is, actually.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Could he share it with me?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Yes, I will share it with him at the appropriate time - of course I will.  That, together with the constitutional convention review of the electoral system, will, I think, provide great fodder for those who are in politics and those who aspire to be in politics.  All in its good time.  The Deputy can take it that the programme for Government in this matter-----
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	239	The Government Senators are on the run, I think.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	240	-----will be implemented in full.  It is just a question of timing.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	241	If Deputy Martin is looking for reform, he should stop the posturing.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	242	As Shakespeare said at one time, all is in the timing.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The Government is eight Senators down - eight Deputies down.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Readiness is very important.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Shakespeare also said: "There is a tide in the affairs of men."  One thing I have learned from being here is that when the Taoiseach decides not to answer a question, he does not answer it.  I was going to ask him when we could expect legislation on the future of the Seanad and when a referendum would be likely to be held.  There is a seanfhocal in the North that states "Whatever you say, say nothing."  It must have come from Mayo because the Taoiseach is right on the button.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	246	What is the seanfhocal?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Let me try another couple of questions.  Sinn Féin's view is that the issue of the future of the Seanad should be part of the constitutional convention.  If we are carrying out a thorough review of the Constitution, covering the electoral system, the political system, presidential terms and so on, it seems appropriate to put the Seanad into that also.  Some of these other issues are also matters for the programme for Government but he has no problem putting those into the constitutional convention.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	248	Perhaps the Deputy might ask his supplementary question, as I want to move on.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	249	A reformed Seanad could find space for people such as the Traveller community, for people who are disenfranchised, for people from the diaspora and citizens living in the North.  Will the electorate be presented with options on the future of the Seanad or will it simply be a choice between the status quo and abolition?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The answer to that question is "No".  The legislation and all the information surrounding it will be debated in full by everybody and the question on the ballot paper will require a "Yes" or "No".
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	251	"Yes" or "No" to what?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	252	To the abolition of the Seanad.  The question will be: "Do you wish to abolish Seanad Éireann?", requiring a "Yes" or "No" answer.  It will be very straightforward and the people will give their answer.  On the run-in to that legislation being published, all the information Deputy Martin and others require will be made available to the fullest extent possible and that debate will take place.  This is part of the programme for Government and both parties agreed it.  That is outside the convention as is the child protection referendum - those two are very clear.  We will hold those when it is appropriate to do so.  In respect of electoral reform, the constitutional convention will reflect on that.  If we did not have an agreement beforehand-----
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	253	Or a Labour Deputy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	254	-----clearly the Seanad option could be one for the convention to consider.  However, we have already put it into the programme for Government that if the constitutional convention and the persons who serve on it decide that there is another issue or other issues that are of such importance that they should also be considered by the constitutional convention, as I told the Deputy at the briefings he attended, it will be possible for the constitutional convention to do that.  The Seanad and the child protection referendum are outside the convention and are part of the programme for Government.  The question will be put to the people in due course.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I have a very short question.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	256	No.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I will be very brief.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	258	We have had a good deal of time on this.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The Taoiseach made a very pertinent point.  He said that if the constitutional convention wishes to raise other issues, it could do so.  What would happen if the constitutional convention wishes to raise the future of the Seanad?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	260	It may certainly reflect on it, but the Government has already decided that the question of the abolition of the Seanad will be put to the people.  In the ordinary course of events when the constitutional convention makes a finding to the Government, for instance, in respect of the reduction of the voting age to 17 or the reduction of the presidential term of office from seven years to five years, it will outline its reflection, finding and recommendation.  In each of those cases the Government has committed to responding "Yes" or "No" within four months.  For instance, if the constitutional convention recommends that the voting age should be reduced, the Government will respond positively within four months to them all.  However, in the case of the Seanad and child protection, the Government has already decided that we will have a referendum on each of these two things.  They are both complex - it is just a question of timing.  If we had not had the fiscal stability referendum, we might have had one before summer and one after summer.  It was most important that it stand on its own and that the child protection one would stand on its own.  I am hopeful that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will be able to bring a consensus wording to Government shortly and we will be able to publish the legislation for that very early in the new session.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	261	One referendum does not make a summer.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	262	Nor one swallow, in which there is some providence in respect of his fall.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.As I have previously said in the House, Cabinet confidentiality is provided for in the Constitution and any consideration of legislation would have to take this into account.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	264	The Taoiseach can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe this is in the programme for Government.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	265	Yes, it is.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	266	It states that there will be new legislation on Cabinet confidentiality.  That is why I was surprised by the brevity of the response.  My supplementary questions were to ask about the current proposals for proposed legislation on Cabinet confidentiality.  I was going to ask him to outline what the Government intended to do in line with its programme for Government commitment and whether it wished, for example, to facilitate pre-budget discussions between Ministers and the Oireachtas in a much more open format than happened in the past.  That might deal with some of the difficulties we have experienced in recent times and Ministers could feel free to come out and argue their positions regarding their Departments' Estimates, for example.  How does the Taoiseach believe the programme for Government commitment will be met?  What will the content of the new Bill or any legislation be and when is it expected?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	267	As the Deputy is aware, Article 28.4.3° of the Constitution contains a specific reference to Cabinet confidentiality and I do not propose to have a referendum to change that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	268	What does the reference to Cabinet confidentiality in the programme for Government mean?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The reference is not specific, but it is a requirement of all Ministers that Cabinet confidentiality be maintained obviously in the interests of the work of Government and the national interest.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	270	The programme for Government proposes legislation on Cabinet confidentiality - that is the point.  Obviously Sir Humphrey does not want it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	271	The Deputy should not mind Sir Humphrey.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	272	Where has the political commitment gone?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	273	Sir Humphrey has not visited the Department of the Taoiseach in a very long time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I just want to find out about the proposal.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	275	Were his ghost to appear, he would be reminded that Article 28.4.3° of the Constitution deals with Cabinet confidentiality and that the Taoiseach has no intention of holding a referendum on that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	276	The Taoiseach proposed it.  Can he clarify what the programme for Government means in regard to legislation on Cabinet confidentiality?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	277	What it means here is that the Constitution refers specifically to Cabinet confidentiality and I am not proposing to change the legislation by having a referendum on that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The Taoiseach proposed he was going to change it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	279	He has obviously changed his mind.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	280	What does the programme for Government mean?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I call Deputy Adams.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	282	Please explain, Taoiseach.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	283	Does he know what is in his own programme for Government?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I call Deputy Adams and I ask that Members address their questions through the Chair.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	285	Any legislation that is proposed has to take Article 28.4.3°-----
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The programme for Government is very clear and the Taoiseach cited it all this session and the Government's will on these issues.  It contains a commitment to bring forward legislation on the issue of Cabinet confidentiality.  It also says that the Government has become too centralised and unaccountable.  There is lots of evidence of that, particularly around the Economic Management Council when we cannot even ask questions of the doings of that council even though it is dealing with the troika, the economy, banks and issues that are having a vital impact, particularly on citizens who are suffering under austerity policy.  As I understand it, has the Taoiseach just torn up another programme for Government commitment by saying he has no intention of bringing forward legislation?  This issue also affects the issue of health where members of the Cabinet sub-committee on health cannot ask questions about what is going on there either.  How does this fit into the commitment to more transparent, open reform?  The Taoiseach hailed the last election as the people's revolution or some such term.  I am citing to the Taoiseach his programme for Government which has a commitment to bring forward legislation on the issue of Cabinet confidentiality and he also cited that the Government is too centralised and unaccountable.  Has he just told us that he is not bringing forward such legislation?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	287	He has.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	288	The relevant Article 28.4.3° states:The confidentiality of discussions at meetings of the Government shall be respected in all circumstances save only where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in respect of a particular matter -i  in the interests of the administration of justice by a Court, orii by virtue of an overriding public interest, pursuant to an application in that behalf by a tribunal appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into a matter stated by them to be of public importance.The concern here might have arisen in that the provision that was being inserted into the Constitution covered very narrow circumstances in which Cabinet confidentiality discussions might not be respected.  This has been enshrined in our Constitution for the past 14 years and that provision cannot be changed without a referendum.  I do not have any intention of seeking a referendum to change it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	289	May I ask a brief supplementary?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	290	Yes, if it is very brief.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I understand the Taoiseach has perhaps forgotten why the commitment was made 15 months ago in the programme for Government but may I enlighten him?  His partners in government and his own members criticised continuously Cabinet confidentiality for many years; they felt it was too restrictive, it did not allow enough information out, etc.  I suspect that is the reason that commitment was put into the programme for Government.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	292	What is the Deputy's question?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The Taoiseach was the author of the programme for Government.  It is incredible that he would come into this House-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	294	What is the Deputy's question?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	299	It is incredible that the Taoiseach would come forward in that manner.

We know all about articles in the Constitution.  This is a commitment to introduce legislation on the subject of Cabinet confidentiality.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	304	This is Question Time.

Obviously the Government will reflect on the issue in so far as knowing the truth about the bank guarantee-----

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I am speaking here for Sinn Féin.  Let me put my question again.  It is very straightforward.  We looked at the programme for Government.  The Taoiseach has a commitment to legislate on the issue of Cabinet confidentiality.  I asked him a very straight question about what steps has he taken to bring forward legislation on Cabinet confidentiality and if he just tore up that commitment.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Yes.  That is it.  That is the reply.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Fair enough.  The fact is that we hear more about the budgetary committee-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	344	That is a separate issue.  The Deputy should put down a separate question.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	346	We are not going into the German Parliament at this stage.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	347	The PAC that the Taoiseach cited was assisting the Taoiseach to fulfil his programme for Government commitment.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	348	In case the Deputy did not hear that properly-----
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I did hear it properly.  The Taoiseach does not need to repeat himself.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	350	-----the point is that the European Commission-----

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	352	-----had to apologise for information that was leaked when it was sent to the budgetary committee of the German Parliament because it is a requirement that all countries that are in a programme send their information to the paying countries.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	353	Will the Taoiseach apologise for tearing up a commitment?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	354	We changed that here so that information that is being sent to those countries that contribute to Ireland is lodged in the Houses of the Oireachtas simultaneously.  That does not arise anymore and I hope the Deputy understands that very clearly.  Yes, it was wrong that this information was leaked in the beginning and it should not have leaked from the European Commission through the budgetary committee of the Bundestag.  That matter has been changed because when that information is now presented to those countries which contribute to Ireland, which the Deputy wanted to get out of here and for them to take their money with them, it is lodged simultaneously in the Oireachtas Library for all Members and all of the public to have access to it.Written Answers follow Adjournment.

I refer to the access to alcohol and drugs.  When is it proposed to introduce the sale of alcohol Bill and the criminal justice Bill?On a point of clarification, did the Taoiseach indicate during Leaders' Questions that tomorrow's Order Paper would facilitate the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, to make a statement to the House?  I ask for confirmation for the Whips.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	362	Everyone is appalled at what happened in the Phoenix Park.  The video of what happened is disgraceful and it is scandalous that three young people died.  I made the point that 800,000 people were in Galway for the Volvo ocean race finale and there were no incidents.  This particular concert in the Phoenix Park was one of a series of three concerts and there were no incidents at the other two concerts.  It may be something to do with the type of music but it is a tragic happening for the families.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, will be happy to report to the House when he has been briefed by the Garda Commissioner.  I heard the chairperson of the joint policing committee speaking about it this morning.  There needs to be an in-depth analysis of what happened and there will be such an analysis.The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, has done a great deal of work on the sale of alcohol, as has the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  I expect the sale of alcohol Bill will come before the House in the next session.  I cannot be more accurate at this stage but it will certainly be introduced before the end of the year.In response to an earlier question, the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, will be very happy to make a statement to the House when he returns from Cyprus where he is attending an informal health meeting arranged by the Cypriot Presidency.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	363	A number of Deputies sought to raise the issue of the events at Phoenix Park as Topical Issue matters.  Rightly or wrongly I decided not to grant those requests today until the Minister has had an opportunity to be informed of the details.  I hope to be able to facilitate Deputies during the week when there may be more information.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I agree entirely with the Taoiseach.  I do not agree it is down to the music but it is a terrible tragedy for the families involved.  My question is about promised legislation.  When will the HSE governance Bill be brought before the House?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I am hopeful this Bill can be published before the end of this session.  As I informed the Deputy last week, a great deal of work is ongoing in respect of this Bill and it is a Government priority now that the Personal Insolvency Bill has been published.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	366	Will it be published before the summer recess?

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I refer to the strategic infrastructure Bill.  The Taoiseach informed the House last week that the national co-ordinating committee was meeting as a result of the flooding in Cork and elsewhere.  I wish to speak on the plight of farmers and the tourism industry as result of the inclement weather.  What action will be taken to compensate or to do something to help alleviate the desperate situation for agricultural contractors?  As the Taoiseach said earlier, it has been the wettest June since records began and this weather is continuing into July.  The implications are serious for the forthcoming harvest.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	375	This matter was raised by Deputy Martin on Leaders' Questions.  The weather has been atrocious and there have been significant losses for the farming community.  I have seen attempts to cut silage in fields all over the country but the heavy equipment has become bogged down.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	418	Last week, we placed a motion on the Order Paper to annul the legislation enacted two weeks ago which barred applicants from obtaining mortgage interest supplement.  The Chief Whip has said we must discuss the motion in Private Members' time.  However, we can only annul the legislation within the first 21 days, so are we to stand idly by while this is taken away from the applicants who need it most?  I do not believe it should be Private Members' business.  It is something we put before the Government and we have asked it to respond.  Can the Government not respond positively and allow us to debate this issue?  It means that those who cannot acquire it now must wait 12 months to do a deal with a bank in order to apply for it.  It is writing away the rights and assistance that were available to people for the past number of years and the tough times we are living through.  It is also cheaper than the rent supplement, which the Government states is available.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	423	On 6 July, the Federal Court of Appeal for the First Circuit in the US upheld the subpoena issued by the British Government relating to the Northern Ireland oral history project held in Boston College.  As a result, Boston College must give police the recordings by its researchers of oral history project discussions and talks with Dolours Price by next month, after an appeals court in the US rejected an effort to stop the release.  Boston College in Massachusetts is still trying to quash a broader order for other materials from its projects.  I understand that lawyers representing the journalists behind the Boston College interviews with former paramilitaries have requested an urgent and immediate hearing in Belfast in a bid to block testimony being handed over to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, and a hearing is expected this week in Belfast.Subpoenas were issued to Boston College at the request of the British Government under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty, MLAT, between the US and the UK.  The subpoenas are part of an investigation by the UK authorities into the 1972 abduction and death of Jean McConville, who disappeared and was murdered in the most appalling circumstances.A number of issues arise.  First, one could argue there has been a refusal to face up to the issues surrounding the conflict in Northern Ireland and a failure to be more honest with the families, particularly the families of those who disappeared, such as the family of Mrs. Jean McConville.  The issue that has arisen in this context concerns the oral history project and the clear decision of the courts in the United States that academic confidentiality does not trump criminal investigations.  This is an important decision and I can understand it.Bearing in mind the history of Northern Ireland, one must acknowledge that while there are those who, last week, welcomed the decision to have a criminal investigation into activities of soldiers regarding the murders that took place on Bloody Sunday in Derry many years ago, there are also those who will want to see every effort made to investigate fully the abduction and murder of Mrs. Jean McConville.  That said, the authors of the history project now feel their lives are at risk because of the court's decision, which comprises a serious issue in its own right.  It is felt bringing closure and arriving at the truth will be jeopardised by the decision.The balance must come down on the side of pursuing the issue on behalf of the McConville family.  Various parties in the North have said we need a forum of reconciliation or a truth commission.  They have put forward various ideas, knowing in all honesty that they will never come to fruition.  We need an admission that, since 1974, nearly 1,700 people were killed or murdered by the Provisional IRA.  People should acknowledge that there was no need for any of this and that, within the Sunningdale Agreement, there was the genesis of a solution.  Twenty years later came the Downing Street Declaration and then the Good Friday Agreement.  Thousands of people lost their lives unnecessarily as a result of the delay.  It was a complete abomination for the people of this island.  This needs to be faced up to.This issue relates to evidence or material Ms Dolours Price gave and which the PSNI believes will be of assistance to it in pursuing the case.  I do not know whether this is the case as I do not have access to the material.  I have read Voices from the Grave containing the testimony of Mr. Brendan Hughes.  It was riveting and revealing in respect of what occurred in the early 1970s in Northern Ireland.  It referred to the various divisions within the Provisional movement.  If there had been more up-front honesty from the Provisionals-Sinn Féin movement and the truth had been told much earlier in regard to the disappeared, in particular, we might not now be at this juncture.  I am anxious to ascertain the Government’s position on this.  I ask the Sinn Féin leaders or those whom they may know within the defunct Provisional IRA movement to co-operate with the PSNI in the investigation in order to enable closure for the families concerned.Will the Minister of State outline what he believes to be the implications of the judgment for the papers handed over to Boston College in regard to the decommissioning body of Mr. John de Chastelain?  Has the Government any cause to review the decision to send the papers of the body to the US State Department and Boston College?
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I have been asked by the Tánaiste to deal with the issue of the Boston College archive, as raised by Deputy Martin.Let me set out the background to the case.  In March 2011, the British Government, acting on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, PSNI, initiated proceedings with the US Department of Justice under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty between the two countries.  These legal proceedings led to a subpoenaing of a collection of archived interviews being held in Boston College.  The archives are part of the Belfast Project , involving an oral history of republican and loyalist paramilitaries deposited in the Burns Library at the college.The initial subpoena related to the interviews of Ms Dolours Price and Mr. Brendan Hughes, two former members of the Provisional IRA.  A second subpoena was issued seeking "any and all interviews containing information about the abduction and death of Ms Jean McConville", one of the disappeared victims of the Provisional IRA.Two legal challenges were launched by Boston College and separately by Mr. Mclntyre and Mr. Moloney to quash the subpoenas.  Mr. Mclntyre and Mr. Moloney argued that the British Government had made a "solemn promise" that it would not "reopen issues addressed in the Belfast Agreement, or impede any further efforts to resolve the conflict in Northern Ireland".  In December 2011, these challenges were dismissed by US District Court judge William Young.  Following this review, the judge's order that all relevant materials be handed over to the British Government was delayed following further legal efforts by Mr. Mclntyre and Mr. Moloney.  Last Friday, 6 July, the US Federal Court of Appeals for the First Circuit turned down their appeal.  As matters stand, this means the archived material must be handed over by Boston College to the US authorities for onward transmission to their British counterparts.  However, Mr. Moloney and Mr. Mclntyre are considering a motion for a re-hearing of the case.  They also continue to keep their legal options open in the Belfast courts.Last February, the Tánaiste told the House in reply to a parliamentary question that as the issue of the archive was currently the subject of ongoing legal proceedings before the courts in the United States, it would be inappropriate for the Government to comment on the matter at that time.On 23 January 2012, Senator John Kerry, chairman of the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations wrote to Secretary of State Clinton to warn of the danger that the subpoena might "upset the delicate balance that has kept the peace" in Northern Ireland and asked that she "work with the British authorities to reconsider the path they have chosen and revoke their request".  Other prominent Irish Americans have agreed with Senator Kerry's assessment.The Deputy will appreciate that a number of factors inform the Government's views on this matter.  The issue is subject to a mutual legal assistance treaty between the US and British Governments.  As Senator Kerry and others have said, the issue undoubtedly has the potential to make an impact on the peace process.  However, in the Government's view, the peace process is sufficiently firmly bedded down to enable it to withstand whatever pressures may emerge from time to time.  The issue also has a bearing on how we deal with the past generally.  We know the pain and hurt of victims, including that of the McConville family, never cease.  We need to find sensitive ways of dealing with the past that meet the needs of victims and the bereaved.Clearly, the case is a matter that the courts in the United States have spoken on and may do so again, as may the courts in Northern Ireland.  Officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, in addition to those of the Department of Justice and Equality, will continue to monitor closely any further developments.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I accept the Minister of State's statement that the Government's view is that the peace process is sufficiently firmly bedded down to enable it to withstand whatever pressures are brought to bear upon it.  Increasingly, however, the needs of victims and the bereaved are surfacing, on all sides.  Issues are surfacing through the historical inquiries team, with some very limited success in some cases and with some degree of closure in others.  Up-front honesty has been singularly lacking from all concerned regarding the disappeared of the McConville family.  There is a very clear case for this issue to be addressed.Will the Minister of State indicate whether he or the Minister for Justice and Equality intends to meet Mr. McIntyre and Mr. Moloney to discuss their circumstances, bearing in mind the fears they have expressed?  To be fair to them, they embarked on the project in a genuine way.  One might say they believed, perhaps naïvely, in the legal guarantees they received.  I accept, on balance, the need to have this issue pursued to secure justice for the McConville family.  Perhaps it might be short-circuited if people could indicate what occurred and how it happened so that the McConville family could be given closure.  It was a disgraceful and unacceptable action that bore no relation to any degree of civility by any definition or yardstick.  It is a stain on the country and the provisional movement in particular.The Minister of State mentioned that the Government knew that victims' pain and hurt never ceased and that sensitive ways of dealing with the issue needed to be found.  Those ways have eluded us because all parties to the situation, some more than others, proposed solutions that they knew would not travel on the other side, allowing them the facade of being interested in an international oversight body when they knew full well that it would never come about.Despite the best efforts of the Eames-Bradley process, people could not be pulled together in this regard.  As part of the agenda, there is a desire to bring closure to the many families who suffered unspeakable losses as a result of the murder and mayhem of the years in question.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	426	The needs of the victims, including in the tragic Jean McConville case, are the Government's priority consideration.  The Government has been seeking all mechanisms to provide reconciliation and effect closure.  The Minister for Justice and Equality and the Tánaiste will continue to monitor the proceedings in question.  There may be a rehearing of the case, which is the option being retained by Mr. Moloney and Mr. McIntyre.  They also retain the option of going to the courts in Belfast.I did not answer the Deputy's question on decommissioning.  This matter has been addressed under the Vienna convention.  None of the material that is also deposited in the Boston College can be accessed until 2041.  It is out of the hands of the British Government and the Irish authorities.  The material can only be accessed on the request of either of those authorities.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Late on the night of Sunday, 5 November 2000 and early the next morning is a time that I will not forget for the rest of my life.  I was with residents in estates in Lucan in my constituency and I remember the looks of horror on their faces as they tried to save their homes, many of which were flooded by several feet of water.  Twelve years have passed, €5 million has been invested and no further floodings have affected the area despite similar devastation in other cities, towns and homes throughout the country.  Despite this, many insurance companies still deny insurance cover to the residents of the estates in question.  This is wrong, given the investment and everything that has occurred since 2000.  Will the Minister of State ask the Irish Insurance Federation, IIF, to tell its members not to discriminate against these residents?  They should not be denied flood cover in 2012.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I have raised this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, previously and he has engaged with the IIF, but not enough is being done.  Last night, I met residents in the Artane area who were still suffering the consequences of floods in 2008 and 2009 and on 24 October 2011.  If one cannot get house insurance, one's home is effectively worthless, as no incoming buyer can get a mortgage without house insurance.This situation is out of the control of residents.  Many of the areas were not affected in the 2002 Dublin floods and whatever has since occurred is probably a question for the local authority, but the residents are unable to get flood insurance for their homes.  Will the Minister of State ask the IIF to engage more readily with local authorities in finding solutions to the flooding problems that clearly still exist?  This is not just a local constituency issue, given the fact that the situation in Cork is on many people's minds as well.  The problem affects other constituencies.  The city council does not seem to be undertaking a process to reach a solution in respect of the River Naniken in Artane.  Will the Minister of State update us on the councils' negotiations with the IIF?  Residents need house insurance if their homes are not to be made worthless by a situation that is beyond their control.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I thank the Deputies for raising an important issue.  I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who is unable to attend.  At the outset, I express my sympathy to anybody whose home or business was flooded in recent weeks.  It is a difficult time for such people and the House will be aware that the Department of Social Protection is providing individuals with emergency payments to offset immediate needs, for example, assistance with the purchase of food, clothing, fuel and household goods.  A number of community welfare service clinics operating in the Cork area have extended their opening hours, providing an additional emergency service.  This has been supplemented by facilitating clients by appointments and making house calls to those in affected areas.Regarding the substantive issue of the provision of new flood cover or the renewal of existing flood cover, it should be noted that this is a commercial matter for insurance companies and must be based on a proper assessment of the risks that they are accepting.  These are often considered on a case-by-case basis and it is important to be clear that neither the Government nor the Central Bank has any influence in this regard.  The Central Bank's consumer protection code contains no provisions that compel an insurance company to accept a particular insurance risk.The IIF has advised me that flood insurance cover is available to approximately 98% of householders.  The IIF has indicated that, when making an underwriting decision, an insurer reviews a property's claims history and any flood protection measure implemented by the Office of Public Works or local authority.  As a result, some people will pay a higher premium because the flood risk is higher or will have a higher flood excess on their policies.  According to the IIF, insurers try to provide flood cover wherever possible.  However, it makes the point that flood insurance is sometimes not economically viable and, in the interests of keeping premiums affordable for policyholders in general, insurers decline flood cover for new business for some risks or in certain cases need to withdraw flood cover at renewal.Due to the difficulties currently being experienced by householders in certain areas in accessing flood insurance, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and his officials in the OPW have had a number of meetings with the IIF.  These discussions have allowed a sharing of information and better understanding about the scope and scale of the work undertaken by the OPW on its flood risk management programme and, in particular, on the mapping of areas subject to flood risk nationally, which will emerge from the OPW's catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme.  This work is being undertaken on the OPW's behalf by specialist consultants and is organised into six regional or catchment areas.  These comprehensive studies will recommend an integrated management plan and prioritised measures to address flood problems in areas where there is significant risk.  As the Deputies will be aware, a programme of flood relief work is also ongoing around the country.Part of the discussions have focused on how the insurance industry could best address the issue of the provision of flood insurance where incidences of difficulties in obtaining flood insurance are being raised.  The industry maintains that the incidence rate represents a small element of its business and that, where difficulties arise, the causes are complex, with each case being assessed in light of the particular circumstances applying.  The OPW and the IIF are keen to establish an ongoing means of sharing information on areas vulnerable to flooding, on identifying flood defence works carried out or funded by the OPW and on the impact of those works in reducing the risk of flooding in areas where flooding previously occurred.Work is continuing on this matter and a number of issues remain to be clarified with a view to agreeing with the Irish Insurance Federation a viable basis on which information can be provided.  There are complex technical issues involved concerning the design standards and risk levels of defence works and maintenance arrangements.
#DerekKeating	unknown-#DerekKeating-party	unknown-#DerekKeating-dob	unknown-#DerekKeating-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	430	I thank the Minister of State for the quite comprehensive reply, although he will not be too surprised to hear that I am not happy with the Irish Insurance Federation's indication that when making underwriting decisions, it considers the claims history of property and flood protection measures implemented by the Office of Public Works and the local authorities.  In my own constituency, approximately €5 million was invested and the success of those works has been shown over the past 12 years when many other cities, towns, villages and homes throughout the country have been devastated.  Nevertheless, there are people in estates whose homes were flooded once 12 years ago - the homes were built on flood plains - but investment was made and the works have been successful, and these people are still being denied flood cover.Will the Minister of State relay my concerns to the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes?  Will he pay me the courtesy of a visit so I can show him the works that have been done?  I still need to revert to the IIF and demonstrate my unhappiness with that element of the reply.
#AodhanORiordan	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-party	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-dob	unknown-#AodhanORiordan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	431	The indication is that the IIF, while making underwriting decisions on insurance, considers the claims history of the property and any flood protection measures implemented by the Office of Public Works, OPW, and local authorities.  Clanmoyle Road in Donnycarney is an example in my constituency and I am quite sure it is replicated nationwide.  Extensive works have been done by the city council but the position has not changed for those householders.  The council has indicated to me that a hydraulic analysis of the River Naniken is required but there is no funding to do it.  What happens then?  Works are required but there are no funds, although applications have been made to the OPW with little success.  What is the householder to do when there is a need identified by the city council but works have not been carried out and people are left with no home insurance?I ask the Minister of State to engage again with the insurance federation, the local authorities and the Office of Public Works to ensure that any identified needs necessary to expedite this problem can be carried out.  When a process is place, the works can be presented to the Irish Insurance Federation.  This cannot carry on and residents in my constituency and throughout the country should not be looking at dark clouds and wondering if the problem will happen again.  That is the exactly what is happening in my constituency and I am sure it is the same in other Deputies' areas.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	432	The OPW has informed me that the flood alleviation works on the River Griffeen in Lucan were carried out by South Dublin County Council and completed in 2006.  The initial phase of the works was funded by the council and the final phase was funded by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The council has indicated that the works were completed satisfactorily and it is unaware of any continuing flooding issue in Lucan since the works were completed.  I am happy to relay the Deputy's request to meet the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Brian Hayes, and I am certain he will visit the site and speak directly to Deputy Keating.  I have asked the OPW to follow up with South Dublin County Council and the insurance industry as part of ongoing discussions.  A meeting with representatives of the IIF involving everybody might be a good way to follow up.The previous Administration examined the introduction of a scheme to protect householders who cannot obtain household insurance from regular insurance bodies due to flooding risk.  This approach was not considered financially viable as it was believed that over time it would incentivise the industry to discontinue the provision of cover in medium and high risk areas, thus making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive.  In the current economic circumstances there are no proposals for a State indemnification scheme.The OPW allocation for flood risk management for 2012 is €45 million, with a further €17 million provided for maintenance of completed arterial drainage schemes.  The EU floods directive requires that the catchment flood risk assessment and management study, CFRAMS, be completed by the end of December 2015.  I will bring the concerns of both Deputies to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Hayes, and I ask them to sit down with representatives of the OPW and arrange for the Minister of State to visit the affected sites.
#PaulConnaughtonJnr	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughtonJnr-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	433	I thank the Ceann Comhairle and his staff for the opportunity to raise this very important issue.  Last week, it was announced that the European Investment Bank, EIB, is to provide a €100 million loan to support the Department of Education and Skills capital investment programme.  This programme, worth €1.5 billion, will see a number of major school building projects commence between now and 2016.  It is anticipated that the €100 million loan being provided by the EIB will be used in the construction and upgrading of 35 primary and 12 second level schools around the country.I will address the issue of the Holy Rosary College in Mountbellew, County Galway, and restate the need for this grossly overcrowded secondary school to be given the go-ahead for a new school building.  It is 12 years since the project got under way and staff, students and parents connected to the school have been understandably frustrated by the significant delay in bringing this project to fruition.  News that the school is not on the five-year programme has frustrated school authorities even further, given the current state of the school in terms of student numbers.Holy Rosary College in Mountbellew was established almost half a century ago and the current school building is designed to cater for 350 students; the school currently caters for 550 students, leading to significant logistical problems for staff.  Recent school building programmes were decided on the basis of projected population growth but this growth has already happened in Mountbellew and a new school building programme is urgently required.  The Department has previously recognised this population growth in the local area, with the local national school - St. Mary's national school - recently extended and expected to cater for increased pupil numbers in the coming years.  Crèche and Montessori facilities within the town now have waiting lists, proving that the number of young people using schools in Mountbellew is increasing, and hence the need for a new school building.The significant overcrowding in Holy Rosary College in Mountbellew has had significant repercussions for the students attending the school.  It currently has no proper gym, which is completely unacceptable for any secondary school, and especially at a time when young people are being encouraged to increase activity levels and the Government is introducing a variety of programmes aimed at tackling childhood obesity.  Boosting the capacity of Irish students in the sciences is another goal of the Government and students at Holy Rosary College in Mountbellew do not have the science labs required for studying science in the 21st century.  That also must be addressed as a priority.I accept there are major budgetary concerns across all Departments but the students and staff at Holy Rosary College deserve a new school building.  With that in mind, I ask the Minister that in the event of any delay being experienced with other projects in the five-year programme, Holy Rosary College would be considered the first substitute on the list.  I also ask that if additional funding comes to the Department, it should be used for school building in the coming years.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it allows me to clarify the current position of the proposed building project for Holy Rosary College, Mountbellew, County Galway, in the context of the Government's strategy for capital investment in school building projects over the next five years.  To ensure every child has access to a school place, the delivery of projects to meet future demographic demands nationally will be the main focus for capital investment in schools over the coming years.  The five-year construction programme outlines when 275 selected major projects will progress to construction over the next five years as part of a €2 billion capital investment programme.  Those projects will account for most of the capital funding available from now until 2016.Total enrolment is expected to grow by around 70,000 students between now and 2018, which is just six years away.  This will involve an increase of over 45,000 pupils at primary level and 25,000 students at post-primary level.  Holy Rosary College Mountbellew is in the Castleblakeney and Mountbellew post-primary feeder area.  There are also two other post-primary schools in the feeder area, namely St. Cuan's College, Castleblakeney, and Coláiste an Chreagáin, Mountbellew.At post-primary level, the total enrolments for the area have been relatively stable over the past decade.  The enrolments for 2011 and 2012 stood at 834 pupils across the three schools.  Based on the current intake pattern for the schools, the Department has projected that enrolments will remain stable with a predicted total enrolment figure of 816 by 2023.The proposed building project at Holy Rosary College is to provide accommodation for a long-term projected enrolment of 550 pupils.  Enrolment in the school in September 2011 was at 547 pupils.  The brief includes the provision of a PE hall, a language lab, a computer room, a music and drama area, a religion room and other ancillary accommodation.  Some refurbishment of the existing school building also forms part of the brief.  The building project has completed the design stages of architectural planning and remains available to be considered for progression to tender and construction should additional funding become available to the Department in future years.The stage 2(b) submission, which includes full detailed design and tender documents, was approved by my Department on 30 November 2011.  However, due to the competing demands on the Department's capital budget imposed by the need to prioritise the limited funding available for the provision of additional school accommodation to meet increasing demographic requirements, it was not possible to include the project for Holy Rosary College in the five year construction programme announced in March.All school building projects which have not been included in the five year construction programme, but which were previously announced for inclusion in the building programme, will continue to be progressed to final planning stages in anticipation of the possibility of further funds being available to the Department in future years.  The project for Holy Rosary College remains available to be considered for progression in this context.  However, it is not possible at this time to progress the project to tender and construction stage.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter with me.

However, I reiterate that the school is built to cater for only 350 students and now caters for 550 students.  It is the school I and all my family attended and I am very grateful for the education I received there.  Since then the numbers have increased.  When the project initially began 12 years ago I was completing my leaving certificate; this is how long ago it began.  At that stage the Department told the school it should seek a new school building due to the increase in numbers then.  I recognise the fact that the numbers are stable at present.  However, the growth has already occurred in Mountbellew and this needs to be recognised.If another school is unable to fulfil its promise to build a school in the next five years would Holy Rosary College be considered at the top of the list?  If any funding becomes available to the Department in the coming years, the parents, students and people of Mountbellew and surrounding areas would like to ensure it would mean Holy Rosary College would be at the top of the list.  I extended an invitation to the Minister at any opportunity he has to visit the school to see the cramped conditions.  I would be very grateful for any support the Department can give the school in the coming years.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	436	Recent birth rate data published by the CSO shows almost 20,000 births were registered in the first quarter of 2011.  This is the highest number of births registered in a quarter since the series began in 1960.  It is vital the schooling system is prepared to cope with these increasing numbers.  Therefore, the Government's priority over the next five years will have to be focused on major school projects to meet these increasing demographic demands.  As such enrolment increases are not uniformly distributed nationally, the Department has carried out a study of the country using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Registry Office and the Department of Social Protection in addition to recent schools enrolment data to identify areas in which there will be sufficient future enrolment increases.  The information used is the most accurate and up-to-date available.The five year programme is primarily focused on meeting increasing demographic needs.  In this context it has not been possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently.  However, it is my intention that all school building projects, including in particular the project for Holy Rosary College, will continue to be advanced incrementally over time in the context of the funding available.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget it is not possible at this time.  If additional funds become available, and the increase in demand to which Deputy Connaughton referred in his comments can be sustained and demonstrated, I will certainly examine ensuring that Holy Rosary College moves into a space that would be created if another school project does not go ahead.

As the Minister of State may know, a very serious campaign was run a number of years ago when there was a threat to the stations at Malin Head and Valentia.  The community across the north west including the fishing community and all of the public representatives in the region on a cross-Border basis argued the case for Malin Head and its 100 year history of service to be sustained.Yet another report has been published, this one from Fisher Associates, recommending the closure of Malin Head.  The public representatives in Donegal and the north west will ask for this recommendation to be rejected immediately.  There is no logic to it in terms of savings.  At present a major investment is under way at Malin Head which will be completed and open soon.  Malin Head, Valentia and Dublin have the capacity to deliver all that is required.  In real terms, the recommendations of the report would probably mean saving one job or two at most.  A statement needs to be made urgently reassuring people in the north west our long campaign to save Malin Head does not need to be reopened.  The Minister of State should be very clear that the people of the north west will fight like tigers to defend Malin Head.  The fishing community and all of the representatives in the region will not accept any suggestion that the centre be closed.  We have been neglected enough and there is no way we will accept any such suggestion without one hell of a fight.

A battle was fought in recent years in which it was made clear to the Government that Malin Head Coast Guard station, with a reputation of saving lives and making safe the waters around the country, is crucial infrastructure and a crucial service.  In 2008, when the campaign concluded it was made clear the three stations, namely, Malin Head, Valentia and Dublin, would continue.  Unfortunately, the Fisher report published last Friday indicates we should move to a two centre model and preferred Valentia.  If it is the intention of the Government to safeguard the future of Malin Head Coast Guard station, it is important that it builds on the investment being made in the station at present and gives strong assurance today that will bring certainty to the future of the station and allay the concerns people have following the publication of the report.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I thank both Deputies for their question.  I will take this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Varadkar.As part of the Croke Park agreement, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport engaged a specialist international maritime transport management consultancy, Fisher Associates, to undertake value for money reviews of services provided by the Irish Coast Guard and the Marine Survey Office.  These reports were published by the Department on Thursday last, 5 July 2012.The Irish Coast Guard and the Marine Survey Office are internal divisions of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and are not separate statutory agencies.  Taken together the reports call for a comprehensive integrated programme of work to enhance maritime safety and emergency response services.  Among the issues identified by Fisher Associates that need to be addressed on a priority basis is the need for Ireland's capacity to prepare for and respond to major oil pollution incidents to be enhanced.More support is needed for the volunteers in our coastal rescue units, particularly in the areas of improved training courses, oversight and supervision, day-to-day management, and risk and quality control.  Significant backlogs in transposing legislative provisions into Irish law need to be addressed and additional inspection obligations also need to be addressed.  Improved administrative and IT systems are needed to support delivery of services and the development of management and accountability systems across the maritime safety services.  The report by Fisher Associates also concluded that such systems would contribute to alleviating staff shortages and recommended that realistic fees should be charged for the services provided by the MSO.  There is a need for improved risk management and for periodic reviews and auditing of operational arrangements.  The reports also call for improved communications both internally and with stakeholders and other partners for enhanced service delivery.The Minister has informed the Government that the issues raised in the reports will be examined by the Department and that he proposes to present an action plan to Government in October, addressing the deficiencies identified.  The issues that have been identified in the reports for action are serious and must be addressed, particularly those relating to oil pollution response capacity and volunteer training and management.  However, the Minister has made it clear that he does not propose to accept or reject any of the recommendations proposed by the Fisher reports at this stage.  Furthermore, no decisions have been taken at this time on these matters.In preparing the action plan, the Department will assess each recommendation and will prioritise actions to address the deficiencies.  That process will call for tough decisions to be made.  However, it is important to recognise that resources available to the maritime services are very limited and must be deployed on a prioritised basis and as effectively and efficiently as possible to address the most urgent needs.  Having robust and efficient maritime safety regulatory arrangements and emergency response services in place will be crucial also for the development of shipping, trade and employment, which have a key role to play in Ireland's economic recovery.I want to take this opportunity to inform the House that new communications systems are currently being installed in the Malin Head centre, which has been closed since May, as part of a general upgrading of communications systems infrastructure nationally and in the three coast guard centres.  It is expected that the upgrade work will be completed next month and the Malin centre will reopen at that time.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I thank the Minister of State for his response.  In 2003 another serious consultancy, Deloitte & Touche, published a report which recommended that Malin Head and Valentia remain open and Dublin be closed.  However, what has happened is that the Dublin centre has been sustained and upgraded, while we had to fight like tigers for Malin Head and Valentia.  We will do the same again.I welcome the recent substantial investment in Malin Head and welcome the fact the centre will reopen soon.  However, I want an assurance from the Government today, or as soon as possible, that Malin Head will not be closed, as recommended here.  That recommendation is causing great alarm across the north west.  It is not just about having the telecommunications infrastructure, but about having local knowledge and an understanding of the culture, geography, locations and names that occur.  Operators in Malin Head would understand these.  The station in Malin Head is of huge importance for our region.  We fought for it before and thought the issue had been put to bed forever.We thought the investment in Malin Head was a clear signal that everything there would remain, but now we have this report.  We need an assurance, as soon as possible, that the Government will not accept the recommendation to close Malin Head and will not deal another blow to the north west.  We have never needed this station more and need a vote of confidence from the Government.  We have had setbacks in the north west.  For example, the Derry to Dublin air link was not supported by the Government and it has pulled back from the A5 project.  Thankfully, however, the Northern Executive has honoured the A5 project and it will go ahead.  We need no further setbacks from the Government.  It has the opportunity now to do the right thing and to make it clear that Malin Head coast guard station will remain.

This is important to ensure the future of the station and was taken as a strong indication the station's future was secure.  It is important this investment is happening because we can build on that and ensure the station is up to speed and is developed with modern technology that will ensure it can continue to carry out the job it has done so well over the years.A part of the Minister of State's response will cause great concern for people in the north Donegal area and those involved in maritime issues across the north west.  That concern relates to the statement that the process currently being considered "will call for tough decisions to be made".  That indicates there may be a question over the continuation of Malin Head Coast guard station.  Currently, the station works very well and performs an important function.  We had a strong fight for its continuance four years ago and we believed then it was safe.  A strong fight will take place again if necessary.  I will work with all my colleagues and with Deputy Mac Lochlainn on this, as will other politicians in the area, to ensure the importance of this station is emphasised to the Minister of State.I see no rationale in the report for anything other than continuing the operation of the Malin Head station.  I ask the Minister of State again to give an assurance that there is no question mark over it and that the performance and job carried out by the station is valued and will continue to be valued and to provide the service it has provided so well for many years from Malin Head.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I thank the Deputies for their comments.  Although they did not mention them, I take it that they accept the many other recommendations made in the report with regard to training and upgrading of volunteers, which are necessary.  I take it they also accept the recommendations regarding risk reviews and the need for a programme of work in the area of pollution control and measures to be taken where there is potential for serious incidents.Significant investment has been made in the Malin Head station and the OPW has signed contractual commitments to the value of €63,000 for renovation of the building.  This will see the centre rewired, new flooring installed and a general clean-up.  The Department has also spent €40,000 on communications architecture and associated works in recent times.  All of this work will be completed in August.I wish to make it clear that none of the recommendations, in particular the one raised by the Deputies, has been either accepted or rejected by the Department.  Sometimes people think decisions are already made, but there is no predefined decision in this regard.  Decisions will be made on the recommendations over the next number of months, with a view to completion by October.

The setting up of the convention is an important and exciting step in a process to better equip our Constitution to meet the challenges of the 21st century.From the outset, it has been the Government's intention that the convention should be founded on a number of principles.  It should be innovative, independent, and influential.  The establishment of the convention represents an innovative approach to examining constitutional reform, one that has never been tried before in this country.  It is true that there have previously been committees to examine constitutional reform, both generally and on specific matters, but this convention will be radically different.  In addition to elected representatives, the constitutional convention will comprise ordinary citizens, who will be considerably in the majority.  This important innovation will ensure that, for the first time in this State, both the legislators who bring forward proposals for constitutional reform and the citizens who decide on the merits or otherwise of those proposals will jointly and publicly consider whether constitutional reform is necessary or desirable.The second principle underpinning the setting up of the convention is that it should be independent of Government.  Resolutions of both Houses of the Oireachtas will approve its establishment and it will report back directly to the Houses.The independence of the convention will be further demonstrated by the manner in which the citizen members will be selected.  They will be randomly selected, using the electoral register, to be representative of society generally.  A polling company will be engaged to select 66 people on the electoral register to be members of the convention on the basis that the persons selected are representative of the population generally in terms of gender, age, social class and region.  I strongly urge anyone who is contacted to take the opportunity to participate in this exciting and historic initiative.  As Deputies will be aware, legislation will be required to use the electoral register for this purpose and that legislation is being brought before the House by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The selection of the public members will be overseen by the chairperson of the convention.In the spirit of inclusiveness, the 33 elected representatives to the convention will include a parliamentarian from each of the parties represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly which accept an invitation from the Government to participate in the convention's work.  The invitations will issue once the Dáil and Seanad have passed the convention resolutions.The chairperson will also be independent and will be pivotal to the success of the convention.  In view of this crucial role, an exceptional person will be needed, combining very high levels of public acceptability, known fair-mindedness, effective chairmanship skills and knowledge of the Constitution and law.  The ability to arrive at workable solutions, while ensuring as far as possible that all participants get a fair hearing, will also be crucial.  In view of the importance of this position, I invited representatives of the Opposition parties to put forward possible names when I consulted them on the arrangements for the convention.  The Tánaiste and I expect to announce the chairperson shortly.The third principle underpinning the setting up of the constitutional convention is that it must be influential.  This can only be achieved if its recommendations are responded to in an appropriate and timely manner.  One of the main criticisms of previous attempts to initiate constitutional reform was that after much excellent work by, for example, various Oireachtas committees and the constitutional review group, their reports were not acted upon and, to use the well-worn phrase, they were left to gather dust on the shelf.  The Government recognises that unless the reports the convention produces are responded to quickly, the convention and, indeed, the very process on which we have embarked will be called into question.I wish to give a formal commitment to the House that the Government will give a public response, through the Oireachtas, to each recommendation from the convention within four months.  We will arrange for a debate in the Oireachtas on that response in each case and, in the event that the Government accepts a recommendation that the Constitution be amended, the Government's public response will include a timeframe for the holding of the referendum. This goes considerably further than any previous Government has gone and, I think, fully demonstrates the extent of our commitment to this new and innovative approach to constitutional reform.  Before making its response, the Government will, of course, fulfil the obligation that every Government has in considering proposals for constitutional reform - first, to consider the proposal itself carefully and, second, to ensure as far as possible that the aim of the proposal is achieved without this leading to unintended consequences.The topics which the convention will consider are set out in the resolution.  They include institutional matters, such as the review of the Dáil electoral system, as well as important social issues, such as the greater participation of women in public life, and same-sex marriage.  There has been some criticism that the work programme for the convention does not go far enough and that it should encompass even more comprehensive reform.  The Government remains of the view that the work programme outlined in the resolution is appropriate.  The issues that will be before the convention are not light matters.  In this context, it should also be borne in mind that the establishment of the convention will complement the Government's overall programme of constitutional reform, some of which has already been put to the people in referendums.  As Deputies will be aware, proposals for further referendums are being prepared on an important social issue, children's rights, and on a key political and institutional change, the abolition of the Seanad.I have no doubt that the full programme of constitutional reform which will be put to the people over the lifetime of this Government will be the most comprehensive in many years.  However, to show that the Government is prepared to consider calls for an even more comprehensive work programme for the convention, we are prepared to consider whether other topics could be considered at a later date.  We will review this in the light of experience and the Tánaiste and I will consult with Opposition representatives and the chairperson of the convention at the appropriate time.The inclusion of additional topics could, of course, have implications for the timeframe within which the convention must complete its work.  Indeed, concerns have already been expressed that the convention will have insufficient time to complete the work programme outlined in the resolution before the House.  The Government is of the view that the timeframe proposed in the resolution is appropriate for the convention's proposed work programme.  However, we are prepared to review the timeframe in the light of experience and, indeed, any future changes to the convention's work programme and we will undertake this review in consultation with representatives of the Opposition parties.The Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement are fundamental to the changed relationships on the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain.  It is wholly appropriate, therefore, that elected representatives of the different traditions in Northern Ireland should be enabled to participate in the work of the convention which will, as the resolution states, have appropriate regard to the principles enshrined in the Good Friday and St. Andrews Agreements.The Government is conscious of the views expressed that interest groups or specific sections of society should be represented at the convention.  Vulnerable, disadvantaged or marginalised groups, children, people from Northern Ireland, especially Northern Unionists, the diaspora and Ireland's newest citizens are some of the groups mentioned.  The Government is firmly of the view that the convention should be composed of ordinary citizens and elected representatives.  It is simply not practical to accommodate in a fair and representative manner all of the groups or sections of society that have been proposed.  However, it is anticipated that interest groups and non-governmental organisations will be able to interact with the convention, including by making submissions.  Indeed, we would expect that the chairperson and other members of the convention will be anxious to hear from a representative spectrum of opinion in carrying out their work.  The Government also hopes that there will be active engagement with the diaspora.  The constitutional convention will be a transparent and an interactive forum.  It is important that ordinary citizens can not only contribute to the work of the convention but can also see how their contribution fits into its overall deliberations.The success of the convention will depend to a large extent on the level of engagement with the general public and I would like to take this opportunity to encourage citizens to contribute to the debate.  I have no doubt the convention itself will be anxious to hear from all strands of opinion at home and abroad.  To facilitate as wide an engagement as possible, it is expected that much of the convention's work will be done via a new website which I understand will be launched shortly.  It is also planned to put the convention's working papers and various submissions on this website and it is intended that plenary meetings of the convention will be webcast live.It will be important that the convention has an appropriate range of supports to assist it in its work.  The Government has put arrangements in train to provide a secretariat from within existing resources.  While the secretariat will be relatively small, the issue of whether young unemployed people could be given an opportunity to work on the convention, for example, through the JobBridge programme, will be considered.The wide-ranging nature of the topics to be considered by the convention is likely to require a significant amount of work for the members.  An expert advisory group will assist the convention in its endeavours and will provide specialist guidance on the variety of issues to be examined.  This support from leading academics, political scientists and constitutional lawyers will be an important factor in the success of the convention and I very much look forward to their contribution.The changes experienced and challenges encountered by Irish society over recent years require an appropriate response.  The putting in place of this innovative and exciting process for considering constitutional reform, one which directly involves our citizens, is a key part of the Government's response.  On my behalf and that of the Tánaiste, I commend this resolution to the House.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	444	One of the central messages conveyed by the people to every Member of this House last year was that they want a change in the way that politics is done in this country.  They want us to focus on getting Ireland through to recovery, but they also demand that we implement wide-ranging and credible reform.  This is a very clear challenge to us all and, in particular, to a Government which has an unprecedented majority.  Success is easily defined, to identify and implement reforms which directly address the failings in our parliamentary, governmental and legal systems.  The public were not asking for an abstract discussion, but a hard focus on measures to radically improve how public life works in Ireland.Both Government parties were elected on clear platforms promising radical reform.  They published extensive promises for specific reforms and a process of wider reform.  They gave themselves no more than 12 months to refer the bulk of reforms to the public by means of referendums.  Since then, the ambition has shrunk and the timetable has been formally abandoned.The constitutional convention which will be adopted today is, in nearly all respects, the forum that emerged during negotiations between Fine Gael and the Labour Party to form the Government.  It carries the title from the Labour Party manifesto, the membership from Fine Gael's and a narrower agenda than either promised.  Discussions were held with the Opposition but only very minor changes have been made to the proposal.This motion was first promised as being imminent last March by the Taoiseach.  He assured us of the urgency with which it was being considered.  There has been no attempt whatsoever to start the process with a serious discussion of what the reform agenda should be focused on.At this moment of continued economic crisis and with lost public faith in the role of politics, proposing to give priority to discussing the President's term of office and the voting age is worse than ridiculous.  If the convention sticks to the core agenda insisted on by Government, it will not be able to deliver on the promise of real political reform.The Government is proposing to try to avoid any serious discussion of its role and powers.  What it appears to want from the convention is to be able to claim to be considering fundamental reform rather than actually doing anything about it.It is now the well defined character of the Government that it hypes everything and makes claims about reform which do not stand up to even basic scrutiny.  In the last year and a half Ministers have delivered hours of speeches about how they have reformed the Dáil, praising their own dedication and commitment in the process.  In reality, the Dáil has gone backwards, with committees directly overseeing Departments more in the control of Government than ever, the Taoiseach undermining Question Time and the Government less likely than ever to engage with Opposition amendments.  There has been no real reform, and if the Government's approach to this convention is continued there will be no reform.Fianna Fáil supports the formation of a body such as this to discuss reform.  We also proposed a citizens' assembly in our manifesto.  However, we also endorsed giving it the ability to set its own priorities and directly take up the functioning of both the Oireachtas and the Government.  The citizens' assembly is a good but not yet fully proven idea, so we also gave a clear commitment that the Oireachtas would be actively engaged in the discussion of reform on a cross-party basis.  We support the establishment of the convention not because we agree with the Government's priorities, but because, once established, we will seek to get the support of its members to radically broaden the agenda.  We will push for real reform to be considered.The fact that the Government has no intention of letting the convention set a new pace for reform is shown clearly in the proposal that the Oireachtas will only get the opportunity to vote on its recommendations if the Government agrees.  As proposed today by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, there will be a radical new form of consultation with Irish society and then they will personally decide if the people will be allowed to vote on the proposals.  How is this the way to show commitment to reform?  The Government is, in effect, saying that it will be radical so long as it retains all of the powers and control it currently has.The first thing we should do when establishing a body to review aspects of the Constitution is to acknowledge the strengths of Bunreacht na hÉireann, something that was absent from the Taoiseach's address.  It is profoundly wrong to attack it in terms of its failure to reflect today's morality while ignoring when it was adopted.  De Valera's Constitution is a profoundly democratic and republican document.  At a time when much of the world was falling to extreme ideologies, it strengthened democracy and human rights here.  For example, no other nation in the world in the 1930s adopted by referendum explicit constitutional protections for the Jewish community.  It gave us a strengthened Judiciary which has used its independence to be a check on the power of the Executive far beyond the situation in other common law countries.  It has also been an evolving document in many areas, successfully being used as the basis for asserting many rights not considered in 1937.  Many of its biggest failings are not the failings of its drafters, but of the generations who have come since and have failed to update it.The proposal before the House today sets out a series of areas to be prioritised by the convention.  Given the tight timeframe, the appointment of the chairperson by Government and the reliance of the convention on Government resources, it is clearly not the Government's intention that its work will go far beyond these measures.The proposals relating to the electoral system and the participation of women in public life are the only ones that address any broad scale issues of political reform.  However, in both cases they address how the Oireachtas is formed, not what it actually does.  This again emerges from the Government parties' firm convictions that structural reforms are not required beyond the cosmetic.At the convention and subsequently, we will be supporting a reform of the electoral system to one which allows for a mixture of local and national concerns to predominate.  We will also be supporting changes in the Constitution which fully reflect the views of today rather than the 1930s on gender and public life.The Presidency is the one institution of our State that has retained and even grown in its public standing.  Each of our Heads of State has fulfilled the role of being a force for asserting shared values and rising above daily quarrels to understand what unites us.  The Presidency is in no way broken so why we should prioritise a change to the term of office or aligning it with unrelated elections is not clear.The extension of the franchise is a welcome idea which we also proposed last year.  On reducing the voting age, this appears to be another example of taking up an idea while ignoring more important and urgent concerns.  Surely the priority should be how we can get the third of people who have the franchise to use it before looking for ways to extend it?  Eighteen is by far the dominant voting age in democracies.  Austria recently reduced it.  Does this issue need to be discussed at a convention?  If the Oireachtas agreed on changing the age, it could be then put to the people.  The voting age for local elections could, in fact, be changed by legislation.  This matter does not need to be debated by the convention.  I would have no objection to reducing the voting age to 17.  Why not go ahead and put the issue to the people?The constitutional provision relating to blasphemy is not something that would be on anyone's list of the most urgent reform issues.  Fianna Fáil has held three regional meetings on the constitutional convention.  All party members were nonplussed by the proposal to remove the reference to blasphemy from the Constitution.  They wondered why the Government does not just go ahead and hold a referendum on the issue.  Other more weighty structural issues of political reform need to be dealt with.  The current blasphemy provision has not had the effect of inhibiting freedom of speech.  This is an area where the convention should not allow itself to be rushed by the Government's deadline.  Any change should be one which emerges from trying to build a consensus across our multi-denominational society.The issue of same-sex marriage has been referred to the convention for the sole reason that Fine Gael and Labour were unable to agree a position.  It is a disgraceful kick-to-touch, hoping to delay by years the moment when a decision should be taken.  I have said many times that I support marriage equality.  As a republican and as a believer in equality, I firmly believe that same-sex couples should be able to marry.  Many people sincerely disagree with this.  I respect that.  They are entitled to their view and should be allowed to be heard.  Whatever one's personal position on this issue, one thing is clear: the people have a right to decide this issue and to do so sooner rather than later.  Referring this issue to the convention implies that there is a possibility that there will be no referendum on same-sex marriage during the lifetime of the Government.The Government has a long list of referendums, such as abolishing the Seanad, which it says must happen no matter what.  Today, the Taoiseach told the House that we are now looking at the latter half of 2013 for the abolition of the Seanad.  Refusing to give the same commitment on the issue of same-sex marriage is completely unacceptable.Over the last year and a half the Taoiseach has repeatedly praised himself for being a tough man and a man of principle.  The sad reality is that he would rather scramble over flower pots and hide from journalists than answer a simple question on where he stands on what is a basic social question, what the Tánaiste described as the civil rights issue of a generation.  The idea that one cannot have an opinion if a matter is being discussed by the constitutional convention is nonsense.  As things are, there is a growing belief that the Taoiseach will wait until a moment when the Government is embroiled in a crisis and will then try to distract everybody by finally agreeing to hold a referendum on marriage equality.  I suggest that he cut out the delay, remove the issue from the convention and agree now to have the referendum on marriage equality which the people want.If the convention sticks to Government's agenda it will consider how people get elected but not what they should do afterwards and it will consider a series of social issues but will not touch on the Government's powers.  We will be seeking a more fundamental review which focuses in particular on how governments are formed and the relationship between Government and Oireachtas.  If we are to build a system which can be strategic rather than short-termist, the Government will have to give up its complete dominance of the parliamentary agenda and government has to be opened up beyond a narrow range of people.The Government will decide whether the Oireachtas gets to vote on what emerges from the convention.  It is clearly the Government's intention to treat the recommendations as little more than an advisory report.  If the convention is to offer any hope of working appropriately, its members must operate in the knowledge that their recommendations will be voted on.  It would be unacceptable for the Government to choose what is to be voted on and the form in which the vote will be taken.  If this is to be more than window dressing on a fast fading commitment to radical reform and consultation, then give us a commitment that the wider agenda will be supported rather than merely tolerated and that every recommendation will be voted on in exactly the form that the convention proposes.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	445	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"approves the calling of a Convention on the Constitution that should determine matters and recommendations regarding constitutional change as it sees fit and to report to the Houses of Oireachtas;proposes that matters for consideration by the Convention should include:(i) reducing the Presidential term of office to five years and aligning it with the local and European elections;(ii) reduction of the voting age;(iii) review of the Dáil electoral system;(iv) giving citizens resident outside the State the right to vote in Presidential elections and constitutional referenda;(v) provision for same-sex marriage;(vi) amending the clause on the role of women in the home and encouraging greater participation of women in public life;(vii) increasing the participation of women in politics;(viii) removal of the offence of blasphemy from the Constitution;(ix) the fundamental reform of Seanad Éireann; and(x) other relevant constitutional amendments that may be recommended by it;recognises:— that this Constitutional Convention must be fully inclusive in composition and use a participatory process, actively involving in particular:— the economically disadvantaged;— the socially marginalised;— Irish citizens from all provinces;— Unionists and their official representatives;— citizens in the diaspora; and— our newest citizens;— that the Convention's process must be fully public, transparent and accountable, from discussion of its terms of reference to its appointments, and from the debates to the conclusion of its recommendations;— that the Convention must have the mandate to consider the broadest possible scope of matters, including, in particular, the need for express guarantees of economic and social rights, the extension of voting rights for northern citizens and citizens in the diaspora, and the architecture necessary to establish a more robustly inclusive, fully representative and accountable democracy with mechanisms for direct participation;— that the new Constitution arising from this process must include maximum human rights guarantees; and— the new Constitution arising from this process should not only be exemplary but also durable, justifying the investment of resources, time and effort, as particularly in a time of austerity, this project must be cost-effective, representing value for money for the public; andnotes that:— membership of the Convention will consist of 100 persons as follows:— a Chairperson to be appointed by the Government;— 66 citizens selected so as to be broadly representative of Irish society;— a  member  of  the  Northern  Ireland  Assembly from each  of  the  political parties in the Assembly which accepts an invitation from the Government; and— members  of  the  Houses  of  the  Oireachtas,  so  as  to  be  impartially representative of the Houses;— substitutes may be appointed  subject  to the selection criteria  above, who will be entitled to contribute to the proceedings and vote in their own name;— the Convention will agree its own rules of procedure for the effective conduct of its business in as economical and timely a manner as possible;— the Convention will have appropriate regard to the Good Friday Agreement, the St. Andrews Agreement and all the modern equality and human rights protections that reflect  the  full  spectrum of  our  international  obligations  and  any others  that  are necessary to establish a rights-based society;— the  Convention  will  report  and  make  recommendations  to  the  Houses  of  the Oireachtas  on  matters  when  it  has  completed  its  deliberations  to  allow  for  a comprehensive referendum to take place in 2016;— the Convention may invite and accept submissions from interested bodies and will seek such expert advice as it considers desirable;— all matters before the Convention will be determined by a majority of the votes of members present and voting, other than the Chairperson who will have a casting vote in the case of an equality of votes; and— the Government will provide in the Oireachtas a response to the recommendations of the  Convention  within  four  months  and,  if  accepting  the  recommendations,  will legislate for any related referendum by 2016."Sinn Féin agrees with the section of Fine Gael's election manifesto which declares:In any Republic the people are supposed to be supreme.  Judged by that standard Ireland today is a Republic in name only.  The expressions "Golden Circle", "Crony Government" and "Crony Capitalism" all describe the same thing: The abduction of our Republic by both public and private sector vested interests, aided and abetted by Fianna Fail ... We want to build a new Republic in which the interest of the people and not those of the insiders are placed at the centre of politics in Ireland ... Modern Ireland cannot be governed by a system of government originally designed for 19th Century Britain. Ireland needs more than piecemeal reform.  It needs radical root and branch change.The Labour Party made similar promises.  That was the basis on which people voted for this Government.  They wanted fundamental change from the corrupt practices of the past.  Tá athraithe substaintiúla de dhíth ón phobal, athraithe atá ar mhaithe an phobail agus ní ar mhaithe an chiorcail órdha, athraithe a chuireann cearta na ndaoine chun cinn agus a bhféadfaí a gcur chun cinn i bpoblacht nua amach anseo san tir seo.  Citizens were angry and resentful of a democratic process that had been subverted by the golden circles and a political class that promoted its narrow interests and those of the bankers, speculators and developers.Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised a constitutional convention to safeguard rights and return the democratic process to the people.  The Taoiseach undertook to consult with Opposition parties and agreed to include the extension of the franchise in Presidential elections for citizens in the North as part of the convention's agenda.  A year and a half after the election we now have the Government's resolution on establishing the convention.  Sinn Féin believes it falls far short of the commitments made by the two parties in the general election campaign and that without significant amendment the convention will be a lost opportunity.  We hoped that the constitutional convention would see the emergence of a new constitutional arrangement to meet the needs of 21st century Ireland.  The economic crisis in this State, the revelations of corruption in certain political parties and the tribunal findings against leaders of Fianna Fáil, alongside the success of the peace process in the North, means that Ireland is in transition.  Citizens want change and this constitutional convention is an opportunity for the Government to build a truly national consensus for fundamental change and to transform the existing constitutional architecture to take account of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.A new constitutional design could reimagine Ireland for this new century and put in place a constitution which puts all the citizens of this nation and this island at its heart.  The new constitution should deliver on the promise of the 1916 Proclamation, which declares: "the right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies, to be sovereign and indefeasible" and that the Republic, as a sovereign independent State, guarantees "religious and civil liberty, equal rights and equal opportunities to all its citizens, and declares its resolve to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally".  That was the change for which people voted.  They wanted new politics, genuine reform and, in the republican language of the Fine Gael manifesto, core republican values.Instead, however, we have a proposal which limits the remit of the constitutional convention.  It fails to deliver a comprehensive transparent process and unless its remit is changed it will deliver minimal change.  Ba mhaith le Sinn Féin coinbhinsiún bunreachtúil atá i bhfad níos leithne, le próiseas atá oscailte agus trédhearcadh agus le cumhacht ag an phobal a chuid moltaí a gcur faoi bhráid an choinbhinsiúin.  Sinn Féin proposes a convention which we believe would be closer to the concerns of the people and would reflect a process that is genuinely open and transparent.  Our amendment proposes a convention that is fully inclusive in composition and uses a participatory process.  It would actively involve the economically disadvantaged and socially marginalised; citizens from all provinces including the Northern province of Ulster; Unionists and their official representatives; citizens in the diaspora; ethnic minorities such as the Traveller community and our newest citizens; political parties; civil society representatives, including the voluntary and community sector; and individuals with academic and legal expertise.  We would ensure that women are represented equally on the convention.Sinn Féin believes that the convention's process must be fully public, transparent and accountable, from the discussion of its terms of reference to appointments, and from the debates to the conclusion of its recommendations.  The convention must also have a mandate to consider the broadest possible scope of matters, including in particular the need for express guarantees of economic and social rights, the extension of voting rights for Northern citizens and citizens in the diaspora and the architecture required to establish a more robustly inclusive, fully representative and accountable democracy with mechanisms for direct participation.The Government has proposed that the convention must address a specified list of issues before moving on to other matters.  It is silent on what happens to the convention at the end of its lifetime if it has not addressed all the issues assigned to it.  The amendment of the Constitution on this issue-by-issue basis has the potential to make the process of making amendments and the work of the convention enormously difficult and confusing.  It is possible that a series of separate referendums and even amendments to amendments will be required depending on the timing of recommendations and the Government's considerations.  Sinn Féin believes that the convention should have the freedom and time to produce a comprehensive proposal.  It took the architects of Bunreacht na hÉireann two years to complete their work.  It should not be beyond our ability to produce a comprehensive set of proposals that would be completed and passed by 2016.  We could build a truly new constitution that is fit for purpose for the new Ireland of tomorrow.  Such a constitution would embrace our Unionist neighbours, guarantee economic and social rights for all citizens and maximise human rights guarantees, including all of the modern equality and human rights protections that reflect the full spectrum of our international obligations and any others that are necessary to establish a rights based society.The approach set out by the Government is minimalist, disjointed and piecemeal.  It fails the mandate given to the Government, fails the process of constitutional change and fails the people.  Tá seans anseo ag an Rialtas treo nua a ghlacadh, treo stairiúil a dhíríonn ar shaoránaigh an Stáit agus an oileáin seo.  This is an opportunity to be bold, progressive and imaginative on behalf of all our citizens.  If approached in the right way, the constitutional convention and its conclusions can inspire the people of this island, unite us in common purpose, build the nation, revive our hopes in the future and create greater national unity based on common interest, a common vision and common purpose.The Government can either tinker around the edges of constitutional change or chart a new course for the citizens of this island.  The omens are not good.  The Taoiseach should pick up his manifesto and read it again.  I read it this afternoon.

In the good times maybe that could have been afforded, but not in these dire economic times.  However, there is still an opportunity for fundamental change.  It will be a challenge and I think the Taoiseach recognises this.  I hope he meets that challenge and I urge him to adopt Sinn Féin's proposals.  larraim ar an dTaoiseach glacadh le moltaí atá a chur ag Sinn Féin anseo inniu.

The topics selected are important, including getting the horrific gender bias out of our Constitution.  I look forward to being able to debate it and vote on it in the Chamber.  I particularly welcome the Taoiseach's openness to this potentially being a first step.  He is also open to some of the issues that have been raised by Deputy Adams, Deputy Martin and others, including those within his own party, concerning radical reform.  There are things we could do to shake the system up to serve the people better.I have heard three things about the process that I like.  The inclusion of Northern Ireland delegates is important.  Deputy Adams has made some good points about making it even more inclusive, but it is good that there is at least some recognition there.  I also like the statistical process being used to ensure that different communities and different parts of the country are represented.  I  also like the openness and transparency in matters such as the proposed live webcast.  The Taoiseach's call to have more people involved will be important.In the few minutes available I wish to address some issues with the process which I would like to see tackled and improved if not for this one, then certainly for the others.  These are the make-up or membership of the convention, its funding and its powerlessness in real terms.  The Taoiseach mentioned the principles of independence, innovation and influence.  I appreciate that this is a genuine effort to do that but we could go further towards achieving those principles.As regards the make-up of the convention, a mistake has been made in including politicians, although it might seem odd for a politician to say that.  I appreciate that politicians are able to bring a view as to how the system works today that nobody else can bring, which is valuable.  However, best international practice does not include elected representatives in constitutional conventions.  Two of the best recognised speakers in the world on this matter are Archon Fung from the Harvard Kennedy School, under whom I had the privilege to study, and Ken Carty from the University of British Columbia in Canada.  In their work in this field, they acknowledge that the presence of partisan influence can lead to distorted deliberations and outcomes.  Professor Fung says that in deliberative democracy "powerful participants may seek to improperly and unreasonably exclude issues that threaten their interests from the scope of deliberation".  In other words, one could have a bunch of politicians there who see suggested change as threatening their incumbency, funding and jobs.  They may move - the academics have seen this happen in other places - to have those topics sidelined.As regards funding the convention, I appreciate as well as anyone in this House that we are in an extremely cash-poor environment.  However, when the Netherlands did this it spent €6 million on it, while British Columbia spent $6 million.  We are putting in €300,000 which is one twentieth of the Dutch figure.  My concern is that there will not be sufficient funding or time for people within the convention to absorb the kind of expert knowledge they will need to tackle the constitutional issues.The third issue is the powerlessness of the convention.  I am concerned that the Government will only take these things as recommendations.  If one compares the Dutch and Canadian experiences, in British Columbia the people got to vote and the convention decided what there was going to be a referendum on.  The Netherlands, however, used a process quite similar to the one proposed here.  In the Netherlands most of the issues raised and agreed by the convention never made it through the government or parliament.  It was seen as a failure largely for this reason.Many issues need to be addressed, including single-seat constituencies and moving from 166 to 100 Deputies.  This is substantial stuff to radically change a system that the people of Ireland do not feel is working for them.  I welcome this as a first step.  There are major opportunities to make the convention more effective and better meet the principles which the Taoiseach has set out for it.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	456	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.  I have been briefed on the process to date and the Technical Group made a submission in response to what we were presented with.  One of my concerns is the limited nature of what is being proposed.  It is a pity because there is an element of box-ticking about this.  We will get one really good opportunity to do this so we must get both the process and content right.I wish to touch on the point made by the previous speaker about the make-up of the convention, which is a point that I have made myself at the briefings.  In a body that is not a self-selecting group of citizens, the number of politicians may well have an undue bearing on the deliberations.  If it is not removed, it should be rowed back on.  I have made that proposal in my amendment.  The remit needs to be wider.  If the group itself is to be genuine it needs to have some level of control over how it does its work.  The balance should therefore be weighed much more in favour of citizens.There should also be a dedicated avenue for civil society organisations and particularly those in the human rights area, which needs to be part of the considerations.  We seem to be taking a silo approach to this - it is very compartmentalised - without looking at the totality of the Constitution.  One piece interacts with the other and it is supposed to be seen as one document.  It should have a broad vision.  I am concerned that, for example, rights to housing and income are not included.  These are some of the fundamental issues that should be examined, at least in the early deliberations.I attended an event last week at which quotations from the 1940s were read, one of which was that revolutionary times require revolutionary changes or responses.  From an economic point of view, we are in revolutionary times.  This presents us with opportunities to think big, which is not evident in terms of this convention.  What is provided for in terms of human rights is insufficient and political reform is only being addressed in a piecemeal way.  There is an appetite and desire for radical reform and for giving power back to the people, which will not happen unless we change the institutions and how we do things.  We have many strengths in this country.  These are most evident at community level.  Our political system from local government upwards is not being examined, which is a real missed opportunity.  Most citizens in this country would welcome real, serious and radical reform which gives power back to the people, because they do feel disenfranchised.  I would have liked to see this included.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I am glad that I live in a democracy.  I am always conscious when I go to vote of the many countries in the world wherein citizens do not have the right to vote or where voting is meaningless because of corruption of political institutions.  Having a constitutional convention is part of the democratic process.  Every citizen and civil society organisation will welcome it.  It is a positive step forward.Citizenship assemblies are seen in some countries as a pure form of democracy.  There is no doubt but that voter turn-out in this country is low.  This is particularly evident in certain constituencies.  This low voter turn-out indicates a deficit in the democratic process.  Conventions and citizens assemblies are a way forward in that they can provide the space, other than e-mail or phone call to a political representative, for voices to be heard .  It is important to progress the public interest as opposed to the party or political institution interest and to give people space to voice their opinions rather than assume that the political representative or political institution has all the opinions or answers.  We must do something about the disaffection with and disinterest in the political system and to address the lack of trust in public representation.  Anything that addresses this is welcome.I note that some political scientists believe these assemblies are not practical.  However, I believe if set up properly and given specific guidelines they can work well.  One of the statements in the programme for Government is that by the end of this Government's term in office Ireland will be recognised as a modern, fair, socially inclusive and equal society.  I do not think anybody would disagree with that as an objective to be realised.I would like to raise two particular issues, the first of which is composition of the convention and the second being the issues it will discuss.  As regards the chairman of the convention, it was originally proposed that such a person would be of exceptional ability and have a high degree of public acceptability, which was in my view vague and included anybody in the sporting, entertainment or cultural world.  However, I note that the Taoiseach in his speech today broadened this out a little.  It is important the chairman has a proven track record in chairing such an assembly.  However, that decision will ultimately, I presume, rest with the Taoiseach and the Cabinet.The convention is to comprise 66 members, which I believe is too narrow.  I welcome that members will be randomly selected, which is fair.  However, I presume efforts will be made to ensure a gender, age, socio-economic background, employed-unemployed, urban-rural balance and that cognisance will be taken of the Gaeltacht, island and new communities.  Also, no space is provided for those under 18 years of age.  As a former teacher and voluntary youth worker, I believe we are missing out on a body of people who are extremely articulate and principled and have a lot to contribute.  It is hoped that space can be made for them.  It is positive that the Irish abroad and in Northern Ireland are included.While that the convention will comprise 66 members might be acceptable in itself, the fact that 33 members will be members of the Oireachtas means parliamentarians will have an inordinate influence on the convention.  The convention is, therefore, disproportionately weighted in favour of parliamentarians.  I agree with the civil society groups who are critical of this.  One comment in this regard is that the politician in the convention should not be allowed to exert a greater influence over the process than does an ordinary citizen.  We the Citizens and Second Republic hold a similar view.

Obviously, there are issues around financial and resource commitments.  I heard today that all eight meetings of the convention will be held in Dublin, which will not help in terms of encouraging people to attend the process.  This issue will also need to be addressed.On the rights issue, I share the concerns of Amnesty and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that issues such as economic, social and cultural rights are not being directly addressed.  We are a leading voice on human rights issues in the developing world.  We are a supporter of the millennium development goals and a voice for rights in developing countries in respect of women, land, property, education and culture.  We need to address that here.  The Good Friday Agreement and so on are included for consideration.  I presume the Weston Park Accord will also be included.  However, prisoners with particular human rights issues in Northern Ireland are being ignored, which, too, must be addressed.The review of the White Paper on Irish Aid was a prototype for the way forward in terms of its providing space for written submissions and the holding of open forum throughout the country, chaired by former Deputy Nora Owens, which allowed people to give their opinions and have their voices heard.  It was a progressive process which could have been used in respect of the constitutional convention.   The bottom line is to empower people.  While I hope it does this, it is open to criticism.

What is being proposed by Government is only an initial step.  It should not be forgotten that Members of the Oireachtas are also citizens.  I remind those Members who have bemoaned the fact that Members of the Dáil or Seanad are to be members of the constitutional convention that Members, too, are citizens and voters who have opinions which they would like to articulate.  That those opinions are to be articulated in the constitutional convention by members of all parties is to be welcomed.There is a temptation to microanalyse what is being proposed by Government in regard to the terms of reference of the constitutional convention.  I believe we should start from the premise that this is a good thing, something which has not been tried before.  It is important that the terms of reference are limited from the outset.  There will inevitably be teething problems in terms of the mechanics and manageability of this process.  I welcome that the Government has identified a number of issues on which it wants the convention to focus from the outset.  This will provide the convention with an opportunity to bed in.While comparing a possible Irish constitutional convention to other countries around the world is good for academic purposes, it serves no real purpose.  We have a unique Constitution and a unique method of amending that Constitution, which is by way of referendum of the people following address of the issue by way of statute in the Dáil and Seanad.  What we are doing here is commencing a process which will engage people and stimulate debate.  I am not concerned about what issues are included at the outset.  I welcome that we have started this process.  The people have not been engaged in this type of forum before.If there are teething problems as some Deputies have mentioned, let them be worked out now in advance of broadening the parameters of the constitutional convention.  There is a temptation on the part of some people to suggest that no Deputy or other politician should be involved in this and that it should be handed over to a particular group of civic society, which I would totally oppose.  Under the Constitution as set out at the moment, it is ultimately the Dáil and Seanad that will propose an amendment to the Constitution or substantial changes to it.  Representatives of all political groupings in this Dáil must be involved from the outset to ensure that the views of all 166 of us are articulated.I appreciate the opportunity to speak and I wish whoever is selected on the constitutional convention the best of luck.

#BrendanGriffinFG	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-party	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-dob	unknown-#BrendanGriffinFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I very much welcome the efforts made to bring this important matter before the House this evening.  Last year's general election result was as much a call for reform as it was a change of political administration and personnel.  I believe the constitutional convention will open the door to such reform.  The constitutional convention will focus on many areas, including gay marriage, reducing the voting age to 17, reducing the presidential term and extending voting rights to citizens abroad.  While I agree with all, I wish to state specifically that I fully support gay marriage and I find it strange that in a Republic that cherishes all of our children equally, this is still a topic for discussion.  Having spoken to Deputies Paul Connaughton and Eoghan Murphy, I know they are two other Fine Gael Deputies who feel the same way in the matter.Unfortunately, I have only three minutes to speak this evening, but I want to use that short time to speak on our electoral system and resultant political system.  I hope that reform in this area will be prioritised by the convention.  These systems are inefficient and do not serve the best interests of the State and its people.  Our national Parliament could very effectively operate with as few as 101 elected Members, including the President.  Such a huge decrease in parliamentary representation could only work if it takes place hand-in-hand with meaningful reform of local government.  In essence a smaller Dáil would need to be met along the way with leaner but more empowered local authorities with fully salaried councillors, greater local revenue-raising capability and many of the facilities that currently exist for Deputies, such as dedicated social welfare and medical card inquiry lines.  These functions could then be removed from the legislators in the new Dáil allowing them and their staff to spend more time on national issues.In electing our Deputies, I propose keeping the PR-STV system but abolishing the multi-seat constituencies, replacing them with 100 single-seat constituencies of approximately 45,000 people each.  Single-seat constituencies would reduce the time spent by Deputies on issues more appropriate for councillors or State agencies by eliminating clientele competition.  They would reduce duplication on parliamentary questions, written correspondence, inquiry-line calls and meeting requests.  They would also put an end to counterproductive internal party competition and allow the Deputy to spend more time on parliamentary business.  Deputies who feel so passionately about the abolition of the Seanad must also be prepared to step back and take an objective look at our own House.  Of course such a move would save a fortune financially, but should the real benefit not be that it would lead to a better political system?  A smaller Dáil would also give the elected representatives a greater chance to have their voices heard.  At present it can take weeks to get selected to speak on topical issues.  Similarly oral questions to Ministers are answered on a lottery basis, meaning that it is pot luck to get a chance to question a Minister on the floor of the House.These are just some of my observations following 16 months in this House.  I do not profess to have all the answers to the questions to be asked at the conventional convention, but I certainly feel that our current system is failing and that we need action to remedy it.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	466	I welcome the Government's decision to bring a resolution before the House to establish the conventional convention.  It is a convention of the people to decide nine items - it could be more.  I wish to address the fifth item, which is the provision for same-sex marriage.  Like Deputy Griffin, I support this important issue and believe it should be prioritised by the convention.  This day next week we will have celebrated two years since the introduction of the civil partnership legislation.  Some 738 couples have, in effect, committed in a union of same-sex couples.  It is to be acknowledged and celebrated that the world has not ended and Irish society is the better for civil partnership.  It is but a stepping-stone and through the medium of this convention and with the support of the membership - whether elected or non-elected - we should provide for same sex-marriage for all citizens who wish it.  As one of five Oireachtas Members, I cannot celebrate the union of my relationship.  Is it right that two men or two women cannot when a man and a woman can commit in the same loving union?  That is what is before us as parliamentarians and citizens to treat all of our citizens equally under Bunreacht na hÉireann.As we head towards 2016 we strive to see an Ireland of progression and we have made significant progress.  The Taoiseach was correct last week in not succumbing to the pressure and tactics of some to say "Yea" or "Nay".  This is not a political football, but is about the lives of citizens who have made progress and have striven manfully and womanfully to make their lives better - to be treated fairly and equally by the State.  The convention is important because it is about the lives of all our people.  That is why I am proud of the Taoiseach and Tánaiste who in the programme for Government enshrined in this constitutional convention that we will have in the lifetime of this Government a plebiscite of the people which is as it should be.It is incumbent on all of us as leaders in our society to change the mindsets and attitudes not just to marriage, but to all the LGBT inequality issues.  Not long ago many people were afraid to go into gay pubs and celebrate their relationships.  Thankfully last week in our capital city all our political parties had the courage and pride to walk in Dublin Pride.  That is the Ireland for which we strive.  We have seen the great progress we have made in the peace process and by this Government in the economy and the way we are seen across Europe.  Together, without turning it into a political football, we must take the issue of same-sex marriage and normalise it.  It is not a political football, but is about the union of two people.  It is about the love we can celebrate and the tapestry of relationships - that is what Irish society is about today.  That is why the conventional convention is a significant step forward.  It is about a commitment to go to the people.  It is about saying that the 1916 Rising was worthwhile and that the Stonewall riots were worthwhile.  Is about saying that civil partnership is a progression to where we all want to be.I support the conventional convention and commend the Taoiseach on the resolution.

Along with Senator Power, I attended the briefings the Taoiseach gave on a number of occasions.  I acknowledge that he was generous in the time he gave us and that he took on board some, although not very many, of the recommendations that came from the Opposition side of the House.The constitutional convention was promised in different formats by Labour and Fine Gael before last year's general election.  It was portrayed as being consultative, inclusive and was going to introduce great change to enable the Constitution to be fit for purpose for the 21st century.  At the briefings with the Taoiseach I told him that I felt what was proposed was somewhat lacking in ambition.  Those who might be more critical might describe it, and have, as something of a damp squib.  It reminded me of a statement by Machiavelli when he wrote "It should be borne in mind that there is nothing more difficult to arrange, more doubtful of success and more dangerous to carry through than initiating changes in a state's constitution".There were proclamations by both Government parties before the general election that Seanad Éireann would be abolished, yet ironically this issue is not being discussed at all by the convention.  The Fianna Fáil Party believes that the Upper House should be reformed, maintained and strengthened.  Abolishing the Seanad without substantial reform to the Dáil would be a major mistake.  Not including discussion on the Seanad in the remit of the convention represents a missed opportunity.  This convention is a missed opportunity - even reviewing how Oireachtas committees can inquire into matters is not being discussed despite the recent referendum result.Given the strong commitment the Government demonstrated to that referendum and to the need for committees to be given powers of inquiry, it is peculiar the convention is not being progressed in this manner.We consider the convention to be narrow in its scope and issues that are to be discussed do not necessarily need as much debate as is proposed.  It must not, however, become a deeply cynical exercise in fooling people into believing that they will dramatically change Ireland's Constitution.  People are already becoming too detached from politics and if this convention does not work, it will make the gap even wider.The challenges facing the State are far too profound to be debating whether the voting age should be reduced to 17 years of age and whether the presidential term of office should be reduced to five years from seven years.  Why not leave the term at seven years but disallow a second term?

They are fed up with all this naval gazing.When Bunreacht na hÉireann was written in 1937, it was ahead of its time as few things have shaped and controlled Irish political and legal culture since then as decisively as it has.  Critical and essential features of the State are mandated by the Constitution, including our systems of election, Presidency, judicial reviews of legislation and, most importantly of all, the fundamental rights provision.  When we debated the Lisbon treaty a few years back there was a good deal of debate about the Charter of Fundamental Rights for all European citizens, yet in Ireland these are laid down since 1937.  A legal expert, Colm O Cinneide, when comparing the Constitution with the European Convention of Human Rights, wrote:There is no doubt the ECHR is a more limited system of rights protection than that provided for in the Bunreacht.  The rights protected in Irish law are more extensive and further reaching that those embedded in the ECHR text .
It is most important that this House acknowledges the progressiveness and foresight that was shown in 1937 when de Valera was Taoiseach.  It has become too easy and very popular to criticise the Constitution as having been allegedly over influenced by the Catholic Church.  Anyone who is familiar with the history of how the Constitution was written would know this is far from the truth.  Article 44o outlines: “Every religious denomination shall have the right to manage its own affairs, own, acquire and administer property... and maintain institutions for religious or charitable purposes.”  It was so ahead of its time that when I read through it again recently, I was interested to note the foresight of it having an article that states “Legislation providing State aid for schools shall not discriminate between schools under the management of different religious dominations”, yet if one was to examine the Government’s policy on education funding in recent times, it seems to be determined to do the exact opposite.  This was highlighted last week in the Seanad by the leader of the Orange Order, Mr Drew Nelson, when he called on the Oireachtas to continue to support Protestant schools in Ireland, as communities in Border counties live in fear for their continued survival, in the face of cuts to the Church of Ireland and other Protestant schools.This convention will not address any of these fears or policy decisions in education.  Unfortunately, we seem only to debate issues from the Constitution at times of contentious debates such as those around Articles 2o and 3o as well as divorce and the abortion issue.  We rarely debate Article 42o which outlines that "The State shall provide free primary education ".  The most urgent issue in our country is the challenge of returning to growth and job creation.  With the Government increasingly showing that it has little energy or initiative in this area, a credible Opposition is badly needed and that is what Fianna Fáil is providing.  However, the proposed reforms in the convention do not go far enough.  Real reform is essential in the process of building a lasting recovery - it is an essential part of the agenda, not an optional extra.There is no doubt that the political system failed in recent years.  No part of the system predicted what happened to our economy and most parts of the system actively pushed policies which caused the crisis.  Government was not subject to enough scrutiny and did not draw on a diverse enough range of expertise.  As for the Oireachtas, in the decade before the crisis it showed no interest in economic fundamentals and did not debate the financial system until it was close to collapse.  There were no calls, for example, to increase financial regulation in this House.The Government, when elected, despite promises of massive reform, made matters worse in terms of the reform of the committee system.  A second set of proposals had to be brought  forward to undo the wieldy system of committees that was initially set up and one has to wait to see whether the reformed committee system will be any more effective.  The Taoiseach has halved the number of times he attends the Dáil for questions.  In fairness, we have had for the first time Friday sittings, but we can only discuss Private Members' Bills and broad-based debates do not take place.It is mind-boggling that the Government is refusing to let a convention on the constitutional future of the country even discuss whether we should have a second Chamber in Parliament.  What this reflects is that the Government wants to have a convention which cannot touch the fundamental issues of how the Oireachtas and the Government work.  Of the issues being discussed, only one represents an area where radical political reform could be possible - the nature of our voting system.  Our current system has one great strength, namely, it ensures that all Deputies remain in close contact with the people who elected them.  However, the level of constituency work required makes a huge impact on the ability of some Deputies to carry out all their work as legislators.  At the time of the last election Fianna Fáil proposed a mixed system of constituencies and a national or regional list system.  This operates in many European countries and appears to have worked.  I suggest that it at least deserves to be addressed in the convention.The constitutional article against blasphemy is to be discussed.  Ireland has a long-earned reputation as a country which respects the freedom of expression.  However, this has and should have limits. The question is where to draw the line.It is also proposed to discuss the relevant article concerning women in the home.  This was originally proposed as a progressive measure setting out an objective of not forcing women out to work.  It now reads as a very outdated provision which has not had any real legal impact.  Many constitutions around the world retain anachronistic language without anybody being too bothered about it, but if we are to discuss the Constitution and this particular issue, we should examine the spirit in which it was drafted to see if there is some way to retain it.  Article 41o states: "The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home."  One would obviously like to see that particular article broadened and changed.  De Valera, when discussing this article, referred to it as protecting women and said that women should not be obliged or prevented from working outside the home.  He wanted to mention this so that women's role would be recognised and that our social system would value the role of women whether in the home or elsewhere.

I wish it the best of luck and hope it has a successful first meeting and first term.  My first point relates to the participation of elected politicians in the assembly.  I take a different view from that of some colleagues who said that they believed it is important that elected Members participate in this assembly.  I would like to see the number of elected politicians in the assembly decline over time.  Our role and the work that we do is amply protected by our place in the Constitution and by the public's understanding of our work.  A mechanism such as this one that is set up to allow deliberation based on the participation of people who do not form part of the political system should be allowed to do that and over time I would like to see the number of elected politicians participating in it decline to zero.  I hope we will see that happen as the body gets up and running and begins to conduct its work.My second point relates to how it will conduct its work and organise itself.  One of my concerns about the initial expectations of this new body is that it might be asked to do too much.  I refer to the number of topics it must consider.  It will need to allow for different views on those themes to be debated and it will also be required to produce agreed proposals which will have broad support.  It is quite a significant piece of work.  I would not like this new body to fail in what it needs to do as a result of looking to embrace too many big themes early in its lifetime as opposed to a focused and in-depth approach on a number of particular themes.Members of the assembly will need support.  Members of the Oireachtas have a support system and a similar model must be in place for members of the new body in order for them to ground their opinions and contributions within a broader expertise so that the themes may be considered properly.  One of the big tests to be faced by this body will be what will happen to the agreements it will produce and this will involve the Oireachtas.

It is somewhat satisfying to see it being progressed.  Many of the items for consideration by the convention are to be welcomed and, in particular, the call by our party leader, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, for the inclusion of equal marriage rights for same-sex couples was most welcome.  However, it must be recognised that the proposed agenda for the convention is just a starting point.  It is hoped that in the future we can be more ambitious with the kind of constitutional reform that could be considered by the State.Last week, along with several other Deputies, I met representatives of the Lagan Brick workers who are caught up in Ireland's longest-running industrial dispute.  They are struggling to find an industrial resolution to their dispute partially because our current laws do not compel employers to engage directly in talks.  It is my understanding that there are constitutional difficulties about forcing employers to engage directly with employees.  The Constitution prevents the Labour Court making determinations that are binding on employers.  These difficulties and others largely relate to overly strong protection given to property rights in the Constitution.  I am not calling for the abolition of private property but the convention could provide the opportunity to explore property rights for many social and economic goods.  We should regard this as an opportunity to rebalance property rights in line with the needs of the economy and, in particular, with regard to social and economic justice.  The above issues do not appear to be on the agenda for the constitutional convention.  Other issues such as the equal marriage rights for same-sex couples will encounter a certain amount of opposition, some of which will be strong and perhaps even unpleasant.  However, if one wants to see the powerful opposition which is driven by vested interests, then one need only look at the issue of property rights and how their rebalancing would be addressed.I call on the Government and the House to more ambitious in setting the agenda for the constitutional convention.  I suggest an open and transparent debate and certain issues should not be smothered by silence.
#AlexWhite	unknown-#AlexWhite-party	unknown-#AlexWhite-dob	unknown-#AlexWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I welcome this motion tabled by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.  The Taoiseach said in his contribution that the convention would be innovative, independent and influential.  On the basis of what has been set out and on what he has said, it will be each of those things.  Certainly, the proposed composition for the convention is innovative.  It involves for the first time, uniquely, a direct citizen involvement in a democratic deliberative process on the Constitution, the most important foundation document of our country and our system.  This process will be visible to the public and this is innovative.The agenda for the convention is not as broad as some would have hoped for or advocated.  However, the Taoiseach stated there is an openness on his part, and there should be on all our parts, to extending the list of topics to be considered by the convention.  The Taoiseach made this very clear and he was also prepared to say that if this meant an extension of the timeframe, this would be considered and this is to be welcomed.It would be a mistake to make little - as I thought some of the earlier speakers did to some extent, including Deputy Martin - of the topics that have been set down for discussion by this convention.  These topics are not at all without importance or significance.  I refer to the first two topics which some people have been dismissive of.  The length of the term of office of President is an important issue.  I heard many people for months on end at the time of the election and the previous election for the Presidency saying that the term of office was too long so I ask why should it not be considered and deliberated upon.  The French changed the term of office of the French President from seven years to five years.The lowering of the voting age to 17 years is the second topic.  I suggest this should be considered and debated.  It would provide the opportunity to include young people in the debate, people who would benefit from such a change.  To suggest that a change in the Dáil electoral system is not of absolutely fundamental importance in our system is bizarre.  I cannot think of anything more important.  I believe in radical reform of the Dáil electoral system but to be dismissive of it and to say it is not at the heart of the kind of change needed is strange.  Equally, I refer to the proposal to allow citizens living outside the State to vote in presidential elections.  The most controversial clauses in the Constitution over the past 30 years, in my memory, have been the clauses dealing with women and women in the home and this is also on the list for consideration.  The question of same-sex marriage is also on the list as is the question of blasphemy.  Deputy Martin stated that he has attended Fianna Fáil meetings around the country and the issue of blasphemy does not float any boats.  I remind Deputy Martin that his former colleague, Dermot Ahern, only two years ago, was prepared to introduce an absurd piece of legislation rather than address this issue which is a constitutional question.  All of these issues are important and I welcome the motion.
#AnneFerris	unknown-#AnneFerris-party	unknown-#AnneFerris-dob	unknown-#AnneFerris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  The constitutional convention represents an important opportunity to discuss changes to a fundamental document.  The Constitution guarantees various freedoms, including our freedom of expression, subject to certain restraints.  However, it is not without its flaws and these have been highlighted by lawyers who are expert in constitutional law and by those directly affected by them, such as, for instance, same-sex couples.I was heartened when the Labour Party mooted the idea of a constitutional convention to examine this 1937 construct.  I am glad this idea has been realised today.  I know that a series of issues are to be discussed, including the provision of same-sex marriage, the amendment of the clause relating to women in the home and the increasing of the participation of women in politics.  However, the scope of the convention should be extended to incorporate broader issues of significance.  I note the provision in this motion to allow for such extension and I will work to ensure that this happens.  A further concern of mine is that the convention may become a talking shop and that action on the recommendations may be delayed.Leadership will be required.  The Tánaiste was proactive in his statement on the issue of same-sex marriage.  He said that he did not believe it should ever be the role of the State to pass judgment on whom a person falls in love with or with whom he or she wants to spend their life.  I agree with the Tánaiste and I agree with those other Ministers who made supportive statements.  This kind of leadership will be needed if any of the recommendations are to be implemented; otherwise, the fear is that like the multitude of reports on Seanad reform, the recommendations will sit like an empty flowerpot on a shelf gathering dust.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	474	When the Labour Party first mooted this notion of a constitutional convention, what was envisaged was more expansive than the proposal before the House tonight.  Sinn Féin has constructively engaged in the convention process over the past number of months.  We have met with the Taoiseach and we submitted detailed proposals of our own.  It might interest Deputy Keaveney to know that collective bargaining rights were one of the proposals we put forward as an issue for discussion by the convention.The remit of the convention as set out in the motion is too narrow.  For it to be genuinely a reforming or even a transformative tool, it should have the broadest possible scope.  Sinn Féin welcomes the inclusion of political representation from the Six Counties but we are disappointed that the Government has decided against ensuring a full representation of Irish society within the citizen block.  Those under 18 years of age will be excluded, despite the fact that we will debate the possible lowering of the voting age, as will the diaspora and citizens from the Six Counties.  Indeed, there is no guarantee that Ireland's newest citizens or citizens with disabilities will be represented.  We may well have a bizarre situation where same-sex marriage or marriage equality will be debated by a convention potentially made up entirely of heterosexuals.  That is a design flaw in the proposed approach.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	478	We have said to the Government that the methodology employed for identifying the citizen block certainly deals with geography, age and gender, but we proposed a much more sophisticated tool that could capture a much broader range of people.  We went through that in some detail with the Government.It is worth noting that the programme for Government sets a specific context for reform.  The Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party promised to establish a process to ensure that our Constitution meets the challenges of the 21st century.  Instead of rising to that challenge, they have half-heartedly engaged in their own process for constitutional reform.  The proposal before us lacks ambition and, sadly, like so many of the Government's promises of reform, the Labour and Fine Gael parties have chosen instead to tinker around the edges.  This has not gone unnoticed by citizens and feeds into a narrative that not only are all politicians the same, but also all governments are the same.  I am disappointed that there is so little ambition or heart in the Government's proposals.This convention could and should be a significant platform for constitutional reform.  There should be a myriad of issues to be debated, including long awaited and fundamental political reform.  Instead the convention is in real danger of becoming, as one commentator put it over the weekend, "a purgatory into which a selection of constitutional issues will be parked before being further delayed or diverted when they return to the parliamentary process".  Bizarrely, Seanad reform has been excluded from the convention.  This is astonishing.  We are told the Government intends to hold a referendum on the abolition of the Seanad, yet it is now refusing a full, open and public debate through the vehicle of the convention.  It appears to have rushed to judgment on the issue and is making a unilateral decision that the people are either offered abolition or the status quo, when neither of those options is what is needed.The convention should be tasked with considering whether a one-chamber or two-chamber parliament would best serve the country.  Such a debate would enable convention delegates to debate the Seanad's potential, if any, if it were to be fundamentally reformed.  Instead of facilitating this debate, the Government has rushed to what it sees as a populist position, instead of addressing a real reform agenda.  We all know the Seanad is not working; it is an open secret.  It has not worked for some time.  Sinn Féin has advocated root and branch reform of the Seanad for over a decade.  The Seanad in its current form is undemocratic.  Its members are elected by an elite group with little or no regard to real representation of wider societal interests.  That is a problem.  A reformed Seanad could serve our democracy well and act as an important counter-balance to the political party-dominated Dáil.  Ultimately, not only is this a matter for the people to decide, but the people should have an appropriate forum to debate that matter.  The constitutional convention should be tasked with instigating and leading this debate.There is a place for a democratic second chamber in Irish politics but only if its representatives are elected by all citizens, including those in the Six Counties and in the Irish diaspora.  It is astonishing for a Government that so regularly looks to the Irish diaspora to assist it in energising and rebuilding the domestic economy to deny that diaspora even the most basic input into the political and democratic life of the State.  Progress has been made on enhanced co-operation between the political institutions on the island, but people north of the Border feel there is still no real method by which they can play their part in national politics and democracy.Senators should represent a wide range of diverse views and the role of community consultation should be increased as legislation is developed.  These would be ambitious reforms but they are also achievable.  Our democratic structures would be fundamentally enhanced by such ambition.  The Seanad should be an elected forum for civic society, particularly for those sectors not adequately represented in the Dáil and, critically, for the more marginalised.  The community and voluntary sector should have a direct input into the development of legislation not on the sufferance of Members elected to this Chamber, but as a matter of democratic process.  One of the primary functions of a reformed Seanad should be scrutiny.  It should scrutinise draft domestic legislation and furnish reports to the Dáil, including specific recommendations for amendment, withdrawal, further consultation, impact assessment and fast-track progress.We have proposed significant changes to the current legislative process.  Prior to consideration by the Dáil, all proposed legislation would first pass scrutiny by the Seanad.  This would be known as the Seanad stage and this new stage would include a community consultation process.  This is the type of real reform the convention could and should be debating.  It is bizarre that the matter of the Seanad's existence or its reform is excluded from the convention.  A commitment has been given by the Taoiseach in respect of civic society's engagement with the proposed convention.  The Government must be sure to get that right.  While citizens who will be drawn to participate and those who are elected to the Dáil and the Seanad will have views and expertise, there is a wealth of experience that must be tapped into to enrich the debate.  Civic society could have been given a more pivotal role in this process, and it is a great pity that this is not the case.As Deputy White mentioned, the Taoiseach has promised that this forum will be innovative, independent and influential.  Certainly, under the motion that has been presented I do not believe it is automatic that any of that will be true.  It will be a challenge for the Government to ensure, during the process and in dealing with the outcomes from the convention, that such innovation, independence and influence are writ large.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	479	Deputy McDonald was referring to the campaign of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other groups to participate in the convention.  I agree with some of the points made by the groups, which call themselves Hear Our Voices, but I do not agree that they should be members of the convention.  To include civic society groups in the membership would distort the convention in terms of it being representative.  Civic society groups are not necessarily representative.  They do not have a democratic mandate and there is also the issue of what groups one should and should not include.  I agree that their input and expertise should be used by the convention.  I agree with the points they have made, particularly with the point that the time for debating before setting up this convention is too short, especially in the Dáil.There is much in our Constitution that we should protect and preserve.  It is not necessarily a regressive thing to be a conservative when it comes to conserving progressive things that have been achieved in the past.  There is much that is good in our Constitution.  People fought for the rights enshrined therein and we should not mess with them.  We should be very careful about what rights we would take away in the name of so-called political reform.I do not have a problem with the convention examining our electoral system but it should be noted that our system is the most democratic.  I will fight until my dying day to protect PR-STV, which I hope will not be changed by the convention.I fully agree that it is very wrong that the convention's agenda does not include the issue of the Seanad.  Our Constitution is based on a bicameral system involving the Dáil and Seanad, and also the President and Legislature.  It is similar to the American constitution.   At least a couple of constitutions are modelled on the Irish one, including the Indian one.  One cannot consider the Dáil in isolation from the Seanad, nor can one consider the presidency in isolation from the Seanad.  The problem is that this Government will never consider Seanad reform, only the all-or-nothing question of whether to abolish it.  That is a mistake.
#CiaraConway	unknown-#CiaraConway-party	unknown-#CiaraConway-dob	unknown-#CiaraConway-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	480	Mr. Éamon de Valera, the author of Bunreacht na hÉireann, famously said he had only to look into his heart to know what he was doing was right for the country.  I, for one, am glad to be part of a Government that will look beyond this Chamber to the community and have confidence in citizens' ability to make the right decisions on the issues put before them.There are two warmly welcome criticisms in regard to the constitutional convention.  These concern both the process and content.  With regard to the process, if people are worried that 33 Members of the Oireachtas will be involved in the convention and that they will be somehow restricted as a result, they should listen to what is being said tonight.  Politicians, by their nature, tend not to agree on very much.  The Tánaiste will know this more than most because this trend is evident even within his party.  To believe there will be groupthink because 33 Members of the Oireachtas will be involved is a fallacy.  Politicians, as with others, are citizens of this great country, and we should remember that.  I will be very confident that the 66 members of the convention, irrespective of where they come from, will be able to make the correct decisions.  We will respect the decisions they make on the questions put to them.I have heard many state the approach is not radical.  What could be more radical than amending the clause that somehow restricts women to life at home?  What could be more radical than addressing the circumstances of a young woman who fears an interview board will not give her a job because it suspects she will go on maternity leave?  If we could introduce paternity leave and give back to the couple the choice as to who will look after the child, what could be more radical?  What could be more radical than allowing 17 year olds to make decisions and have an influence?  We would have a very different Chamber if more 17 year olds were allowed to vote.  I have every confidence that they, too, would be sitting alongside us at the age of 20 or 21.  These are radical steps that could change society for the better.  I commend the motion to the House.
#LukeMingFlanagan	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-party	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-dob	unknown-#LukeMingFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	481	We could definitely do things better in this country.  While we can criticise what the Government is trying to do in this area, we should realise nobody has ever tried to do anything before.  I congratulate the Government on its efforts.  I hope something emerges from the convention.  I will die of scepticism if nothing does.  It is very rare that anything emerges from a report in Ireland other than a bigger carbon footprint and many frustrated people.Despite Ireland's geographic size, population, weather conditions and plentiful supply of water, it has great potential.  Over the past century, we have been generally well-educated, but somehow it all seems to get messed up.  This may not be as attributable to the people we elect as much as I once believed; perhaps it is attributable to how we go about our business.  I am not a politician hater and believe there are too many such people - they are dangerous.  It is great that politicians will be involved in the convention if only because they, for their sins, have great insight into how sick the system is.  That is not to say the people in the system are sick.  The system is like a bad car which, despite one's putting in good petrol and oil, will not move.  This is a major problem.  I said on my first day here that 19 out of 20 in my family and that of my wife had to leave this fertile country.  It always has potential but it never fulfils it.  If the convention can go some way towards fulfilling this potential, I will cheer for it.In fewer than three minutes, Deputy Brendan Griffin got to the nub of the problem.  For this, I give him credit.  There would probably be too many Members if we were to do only the job we were meant to be doing, which is crossing the t's and dotting the i's of legislation.  Deputy Griffin referred to freeing up Members to legislate and having a better system at county council level.  In my county, there are too many county councillors.  We could get rid of some of them where there are smaller populations but set in train a system in which those who want to make change and care about doing so will not get sick of the system owing to their not being able to make the changes they desire.  One needs a system that listens to the elected people.  Those who are elected comprise the boss because they have been elected by the people.  I hope that, in the convention process, somebody will speak so strongly about the way local government works that there will actually be change.  When I became a county councillor I was full of energy, but I am no longer full of energy having gone through the system.  The system took no account of who was elected but took account of an unelected county manager.  That system ought to be changed.Consider the talk about getting rid of town councils.  If it is a matter of cost, one should realise people are willing to do the job for nothing.  There should be a local town council system instead of the current system in which locals who set up a committee to apply for a few quid from one of the agencies, which are soaking it up through handing out funding, get sick of doing so after nine or ten years.  Instead of operating under the current system, such people could be running for election to local town councils and making real decisions about how money is spent locally.  They would never make stupid decisions such as pulling up a footpath that was built the preceding year.  The money would be spent properly.  This philosophy needs to filter up from town council level to county council level, or even regional level.  There is an argument for governance at regional level.  The current system is a complete disaster.  The people who are now in government tried for so long to get there - I probably cheered them when they started many years ago - that they will not listen to anyone else because getting in was so difficult and no one listened to them when they were in opposition.  That they might believe this is scary.  A Fine Gael Deputy expressed the opinion to me that, although reform of local government was all very well, it would not leave Deputies with much power.  It is not about Deputies - it is about running the country the right way.If people who have become sick and tired of a system in which they telephone local councils, there is no accountability and nothing that is necessary gets done because it is all a mess found their way onto the convention, it would be one hell of an achievement.  However, the process will not work if people do not listen to its members simply because, having waited so long for their own say, they are afraid they will lose it again.  I can understand the temptation.  I might be the same.  Who knows?  I will probably never get to find out.  We need to change how we run this country.  We have great potential.Regarding women's rights, I grew up in a house in which letters to my mother were addressed "Mrs. Luke Flanagan", although not by my father's choice.  I am delighted that those days are gone.  The further away they go, the better.  One of the best suggestions for solving the problem of not enough female participation came from the Opposition and will also make men more equal, that is, paternity leave.  I want to participate in my children's lives as much as my wife does.  Under the law, however, I am not treated equally.  Saying this is not fashionable or popular, as it suggests that one wants to remove some rights from women.  Everyone's rights are diminished when one removes men's or women's rights.  If the constitutional convention can equalise the situation, wonderful.  I do not know whether 60 people will be enough, but perhaps it will.  What is representative and what number does one pick?I could pick many holes in this motion, but it is the best attempt that I have seen yet.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	482	It is a privilege for every Deputy elected to this Dáil Éireann to represent our fellow Irishmen and women.  We do so knowing we are entrusted with getting our country through a difficult economic time and bringing about recovery.  We are also entrusted with laying the foundations for the country's future and forging a modern, fair, compassionate and democratic society, a country that reflects the best of ourselves and a legacy of which we can be proud.Those of us who have been elected to the Thirty-first Dáil find ourselves seeing out the closing years of Ireland's first century of independence.  They have been difficult years of late, but this is also a moment in our history for renewal.  It is an opportunity to ask ourselves not just what went wrong, but what we can do better, what we want our next century of independence to look like and what values will underpin our laws and the institutions that will shape our politics.  When my party first proposed the holding of a constitutional convention in April 2010, it was in this spirit of renewal.There is much in the 1937 Constitution that has served us well, but we must also acknowledge that there are many whom it has served less well, particularly the nation's children.  Our Constitution is a document of the 1930s for the 1930s.  It was a time when one church was considered to hold a special position and women were considered to be second class citizens.  In many ways, Irish society today would be unrecognisable to the original drafters of the 1937 Constitution.  Ireland has been transformed by the liberalisation of our laws, almost universal acknowledgement of a person's right to a private life, equal rights for women, the fact that 17% of our population was born outside the State and the more personal role of religion in people's lives.  The pace of change in social attitudes has consistently outpaced the laws governing them.The constitutional convention is an opportunity to examine how we as a people want to respond to these societal changes in a measured, fair and compassionate way.  It is also an historic opportunity to take an independent look at our electoral system and to ask how well it serves our democracy.  These are no small tasks, but it is right that the Constitution, which belongs to the people, should be open to deliberative and thoughtful consideration by the people.The process that we are proposing is radical.  This mechanism for the consideration of the Constitution has never been done before.  It invites that two thirds of the membership of the constitutional convention will be drawn at random from our citizens, people who are on the electoral register.  It has never been the case before that our Parliament exercised such a vote of confidence and trust in citizens that we invited them to take part in a constitutional convention to consider the Constitution's future form.  We need to reflect on this fact.  When we engage in oppositional politics in the House, Members are sometimes blinded to radical change, such as the change we are effecting this evening.  We are establishing a constitutional convention in which individual citizens will form the majority.Members have suggested that we should be more ambitious in terms of what the convention will consider.  People who have been Deputies for a long time have had experience of the various all-party committees on the Constitution, the reports of which line bookshelves.  They are worthy considerations of constitutional issues.  We have decided to give the convention a mandate to examine specific issues in the Constitution and report on them within 12 months.  The Government is required to respond to that report within four months.  The convention is not confined to the issues listed in this motion.  Rather, it will be enabled to recommend additional matters for consideration.As Deputy White stated, these are no small matters.  For example, reducing the voting age from 18 years to 17 years is a radical measure.  I remember campaigning for the right to vote at 18 years and being denied that right when the then Government chose to hold the election before those who were entitled to vote as a result of a constitutional change were included on the electoral register.  Same-sex marriage, which has been discussed repeatedly, is no small issue.  The position of women in our society has long been debated and is no small matter.  Many Deputies have been preoccupied with the question of how to increase women's participation in politics constitutionally and how to make the Parliament genuinely representative of the population in gender terms.  The participation in presidential elections of citizens who are resident outside the State is no small issue.  All of these are very substantial issues.  Deputy Alex White mentioned the removal of blasphemy from our Constitution.  When such issues are addressed by the constitutional convention and if and when they are addressed by way of a referendum, we will all discover that in the minds of the people who will vote on these matters they are not small or minor issues.The process of change must be done step-by-step.  Sometimes when an issue like our Constitution is raised, we may look to consider it in its entirety, and sometimes, when we attempt to change everything, we change nothing.  This is a proposal where the Government committed to having a constitutional convention and it is to be established as we indicated it would, with the two thirds participation of individual citizens.  It is being given a mandate to go through these issues, examine them and make recommendations.Civil society, interest groups and representative bodies will be included in the process.  It is clear from the terms of the motion and the way the constitutional convention is being set up that civil society will have a role in this process.  It will involve dialogue and discussion.  The Constitution belongs to the citizens and the people and that is why the membership of the constitutional convention is composed of individual citizens and those who are elected by citizens.  The convention will take submissions and hear ideas, and I have no doubt there will be very active engagement between the representative bodies in civil society and the convention.We have committed in the terms for the constitutional convention to a timeframe in which it will do its work.  With the issues set down for consideration by the convention, there should be a report within 12 months, and that is challenging when dealing with complex issues.  It is also important that we set down a timeframe within which the Government will respond to the recommendations of the constitutional convention, with the period in question set at four months.It has been suggested that this is less than radical but we are seeing a process of change being progressed on a scale that we have not seen before.  There are issues on which we have decided to have separate constitutional referenda, including children's rights.  A referendum will be held on that in the autumn so that there is an opportunity to put into the Constitution particular rights for children.  The Seanad issue must also be decided by the people.  First, it must be decided by the people whether our country of approximately 4.5 million people should have one or two parliamentary Chambers.  That is why there will be a separate referendum on the issue.The constitutional convention is an opportunity for a wide and inclusive mode of addressing our democracy.  It is a way not just of engaging the citizens who will participate but of having a wider national conversation about the kind of country we want to live in and the principles by which we want to live.  It is an exciting innovation in Irish public life.  I have no doubt it will challenge each of us individually as citizens and collectively as part of the political system.  Ultimately, our democracy will always depend on the willingness of individuals to perform the duties of citizenship, and the Constitution will once more call on us to play our part.  I commend the motion to the House.

If we consider the statements of the Minister for Health and other Ministers last year in the context of the formulation of the budget, they accepted there were challenging and difficult times ahead.  At the time, we highlighted that we were very concerned about the budgetary process, the number of leaks and the intimidatory statements made by Ministers to their colleagues that Armageddon would arrive if they did not get their way at Cabinet.It is clear now, seven months on from that budget, that much of what was said in terms of the health Estimate was a tissue of lies.  It has transpired the health budget was based on false premises.  For example, the programme for Government stated the restructuring of the HSE was a priority.  This was to be one of the first acts of the Minister for Health.  He was like Wyatt Earp going down to the OK corral, looking for a fight.  He found the board of the HSE and summarily dismissed it and replaced it with an interim board.  We asked at the time what was the purpose of dismissing the board and the Minister replied that he wanted to be a hands-on Minister, one who would roll up his sleeves and take charge of everything.  Unfortunately, we are still waiting to see that legislation on governance of the HSE come to the Dáil.This lack has created huge difficulties and there is now paralysis in the HSE and the Department of Health.  Nobody is quite sure who is in charge.  The Minister says he is in charge and is responsible, but he has abdicated his responsibilities.  The CEO, Cathal Magee, was before an Oireachtas committee recently and he outlined clearly that there is no way the HSE will achieve the savings outlined in the budget last year.  Therefore, the savings outlined last year were just figments of imagination.  This has transpired to be the case and the service is already running at a budget deficit of over €280 million.  Huge changes will be required and catastrophic damage will be done to services if the Department is to come in on target.  We have highlighted this every month since February and have pointed out that the budgetary figures provided last year were not achievable.  Later this year, we will see huge damage to services.  We will see the closure of operating theatres and the downgrading of wards.  The CEO, Cathal Magee, said at the Oireachtas committee that the HSE could envision the potential closure of hospitals to bring the HSE in on budget.  This motion notes that the health Estimate in budget 2012 was misleading, given that it was based on assumptions and targets that were not deliverable by the Minister for Health.Another key area in which there was a promise of huge savings was in reference pricing and generic drug substitution and figures were provided for these savings.  However, nothing has happened and no effort has been made to bring forward legislation to enable generic drug pricing and reference pricing.  This again was a stated priority in the budget, in order to bring about the savings required to bring the HSE in on target.  Clearly, this is another priority on which the Government has failed.  It has failed to ensure it had a budget over which it can stand.  The Government also proposed to make significant savings in the area of private health insurance and planned to charge people the full cost of public beds.  However, there has been no enabling legislation and no change.  By failing in these two areas the health budget will be down €200 million.  The Government committed in the House last year to ensuring the HSE would have an adequate budget to deliver services, but what will happen now is that we will have fire brigade action from September onwards.  It will be a slash and burn policy, all because the Government was incapable of delivering on the priorities and policies outlined by the Ministers for Health and Finance in the budget last December.It is now July and the HSE remains in a state of flux.  The CEO is the Accounting Officer, the Minister claims he is in charge and the board is made up primarily of people appointed from the Department of Health.  The Department says the HSE is responsible, but the CEO is the Accounting Officer, with the board.  This state of affairs has caused damage and dislocation, particularly with regard to bringing forward policy, enacting it and ensuring services are provided.With regard to the HSE service plans, last January we had more smoke and mirrors from the Minister when he sent back the service plan because he was not happy with it.  Surely, he should have been involved in drafting the service plan as he has claimed that he is the one ultimately responsible.  The HSE and the board signed off on a plan, but the Minister took a look at it and sent it back to the board saying he wanted substantial changes.  What substantial changes did he want?  As far as I am aware, no changes were made.  That was just another spin by the Minister to show he was flexing his muscle in terms of being in charge.  Unfortunately, he has not stood up to the responsibility of ensuring the HSE brings in its budget on time and within limit.The fundamental issue is the delivery of services to the people.  We have already begun to see hospital managers under huge stress and pressure.  We have heard claims that trolleys are being moved to wards in order to reduce the trolley count.  We have eminent consultants saying that lives are now being put at risk.  Front line health service providers and nurses are stating that they are working in areas that are not fit for purpose in terms of delivery of emergency care.  These issues are being raised continually, but that is nothing new.  They were raised last December also.  We have highlighted these issues regularly, but the Minister seems to be incapable of understanding or acting on these warnings.  It is time for him to act because the CEO of the HSE has said that it cannot come in on budget unless there is massive dislocation to health services throughout the country.  This is just the seventh month of 2012, but huge adjustments are required if the HSE is to come in on target.The adjustments required will, unfortunately, affect vulnerable people most.  We had a situation not long ago when incontinence pads being provided for patients in a nursing home in Kilkenny were being counted out to them.  At the same time as this is happening, the Minister has failed to make the savings in the areas he proposed, agency staff, generic substitution and price referencing.  He identified massive savings in these areas, but the CEO has stated that these savings have not been realised at all.  I understand the challenges are difficult and we are all aware of the reality of the situation we face.  However, the least the Minister should do is to try to bring forward the legislation that will allow him to make savings, that will allow him to substitute brand drugs with generic drugs and allow him to price reference and address the agency issue.  More importantly, he must bring about proper corporate governance and ensure accountability at the highest levels to ensure Government policy is enacted.  That is not happening now.On the issue of community nursing homes, the Minister has stated that the most important issue with regard to acute hospital services is to ensure a throughput of patients and to ensure that people do not remain in intensive care or high maintenance units in hospitals when they could be in community nursing homes.  At the same time, the service plan he rejected initially and then sought to implement has proposed closures of over 800 community nursing home beds in one year.  Without any stretch of the imagination, that is contradictory to what the Minister is trying to achieve, namely, to move people who should not be in hospitals into the community setting.  I never come into this House and question anybody's integrity but other Deputies have raised the issue of conflicts of interest in terms of private nursing homes and support for them and a slash and burn of our community nursing homes without any logical explanation as to why they should be closed.  The Health Information and Quality Authority was used as a reason for closing them in some cases while in others, other reasons were used.  However, there is a fundamental question we must all ask.  What is the logical reason for closing community nursing homes which we all accept provide the highest standard of care to our elderly people in the community setting and which benefit, in every way, the transfer of people from the hospital setting to the community one which, as the Minister says, is stated policy and yet he reverts to type and closes them without any consideration for the residents or the community?I refer to other areas causing huge dislocation.  The Minister placed great store on his special delivery unit.  This was the answer to all his difficulties and would resolve all the problems he faced.  The special delivery unit is spending an awful lot of time dealing with people who are waiting more than one year for procedures.  However, it is benefiting from the fact that people cannot get to see a consultant to be assessed and to find out whether they need to become inpatients.  Hundreds of thousands of people are waiting to see consultants to be assessed but they are not being allowed into the system.  I know of a woman in her 90s who is waiting more than four years for an audiology assessment.  People are waiting ages for orthodontic services.  What is happening to orthodontic services is shameful, in particular in regard to our young people who simply cannot get to see an orthodontist.We must be honest with ourselves.  The Government has failed to bring forward the legislation which would allow it to deliver the services our people need.  I do not know the reason but the Minister promised three pieces of legislation.  He also promised with great fanfare some time ago that he would renegotiate consultants' contracts but he has just thrown that aside.  He said he might get more productivity out of them.  At the same time, some consultants are continually in breach of their 80:20 public-private mix.  There are contracts with a 70:30 mix but some consultants are even in breach of that.  Nobody is taking them on.  When he was on this side of the House, the Minister promised he would do the devil and all when he moved to the other side.  He has moved to that side of the House but everything has almost stopped.The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, is as accountable as the Minister because she is representing the Government in this Chamber and in this debate on the budgetary process.  The Government has quite clearly failed.  When it is closing hospital wards, hospital theatres and nursing homes in the future, it might reflect on the fact that if it had been active in the legislative area to bring about the savings identified in the budget, we would not have to take the drastic action we may yet have to take.  What exactly will the Government do at this late stage with one week remaining in this session to bring forward legislation to allow it to at least effect some savings between now and the end of December so that we will not have the dislocation of services which will inevitably happen if we continue on this path?I refer to the issue of accountability and the HSE.  We must find out once and for all to whom we speak.  Is it the Minister, the Secretary General of the Department or the CEO or all three - the three wise men?  At committees, I see the Secretary General of the Department, the Minister and the CEO of the HSE all defer to each other.  The Minister must take a hands on approach at some stage.I refer to the other commitments in the programme for Government.  I only have 20 minutes to speak so it would be wrong of me to take up more time than that but we will have to revisit the issue of primary care.  The Minister promised at the Irish Medical Organisation conference that he would transfer money from the hospital budget to the primary care setting.  Has that happened?  This is a key question to which we must know the answer.  The Government cannot continue to spin its way out of this.  The fact is that services are continually being downgraded by stealth and people will be waiting for longer periods, not necessarily on hospital trolleys, to see a consultant.  People cannot get to see consultants for assessment.This motion is an opportunity for us to highlight the Government's abject failure to address the budgetary problems which have been evident since early January.  This was highlighted in the context of private health insurance and the fact that charges for public beds has not happened.  The CEO of the HSE said last week that this did not transpire.  In one fell swoop, the Government has lost millions of euro through inactivity on the legislative front and, as I said, people will suffer because of that.I refer to the issue of agency staff.  We highlighted the fact the Government did not have a plan for retirements on 29 February.  The more I look at this the more I see that it is by pure accident rather than design that we have not had worse dislocation of health services.  We have an issue in regard to agency staff and the Temporary Agency Workers Directive.  A key component of the budget was to address the reliance on agency staff which would save more than 50%.  The Government has made no effort to do that.  The recent figures from the HSE, the Minister or the Department - I am not quite sure from where they came, although I presume they are accurate - state that the agency bill has increased.  We are becoming more reliant on agency staff even though it is the Department of Health's stated policy, and it was stated in last year's budget, that this issue would be tackled and that the Government would address the issue of agency staff once and for all.I hate to say it but after a short period time, the Government has driven the health services to the brink because of inactivity.  It is not always about a lack of funding but rather inactivity and a deficit of ideas and action.  That is the situation we face.  When people must wait long periods of time to be assessed, to get medical cards and to get orthodontic treatment and when someone of 90 years of age must wait four years for audiology services, the Government can consider its abject failure to bring forward the legislation it promised the people and the Dáil when it passed the budget last year.  I am convinced - it was said at the time - that it was aspirational at best or dishonest at worst.  The jury is still out that particular issue.   It gives me no joy to say - let it be conveyed to the Minister - that it is a very serious breach of trust when a Government passes a budget and fails abjectly to bring forward the legislative measures which would bring about savings so that people who require services will not have to carry the burden due to inactivity and its failure on the legislative front.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The health service has been used to taking a battering in this House over the years.  Some of it has been justified but some of it has not been.  Before the HSE was set up, not a day went by without an issue in one of the 11 health boards being raised or debated.  The whole aim of setting up the HSE was that patients wherever they lived had access to the same type of service and that health outcomes would be the same whether one lived in Carndonagh or Cahirciveen.  When the previous Government set up the HSE, it was actually welcomed by the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  Obviously, since going into government both parties, as is the norm, found themselves to have short memories.I am not saying the HSE did not have a very difficult start.  I admit it took a while to bed all of the changes down but it must be acknowledged that the health service is one of the biggest employers in the State, has thousands of sites and numerous grades and different professions, so it was bound to take time to settle.  Any expert in change management would tell one that.  Let us take primary care, for instance.  The Minister and Minister of State, Deputies Reilly and O'Sullivan never miss an opportunity to say nothing was done in this area before they came into office, even though on their own Department's website an update on progress on primary care teams that was posted in March 2011 tells a very different story.  It outlines how there were 348 teams at an advanced functioning stage, that is, holding meetings on patients.  A further 171 teams were in development.  There were at that stage over 2,500 health care professionals on primary care teams.  This illustrates that an enormous amount of work was done by the previous Government.  Any objective commentator would confirm that.  I wonder do the Minister and Minister of State agree.What baffles me most is the audacity of the present Government.  When elected, members of the Government made a conscious decision to rubbish all previous health policy as it was seen to be tarnished in some way.  The mantra of universal health insurance was the answer to all our woes, nothing would be right until it was introduced.  However, the Dutch model is no longer mentioned as it was found to increase the number of administrative staff and to cost the Dutch taxpayer more.  It is now 16 months since the election and a White Paper on universal health insurance has not even been introduced.  The Minister has said it is unlikely that it will be introduced in the lifetime of the Government, however long that will be.In the meantime, insurance costs for families who can afford it have gone through the roof and an increasingly rapid number of people are leaving insurance schemes as they simply cannot afford them.  Waiting times for processing medical cards are at a historic high, and not just for first time applicants.  We all remember the story of Regina Kennedy who last December, at 29 years of age and battling chronic renal failure, said she could not afford life-saving medication while her medical card re-application was being considered.  Even though she had a chronic illness and the date on her original medical card had expired she would have to wait months and pay for medication in the meantime.  This is far from the Utopia of universal health insurance.  The Minister is not in charge of his Department or the HSE.  He is too busy pontificating and relabelling policies so that he can call them his own.  This is not fooling anyone working in the health service and it is certainly not fooling the public.The National Treatment Purchase Fund, which had treated more than 200,000 patients over the previous ten years was a real success story and, when surveyed, patients who had used it gave it a more than 95% satisfaction rate.  Waiting times were considerably down, with the vast majority of procedures being done within a three month waiting period.  Within a few months of taking office, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, dismissed the NTPF and set up the special delivery units, SDUs.  The SDUs are now busy relabelling trolleys and waiting rooms in the country's hospitals so numbers in accident and emergency departments look better on paper.As we speak tonight, there are 2,451 beds closed in our public hospital system and 277 patients on trolleys.  While the Minister is taking praise for treating the longest waiters on the waiting list, very few people have copped that these are the least number of patients being treated compared to when the NTPF was in charge.  Obviously, the spin of treating those waiting longest was the priority rather than the substance of comparing the total numbers being treated.  The Minster is not being open and honest about the SDUs.  I was surprised to see reports that two of his advisers on the SDU are paid through the UK and do not appear to pay tax in Ireland.  If these reports are inaccurate they should be corrected immediately.The Minister is also facing major challenges to ensure that his health Estimates are correct and in order.  Indications so far do not lend any confidence.  It is hard to ascertain the exact budget correction the health service is facing.  It seems to be in a shambles.The Minister got rid of the board of the HSE, an exercise in optics, and shamelessly has yet to bring forward legislation to replace it.  This cynical exercise has led to this mess and brings with it a total lack of accountability.  The Minister put Department of Health officials on the interim board of the HSE but when they met last week with the CEO of the HSE to discuss exact budget deficit figures they could not agree on them.  This is farcical.  It is like a pantomime.  The deficit could be anything from €250 million to €300 million but as there is no functioning governing board the Minister will have to become directly involved himself to sort out this mess.The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, has recognised this.  Ten days ago, he asked the Minister for Health to get personally involved, but there are no signs of this happening yet.  Deputy Howlin even wrote to Deputy Reilly and outlined his concerns over the budget over-runs in a four page letter and added that he was concerned about the lack of governance structures.  This is like a bad episode of "Killinaskully".While the Minister pontificates about his universal health insurance plan, without producing any real plan, the health service as we knew it is falling apart, bit by bit.  Morale is extremely low amongst staff, the service is facing massive cutbacks but the Minister is not even being honest about that.  The CEO of the HSE is calling for direction.  The Minister's own Department is saying the HSE is to blame.  It is like a vicious circle of financial madness.The Minister has only three Bills on the legislative list, not one of which has been published in this session.  The first is on generic drugs where there were to be substantial savings, but to no avail.  The second is to amend the Health and Social Health Care Professionals Act 2005, hardly a complex piece of legislation, but nothing has been done.  The last is the HSE governance Bill.  Despite repeated requests from Deputy Kelleher and many others on this side of the House, nothing has been produced.  The Minister needs to take charge and to act now to prevent further damage being done to front line services.  He is in danger of becoming the emperor with no clothes.Time, patience and excuses are not enough.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and the Ministers of State are no longer acceptable.   Labour and Fine Gael have been in office for 16 months.  It is time for them to walk the walk.  We have spent too long listening to them talking the talk, but there seems to be no cohesion, direction or control.  The situation is spiralling out of control while the prospect of a €500 million over-run can only spell disaster for front line services.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on the motion tabled by the Fianna Fáil  spokesperson on health, Deputy Billy Kelleher, and to express my concern about the health services.Before the last general election, Deputy Reilly had all the answers.  He travelled the country, visited every county and constituency and made every possible promise that could be made.  In my own county of Wexford, he promised many changes to the health services, improvements to Wexford hospital and better mental health services.  He undertook to deal with just about every issue on the cards at the time.  He was the expert in the health service area and had all the answers and solutions.The Minister's promises have not been fulfilled.  The health service is on course to run a deficit of €500 million this year.  This is due to the Minister's failure to prepare a proper budget.  He presented a false Estimate last December, failed to implement necessary legislation on drug pricing and bed designation and his other targets were never achievable.  He got rid of the HSE board, to great fanfare, and we now do not know who is running the health service.  When he got rid of the HSE board I understood the Minister would take over complete control of the HSE.  That is why I was amazed when, last week, he made an attack on the HSE and told it to get its house in order, even though a significant number of directors of the HSE are officials of his own Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Do these officials not follow the same philosophy and ideals as their Ministers?  That cannot be the case, as the Minister is criticising them and asking them to get their house in order.Savings of €124 million in drug payments were envisaged through a new pricing agreement with the industry but pharmacists, doctors and consultants did not think the target was achievable.  The Minister spoke about replacing expensive drugs with generic medicine but I recently read that generic drugs are almost the same price as their branded equivalents.  Perhaps he will clarify how he plans to save €124 million with cheaper drugs because it does not seem to be happening.  He also proposed to increase private income by €144 million, of which €75 million would come from private patients in public beds.  As Deputy Kelleher has pointed out, however, the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Cathal Magee, has indicated that it will not be possible to deliver on this target.  Clearly the Minister was pulling figures out of the sky.  Agency costs were to be reduced by 50% but, again, Mr. Magee has stated that the target is completely unrealistic.  When the Minister and his departmental officials presented their budget last December they put forward figures that nobody in the health service believed could be achieved.People are waiting as long as five years to see a consultant in Waterford and Wexford general hospitals.  The orthodontic service is a shambles and people are waiting years just to be assessed for hip operations, let alone be admitted to Ardkeen or Kilcreene.  There are also significant waiting lists for eye operations.The medical card system is a disaster and Deputies spend a large proportion of their time trying to secure people's rights to cards.  People who are below the income threshold or who previously held cards are now finding it impossible to get medical cards.  In fairness to the staff in the medical cards unit, they are very helpful and respond promptly to our inquiries.  Whether because of a lack of staff or delaying tactics on the part of the Minister, however, medical cards are taking too long to process.  I suspect the delaying tactics come from a desire to save money.I recognise that mental health services are dear to the heart the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and she has been helpful to my own county in providing funding for services.  I ask her whether the €35 million budgeted for mental health services continues to be ring-fenced for this area.  I have been informed by sources within the HSE that it has been suggested in recent days that part of the €35 million investment in mental health services should be diverted to offset overruns in other areas.  I ask her to confirm that the 414 staff promised for mental health services will be recruited at the earliest opportunity.   From what I have been hearing about mental health services in my region, I am concerned that money may be siphoned off for other parts of the health service.  That would be disastrous because, as the Minister of State will be aware, the service has changed significantly in recent years and people have moved with the reforms recommended at national level.  It is important that the process of change is maintained.  The closure of St. Senan's hospital in Enniscorthy became an emotive issue but the ancillary services that have since been put in place are excellent.  We need additional services for the south-east region and, I am sure, the rest of the country.  Mental health services in Waterford need to be upgraded because they are now serving the entire south-east region.  I am sure the Minister of State will fight to ensure the money is ring-fenced.The Minister has spoken about the importance of the fair deal scheme for the elderly in our communities.  I recently received a letter from a nursing home in Wexford which has not admitted a single patient through the fair deal scheme.  It now has seven empty beds but it has been informed by hospital management in Wexford that the funds required to release patients to nursing home care are not available, even though a considerable number have been approved for funding.  This is another broken promise from the Minister.  The fair deal scheme is not working in the south east because the funds have not been made available for it.  The old subvention system worked reasonably well but the fair deal scheme was to be the answer to all the problems in terms of caring for the elderly.  We must continue to fight for the rights of elderly people because the lack of funding has been a bone of contention in the south east for the past two years.  Between eight and ten patients in Wexford hospital could be transferred to nursing homes with vacant beds rather than holding up beds through no fault of their own.  Gorey hospital had eight long stay beds for older people but they are now being transferred to St. John's hospital in Enniscorthy.  St. John's is a new hospital with excellent facilities but it is already overcrowded and the transfer of patients from Gorey means there will be no room for fair deal patients.There are many difficulties in the health service at present and it is important that the Minister comes clean on the issues that have arisen.  The estimates he gave in the budget are clearly incorrect and will never meet the needs of the health service.  He needs to fully explain the reason his budget was underfunded and what he is going to do to provide additional funding.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform is calling for cuts in the running costs of the health service but this can only mean the closure of wards and reductions of services.  In this day and age, that is not good enough.  I ask the Minister to come clean and deal with the issues as quickly as possible.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	487	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"— noting that the Health Service Executive (HSE) is facing a significant challenge in 2012 given the need to set expenditure levels within the parameters of the National Recovery Plan;— acknowledging the significant reductions which the health sector has experienced over the last three years, both budgetary and staffing;— further noting that the HSE has operated the Croke Park Agreement very effectively, with over 3,500 staff redeployed, and a reduction in overall numbers of over 6,000;— further acknowledging that a range of measures are being actively progressed during 2012 to enhance income collection;— commends the Minister for Health for managing within this difficult environment, and at the same time achieving;— a 7% increase in in-patient discharges and a 6% increase in emergency department admissions;— in relation to a basket of 24 procedures, the national target of 75% of cases treated as day cases;— significant improvements in hospital waiting times, with 9,100 fewer patients waiting on trolleys when compared to the same period in 2011, which equates to a 19% year-on-year improvement;— implementation of clinical programmes which saved 70,000 bed days last year, thereby allowing for more patients to be treated more efficiently;— cost reductions within the health sector which are impressive by international standards, particularly within the hospital sector;— 1.8 million people now with medical cards, and 130,000 with GP visit cards;— the passing of legislation to abolish restrictions on GPs wishing to become contractors under the General Medical Services scheme which is now in place;— progress on the preparation of legislation to allow for the extension of free GP care to persons with long term illnesses;— progress in building primary care capacity and in chronic disease management, particularly for the management of diabetes;— significant advances in mental health services in the implementation of A Vision for Change, in particular improved child and adolescent mental health services;— advances in the care of older people, with almost 23,000 clients now supported under the Fair Deal scheme; and— accelerating the type of service delivery reforms that will move to models of care across all service or care groups which treat patients at the lowest level of complexity and provide services at the best possible unit cost; and— welcomes the determination of the Minister and Government to move towards a health system that provides access based on need rather than income, underpinned by a strengthened primary care sector, a restructured hospital sector and a more transparent ‘money follows the patient' system of funding that will be supported ultimately by Universal Health Insurance."I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  As the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform indicated on the publication of the Estimates, the Government has a significant fiscal deficit which needs to be closed.  Our country has suffered the greatest economic crisis in living memory leading to a large fall in Exchequer revenues.  I am sure I do not have to remind the Fianna Fáil Members opposite of the reason that is the case.It is in this challenging context that expenditure plans for 2012 were set and the health sector, as with other sectors, incurred a reduction in the resources allocated to it.  The health service budget has been reduced by €2.5 billion over the last three years.  The number of health service staff has fallen from a peak of 111,000 in 2007 to less than 103,000 now.As we are all too well aware, the country still faces serious challenges in respect of the public finances.  In order to meet the targets agreed with the troika, there will be further reductions in the level of resources allocated to the health sector.The Government faced difficult choices in setting the health Estimate and set, as its priority, the aim to maintain services to the greatest extent possible within the reduced resources available.  The HSE's national service plan was prepared in the context of the challenges faced by the health services this year in terms of reduced staffing levels and a reduced budget, combined with increasing demand for services.It also took account of additional funding being invested this year to critically change the models of care we are providing in areas such as mental health services, primary care, the national clinical care programmes and children's services.  It is not enough to reduce services in order to meet budgets; we must also commit to the radical programme of reform that is set out in the programme for Government.  We can no longer continue with business as usual.  That is simply not a sustainable position.It is clear that the savings targets set for the health service are ambitious, particularly in light of the fact that significant numbers of staff retired under the grace period.  Budget reductions pose a major challenge to the system's ability to maintain services at an acceptable level.  In the six months to the end of February this year, almost 5,000 staff members retired from the health service.  All key services, including maternity, critical care, neonatal and essential social services were maintained without interruption.  That is a significant achievement on behalf of the HSE.  This was facilitated to a large degree by the flexibility provisions in the public service agreement.  In some respects, the response and co-operation of staff went far beyond the terms of the agreement.  I commend and welcome the flexibility and adaptability staff showed during this difficult period.This agreement is a key tool in enabling the health service to respond to these staffing reductions.  Since its inception in 2010, the agreement has helped the health sector to manage the reduction of staff numbers by over 6,000.Another significant success of the Croke Park agreement in the health sector has been the redeployment, to date, of some 3,500 staff within the services.  This number is exclusive of 1,000 staff who transferred to the Department of Social Protection.  Other achievements include an extended working day in hospital laboratory and radiography services, the ongoing revision of rosters at local level and co-operation with clinical care changes in hospitals.It is also clear, however, that further change is required, and at a faster pace, if we are to be able to reduce the impact on front line services.  Therefore the 2012 health sector action plan contains a demanding and relevant set of measures.  These include a comprehensive review of rosters, changes in skill-mix, productivity improvements and a focused approach to reducing sick leave levels.The motion specifically addresses the issue of the drugs bill.  Drugs spending represents 17% of total health expenditure and, clearly, this is not sustainable.  The comparable figure in the UK is 9%.  I would like to set out some of the work that has been under way in this regard.  Significant savings on the drugs budget have already been made in recent years.  Changes in wholesale mark-up paid on medicines, and the introduction of a common sliding dispensing fee across all schemes, along with the reduction of the retail mark-up paid on a number of schemes, resulted in on-going annual savings of approximately €120 million.The Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Community Pharmacy Contractors) Regulations 2011 reduced certain payments made by the HSE to community pharmacy contractors with effect from 20 June 2011, with a further saving of over €34 million.  This included a reduction in wholesale mark-up on drug items from 10% to 8%.  These reforms have contributed to savings in the drugs budget this year along with changes to the threshold of the drugs payment scheme.An interim agreement with the Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association, IPHA, provides €10 million in savings in 2012 through reductions in the price of off-patent medicines.  This agreement is in advance of more substantive discussions to deliver a new agreement and significant price reductions.  It is intended to bring these discussions to a conclusion shortly.I am glad to report to the House that further savings will be achieved later this year through the introduction of the health (pricing and supply of medical goods) Bill 2012, to which Deputy Kelleher and others have referred.  This Bill was approved by the Cabinet this morning and will be published in the coming days.  The Bill was promised a number of years ago, during the term of the last Government, by the then Minister, Mary Harney, but unfortunately little or no progress was made in this regard.The Bill will provide for the introduction of a system of reference pricing and generic substitution for prescribed drugs and medicines, which will lead to savings for taxpayers and patients.  This is a significant development and in the coming years we look forward to making savings in the overall medicines bill and also for individual patients.In addition, a national task force is being established to deal with the prescribing and dispensing of existing medicines.  It will address this from the perspective of quality and patient safety primarily, but it can be anticipated that significant cost savings will result.  By addressing the issue from the perspective of quality and safety, and by working with the leadership of the medical, pharmaceutical and other professions, we have the best means of securing a sustainable means of improving value for money from the State's significant expenditure on prescribed medicines.The task force will be made up of a number of key leaders from the healthcare system and will be chaired by the chief medical officer of the Department of Health.  Its terms of reference will require it to oversee and direct analysis of the extensive information that is held on prescribing patterns through the HSE's primary care reimbursement service.  It will use this information to establish priorities to be addressed concerning quality and patient safety prescribing and to allow that to inform decisions on the nature and scale of interventions that should be undertaken.  These can range from providing advice, guidance and support to prescribers and dispensers to help them to improve prescribing practice, to assessing the suitability of maintaining a supply of certain items with limited efficacy where more appropriate items are available.  The work of this task force will be based primarily on evidence.  The criteria that underpin these decisions will be clear and explicit to everybody working in this area.I understand a preliminary meeting of the group will take place next week and that it is anticipated an executive office to support the very important work of this group will be established as a priority in the HSE so that the committee can be fully functioning before the end of September.I anticipate that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, will in his closing statement to the House tomorrow evening speak about developments in hospital waiting times, the work of the special delivery unit and other issues.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, will speak about the ongoing development of specialised care services and the work under way to improve client experiences in mental health and disability services and care of older people.For my part, I want to report on progress in primary care.  If we are to achieve savings in health spending while also reforming and improving the health services we provide, we must develop new models of care.  As I stated earlier, business as usual is not acceptable.  It is particularly not acceptable in the current climate when there is such pressure on budgets.  We want to ensure that primary care can meet 90-95% of people's health needs and so we must move away from the old hospital-centric model where health care was episodic, reactive, fragmented and expensive.  Through modern and strengthened primary care, we can achieve much better health outcomes and much better value for money.I can assure the House that front line services in the primary care area will not be cut.  I hope Deputy Kelleher heard that.  Primary care services will be significantly strengthened in the coming months.  We recognise the importance of primary care and of switching the focus and orientation away from hospitals to the primary care setting.  An allocation of €20 million set aside in the budget will enable us to recruit some 300 people in the primary care area, including public health nurses, RGNs, occupational, physio and speech and language therapists.  These posts will be allocated to the areas of greatest need, using an objective resource allocation model.  Full details of this allocation will be announced next week.In January, I established the Universal Primary Care Project team to drive implementation of primary care reform.  The projects overseen by the UPC team include policy, planning, costing and legislative preparation for the extension of free GP care, preparation of legislation in respect of which is at an advanced stage; development of implementation plans for chronic disease management in primary care - last week I approved the recruitment of 17 diabetic nurse specialists to commence the roll-out of the diabetes programme; development of a detailed programme of capital investment in primary care centres; preparation for a new GP contract to reflect the programme for Government commitment to universal free GP care and intensive chronic disease management; and preparation of new governance and funding arrangements for primary care, which is well under way.  I assure Members opposite that a great deal of work has been done on preparation for the development of the new directorate within the HSE.  Work on identification of the cohort of staff who will be working under the new directorate and, crucially, on separating out those budgets is ongoing.  For the first time ever, there is a commitment to the establishment of a primary care fund which will enable us to meet the commitment to strengthen primary care.Our health services are essential to the functioning of our society.  Our citizens expect and demand a modern, high quality, safe single-tier health service which guarantees access to care based on need not on ability to pay.  They expect a health service that is continually evolving and improving and delivering services more efficiently, effectively and with fewer staff.  The programme for Government sets out a clear pathway for the future development and strengthening of our services, notwithstanding the enormous financial challenges that this Government inherited.  Despite the challenges posed by reducing resources, this Government has already made significant advances in improving services and delivering on the commitments made in the programme for Government.I urge the House to reject the Opposition's motion and to support the Government as it deals with the challenges it faces by supporting its amendment.

I also welcome the contribution made by the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall and welcome her colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to the House.  The Department of Health is not the prettiest to be assigned to.  I wish to put on the record my admiration for those people who serve in the health services, HSE or Department of health, be that in a political, administrative, departmental, front line, nursing, domestic or other capacity.  It is probably the most stressful place to work from a political or service delivery point of view.There is no doubt but that Deputy John Browne is correct.  There is a lot wrong with our health service.  However, I take issue with him and with Deputies Cowen and Kelleher on one issue.  The problems in the health services in Ireland did not commence last February 12 months.  They have been around for a long time.  Despite 40 minutes of uninterrupted contributions from the Opposition benches they did not offer a single solution, which says a great deal about where Fianna Fáil as a political party is placing itself on its road to redemption.  All they did was crib and moan.  I know that Fianna Fáil is in a race to the bottom with the political party sitting to its right.  However, as a party trying to restructure itself on the political landscape in Ireland it should, rather than continually whinging from the sideline take some responsibility for what it did to the health services, admit it was wrong and be supportive of Government which is trying to fix the problem.I wish to raise two issues with the Minister of State.  I am glad both Ministers of State are in the House because this issue is relevant to both.  The first issue relates to young adults with an intellectual disability who have been receiving letters during the past couple of days in regard to whether they have school places going forward.  I am sure every Member of this House has received representations on this issue in the recent past.  I was visited at my clinic last Saturday by parents of a child with an intellectual disability who are concerned about who will care for her when they are gone.  I urge and implore the Ministers of State and Minister to engage with the voluntary bodies charged with providing services for young intellectually challenged adults to ensure there are places for them when the school year recommences next September.I have previously stated in this House when speaking on education issues that I believe now is the time for this country to engage in a new model of social partnership.  By this I mean not the model of social partnership that involves calling people in late at night to Government Buildings and asking them how much of the cake they want but the model of calling in all of the stakeholders, be they nurses, domestic staff, parents, service providers in the voluntary sector, HSE or Department of Health officials, and informing them of the amount which has been voted through by the Oireachtas for the next year for, say, education, health, defence or justice and asking them how they propose to spend it, what they see as the priorities in their area and, more important, the areas where potential savings could be made.  I agree with the Minister of State that we cannot continue with business as usual.  We have a depleting budget going forward.  I implore officials in the Department of Health, together with their colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills and the voluntary service providers, to sit down together over the next six weeks to ensure young intellectually challenged adults of 18 years are not discharged from school, leaving their parents, many of whom are elderly, wondering who will look after them when they are gone.  I compliment all of the work already done in this area.  The brother of one Deputy once referred to the Department of Health as "Angola", on which I would probably agree with him.  I applaud anybody who is trying to deliver real change in the health services, including the nurses at the side of the bed or the Ministers of State present this evening.  Their hearts are in the right place and I compliment them on the work they have done.  However, I urge them to engage, for God's sake, with the service providers and stakeholders at all levels of the health service in order to achieve better value.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this issue, which is of intense interest and importance to every citizen.  An overrun in the HSE budget is nothing new, but this one is disturbing for us all.  While I welcome the opportunity to debate the issue, I am disappointed in the wording of the motion which raises a very legitimate issue but offers no solution.  It takes the easy option of demanding that services be maintained regardless of the overrun.  All of us wish that services could be maintained but the issue is achieving it.  The clear absence of any management structure when setting up the HSE was disastrous and it has dogged it ever since.  It merely introduced a layer of management on top of the layer of management that existed for the health boards.  It has struggled ever since as a result of that fateful decision.  To this day governance in the HSE is problematic as is administration.  Legislative change in the past few months, as mentioned in the motion, was not going to prevent a deficit emerging right now.  Despite putting enormous amounts of taxpayers' money into the health system there is widespread dissatisfaction with delivery and regardless of what is often said about it outcomes are not up to international norms except in very limited areas.A lack of money is not the problem nor is it the quality of personnel in the system.  However, the management is a major problem.  Management of something as vast, pervasive and complex as a health service is highly problematic and requires a management system with a clear line of command and responsibility that is second to none and we just do not have that.  Most of the money goes into the hospital and that is where the problem is particularly obvious.  I recently had occasion to visit a patient in what is regarded as one of our top hospitals.  My observation of procedures and practices - medical and otherwise - were more than disturbing.  In one example I observed a patient in a bed being moved to a different ward so the area had to be cleaned.  On a Saturday afternoon I sat there and watched as three different cleaners came to clean the area - they all did exactly the same work and left again.  While it is a very small thing it reflects the absence of anybody in charge and taking responsibility for management at ward level.  Nobody is responsible for cost containment.  As that was a Saturday afternoon, I presume the cleaners were not on normal rates of pay but on a higher rate.  I do not blame the cleaners but management.  How could that happen in a hospital where budgets were stretched?I will not go into the other inappropriate and wasteful use of devices and the ordering policy.  The point is that hospitals absorb a huge amount of budgets and without really strong management in hospitals we will continue to have these problems.  I will not go into the issue of consultants and the management of patient care, which is also of concern.Another area of concern is the area of medicines.  Approximately €2 billion is spent annually on medicines and this is rising at an alarming 9%.  While some reduction has been achieved the pharmaceutical industry must do better and come to the table in order to provide savings to the State, just as the State has responded to its concerns that we would support innovation and purchase of new and expensive drugs.  The reduced prescription charges introduced by the two pharmacy groups is very welcome and I hope the competitive pressure will see this trend continuing and secure further savings for the State and private citizens.I raised the issue of disabled school-leavers some months ago and I realised that it would only become obvious at this time of year.  As able-bodied school-leavers are moving on and looking forward to new educational opportunities, holidays and trips abroad, disabled school-leavers are being sent letters to be informed that there is probably no service for many of them.  I understand there is less money for everything but it cannot be that there is no money for some of these children.  Every one of these children is entitled to some kind of service plan.  Their parents who have done everything for them up to the age of 18 are getting old themselves and are beginning to worry about the future.  They see other children having every opportunity while they have none.  We cannot throw these children on the scrapheap of life now.  I will not stand by silently if every one of these children leaving school at 18 is not provided with a day-care plan.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I support the sentiments of the Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, that it would be wonderful to be in this Department at a time of full and plenty with the country awash with money.  God knows, there were times when the Government was hard-pressed to know what to do with it.  We are in an entirely different space now and we are trying to ensure the front-line health services both within the acute hospitals and in the community are delivered in a more efficient and effective manner.  That the country is virtually bankrupt is not and never was as a result of people needing a health service but of gross mismanagement by the previous Government, and Opposition Deputies should keep that in mind.The Health Service Executive's national service plan for 2012 acknowledges that there will be an inevitable and unavoidable reduction in services this year because of the scale of the financial and staffing challenges facing the health service.  However, it also outlines the various actions that will be taken to mitigate as far as possible the impact the budget and staff cuts would otherwise have on services.  In framing the plan, the HSE was asked to avoid across-the-board cuts in budgets and to ensure that reductions in budgets should not lead to a corresponding reduction in services.  This is in line with the objectives of the Government's health reform programme to prioritise our services in a way that supports those in greatest need.I wish to address the areas of the health sector for which I have responsibility, namely disability, mental health and older people services.  In excess of €1.4 billion will be spent on specialist disability services in 2012.  The national service plan provides for a 3.7% reduction in budgets, but makes it clear that there is scope for achieving efficiencies of 2% or more through measures such as consolidation and rationalisation of back-office costs.  That is not as easy as it sounds.  Some organisations have already introduced all those efficiencies, as we are well aware.  It is not something that can be said in a glib or off-hand manner.  Organisations delivering disability services have done an exceptional job this year.I wish to answer some of the points about school-leavers made by many contributors, including the last contributor.  We started off with a figure of approximately 700 school-leavers - young men and women who happen to have a disability.The number in this respect has not settled but we estimate that 180 people will be in need of a day place.  I congratulate the disability services in the HSE and the organisations which have made room and managed to find space to provide for people who needed a service without it costing the Government any additional money.  There will be no additional money in terms of provision having regard to demographics but we must ensure, and I am not certain that it can be done by way of threat, that people who are most vulnerable and in greatest need will have a service and we will continue to work on that on a daily basis.Deputy Browne asked me the other day if I still had the €35 million allocation for mental health services.  I would love to think that I had it personally but we have that funding.  The posts which will be necessary to bring mental health services into the community and to strengthen the community mental health teams will be put in place this September.  I congratulate the people in the Deputy's constituency of Wexford and the people of Waterford on the tremendous job they have done in driving that service forward and being courageous in doing that under some pressure.  We have had the assistance of the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, who insisted on the retention of the €35 million allocation, and there is also the promise in the programme for the Government's in regard to mental health.We will publish a carer's strategy next week to provide not only for older people because carers comes in all shapes and sizes; sometimes they are very young and sometimes they are elderly.  We will publish a dementia strategy  in 2013.  The review group and public consultation on that is being put together as we speak.The allocation of €1.4 billion for the fair deal scheme is ring-fenced.  I was amazed to hear there are difficulties in some areas because I inquired about the scheme only this morning and was told there was no waiting list.  How we treat our elderly people cannot be only about nursing home or long-stay provision; it must be about far more than that.  It must be about ensuring that we all live and die where we wish to be, namely, in our own communities.

Go raibh maith agat.I hope the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, takes the opportunity tomorrow or on Thursday to come into the Dáil to address the very serious questions that have been raised concerning his involvement in the private nursing home sector.  That involvement raises issues of conflict of interest and his suitability to take decisions regarding public and private nursing home care.  This is directly relevant to the motion before us and the issue of health care funding and health care services.Between January and May this year, 296 public residential care beds were shut by the Government and the Department of Health does not have a way of identifying the number of beds opened or closed in the private sector in the same period.  There are more than 600 public hospital beds occupied by people whose treatment is complete but whose discharge is delayed, mainly because they are older people and there are no care home places or step-down facilities for them.  With care home beds being closed and acute hospital beds also closed - more than 2,400 at present - the system is being contracted at both ends.  Clearly, the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and his colleagues are continuing the failure of their predecessors and are driving the health service into deeper crisis.It would be laughable if it were not so tragic that at this mid-point of 2012 we have a renewed panic within Government about the so-called spending over-run in the health budget.  This was utterly predictable because the amount of money cut from the health budget for 2012 was totally unsustainable.  We are told that the over-run for the year to the end of May 2012 was €280 million.  It is no surprise that the HSE has exceeded its 2012 budget to this extent because, as we and many others have warned, the cuts imposed on health spending in budget 2012 simply cannot be sustained without the virtual collapse of services.Some €750 million was taken out of health in the Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition Government's budget 2012.  Now the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, is predicting that the over-run for 2012 will be €500 million.  A total of €1 billion was taken out of health spending in 2011 and the Department of Health is talking about an overall reduction of €2 billion up to 2014.  This is totally unsustainable without devastating already struggling front line services.Last month we had the leaked correspondence from the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to the Minister, Deputy Reilly, on the over-run in health spending, apparently a public airing of the usual pre-budget manoeuvring within Government.  We also had attempts to link the health funding crisis with the Croke Park agreement.  The funding crisis in the public health services has its source in fundamentally flawed Government policy and not in the Croke Park agreement.  We are seeing an effort to target the pay of people working in the health services as part of the austerity drive.  If implemented, such pay cuts would be imposed alongside cuts in services for patients, not instead of them as the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has pretended.The continuing recruitment embargo is a false economy as it has led to increased use of expensive agency staff and to more overtime working by existing staff.  The Croke Park agreement provides for flexible working and this should be used to the maximum.  Due to the continuing cuts and the recruitment embargo, staff are under severe pressure but have shown flexibility.  One of the main drivers of costs in the health services is not the Croke Park agreement but the consultants' contracts, which keep pay for top earners in the health service at excessive levels and perpetuates the two-tier system with many consultants continuing to benefit from both the public and private sectors.Alongside the reports of the €280 million over-run last weekend, we had speculation that the €35 million allocation for mental health services this year would be targeted to fill gaps elsewhere.  Any such move would be scandalous and should be strongly resisted, and I depend on the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, to do that.  Only last week, on 4 July in this Chamber, she told us: "I listened to Deputy asking where was the €35 million and metaphorically, it is in my back pocket. [The Minister of State will remember saying that and I remember her saying that very well.] I still have the money, it still exists and it remains within the Department."  I would ask her to give it a tap to make sure it is still there.  I hope the Minister of State and her Cabinet colleagues ensure that funding remains in place and that it is allocated as agreed and as promised for mental health services in this State where it is so badly needed.As we address this latest funding crisis in health, we are still in the dark about the Government's plans for major health care reform.  The Minister, Deputy Reilly, and his colleagues have repeatedly told us that they are moving towards universal health insurance and a "money follows the patient" model of funding, but beyond these endlessly repeated headlines we have been given little detail of how these far-reaching changes are going to be achieved and how exactly they will work.  One thing is certain, this system will not be based on the public service model of health care delivery.  The emphasis will be on the purchase of services in both the private and the public health sector by health insurance companies.  There is nothing to indicate that the two-tier public-private system will be dismantled.The Minister has spoken of a single waiting list but, again, we have no detail about how this will work.  For example, will hospital consultants still be able to work in and profit handsomely from both the public and the private systems?  If not, then new consultants' contracts will be required.  If there is to be a new and better way of working for consultants, and there certainly should be, then work on the new contracts would need to begin now to prepare for the throughput of new consultants coming into the system in the years ahead.  We have also been told that hospitals will be grouped and that hospital trusts will be formed.  Again, we have been given no detail.  What guarantee do we have that this will not be yet more bureaucratic change?At last month's quarterly meeting of the Joint Committee on Health and Children with the Minister and the CEO of the HSE, both of them painted a bleak picture of a health service in the midst of a deep economic recession.  Billions of euros are being taken out of the health service budget.  I have described this as austerity in action.  One cannot take €2.5 billion out of the health service budget in the last three years and not seriously affect front line care of patients.  This is admitted in the HSE 2012 service plan.  This is the result of the fundamentally flawed economic strategy of this Government.  At the Joint Committee on Health and Children I asked about the Minister's intention to take more billions out of the health budget.  The Department of Health statement of strategy 2011-2014 states:...total current expenditure for the public health service is being reduced by nearly €1.1 billion in nominal terms over the period 2011-2014 under the National Recovery Plan.  However, in order to meet unavoidable pressures and Government commitments, in excess of €2 billion will have to be taken out of the health budget over the same period.As my questions were not answered at the committee, I ask the Minister again, or any Minister who cares to respond in the course of this debate tonight and tomorrow night, for clarity on these figures.The Minister stated that €2.5 billion was taken out over the past three years.  His Department's strategy speaks of €1.1 billion in nominal terms, 2011 to 2014 and in excess of €2 billion over the same period.  How does this translate in terms of 2013 and 2014?  It is a very confusing picture.  How many more billions of euro have to be taken out to meet what the strategy calls, "Government commitments"?  I have to understand those Government commitments to mean bank bondholders' losses and other debts not incurred by the people.  The Minister has repeatedly spoken of maximising the use of resources, including the skills and the time of health professionals.  How does he reconcile this with the type of so-called savings being made now?  For example, in Cavan General Hospital in my constituency, it is proposed to run the operating theatre on a week-on, week-off basis.  Staff believe this will not make the targeted savings because it will mean more work done out of hours during the theatre's working week and that it will increase waiting lists.  Undoubtedly it will.  A fully equipped operating theatre will only be used at 50% of capacity, apart from emergencies.  How does that make sense?  I call on the Minister again to intervene to put a stop to this regressive and counter-productive cut.Savings can be made in our health services by charging the real cost for the use of private beds in public hospitals, by targeting the excessive salaries of the highest earners in the health sector and by reducing the cost of medicines, where little progress has been made.  This is recognised in the motion and Sinn Féin will support the motion in the name of the Fianna Fáil Deputies.  However, it has to be recognised that, overall, the crisis in health spending is a product of the failed austerity strategy of the Fine Gael-Labour coalition and it cannot and will not be fully and properly addressed until that futile strategy is changed.  I am under no illusion that this futile strategy is fully supported by Fianna Fáil and so its promotion of this motion is an example of double-standards.
#MichaelColreavy	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-party	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-dob	unknown-#MichaelColreavy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I welcome the motion but I, too, took a double take when I saw who was proposing it, given it was Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats which were first to take a very sharp scalpel to the health services.  I have notes for my contribution but I will ignore them.  I will start instead with some good news.  The endoscopy unit at Sligo Regional Hospital has achieved level one accreditation from the Royal College of Physicians in London.  This is an excellent achievement and I commend the staff and everyone involved with that achievement.  It shows what can be done if a staff and a good hospital are given half a chance.  Sligo Regional Hospital is only the second hospital in the country to receive this level of achievement.  It demonstrates the standard of excellence for patients in the endoscopy department of the hospital.I wish to contrast this achievement and the pride of the staff in that achievement with the situation of breast cancer services.  Before the election, this Government promised the breast cancer services would be restored to Sligo.  The service was taken away by the Fianna Fáil-PD Government and it has not been restored.  Promises have not been kept.  A bus to Galway was provided in place of the restoration of breast cancer services.A specialist stroke unit is badly needed in Sligo Regional Hospital, including a catheterisation laboratory but there has been nothing yet.  A previous speaker from this side of the House said there was no suggestion made as to how matters could be improved within the current straitened economic situation.  The Government needs to look at how much potential productive time, particularly of surgeons who are well-paid consultants, is not being used in theatre because there are not sufficient theatre staff.  Lists are growing longer and well-paid consultants are not working, I would argue, to anything near their full productive potential.  This situation needs to be examined urgently.It seems to me that in this House we are engaged in an unspoken process of slimming down health services to make them a more attractive proposition for some form of privatisation.  I do not know what that form is but I am very suspicious of it.A man came to me yesterday.  He said he had an appointment in St. Vincent's hospital in Dublin for a post-operative check-up.  He had previously travelled on a HSE bus from Sligo to the clinic in Dublin and back again to Sligo.  He was told on Friday when he rang to inquire about the bus time that the bus had been withdrawn.  He had no knowledge of the withdrawal prior to his call.  He would have to make his own way to Dublin but this was a man who had never set foot in Dublin apart from walking from the minibus to the hospital for his surgery.  I rang St. Vincent's hospital and they were excellent.  They arranged a later appointment for him.  I took him to Dublin and brought him to St. Vincent's where he was treated in the outpatients' department.  I took him to the station and ensured he got on the train for Sligo.  This was his first time on a train.  It is disgraceful that this man did not know until he made an inquiry last Friday that his mode of transport had been withdrawn.

I will devote my short speaking time to one particular aspect which is also of importance to the Minister of State, the mental health sector.  I refer to the startling statistics about the number of people with mental health issues and the very insignificant level of funding in this area.  Last week, the cross-party group on mental health raised a Topical Issue Matter on mental health with the Minister of State.  We raised three questions, on the status of the €35 million that had been committed for community mental health services; the date of the appointment of a director; and the commitment on the ring-fencing of staff numbers.  It was a good debate and we had a good engagement with the Minister of State.  She referred to the gap analysis which she had been seeking to indicate the posts needed such as social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists and the location of the nursing posts.  She gave the impression there would be positive moves.  We did not get an answer on the question about the director but the Minister of State provided information on the posts and the funding of €35 million.  It was alarming to read in the newspapers that health spending is facing big cuts as the financial deficit hits €280 million, possibly €500 million and that there would be a review of expenditure across all headings.  Most alarming is the suggestion that parts of the €35 million for mental health services would be used to offset the overruns.  I ask the Minister of State to assure me on this point.  There is a dire need to move on A Vision for Change so that it becomes a reality.  I refer to my recent parliamentary question to the Minister of State on the matter of the parents of an 18 year-old son with intellectual disability who relies on services from the HSE through the Brothers of Charity and these have been affected by the cuts.  There is a need for appropriate services for people with intellectual disabilities who leave school.  The HSE has identified approximately 650 school-leavers who will require services in 2012.The issue of drugs made the headlines at the weekend because of events in the Phoenix Park.  We know the problems of polydrug use and alcohol and yet the funding is being cut to the drugs task force projects and they are left in dire straits when dealing with those issues.

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I compliment Deputy Kelleher for tabling this motion.  Some have regarded this motion as a bit of a cheek coming from Fianna Fáil.  This Government is almost 18 months in office and we have nothing but broken promises.  I do not blame the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, because she has made a decent effort to ring-fence the money in the mental health area and to do other things.  However, there has been one broken promise after another.  I did not even read the Government's proposed amendment to the motion because it is not worth the paper on which it is written.  It is nothing but blunder and bluster from the Minister.  He promised so much and made so many commitments, in writing and otherwise.  He had experience.  He negotiated the Irish Medical Organisation, IMO, contract with the former Minister, former Deputy Mary Harney.  He is a medical doctor and as a medical professional is more qualified and eminent to speak on medical matters than me.  Other than that, however, he is a cowboy acting as if the rest of us are Indians.  I mean that and I hope it is not offensive language.  He is just a chancer as far as I am concerned with regard to what is happening in the health sector.

We have been under siege.  What Deputy Colreavy described is happening throughout the country.  Unfortunate people from rural areas and elsewhere are being thrown to the wolves by a system that is out of control, that is not fit for purpose and which the Minister said he would dismantle.  The former taoisigh, former Deputy Bertie Ahern and former Deputy Brian Cowen, and the former Minister, former Deputy Dermot Ahern, agreed, as I know from being involved with the party at the time, that the HSE should be disbanded because it was out of control.  That was a few years ago.The Minister took away duties from the board but the board is still there and still making demands.  I and Deputy Seamus Healy had a Topical Issue debate recently in the House about the waiting list in Clonmel but the only response I received was jargon about bed managers, ward managers and other managers.  When there were matrons in the hospitals there were none of these managers and we had clean healthy hospitals that were accessible.  Now we have hoards of pen pushers and people with letters after their names.  It is a system of self-serving people, rather than a system that serves the public.  These people have big wages and big job titles but many of them are doing nothing aside from adding to the problems and creating more problems.  Nobody can touch them or take them on.  Somebody needs to call time on those people.The front-line services are being attacked and are under siege.  The self-serving people that are in charge are destroying the health service we had, such as the accountability the ordinary members had on the health boards.  It is time we got back to serving and looking after people with dignity and respect, not leaving them on corridors, removing services from them and frightening them from making complaints.  It is outrageous.

In page 8, to delete lines 33 to 37.Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar an dá leasú eile.  I understand why amendments are ruled out of order.  Generally, it is to ensure there is no extra cost to the State.  However, the reason we are here is to provide micro finance to small emerging businesses, who are desperately in need of this oxygen to survive and grow.  Every Member of the House is convinced about this and that the amount of money necessary is much larger than €10 million.  In amendment No. 1, I replaced the figure with the phrase "an amount to be determined by the Minister".  In amendment No. 2, I sought to delete the figure of €15 million and to substitute "an amount to be determined by the Minister".  Surely "an amount to be determined by the Minister" does not in itself incur an extra cost on the State.  It is a great disappointment because we went as far as we could to ensure it would not put a cost on the State but would leave the door open to the Minister, in his judgment, to deal with increased demand in the future.

I will speak to all of the amendments if necessary because all the surviving amendments deal with the same issue, the governance of the micro finance fund.Section 12 deals with the governance.  During the debate with the Minister on Committee Stage I asked him what would be the cost benefit analysis of the Minister providing a vehicle, of which he would have direct control, for this micro finance fund.  The worry we communicated very strongly on Committee Stage was that the governance of this vehicle was at arm's length from the Minister and we asked for a cost benefit analysis of that.  The Minister said he would deliver a cost benefit analysis, that is, a compare and contrast exercise for a different type of vehicle to be used from the one proposed in the Bill.  Microfinance Ireland is accountable to Social Finance Foundation, SFF, including for the appointment of the board.  While the Minister has some oversight, due to company law he will not have tight control over the organisation.We also asked what would the difference be for SFF to move from a wholesaler within a sector to a retailer within a sector and how that would change the sector itself.  I am not sure if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would prefer me to speak to the amendments individually or to all of them together.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21667	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	507	We debated these issues on Committee Stage.  Before discussing amendment No. 3, I wish to clarify a point.  In case Deputy Tóibín believes there is just €10 million available for lending from this fund, the sum of €10 million is the equity going into the micro finance fund from the Department's budget.  That is the equity on which borrowings of up to €25 million can be leveraged.  In addition, the capacity to provide an additional €15 million in equity is permitted under the legislation.  As we discussed on Committee Stage, the capacity of this fund, which is €10 million in equity and a maximum of €25 million in lending, is to lend an estimated €40 million over the next few years.  The additional equity would allow for leverage up to the €100 million target we have set overall.While I understand Deputy Tóibín's anxiety that micro finance play an important part, we have conducted much analysis of the level of demand for this type of lending vehicle and we are satisfied, on the basis of the assessment, that this will meet all the needs.  However, considerable headroom has been built in so even if demand exceeds our expectation, there is plenty of headroom under the legislation.  The advantage from the point of view of this House is that we will have to come to the House to secure its permission to increase the equity and Members of the House will have an opportunity to examine the success of the scheme.  It is not bureaucracy but striking a balance between the two.  While I understand what the Deputy is trying to do, I believe this is fair, reasonable and based on good practice in the House.Amendment No. 3 is probably not adequate to achieve what the Deputy desires.  The purpose of section 12 is to set out the name of the subsidiary and identify its share capital and ownership.  Sections 3 and 4 list the share capital of the subsidiary as €1, which will be issued to Social Finance Foundation.  It is indicated that the share capital cannot be revised without the consent of the Minister.  The amendment seeks to remove the limitation on the share capital and the inalienability of the share.  It offers no alternative structure for the subsidiary and the intent of the amendment is not clear.As I understand it, the Deputy is concerned the Minister will not have sufficient belt-and-braces control over the operation of the fund.  The Deputy proposes a fully fledged State-sponsored body.  In the time available, the costs and benefits could not be detailed in a comprehensive paper.  There are really no great benefits and only costs arise from the Deputy's proposal.  What he proposes would require a full-time, permanent staff and executive.  We would have to commit to pay and pensions in respect of the positions if they were created under a fully fledged statutory State body appointed by the Minister.  It would be a much more inflexible tool and would be much more costly to put in place.The Deputy asked whether the Minister would have sufficient controls to ensure the board will act in accordance with public policy and not go on a solo run.  I can provide him with assurance.  The board will be appointed by the board of Social Finance Foundation but following consultation with the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The board will consist of key stakeholders, including the Social Finance Foundation, the banks, the county enterprise boards or local enterprise offices, First Step Microfinance and other appropriate organisations.  The board will have experience in micro-finance.  It will meet quarterly and will provide regular updates on progress to the Minister.  It will publish annual reports, which will be available to the Houses.  Financial statements will be laid before the Oireachtas and there will be an audit and risk committee to oversee performance.  There will be a credit committee.The body's memorandum and articles of association will set out its remit and this will be a published document.  The scheme I will be laying before the Houses will be the one in accordance with which the body will be delivering services.  The body will be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, as with every other State body.  The due diligence of the European Investment Fund in respect of micro-finance agencies will apply.  Deputy Tóibín is very keen that we draw on this.  We have been drawing on it only to a limited extent to date under First Step Microfinance.  There will be a due diligence procedure protecting the relevant moneys, including those of the State.  We have committed ourselves to an internal review and to publishing a review after two years.  The body will be subject to ethics in public office and freedom of information legislation.All the reasonable controls that one could expect for a body are being put in place.  The heavy commitment and governance involved with the setting up of a quango do not arise.  What I propose is a more flexible way of responding to the need.  Given the list of controls, I believe the Deputy can be satisfied the new body will stick to its remit.  Its representatives will be happy to appear before the committee, of which the Deputy is a member, to account for its stewardship.  We are meeting the needs about which the Deputy has rightly raised concern.

In page 9, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:"(4) The chairperson and board of directors of the subsidiary will be appointed by the Minister.".Roughly the same points apply in this regard.  On Committee Stage, the point was made well that the regulatory impact analysis indicated the chairman of the Social Finance Foundation subsidiary would be appointed by the Minister; this will not be the case.  There is no need for me to dwell on it any longer.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21667	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The vehicle we chose to establish is one that seeks to lean on the established experience of Social Finance Foundation.  It was designed to be in operation in conjunction with the scheme as quickly as possible using the established experienced network.  Social Finance Foundation has constituted an established network and had been channelling money to First Step Microfinance.  It has experience in this space.  The new body is being established as a subsidiary, which minimises costs and maximises the assembled experience.The appointment is to be by Social Finance Foundation, which sets up the subsidiary. De facto, it is controlled by the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, subject to the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is intended the members of the board will have relevant experience in micro-finance, thus making the facility a success.  It would be fully accountable in the way I described.  We cannot accept the amendment but, because of the way in which the facility is being established, we are meeting all the Deputy’s concerns.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21667	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I thank the Deputies, particularly Deputy Tóibín, who has been present for all Stages.  I believe the initiative has cross-party support.  It is filling a gap that other countries have filled long before us.  The Deputy, to be fair to him, has been advocating this measure for a considerable period.  It was considered many times but we have succeeded in getting it across the line.  I thank all my officials who have helped and I thank the other Departments who have co-operated in getting the legislation to this point.  I certainly hope it will be a success.  I assure Deputy Peadar Tóibin and Deputy O'Dea that we will make the body accountable to the committee so we can draw on the experience of Deputies at local level to ensure this will work as we hope.

We probably differ on two issues, the first of which is the ambition of the project, bearing in mind that we understand the Government is under financial pressure and that it seeks to protect the taxpayer, as we do, from exposure.Given the 14.9% unemployment rate, the number of businesses that collapse everyday, the number of start-ups that cannot even get off the ground - the stillborn start-ups, as it were - the many entrepreneurs who must continue their activities outside of this jurisdiction and the nearly 200,000 people who are long-term unemployed, the Government needs to be more ambitious in its investments, in making credit and grant funding available to businesses and in the programmes and job activation processes that it offers to businesses.We welcome this initiative.  As the Minister stated several times, the efforts made to date have not been successful.  In the round, this initiative is positive.  The EU presents the State with many opportunities.  We are a pro-European party and it is important that Ireland take full advantage of funds, for example, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, EGF, and the European progress microfinance facility.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 35 together.Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the HSE to form a view in relation to each person leaving care as to whether there is a "need for assistance" and if it forms such a view, to provide services in accordance with the legislation and subject to resources.All young people who have had a care history with the HSE, be it foster care, residential care or high support, are entitled to an aftercare service based on their assessed needs. The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years to 21 years. The HSE policy allows for this to be extended up to the age of 23 years of age on the basis of a need for assistance.The basis of an aftercare service is an individual assessment of each young person's need in the months before their 18th birthday. An individual holistic needs assessment identifies a young person's need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education.  The level of support required will vary for each individual from advice to accommodation to further education, employment or training and social support.The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training and social support. The most vulnerable group of young people leaving care are those that have dropped out of education and training and those that have left residential care. Some of these young people may have mental health problems or a disability.  Aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical support. It is essential that all young people leaving care are provided with the type of transitional support that their individual situation requires. The provision of an appropriate aftercare service has been highlighted as a key element to achieving positive outcomes for young people leaving care.Some 90% of children in care are in foster care and a large number of these remain living with their foster families, supported financially by the HSE, on reaching 18 years of age. These young people continue in education and training as planned. This remains a key component of aftercare for young people when they leave care.The HSE National Aftercare Service is underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document which has been developed in cooperation with the key stakeholders, including the voluntary sector agencies involved in aftercare provision and my Department. The policy which was finalised in April 2011, commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people. The HSE has established an intra-agency National Aftercare Implementation Group to monitor progress in implementing the national policy and their work is ongoing.Clearly, there has been a lot of progress in the provision of aftercare services and more young people are receiving a service. The HSE has advised me that there were 1,310 young people in receipt of aftercare at the end of May 2012, compared to 847 young people in 2009. The implementation of the policy and the ongoing provision of aftercare services are being kept under review and I will continue to engage with the HSE on this matter over the course of the year. In addition, I recently had further discussions with the Attorney General regarding strengthening the legislative approach to aftercare and I believe that the law can be strengthened. It is my intention to seek to bring forward legislative proposals in this regard later this year.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 44 together.The Programme for Government 2011-2016 states that the Referendum on Children's Rights is a priority, and that the wording of the proposed referendum will be along the lines of that proposed by the All Party Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children (JCCAC).Both myself and officials of my Department have engaged extensively with the Attorney General and her officials to formulate a draft wording for the proposed constitutional amendment. Contact in that regard is ongoing and, as part of normal process, will involve consultations across the relevant departments in advance of presentation of a proposed wording to Government for consideration.Integral to the passing of the proposed amendment will be a change as regards adoption law in the position of children of marriage and married parents. To ensure that the public are fully informed of the nature of the proposal, and the consequences of approving it, the proposed amending legislation in the area of adoption will be published along with the wording of the amendment. Publication of the Referendum Bill will have regard to the need to allow an appropriate period of time for the proposal to be fully debated and considered.While the Government has yet to consider the matter of the precise referendum date, it has already decided that it will take place later this year and will be held on a standalone basis. The significant and complex work currently being done is geared towards this timeline and objective.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I am pleased to inform the Deputy that towards the end of 2011, following discussions at Ministerial and Official level and in consultation with the Attorney General, it was agreed that certain youth justice functions would transfer from my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality to myself as the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. Advices were received from the Office of the Attorney General in relation to the legislative mechanism to be used to effect such a transfer.  It was agreed that responsibility for the Children Act, 2001 would be shared between my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality. The position is that:—The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is responsible for the Children Detention Schools at Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin which provide detention places to the Courts for girls less than 18 years old and boys less than 17 years old ordered to be remanded or committed on criminal charges;The Minister for Justice and Equality retains responsibility for all aspects of the Children Act related to crime detection (including anti-social behaviour), diversion, prosecution, court proceedings, community sanctions, age of criminal responsibility. The Minister also retains responsibility for dealings with An Garda Síochána and the Probation Service.The formal transfer of statutory responsibility came into effect on 1 January, 2012 on foot of an Order of the Taoiseach by Statutory Instrument (S.I. No. 668 of 2011).The staff of the Irish Youth Justice Service (IYJS) moved to my Department in November 2011 in anticipation of the transfer of functions. With effect from 1st January, 2012, the IYJS is staffed by officials from both the Department of Justice and Equality and my Department. This is a practical example of this Government's commitment to explore new and more flexible ways of working effectively to achieve cross-departmental collaborations.The IYJS will develop a National Youth Justice Action Plan later this year which will sit within the Children and Young People's Policy Framework currently being developed in my Department but will also form part of the National Anti-Crime Strategy being developed as part of the draft White Paper on Crime being finalised by Minister Shatter.I am very pleased that the practice of sending 16 year olds to St. Patrick's Institution has been ended. I made an order by Statutory Instrument (S.I. No. 136 of 2012) that, with effect from 1st May 2012, all newly remanded or sentenced 16 year olds are being detained in the children's detention facilities at Oberstown. On 2nd April 2012, I also announced that capital funding of approximately €50 million over three years has been secured to develop new and expanded facilities at the children detention schools at Oberstown in Lusk, Co. Dublin so that, within two years, all those under 18 who need to be detained will be sent to dedicated child-specific facilities on the Oberstown campus.I can also inform the Deputy that, in conjunction with my colleague Alan Shatter TD, Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, I have made an Order by Statutory Instrument (S.I. No. 210 of 2012) which extends the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to consider complaints by and on behalf of children detained in St. Patrick's Institution.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	516	The Hague Convention on Inter-country Adoption entered into force in Ireland on 1 November 2010 with the enactment of the Adoption Act 2010 and the establishment of the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI). Therefore, since then, adoptions have been ongoing from Hague contracted countries and 35 such adoptions have taken place in the period 1 January 2011 to end June 2012.Under section 72 of the Adoption Act 2010, the Adoption Authority may enter into administrative arrangements with another contracting State. An administrative arrangement is not mandatory for inter-country adoption between countries that are both signatories to Hague.  However some contracting states, including Ireland, may determine that in some instances co-operation in the field of inter-country adoption between particular countries is best served by the development of an administrative agreement under Section 72 of the Act.The Adoption Authority is working to establish administrative arrangements with a number of Hague countries in relation to inter-country adoptions, as provided for under section 72 of the Adoption Act 2010. The Authority has travelled to a number of jurisdictions in order to make contact with the Central Authorities, advise of our processes and procedures, assess the need for additional administrative arrangements or agreements; and to glean as much information as possible of relevance to prospective adopters from those countries. The visits also provide opportunities to streamline processes on both sides and obtain up-to-date information for prospective adopters on developments in these countries. The most recent engagements by the AAI with its counterpart Central Authorities include:positive discussions in that regard which recently took place between the Adoption Authority of Ireland and a visiting delegation of senior officials from the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, which is a Hague signatory. The discussions lead to finalisation on the contents of administrative arrangements for the resumption of adoptions between Ireland and Vietnam.  I have invited the Vietnamese Minister for Justice, Mr. Ha Hung Cuong, to visit Ireland in September at which point I expect that the agreement setting out the administrative arrangements will be signed by the two Central Authorities.A delegation from the Adoption Authority travelled to New Delhi, India, on 18th June 2012 to discuss adoption arrangements between the Adoption Authority and CARA, the Indian Central Authority. I understand the Authority is considering the report from this visit.With the help of the Irish Embassy in Moscow, the AAI has had a response to its earlier communications from the adoption authorities in Kazakhstan on the issue of inter-country adoptions and is proposing to meet the authorities in Kazakhstan.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	517	The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) seeks to proactively engage with its counterparts in countries identified for inter-country adoption purposes, including Kazakhstan. While direct contact and diplomatic channels are used to promote such contact, the success of these efforts is obviously contingent upon the preferences of such other countries regarding inter-country adoption relationships.Over the past 18 months AAI has written to its counterpart Central Authority in Kazakhstan on three separate occasions to begin the process of developing an administrative agreement for inter-country adoption. To date there has been no reply from the Kazakhstani authorities to any of the contacts made by the AAI. The Authority has continued to indicate that it is open to discussing the issue of inter-country adoptions with its Kazakhstani counterparts at any time, and the most recent correspondence from the AAI was in March of this year.An official of the Irish Embassy in Moscow presented the copy correspondence to, and raised the issue of inter-country adoption with, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kazakhstan on Friday 11 May 2012. The Embassy officials in Moscow have also been asked to secure feedback from the meeting held in Kazakhstan on 11 May to assess its relevance for progress towards an administrative agreement on inter-country adoption between Ireland and Kazakhstan. AAI is doing a review of adoption laws in Kazakhstan.An official at the Irish Embassy in Moscow confirmed to the AAI on 4 July 2012 that the National Central Authority had received the Adoption Authority of Ireland correspondence and a reply was in the course of preparation. They were not in a position to state the nature of the reply.  This matter was also followed up on 3rd   July directly with the Embassy by officials of the DCYA. A response is awaited.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I can confirm that in preparing the policy position to underpin the introduction of legislation to place Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children on a statutory footing due regard was paid to a range of international experience of relevant legislation, including that of New South Wales.  I note that, while changes have been made to the reporting regime in New South Wales, the policy of mandatory reporting has been maintained.As regards any potential adverse effects, the Deputy will be aware that Children Firsthas operated on the basis of voluntary compliance since it was first published by the then Department of Health and Children in 1999.  Children First is much wider than reporting and sets out a comprehensive range of practices which organisations and professionals are required to adhere to in order to safeguard children.  Significant resources have been put in place to support the implementation of Children First and in the case of the HSE and An Garda Síochána, Children First has formed an integral part of their existing operations and practices. The HSE has provided training, information and advice on the implementation of Children First  throughout the HSE, voluntary and community sector.In the draft legislative proposals on Children First it is proposed that organisations working with children appoint a Designated Officer.  It is proposed that the Designated Officer, along with certain named professionals, will have statutory responsibility to report information about abuse to the HSE.  To assist Designated Officers and certain named professionals make a determination as to whether to report abuse, a ‘Guidance for Reporting of Abuse' is to be developed by my Department. This Guidance will deal with issues such as definitions, thresholds and appropriate routes for the reporting of abuse. The Guidance will assist designated officers and professionals named in the legislation, in considering a number of factors to see if the concern reaches the threshold of a report under the legislation. This approach is intended to ensure that only those cases which require an assessment by the HSE are brought to its attention.I received the Report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on the draft Heads of the Children First Bill last week and my officials have commenced a review of the Report and an assessment of any changes that might be recommended to the Heads of Bill as currently drafted.  I welcome the input of the Health and Children Committee and the experts consulted by the Committee during its deliberations and look forward to the further refinement of the legislative proposals as a result of this input.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	519	Responsibility for matters relating to An Garda Siochana rests primarily with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality. Children, who are not being arrested or detained, may come into the care of An Garda Síochána for a number of reasons:lost children brought to a Garda station;child of an arrested person — where the child remains in the control of the An Garda Síochána for a period of time;section 12 of the Child Care Act 1999 is invoked and the child is removed from a dangerous situation for his/her protection and cared for by An Garda Síochána for a period of time,circumstances where a child seeks the services of the Health Service Executive (HSE), via a Garda station.Current Garda policy caters for the provision of medical assistance as necessary; the removal of the child to hospital if required; the safe delivery of the child into the custody of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in accordance with section 12, Child Care Act, 1991; and any other assistance to ensure the health and well-being of the child while in Garda care.At present the Health Service Executive provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area through the Crisis Intervention Service, and outside the greater Dublin area through the Emergency Place of Safety Service. The Crisis Intervention Service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years. The CIS service has informed me that they successfully placed all children, with the exception of one child on one occasion, in either emergency foster care or in a hostel, who sought their assistance in 2011.Outside the greater Dublin area, the HSE operates an Emergency Place of Safety Service whereby Gardai can access an emergency placement for children found to be in need of a placement out-of-hours. All Gardai Stations have a national contact phone number where a social worker is available for consultation, and where appropriate will arrange a placement with an emergency foster carers who provide a placement for one night, or over a weekend for a maximum of 3 nights. The Gardai will consult with the social worker as to the best course of action on occasions where a child may be intoxicated, in need of a health or psychiatric assessment or showing aggressive behaviour regarding the most appropriate course of action. Where a child's main issue is that of a placement, the social worker will make a suitable arrangement.While I have been informed by the Department of Justice and Equality that statistics for the number of children who have remained in a Garda station overnight in the care of An Garda Síochána are not readily or centrally available, I understand that as a result of the current policy and services available, the reasons for children to stay overnight in a Gardai station due to a lack of suitable placements has been reduced to a minimum. However I have asked the HSE to look into any situation where a child is reported to have been kept overnight in a Gardai Station and to report to me on the reasons for this.Furthermore, notwithstanding the current availability of service to Gardai, the HSE is currently engaged in work on the development of nationwide models for 24-hour social work assistance to be informed on the ongoing pilots projects in Cork and Donegal.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The Report of the Independent Child Death Review Group highlights in the most serious way our national problems with alcohol and drug abuse. The report highlights a significant number of individual cases where alcohol and drugs were prevalent in the home, and the devastating impact of drug and alcohol misuse on children and young adults, both through their own direct use and as a result of parental use. Some of those described in the report themselves sought release in alcohol and drugs.I am committed to working with Minister Roisin Shortall and the HSE on progressing a fresh approach to identifying and addressing the hidden harm posed by substance misuse.In February 2012 the Report of the National Substance Misuse Strategy Steering Group, was launched. The focus of the Steering Group was on alcohol and it was charged with identifying actions that could be used to deal with the harms caused by alcohol misuse. The Steering Group was drawn from relevant Departments and agencies, medical professional bodies, the community and voluntary sectors and the alcohol industry. Its report is a roadmap for the future direction of policy to deal with the use and misuse of alcohol. I continue to proactively support efforts to tackle alcohol misuse both directly with Minister Reilly, Minister of State Shorthall and their officials and through my participation in policy development and oversight in relation to this major public health issue at Government and in the Cabinet Committee on Social Policy.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	521	Under the Child Care Act, 1991, the Health Service Executive has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection. The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. There were 6,236 children in the care of the state in April 2012, the vast majority of whom were in foster care (5,601) and residential care (378).A very small minority of young people under 18 years of age have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, due to their childhood experiences or in some cases as a result of injury, accident or disability. The care needs of these young people are generally met by directly provided residential services or services commissioned by the HSE within Ireland.For a small number of young people, the HSE is on occasion required to make arrangements for their placement in care and treatment facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of care and therapeutic services and psychiatric treatment not currently available in this country. This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.  These placements are made under the order and supervision of the High Court. The HSE has advised me that there were 8  young people detained abroad on high court orders on 6 July last.The HSE ensure that these placements are suitable and the child's social worker visits regularly and makes arrangements for family or carers of the child to also visit.The units in which the children are placed are inspected and regulated by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.The level of requirement for these services is closely monitored by the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services.The general issue of referral of persons abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system as it is in many other jurisdictions of similar size and is not unique to childcare services.  However, recourse to such arrangements for children is kept to a minimum and decisions in each case are made in the best interests of the child.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	522	It is important to note that the Independent Child Death Review Group conducted what was in essence a desktop review of HSE files. This was in accordance with the terms of reference for the Group. The Group did not interview staff and did not make specific findings regarding individual staff members. Consequently right of reply or opportunity was not afforded to the HSE, or indeed any of the service providers engaged with the deceased, to respond to the report'sfindings in relation to matters reported on. The purpose of the review was to establish how these children and young adults died and to focus on the strengths and weaknesses of the State’s involvement. Its purpose was to see how systems can be strengthened, rather than to establish culpability. The review related to deaths over a period of ten years and interventions in the lives of these children over preceding years.The HSE has indicated that in some cases disciplinary actions were initiated against staff who were involved in cases subsequently examined by the Review Group. It also indicated that there may be further reviews and if cases of personal culpability are found these will be addressed. This would be done in accordance with the relevant employment legislation. The matter of action against employees of the Health Service Executive is one for the HSE to address as the relevant employer.On a current basis the HSE now automatically has all deaths of children in its care or known to child protection services independently reviewed in order to identify learning and any actions that may be necessary.

This report is nearing completion and it is expected to be published in late summer/early autumn.There are currently no audits ongoing in other areas pending the agreement on the methodology for the further rollout of the process.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 57 together.Work has commenced in my Department on an overarching Children's and Young People's Policy Framework. A public consultation on this Framework is underway at present. It is anticipated that the Children's and Young People's Policy Framework will be available in 2012. This will include a high level policy statement on youth.It is my intention that the more detailed Youth Policy Framework will be completed in the light of the wider Children's and Young People's Policy Framework and in particular in the light of the public consultation underway at present as well as the expert and youth services providers' input. I am also keen to ensure that youth policy developments at European level during Ireland's Presidency of the EU Council of Youth Ministers in 2013 will inform Ireland's national policy for young people.To further inform the process, my Department has commissioned a review of international best practice in the field of youth development and support and this will be available shortly. The findings from this review will be explored by practitioners and managers of young people's services, academics, researchers and others at a symposium on Youth Development Outcomes planned for later this month.Two working groups — an International Expert Reference Group and a National Youth Work Advisory Committee Task Group — are assisting my Department in developing the Youth Policy Framework.  The International Expert Reference Group has met on three occasions. The Task Group has met once and both groups have met together jointly on one occasion to coordinate expert and stakeholder input into the draft findings of the international review.

I will provide the information to the Deputy when it becomes available.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	527	The HSE has advised me that 249 children were placed in private foster care at a cost of €6,727,698 in 2009, 304 children were placed in private foster care at a cost of €9,581,360 in 2010 and  360 children were placed in private foster care at a cost of €12,893,243 in 2011.  The information requested for 2007 and 2008 is not available at this time.While the HSE was unable to provide details of precise costings to date in 2012, it has advised me that there are currently 251 children in private foster care at a weekly cost of €342,265.The private foster care company costs include the recruitment, assessment and training of the foster carer. The private company also provides the link worker (professional social worker) to provide support and supervision to the carer,ongoing training, and depending on the circumstances of the placement,  support may be available on a 24 hour basis. The HSE generally utilise private foster care companies where children have a higher level of need including stepping down from high support placements.Private foster companies provide services to separated children seeking asylum and to the emergency out of hours placement service.The HSE retain the approval authority of the foster carer in all cases.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	528	The type of research initiated through my Department's National Children's Research Programme and, in particular through the National Longitudinal Study of Children —Growing Up in Ireland — is providing us with a wealth of valuable data on all aspects of children’s development, including their psychological development. Since 2006, Growing Up in Ireland has been following the development of almost 20,000 children in Ireland across two cohorts: an infant cohort recruited at nine-months; and a child cohort recruited at nine years. The infant cohort children (with their families) have been interviewed at 9 months, 3 years of age and further interviews are planned in 2013 when these children make the critical transition to primary schooling (at 5 years of age). The child cohort children (also with their families) have been interviewed at 9 and 13 years of age.It is generally accepted that many causes of poor psychological outcomes in both adolescence and adulthood can be traced back to early childhood. By capturing data on these children in early childhood and following their development over time, we will have a better understanding how, why and when these children experience and/or overcome psychological difficulties.A series of Growing Up in Ireland reports have already been published, one of which focuses specifically on children’s psychological development. This report shows that the majority of nine-year-olds in Ireland are developing well without any significant problems in this area of their lives.  It also found that however, one in five nine-year-olds have been classified as showing significant levels of emotional or behavioural difficulties and that certain characteristics of the child (e.g. the presence of a chronic illness) and other factors (e.g. economic deprivation, maternal depression, neglectful parenting style and conflict in the home) make children more vulnerable than others.  Clearly these data have the potential to inform policy and practice regarding children and their families thus ensuring that policies, services and interventions are targeted, practical and effective.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	529	On 2 April this year I announced a series of measures that set out a clear timetable to end the use of St. Patrick's Institution for the detention of under 18 year olds in the next 2 years and a number of intermediary steps that would support the commitment made in the Programme for Government in this regard.  These included extending the children detention school model up to 16 year of age, an action made possible by reductions in recent demand for detention places and subsequent spare capacity within the existing children detention schools.  I signed the necessary orders to bring this about and since 1 May 2012 any boy aged 16 years or less, newly remanded or committed, has been detained to a children detention school.As the Deputy may be aware,  my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Alan Shatter TD, has the line responsibility for St. Patrick's Institution.   In addition to the interim measures I have announced, I have been informed that the Irish Prison Service has instituted a programme of placing suitable under 18 year olds into the community under the supervision of the Probation Service, further reducing the demand for places in St. Patrick's Institution.  I understand that it is intended to review the effectiveness of this programme towards the end of the year. As of 4 July 2012 I have been advised that there were 21 males aged 17 years and 1 male, who is completing a sentence, aged 16 years being detained in St. Patrick's Institution.Also, it may interest the Deputy to know that I have, with the consent of my colleague Minister Shatter, signed the statutory instrument that has extended the remit of the Ombudsman for Children to include those children being detained in St. Patrick's Institution and that this has been in effect since 1 July 2012.With these measures, I am satisfied that good progress is being made on Government policy   on ending the use of St. Patrick's Institution.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	530	In 2011 a total of 188 adoptions were entered into in the Register of Inter-country Adoptions of which 21 were from countries who have ratified the  Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-Operation in respect of Inter-country Adoption and 167 were from non-Hague countries. To date in the current year 69 adoptions were entered into the Register of Inter-country Adoptions of which 14 were from countries who have ratified Hague and  55 were from non-Hague countries.The Adoption Authority of Ireland maintain statistics for the number of declarations of eligibility and suitability issued and for the number of adoptions entered in the Register of Inter-country Adoptions. These figures do not require correlation as the processes for completing adoptions can span several years due to various external factors such as considerable variation in the waiting times between the sending of an application pack and the actual completion of an adoption in sending countries, which can be as much as 3 years or more in some cases.Accordingly, register entries can have been made by the AAI on foot of declarations of eligibility and suitability issued by its predecessor, The Adoption Board.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The Independent Child Death Review Group highlighted in its report what it considers to be the restrictive nature of the in camera rule and the fact that court proceedings relating to child welfare and protection cases are held in private. The Review Group called for a review of the operation of the rule.I believe there is scope for more transparency in this area. We need to put in place a mechanism which will ensure that the learning from such cases is shared across the system in order to improve services, while continuing to protect minor's interests and maintain anonymity. This would also allow the public to gain some insight into how the child protection system operates.With this in mind it is my intention to bring forward regulations to allow access to child welfare and protection proceedings for the purpose of reporting on such proceedings.  I believe this can be achieved as long as it is approached sensitively and with due regard to the interests of those who are the subject of proceedings. I do not propose a full range of access to the media, but something more along the lines of Section 40 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, which gives access to a limited range of parties such as bona fide   researchers and persons appointed by the Courts Service. The persons allowed to access the family courts under this provision can publish reports on the proceeding so long as the anonymity of the parties is maintained. The pioneering work of Dr Carol Coulter in reporting on family law matters provides an excellent template as to how to balance the right to privacy with the right to a fair, transparent and accountable system of justice.The exact nature of the regulations, however, will be informed by consultations with my colleague the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Courts Service.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	532	The work of the Independent Child Death Review Group was completed upon the production of its final draft report. I want to commend the authors for the professional and painstaking work they did to produce a report of such high quality. The Review Group was asked to present key details of each case where the individual died from unnatural causes, but to anonymise the report so that the identities of all those children and young adults who passed away were protected. Ms Gibbons and Dr. Shannon were more than equal to the challenge this presented.It was my clear intention that the report would enter the public domain and inform debate and discussion about the level of State and other services being offered to children and young adults in need of intervention and/or assistance. The Review Group achieved this aim. By publishing the report the Government has demonstrated its commitment to transparency and honesty about the challenges in getting children's services right. Child protection remains a high priority on our agenda and changes at every level — policy, law, structures and individual practitioner — were happening during the period of the preparation of this report, and will continue to happen.Many of the recommendations echo recommendations made in previous reports. My officials are preparing a single database of various report recommendations in order to streamline reporting to me on these matters. My officials are also preparing a detailed project plan for children's services reform. Actions not already part of change programme will be incorporated into that plan. It is my intention to bring regular progress reports on the reform programme to Government and the relevant Cabinet sub-committee.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	533	In preparation for the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency work is under way on disaggregating the Children and Families budget from within the overall HSE financial determination. This necessary work will be completed in the latter half of 2012 in preparation for the planned establishment of the new agency early in 2013. The 2012 budget provision for Children and Families in the HSE National Service Plan is €568 million across all services. A separate figure in respect of management and reporting is not described. The current reporting systems in the HSE are not designed in such a way as to readily facilitate the provision of national data relative to this area.It is my intention and that of the National Director, Gordon Jeyes as the Chief Executive Officer designate for the new Agency, to ensure that there is full transparency with regard to the composition of the budget for the new Agency when established. I acknowledge the need for improvement and greater accountability in this area as part of our concerted efforts to strengthen the governance and organisational arrangements in respect of children and family services generally.Governance arrangements for the new Agency will be further addressed in the report of the Task Force of the New Agency.

All reports to child protection services are screened and an initial assessment is undertaken to determine whether a further more comprehensive assessment may be required and to enable a plan for continued intervention or support to be put in place. In 2010, there were 29,277 child protection reports received 16,452 of which related to welfare concerns. The remaining 12,825 related to neglect (4,755), sexual abuse (2,962) physical abuse (2,608), emotional abuse (2,500) and abuse was confirmed in 1,566 of these cases.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	535	The HSE has advised that it does not apply a standardised number of cases per individual social worker. However, an indicative range would be in the region of 15-25 cases per social worker. Actual variations in caseloads are dependent on the complexities of the individual cases, and whether the cases are in relation to child protection or children in care.  There is, in general, a higher intake of cases held by duty social workers.The HSE through a document titled ‘The Induction of Social Workers: A Policy and Guidelines for Children and Families Social Services' provided guidance on the management of caseloads by recommending limited caseloads and supervision and support for newly qualified social workers. This induction policy is the subject of a review and evaluation. Furthermore, as part of the ongoing reform process, a methodology for workload management for all social work staff is also being developed within the HSE.As regards residential care, most residential units are operated by social care staff, rather than by social workers. All children in care, including those in residential care, should be allocated a social worker. The HSE reported in May 2012 that 97.3% of children in residential care have an allocated social worker.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	536	The HSE's 2010 Review of Adequacy provided information on reported incidents of physical abuse, sexual abuse and neglect.  Such information has informed learning about the impact of neglect, the benefits of early intervention, the serious impact of adult addiction on children's welfare and the issues that present for older teenagers with high risk behaviours, including suicide.What is happening now in terms of the HSE's engagement with children and families is as follows:there is a closer integration across family support, child protection, and child and adult mental heath services;there is better integration of services and information;there is a model of managing referrals to ensure rapid response to welfare as well as child protection concerns, known as the differential response model;the Children First Guidance is being placed on a statutory footing;improved services within the HSE's Children and Family Services are currently being implemented by the National Director, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, and his national team. This team includes new national posts for Quality Assurance (including implementing all recommendations from inspections and investigations) and national standardised operational systems.A fundamental structural change is currently under way, which will see the establishment of a dedicated Child and Family Support Agency in 2013.  This will radically change how services are delivered to children and families.  I established the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency in September 2011 under the chairmanship of Ms Maureen Lynott.  The Task Force has been examining the necessary transition programme to establish a Child and Family Support Agency, and is basing its work on best practice in child welfare, family support and public administration; consistent with the Government's public sector reform agenda.I am also committed to a Constitutional referendum to strengthen children's rights.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	538	The maximum grant available was €50,000 (including VAT).  The aim of the funding is to provide support to child care settings to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work, or to purchase equipment.Following a robust appraisal, 290 applications were approved for funding.  Unfortunately it is not possible to isolate the applications concerning the particular problems referred to in the Deputy's question without devoting a considerable amount of time and, in view of the significant amount of work involved in administering the programme, this would not be considered the best use of resources at this time.  Pobal has, however, advised that funding for the issues referred to by the Deputy came under either the maintenance or renovation headings.  The total figure approved was €6m and of this figure €3.8m was approved for applications that came under the heading of renovations which is 63.5% of total approvals and €0.7m was approved for applications that came under the heading of maintenance which is 11% of total approvals.The successful applications were those that represented the most complete, coherent, precise and compelling cases for funding.  The investment has been directed, to the greatest extent possible, to addressing the most urgent works, and supporting the quality of services making the greatest impact for disadvantaged children and communities.

It is understood that the appeal was not upheld and home tuition has been provided by the Department of Education and Skills pending the availability of a suitable educational placement.I have been advised that the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), under the remit of my Department, has been working with the family over a period of time.  The National Council for Special Education also has a role in this case.  The NEWB has provided assistance to the family in the appeals process under the Education Act, 1998.  An Education Welfare Officer of the Board continues to assist the family and efforts are continuing to access an appropriate educational placement at an early date as well as appropriate clinical services to support the young person in question.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	540	My Department currently administers three support programmes —  the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.The Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme provides funding to community child care not-for-profit services to enable them to charge reduced child care rates to low income and disadvantaged families.  Community child care services qualify for grant aid on the basis of the level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  Because of the current budgetary situation no new applications, for entry into the CCS programme, by service providers are being considered at this time.The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme was introduced in September 2010.  The CETS programme provides free child care places in both community and commercial services to qualifying FÁS and Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) trainees and students.  Again, due to the budgetary situation, no approvals for new child care places are currently being considered under this programme.  In the region of €63 million is being provided in 2012 to support the CCS and CETS programmes.The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme provides one free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Both community and commercial child care services are eligible to apply to participate in this programme.  Due to demographic pressures, which mean that the number of children eligible for the programme will increase by some 3,000, the cost of the programme is expected to rise to almost €176 million in 2012, an increase of almost €10 million and this funding has been provided for.  The ECCE programme will continue to be evaluated and developed as resources permit.Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy 2012.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	541	Two out-of-hours pilot projects, one in Donegal and the other in Cork, were commenced by the HSE in 2011. The Donegal project started mid-year and the Cork project started in the third quarter.  Both projects were internally evaluated by the HSE, which then commissioned an independent external assessment, undertaken by Trinity College Dublin.  This external assessment has been completed and is now being examined by the HSE.  The outcome of this assessment process will inform further decisions in the coming months on progression to a national out of hours service model.  Clearly whatever model emerges will need to address the challenges of varying demographic demands in both rural and urban settings.What is important is that children in crisis, no matter where they are, have access to 24 hour social work assistance, and this is what the HSE's National Director for Children and Family Services and I are working towards.  It should be noted that at present the Health Service Executive provides out-of-hours emergency services for children at risk in the greater Dublin area through the Crisis Intervention Service, and outside the greater Dublin area through the Emergency Place of Safety Service.The Crisis Intervention Service provides out-of-hours emergency social work assistance to young people aged under 18 years.  The service operates across the greater Dublin area (Counties Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow).  Referrals are made by service providers outside of normal working hours i.e. Gardai, hospital and ambulance service personnel.  Outside the greater Dublin area, the HSE operates an Emergency Place of Safety Service whereby Gardai can access an emergency placement for children found to be at risk out-of-hours.  This service involves the placement of a child in a family setting until the next working day, when the local social work service assumes responsibility for the case.  As part of this service Gardai have access to advice and information from a non-HSE social work off-site resource which is provided on a contract basis.

The discussions lead to finalisation on the contents of administrative arrangements for the resumption of adoptions between Ireland and Vietnam.  I have invited the Vietnamese Minister for Justice, Mr. Ha Hung Cuong, to visit Ireland in September at which point I expect that the agreement setting out the administrative arrangements will be signed by the two Central Authorities.The Adoption Authority has accredited two bodies to facilitate adoptions from Vietnam, ARC and Helping Hands.  During their visit, the Vietnamese delegation met with both agencies and I am hopeful that the discussions the delegation held with these accredited bodies will assist future interactions.  Details in relation to time frames and processes for adoptions from Vietnam should become clearer following the finalisation of the administrative arrangements by the two Central Authorities. The relevant information will be posted on the Authority's website as soon as it is available.The Adoption Authority is working to establish administrative arrangements with a number of other Hague countries in relation to inter-country adoptions, as provided for under section 72 of the Adoption Act 2010. The Authority has travelled to a number of jurisdictions in order to make contact with the Central Authorities; advise of our processes and procedures, assess the need for additional administrative arrangements or agreements; and to glean as much information as possible of relevance to prospective adopters from those countries. The visits also provide opportunities to streamline processes on both sides and obtain up-to-date information for prospective adopters on developments in these countries. The most recent engagements by the AAI with its counterpart Central Authorities include:A delegation from the Adoption Authority travelled to New Delhi, India, on 18th June 2012 to discuss adoption arrangements between the Adoption Authority and CARA, the Indian Central Authority. I understand the Authority is considering the report from this visit.With the help of the Irish Embassy in Moscow, the AAI is continuing its approaches to its Kazahk counterparts on the issue of inter-country adoptions.AAI delegations have made visits to the US to discuss issues in relation to inter-country adoptions.  The Authority has advised that a Memo of Understanding relating to inter-country adoption between the US and Ireland has been drafted and transmitted to the US State Department in its role as the Central Authority.The Adoption Authority has accredited Helping Hands for the purposes of adoption mediation with the Philippines and the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.On the 12th of June the AAI announced the accreditation of ARC Adoption Ltd for the purposes of adoption mediation with the US.

These two Bills and the National Vetting Bureau Bill are part of a suite of complementary legislative proposals to strengthen child protection.The focus of the Withholding Bill is on the responsibility of all citizens to provide information to the Gardaí where they have knowledge of a serious sexual crime against a child, in the investigation and prosecution of that crime.  The proposed Children First legislation focusses on the protection of individual children about whom a report is made and other children who may be at risk from an alleged perpetrator of abuse. Its aim is to make organisations safe places, and to ensure that key people in authority in these organisations, and named professionals report to and co-operate with the HSE information about abuse and serious neglect.Given the close link between the legislative programmes of my Department and the Department of Justice and Equality I have regular contact with my colleague Minister Shatter in this regard. In addition, officials from my Department have been meeting and working closely with colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality to ensure both pieces of legislation are well aligned and complementary.  Minister Shatter and I have also worked closely to ensure our communications regarding both pieces of legislation are clear.  This process will continue.Last week I received the Report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children on the draft Heads of Bill for Children First.  My consideration of the Report and any changes to the Heads of Bill is ongoing.  My officials will continue to liaise closely with counterparts in the Department of Justice and Equality as both pieces of legislation move through the legislative process.

The introduction of the National Child Care Information System will help to greatly improve performance in this area. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that good progress is being made by the HSE with regard to the introduction of this system.  An Invitation to Tender (ITT) was issued  in January of this year and responses from potential suppliers were received in March. An NCCIS evaluation team in the HSE has had meetings with all of the suppliers who responded and attended at demonstrations of proposed child care ICT systems and or prototypes. The evaluation team is currently completing its assessment of the tenders and will, on completion, recommend a preferred supplier. This process is expected to be complete in the very near future.The NCCIS will be the central system supporting Social Work services. As a social work case management system, it will be used to record and store the case history of every child and other clients of the service. Management information will be derived automatically from the case management system. The aim of the NCCIS project is to identify and procure an easy to use technology solution to support this type of case recording and to automatically provide management information. A first step was to develop agreed and consistent definitions and business processes across all social work offices. In this regard, a national standardised business process has been rolled out nationally. This will ensure that definitions used are consistent, for example to ensure the number of recorded  referrals relates to  individual children and not families. I am confident that the process being led by Gordon Jeyes, the HSE National Director of Children and Families Services will deliver the information needed.The introduction of the NCCIS is a high priority and will help to significantly improve the level, quality and accessibility of information in respect of Children and Family Services.

However, on this occasion the release will be delayed by a further 21 days because of the introduction of the Nace Rev. 2 classification of economic activity. The implementation of the new classification proved quite demanding as it is significantly different from its predecessor (Nace Rev. 1.1). The decision to reclassify the national accounts back to 1995 in both current and constant prices also added to the delay.

NESDO operates a comprehensive sick leave policy which is outlined in its Policy and Procedures Guidelines. These Guidelines were agreed by both staff and management and approved by the NESDO  board, and are reviewed on an annual basis. NESDO's sick leave policy outlines the responsibilities of both staff and management in the management of sick leave. Among the requirements are  review meetings ( where individual staff member's pattern of sick leave is examined and discussed with the staff member concerned), return to work meetings (to facilitate a staff member's transition back to work after an instance of long-term certified sick leave), resumption of work forms, and disciplinary measures where sick leave abuse occurs. NESDO's Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) also offers an opportunity for the manager to discuss with a staff member instances where attendance patterns impact on the individual's performance.NESDO fully complies with the requirements set out in Circular 9/2010.The information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of sick leave days in 2011 for NESDO is contained in the following tabular statement.Number of Sick Leave Days in 2011Number of StaffMore than 54More than 101More than 150More than 200More than 210The length of the ten highest absences in 2011 was as follows: 12, 9, 7, 6, 5.5, 5,  4, 3, 2 and 1 days.The combined number of sick leave days taken by staff  in 2011 and to date in 2012 is 76.5 and 36 respectively. While no direct costs were incurred (by the employment of substitute staff or additional overtime), the salary cost of this sick leave in 2011 and to date in 2012 is approximately €15,200 and €7,200 respectively.

As neither of them is an Irish citizen it is not possible for my Department to offer them consular assistance. The Greek authorities are under no legal obligation to assist our Embassy with any requests made in connection with this case, as we have no locus standi   in the matter. However, on hearing of their detention, and notwithstanding the fact that neither is a citizen of Ireland, the Irish Embassy in Athens made contact with the Greek police in an effort to convey the Irish Government’s interest in this case on the basis that he is married to an Irish citizen. It was made clear to our Embassy that the authorities in Crete would not provide them with any information regarding this case as no Irish citizen was involved.To clarify further, the Embassy has certain rights of communication and contact with Irish citizens in Greece to facilitate the exercise of our consular functions under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations (1963). This Embassy has no such rights for other persons, even if they are related to Irish citizens.

He has been on hunger strike now for over 80 days. Although he was for much of this period taking mineral and vitamin supplements, he is believed now to be only taking water, and is in a critical condition. There are reports that he may be periodically blacking out, although he remains in control of his actions.I had hoped that Mr. Rikhawi's protest could be satisfactorily resolved along the same lines as earlier protests, but this has not proven to be the case so far. I continue to call on both parties to actively consider pragmatic solutions which can avoid a tragic outcome. The Irish Ambassador has conveyed my concerns about this case directly to the Israeli authorities at a senior level, following up on earlier messages, and has also been in contact with the ICRC. Our Representative Office in Ramallah has been in contact with NGOs working with the prisoners and with Mr. Rakhimi's lawyers. The EU has also conveyed its concerns at Head of Mission level.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	556	The various measures included in the package agreed at Weston Park in August 2001 addressed four issues to assist in the successful implementation of the Good Friday Agreement: policing, normalisation, the stability of the institutions and decommissioning.  Proposed draft legislation by the British Government to deal with this specific issue as referred to in paragraph 20 of the Weston Park accord was formally withdrawn by the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Peter Hain MP, on 11 January 2006. The draft legislation, the Northern Ireland (Offences) Bill, had been opposed by the majority of the Northern Ireland Assembly parties and the Secretary of State was compelled to withdraw the legislation when the only supporting party, Sinn Féin, could not accept certain aspects of the proposed legislation. The Government remains committed to the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.On the particular issue of securing early release for Mr. McGeough, the prisoner in question initiated legal proceedings to secure an early release and judgment on this has been passed. On 8 July 2011, Mr. McGeough was granted leave to seek a judicial review in an attempt to obtain a Royal Prerogative of Mercy. Mr. McGeough's legal team argued that because he had been previously jailed abroad, the Royal Prerogative of Mercy should be granted to ensure equal treatment with others who benefited from it. On 2 March 2012, the High Court ruled this argument untenable.  Officials from my Department continue to monitor developments very closely.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 99 together.I have discussed this case with the Secretary of State on a number of occasions, most recently on 27 April. I have been assured that the process which has led to the prisoner's detention fully adhered to the law and that advice was sought from an independent body to verify that this action was pursued in a correct manner. The NIO has confirmed that a Royal Prerogative of Mercy was given to the prisoner on 30 April 1980 but that this pardon was only granted in respect of a sentence of twenty years for conspiracy to cause an explosion and was not granted in relation to the sentence of two terms of life imprisonment related to the Old Bailey bombing. On 22 February this contention was upheld by the Parole Commission which ruled that the prisoner is subject to life licence in respect to the two life sentences.I understand that the prisoner's legal representatives are currently exploring the further legal avenues available to the prisoner to appeal this decision.  I have also raised concerns surrounding the health of the prisoner with the relevant authorities.  The prisoner has been moved to the medical wing of Hydebank Prison and more recently to hospital for medical treatment. My officials are in regular contact with the authorities in Northern Ireland, relevant MLAs, human rights NGOs and others closely following this case.  I will continue to raise my concern as appropriate with the relevant authorities.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	558	The issue of prisons within Northern Ireland is a devolved matter to the Northern Ireland Executive and, specifically, to the Department of Justice in Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland Prison Service.  Arising from the Hillsborough Agreement of February 2010, Dame Ann Owers and the Prison Review Team undertook a review of the prison system. In October 2011 their report made forty recommendations on prison reform in Northern Ireland.  Minister for Justice Ford has underlined his commitment to full implementation of the recommendations and has described the prison reform process as "unstoppable". I had an opportunity to discuss the reform process with him at our most recent meeting on 20th April. Implementation of the Owers Report remains the most effective way to ensure that prison conditions in Northern Ireland meet the required standard.Where allegations arise in relation to conditions in Maghaberry Prison, or any other prisons in Northern Ireland, which affect an Irish citizen, the Government continues to raise the matter with the relevant authorities.  The Government is of the view that the full implementation of all of the recommendations of the Owers Report remains the most effective way to ensure that conditions within all prisons in Northern Ireland are of an acceptable standard.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	559	I understand that the Ukrainian Parliament has discussed draft legislation which could ban activities which allegedly promote homosexuality.  As the Deputy will be aware, I am on record as having expressed concern about any legislation that could result in further stigmatisation, and even criminalisation, of lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender people. In relation to this issue, I will ensure that the concerns of the Government are relayed to the Ukrainian authorities.The Government is strongly committed to combating discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity.  We believe that consensual, same-sex relationships between consenting adults should not be criminalised and supports measures to ensure that the right to freedom of expression and association can be enjoyed effectively by all people. Discriminatory legal or administrative provisions, which curtail the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people are not acceptable.  In our international relations, Ireland strongly supports the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity. On Friday, 17 June 2011, a historic resolution on Human Rights, Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity was adopted at the 17th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Ireland co-sponsored the resolution. This was the first time a UN resolution explicitly acknowledged human rights protection as covering sexual orientation and demonstrates the increasing commitment across the broader international community to the promotion and protection of the human rights of all persons, irrespective of their sexual orientation and gender identity.  Ireland also participated in a panel at the 19th session of the UN Human Rights Council on the report prepared as mandated by this resolution. Ireland will continue to engage actively with this issue at the Human Rights Council.

There remains, however, a threat from paramilitary groups who continue to assert their determination to impose a return to conflict on the people of Ireland.  RAAD has claimed responsibility for the murder of one young man in Buncrana earlier this year and for a grim series of shootings and mutilations of young people in Derry. It is clear that these people enjoy no popular support within the community, as evidenced by the unequivocal response by the people of Derry who have publically protested against those who seek to impose their will on the community through violence.Strong deep cooperation between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland is doing much to counter such individuals and groups. The number of arrests in connection with paramilitary activity made in both jurisdictions continues to be significant. The Gardaí and the PSNI will continue to cooperate very closely to combat such activity on both sides of the border.  Justice and security matters are not among the six Areas of Co-Operation on which common policies and approaches are discussed and agreed in the North South Ministerial Council.  It is however, a matter of close ongoing cooperation between the Government, the Northern Ireland Assembly and the British authorities.  The Joint Statement by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Cameron on British Irish relations in March this year underlined the determination of both governments to support reconciliation and prosperity in Northern Ireland.  I reviewed progress in this area with Secretary of State Owen Patterson today and will have an opportunity to do so again when I meet with the Secretary of State, the First Minister and the Deputy First Minister next week.

Peace, security and development, within an open and transparent rules bound system are essential for sustainable growth and job creation and my Department will focus on a range of key policy areas during our Presidency in support of our overall objectives. Among the areas that will require priority attention are:Active support for the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the European External Action Service (EEAS) to promote effectiveness and coherence in the EU's response to current foreign policy and security challenges. It is likely that the Middle East and Iran, North Africa and other issues in Africa and elsewhere will require priority attention within the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) during the Irish semester.We will promote greater coherence in EU external policies, including at the UN and in other multilateral fora. Our priorities within the CFSP will include the promotion and protection of human rights and helping to shape the EU's position on disarmament and non-proliferation. We will work to enhance the role of the EU at the UN on human rights issues; we will also help to implement a political declaration and action plan expected under the EU Human Rights Strategy. Key areas of work in the disarmament and non-proliferation field include preparation for the Non-Proliferation Treaty review process and a major chemical weapons conference in April 2013.We will contribute to the development of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy, taking full account of Ireland's interests and building on the experience of Ireland's 2012 Chairmanship of the OSCE in the areas of conflict prevention and resolution.The Irish Presidency will actively support the work of the EU's permanent President of the European Council and the High Representative to strengthen the EU's relations with its strategic partners. We will support growth and employment for the EU and its partners through enhanced political engagement underpinned by strengthened commercial relations. Coordination among EU Members States and with the EU institutions on the EU's Summits and Ministerial level meetings with the US, Russia and Latin America will be an integral aspect of the Irish Presidency's work in this regard.We will support the implementation of the incentive-based approach of the European Neighbourhood Policy. This is aimed at promoting democratic reforms and strengthening economic development in the countries to the East and South of the Union.We will promote the integrity and universality of the International Criminal Court (ICC), encourage further ratification of the Rome Statute of the ICC and seek to ensure that those indicted by the Court are brought to justice.The Irish Presidency will engage in targeted efforts to reinforce and improve the EU's civil protection instruments.Issues on the enlargement agenda arising during our Presidency will be shaped by progress made in the accession negotiations in the interim. It can be expected, nonetheless, that we will continue oversight of the accession negotiations with Iceland, Turkey and Montenegro. It is expected also that Croatia will accede to the European Union on 1 July 2013.As Presidency in the lead up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) Review Summit in September 2013 we will highlight areas to be considered as part of the post-2015 framework such as: human rights; equity / inclusiveness; climate change and sustainable development; economic growth and employment; agriculture and industrial development; governance, fragile states and vulnerability; and security-related issues.We will seek to address the linkages between hunger, nutrition and climate justice by ensuring that these linkages are adequately reflected in the new international development goals post-2015. We will oversee also the EU's input to the UN General Assembly's reporting and assessment of the state of the marine environment.The Irish Presidency will champion greater links between humanitarian relief and development aid. Drawing on lessons from the Horn of Africa emergency in 2011 and input from our partners in the field, we will explore the practical application of these principles and showcase examples of best practice. We will place particular emphasis on the EU's approach to disaster risk reduction. We will progress the implementation of the European Consensus on Humanitarian Aid and work to develop new and innovative ways in which to ensure that the common set of humanitarian principles and commitments can be put into practice.We must also be prepared to ensure that we are in a position to respond in an appropriate way to a range of issues that may emerge.  Ireland has won a high reputation on six previous occasions for maintaining its flexibility and for managing an efficient, effective and impartial presidency, with clearly defined, realistic and achievable goals.  In the post-Lisbon institutional framework, it will be even more important to work closely with partners and with all the institutions of the Union. We will seek to ensure that in the year which marks the 40th anniversary of our accession, the people of Ireland can continue to be proud of our contribution to the European Union.

There are particular concerns in the United States where addressing the position of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements are priorities for the Government in its contacts with the US Administration and Congress.  The Government's keen interest in a resolution of the situation for undocumented Irish migrants is well recognised and accepted by our friends within US Administration and Congress. Their advice to us remains that comprehensive reform of the US immigration system and procedures is likely to be the only manner by which this can be achieved.With a view to helping some positive momentum around immigration issues insofar as they relate to Ireland, enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 temporary U.S. work visas has been a particular focus of our efforts.  If passed this would make 10,500 E-3 visas available to Irish citizens each year.  During my visit to Washington in February this year, I reviewed progress on E-3 issues during meetings with Senators Leahy, Brown and Schumer and with the Friends of Ireland group in the House of Representatives and with Deputy Secretary of State Bill Burns.  I also discussed prospects for progress with the Congressional Delegation led by leader Nancy Pelosi in Dublin in March.During his recent visit to Washington, the Taoiseach raised immigration with President Obama and with Senators Leahy, Brown and Schumer and the Friends of Ireland Group.  In June, I spoke again with Senators Leahy and Brown to reiterate the importance the Government attaches to this issue and our support for their efforts to make progress.  Most recently, I raised the subject with Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania during his visit to Ireland on 2 July. On 15 June, President Obama made an announcement in relation to the specific category of young illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children and measures to exempt them from deportation and to be granted temporary work permits.  It is too early to determine what effect, if any, this will have on the overall immigration debate.While I am heartened by the advances that have been made so far towards bi-partisan consensus in the  US Senate towards enabling Irish people to apply for E-3 visas, I am conscious that passing any immigration-related legislation in an election year in the US presents very significant challenges. Through our Embassy in Washington, the Government will continue to work closely with all relevant actors, including our friends in Congress and with Irish-American community representatives with a view to ensuring that every opportunity is taken to put an E-3 visa scheme in place.

To date in 2012 there have been 16 Sectoral meetings, an Institutional meeting on 27 April and a Plenary meeting on 15 June.  The next Institutional meeting is planned for the early autumn and the next Plenary is scheduled for 2 November 2012.  At the meeting in Plenary format at Farmleigh on 15 June discussions covered a wide range of issues including the economic challenges faced in both jurisdictions, the impact of the euro-zone crisis, bank restructuring and lending and NAMA. The meeting reviewed progress across a range of areas of North-South co-operation, including the work of the North-South bodies, particularly as they relate to fostering economic recovery on the island.  Ministers re-iterated their commitment to practical cooperation on these issues, and to exploring areas where cost savings might be achieved.We discussed the opportunities for co-operation in exploiting the trade opportunities in developing markets. The benefits from maximising the potential of major tourism events including ‘The Gathering' were noted.  We welcomed continuing collaboration on innovation supported by the European Union and noted the successful all-island "Collaborate to Innovate" Conference on European research and innovation funding for SMEs which took place on 7 June 2012  in Belfast and which was addressed by EU Commissioner Máire Geoghegan Quinn.  We also discussed the challenges and priorities for the upcoming Irish EU Presidency in 2013, and explored the potential for co-operative actions during the Presidency, including meetings of senior officials, the hosting of EU events in both jurisdictions and the inclusion of EU matters as an Agenda item at relevant NSMC sectoral meetings.The Decade of Commemorations and the importance of ensuring that all commemorative events are respectful and inclusive was also discussed.We welcomed continued progress on business planning for the establishment of the Radiotherapy Unit at Altnagelvin in Derry which will benefit patients on both sides of the border.  Work on this important facility is planned to commence in 2013 and the Unit should be operational in 2016.  The very successful North/South conference on alcohol misuse which was held in Armagh earlier this year was also welcomed.The importance of co-operation on Third Level Education was discussed, taking account of the likely increase in student mobility between the two jurisdictions and of continuing collaborative action between third level institutions to assist with cost savings and on research and development.We discussed progress to date on the A5 and A8 road projects, noted that the government remains committed to the completion of the A5 and approved a funding and implementation plan for the A5 project to the end of 2016 based on existing financial commitments.We agreed to finalise deliberations on the North South Consultative Forum at the next NSMC Plenary meeting, and welcomed recent progress in establishing the North-South Parliamentary Forum.We also discussed the North West Gateway Initiative, welcoming the progress that has been made on a range of projects. I expect that we will meet with the relevant Ministers, before the next NSMC Institutional meeting, to ensure that the measures to be taken forward through the Initiative are effectively delivered through the work of their Departments.Elements of the St Andrews Agreement Review were advanced at the meeting.  In regard to the Review's first Term of Reference, Ministers endorsed the recommendations concerning the various North South Bodies that had been agreed at sectoral meetings.  Work is progressing on a review of the financial memoranda of the North/South bodies. In relation to shared services, work has commenced on exploring the potential for realising efficiency savings within the Bodies, and a report will be submitted to the NSMC in the autumn.  The First Minister, deputy First Minister, Taoiseach and I will reflect and consult on Terms of Reference Two and Three of the St Andrews Review, which include the case for additional areas of co-operation within the NSMC, with a view to decisions being taken on these at the November 2012 Plenary meeting.  We will continue to work with our Northern colleagues in the NSMC to ensure that additional opportunities to engage cooperatively in areas where there is scope for joint action are identified to the maximum extent possible.

This shows that Ireland was ranked 5th during the 2000 to 2010 period. However, this has been significantly improved upon by the current Government. In 2011 Ireland rose to 2nd overall in terms of Ministerial attendance at Councils, including outperforming France and Germany. This is contained in the ‘Accountability Report 2011' published last April by European Movement Ireland. This showed that Ireland had an overall Ministerial attendance rate of 86%, with Ministers attending 61 out of 71 Councils that took place from 9th March to end December 2011. This was an almost 10% increase on the attendance level by Ministers of the previous Government when Ministers only attended 63 out of a total of 82 Council meetings held in 2010, and of the 9 Council meetings held between January and 9 March 2011, Ireland was represented at Ministerial level on only one occasion, at Ecofin in February 2011 by the late Brian Lenihan TD, Minister for Finance.  I am happy to record that there has been a 100% attendance record by Ministers at the 39 Council meetings held during the recent Danish EU Presidency.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	566	The Government remains seriously concerned about the situation in Sudan and South Sudan.  We are working with our EU partners to ensure that, in addition to a focus on the political and security situation, priority is given by the international community to the vital issue of humanitarian access to people and communities affected by the conflict and the tension in the region.  We will continue to use all available opportunities, within the EU and internationally, to raise these issues.The situation in Sudan and South Sudan, including the humanitarian crisis in Southern Kordofan, has been discussed by EU Foreign Ministers at their meetings over recent weeks and months.  In January, with Ireland's encouragement, the EU urged the Government of Sudan to allow safe and unhindered access for international humanitarian workers to all civilians, and reiterated its readiness to provide humanitarian assistance. The EU also emphasised that the ongoing conflicts in Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile and Darfur remain obstacles to the provision of the full range of support we would like to provide to Sudan, and in the region.  In April, the EU called on the Government of Sudan and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement North (SPLM-N) to engage in an inclusive political process to resolve the ongoing conflict.The UN Security Council on 2 May and 17 May adopted Resolutions demanding that both Sudan and South Sudan fulfil their obligations under international law to allow access by humanitarian agencies to civilian populations in need of assistance.Since the adoption of the UN Security Council Resolutions, there has reportedly been some calming of the tensions between Khartoum and Juba.  However, the issue of humanitarian access has remained unclear, despite continuing pressure from the EU and other parties.  On 27 June, the Sudanese Government finally approved a Tripartite Proposal by the African Union, the Arab League and the United Nations for the delivery of humanitarian assistance to civilians in the areas held by the SPLM-N.  This nine point agreement provides for the right to humanitarian assistance to the Sudanese affected by the conflict in the Blue Nile and South Kordofan without discrimination and the immediate cessation of hostilities in the region. It also includes a joint plan between the Sudanese Government and the UN to deliver humanitarian relief to those in need in both states.We are in contact with a range of parties on the ground, but unfortunately there is no clarity yet as to whether the new deal on humanisation access is actually being implemented.  I very much share the concerns expressed by the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, Valerie Amos, who has called for urgent access to all of the communities affected by the conflict.  It is vital that neutral, impartial, independent and experienced humanitarian workers can reach these people to assess their needs and to immediately deliver the assistance necessary for their survival.The Government has provided substantial assistance for those affected by the conflict in this region.  Earlier this year, I approved an allocation of €2 million for the UN-managed Common Humanitarian Funds for both the Republic of Sudan and South Sudan.  On 24 May, in recognition of deterioration in the humanitarian situation I announced a further funding allocation of €3m.  These funds are being provided to help UN agencies and NGOs target the most critical humanitarian needs across both countries, including in areas affected by conflict and by displacement of populations from the Blue Nile and South Kordofan areas.  In addition, almost €1.5 million in assistance has been allocated to a number of key Irish NGO partners, including Goal, Trócaire and World Vision for programmes in Sudan and South Sudan under the annual Irish Aid Humanitarian Programme Planning funding scheme.We will continue to monitor closely the situation in South Kordofan, Blue Nile, and other affected areas of both countries.  Together with other EU Member States, we will continue to press for unrestricted humanitarian access to affected civilians.  We also stand ready to provide further assistance to our partner agencies as needs are identified on the ground.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	567	The 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid set out clearly the basis and priorities for Ireland's official aid programme, which is working on behalf of the Irish people to improve the lives of the world's poorest people.  The programme has been recognised internationally for its focus on poverty and hunger, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, and for its leadership in making aid more effective.The Review of the White Paper on Irish Aid is one of the commitments contained in the Programme for Government. We wanted to carry out such a Review to examine the progress being made in our aid programme, to assess the changed context, globally and here at home, and to set out our future priorities.A very vibrant public consultation was undertaken for the Review between February and April of this year, which was overseen by the independent Irish Aid Expert Advisory Group. We met over 1,000 people across Ireland and in our partner countries, and received 165 written submissions. We also undertook consultation across Government Departments and in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It was encouraging to see so many Members of the Oireachtas participate in these consultations. In particular I would like to acknowledge the written responses that we received from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, and others.The contributions made during the consultation period are now being examined carefully and work is beginning on the Report on the Review of the White Paper. I intend that the Report and its recommendations will be submitted to Cabinet for approval in October, and that it will then be published.

Ireland's Consul General in Atlanta, Paul Gleeson, travelled to Florida on Thursday and met with the affected students to offer support and any available consular assistance. As in all such cases, we will continue to monitor developments closely and to provide all appropriate consular assistance, including by helping to relay messages to family in Ireland and by providing emergency travel documentation where the need arises.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	569	As we know from our own history, population growth is an enormously complex, multi-dimensional issue. The challenges posed by a rapidly expanding world population need to be addressed by tackling the root causes of that expansion. In poor countries, extreme poverty, food insecurity, inequality, high death rates and high birth rates are all linked in a vicious cycle. Irish Aid, Ireland's official development aid programme, is focused on dealing with these challenges and breaking that cycle.Investing in health, particularly sexual and reproductive health, and in education for women and girls is fundamental.Women and girls who have at least completed primary school have fewer children. Women who can access information on family planning options and safe, effective and affordable contraception use it to plan their family size in a way that maximises their own potential and that of their children.Providing women with access to reproductive health care also has a transformative effect on women's vulnerability to poverty, hunger and economic and social discrimination. The Government's aid programme, administered by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, aims to address the root causes of poverty.Rapid population growth alone is not the cause of poverty. The situation is more complex:poverty actually drives high population growth. Irish Aid responds to this challenge through our work in our priority countries and through our engagement with the multilateral system. In 2010, for instance, through Irish Aid, the Government provided €145 million in support to the health and education sectors in our nine partner countries and through global level partnerships. Since 2006, we have provided almost €30 million to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to support better reproductive health services for women in the developing world.In 2011, as a member of UNFPA's Executive Board, Ireland worked to develop strategies and programmes that reach the poorest and most vulnerable women and allow them to make real choices over their lives.We have recently joined the international Partnership for Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health which promotes access to family planning.Ireland's aid programme is strongly focused on sub-Saharan Africa, where the challenge of population growth is acute.  In Ethiopia, our support for the Health Extension Programme has seen impressive growth in the uptake of contraception in rural areas.  In both Tanzania and Mozambique, Irish support for the health sector has contributed to better delivery of district level reproductive health care. In Lesotho, in partnership with the Clinton Health Access Initiative, we have contributed to improved access to family planning by women living in very remote mountain villages. The international community has made real progress on many important development goals in the last ten years.School enrolment and child health have improved, child deaths have been reduced and access to clean water and sanitation has been expanded. With just three years remaining for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals we are committed to helping repeat this level of progress in the area of reproductive health.

In addition to their country of primary accreditation, many Ambassadors are also accredited to additional countries on a non-resident basis.  There are also 94 Honorary Consuls located in 54 locations around the world which assist primarily with consular functions on behalf of my Department.  Our Missions abroad are actively involved in representing and advancing Government policies with other States and in international organisations, in particular the EU and the UN; economic and cultural promotion; providing frontline consular and passport services to Irish citizens overseas; engaging with Irish communities and harnessing the resource they offer in assisting economic recovery; and managing programmes, particularly in Irish Aid priority countries.Our Embassy network works very closely with the State Agencies which have a remit for the promotion of Irish trade, tourism and inward investment — Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia, Tourism Ireland and IDA Ireland — and other relevant Departments in assisting Irish producers to find and access new markets.The scale and presence of the Irish diplomatic network is a matter that is kept under ongoing review in the light of changing circumstances and needs.  Given the current budgetary situation, and recognising the role that our diplomatic network is playing in Ireland's economic recovery, any further adjustments to our diplomatic network will continue to be strategically focused.While any reduction in the number of Embassies in Dublin is to be regretted, it is a matter for each State to make decisions on where it deploys its diplomatic network. Likewise, for Ireland, we will continue to make our own decisions on where we have a Mission on the basis of an assessment of what best serves the interests of the State and our people.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	571	In December 2011 the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees and the Government of Iraq agreed a process for the closure of Camp Ashraf in Iraq, whose terms were accepted by the camp residents.   This process began in February, under the supervision of the UNHCR and the UN Special Representative Martin Kobler.  Of the 3,400 residents in Camp Ashraf, about 2,000 have now transferred to Camp Hurriya near Baghdad. This is designated as a Temporary Transit Location from which the residents will move on to permanent accommodation in other countries, which both the residents and the Iraqi authorities now agree is the desired solution.  The transfer process to Camp Hurriya is a difficult one, with great distrust and suspicion between the two sides.In Camp Hurriya, the UNHCR is processing the individual residents and determining where best to relocate them.  The UNHCR is encouraging countries to make places available for those residents who do not already have an entitlement to resettlement elsewhere.The protection and human rights of the residents during this process are concerns for Ireland, its EU partners and the wider international community. The EU has enunciated a series of essential principles in relation to Camp Ashraf and its residents:1. Iraq is once again a fully sovereign state, no longer under the tutelage of either the US or the UN.  It has sovereignty over the camps, and is within its rights in seeking to move Camp Ashraf away from the Iranian border.2. Equally, however, this means that the Government of Iraq is responsible for the safety and humane treatment of the residents.3. There must be no question of forced return of any residents to Iran — and the Iraqi authorities have accepted this.4. The process under the UNHCR is the agreed — and only — means of resolving the situation of Camp Ashraf, and should be adhered to.In relation to the living conditions in Camp Hurriya, I call on the Iraqi authorities to allow all reasonable provision for the safety and comfort of the residents, including the transfer of personal property from Camp Ashraf. In doing so, we recognize that it is the judgement of the UNHCR that Camp Hurriya is of an acceptable standard to accommodate refugees. The precise status of this camp is a matter for the UNHCR and the Iraqi authorities.

For its part, the Government has expressed its strong view that any future arrangements must avoid fragmentation of the Union and that maintaining the integrity of the Single Market is a matter of the highest importance.At the European Council meeting on 28/29 June, President Van Rompuy presented his report "Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union" to the Heads of State and Government. He identified four ‘building blocks':an integrated financial framework;an integrated budgetary framework with commensurate steps towards common debt issuance;an integrated economic policy framework; andstrengthened democratic legitimacy and accountability.President Van Rompuy has now been invited to develop these ideas, in close cooperation with the Presidents of the Commission, ECB and Eurogroup, and to come forward with a specific and time-bound roadmap for the achievement of a genuine economic and monetary union.He will examine what can be done within the current Treaties and which measures would require Treaty change. He will make an interim report in October and a final report before the end of December 2012.Ireland has a very strong national interest in a robust and stable currency, in a strong and coherent European Union, and the Government looks forward to engaging with President Van Rompuy in this important work over the period ahead.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	574	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the terms and conditions of approval of airports by the Revenue Commissioners, as a place for the arrival of aircraft from outside the State, requires the operator/proprietor/licensee of each airport to notify Customs of all arrivals and to maintain a record of all such arrivals.   In general, customs controls at small airports are risk-based and carried out by mobile Revenue staff.  In the event of an unscheduled landing by a flight from abroad, the person in charge of the airport is required to report to Customs giving details of the landing, the pilot, the registration of the aircraft, whether there are goods or passengers on board, place from where the aircraft came and is destined, whether the landing was a forced landing outside the control of the pilot and whether the pilot expects to be able to continue the flight.  This information is used for risk assessment by Customs and will determine what action is necessary.It is important to note by way of context that the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systemic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than for anti-smuggling checks. This is particularly relevant in the case of the smaller airports outside of Dublin, Cork and Shannon where passenger traffic is predominantly intra-Community. In fact some of the smaller airports have no international flights at all. In this context, Revenue's approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	575	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that arrangements have been in place for some time, between the operators/ proprietors/licensees at the airports in question and the Revenue Customs Service, to ensure that all unscheduled flights arriving into these airports are notified to Customs. These arrangements are working well and the Commissioners are satisfied, insofar as possible, that all unscheduled flights have been properly notified.    All aircraft arrivals at Ireland West Airport Knock, Sligo and Galway are monitored on an ongoing basis and, based on risk analysis, profiling, review of intelligence and other factors, a decision is made on whether Customs inspection is deemed necessary.  Passengers and crew from all aircraft, including private aircraft, entering the State are subject to the same checks, including individual profiling, physical inspection/examination by Customs, and screening by a drug detector dog.The risk of smuggling (including drug smuggling) using unscheduled flights is fully appreciated by Revenue and is the subject of continuous assessment and risk analysis. Each airport is the subject of a formal risk assessment process that has regard to the nature of the facility, traffic frequency, routes, national and international seizure trends, specific intelligence and other risk indicators.  Traffic with origins and destinations with a high-risk rating attract particular interest. The level of assessed risk at each location then informs the frequency of physical inspections. This approach is similar to that employed throughout the EU, is in keeping with recognised best practice and represents the most effective deployment of scarce resources.Finally, it should be noted that the terms and conditions of approval of each of the airports in question by the Revenue Commissioners, as a place for the arrival of aircraft from outside the State, require the operator/proprietor/licensee of each airport to notify Customs of all arrivals and to maintain a record of all such arrivals.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	576	I propose to take Questions Nos. 103 to 105, inclusive, together.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that Statutory Instrument (S.I.) 353/1994 Disabled Driver and Disabled Passenger Regulations outline the provisions under which certain vehicles may qualify for relief from VRT and VAT when used for the transportation of disabled passengers.Regulation 2 of the above mentioned S.I. outlines a "qualifying organisation" and Regulation 3 outlines the medical grounds under which a disabled person may be assessed.Regulations 16 and 17 outline the provisions under which fuel rebates and motor tax remissions are allowed.There have been no recent changes to the provisions of S.I. 353/1994.However, I have also been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it has come to their attention that occasions have arisen where relief from VRT and VAT on a vehicle was allowed to organisations which are primarily funded by the State. As the provisions of S.I. 353/1994 do not apply to such organisations, procedures were put in place to ensure that relief for the payment of VRT and VAT is only allowed on vehicles purchased by "qualifying organisations" as provided for in legislation.In addition it was also brought to the Commissioners' attention that relief of the residual VRT was allowed to qualifying individuals on the purchase of used vehicles in the State where no VRT was paid in the first instance, e.g. on the purchase of a used vehicle by a qualifying individual where the relief was granted to an earlier owner of the vehicle who had previously qualified for the relief.Consequently procedures were put in place to ensure that relief for the payment of VRT and VAT will only be allowed to qualifying persons or organisations in situations where the person or organisation has borne or paid VAT, VRT or residual VRT in respect of a vehicle or in respect of the adaptation of a vehicle.  If the VRT on a vehicle has been fully refunded at an earlier date under the scheme, there is no residual VRT available to be refunded on a subsequent sale to a second qualifying person and this should be reflected in the price of vehicle at the time of resale.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	577	All fruit juices, soft drinks, bottled water and smoothies are subject to the standard VAT rate, currently 23%.  The standard rate is the VAT rate applied to such products in the majority of EU Member States.  Prior to 1992 bottled waters and fruit juices had applied at the zero rate, but were made subject to the standard rate from 1 November 1992 in order to correct a competitive anomaly, as similar competing products such as soft drinks were standard rated. The change in the VAT treatment coincided with the removal of excise duty from bottled water.   Where a product was zero rated prior to 1 January 1991 but subsequently standard rated, it is not possible to reintroduce the zero rate for that product.  However, under Annex III of the EU VAT Directive, Member States are permitted to apply a reduced rate of not less than 5% to soft drinks, bottled water and fruit juices.  It would therefore be possible to apply our reduced rate of 9% or 13.5% to these drinks.  However, a reduction in the rate of VAT on such products would be costly to the Exchequer and I have no plans to reduce the rate of VAT on bottled water, fruit juices or smoothies.

There are a number of statutory prohibitions on deductions and these are set out in Section 81, Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. In addition, a deduction in respect of entertainment expenses is expressly forbidden. Where the cost of a training course is reimbursed to a staff member, the Revenue Commissioners will normally allow a deduction to the employer on the basis that the cost is incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade — from the company's point of view such a cost would normally be included as part of its staff costs for the year.   Tax relief is also available under Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, subject to certain conditions and thresholds, at the standard rate of income tax (20%), for qualifying fees paid by an individual in respect of a third level education course including part-time and postgraduate courses. An individual can claim tax relief on fees paid by him/her in respect of an approved third level course pursued by him/her and on fees paid by him/her in respect of an approved course pursued by other individuals.Section 476 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, also provides tax relief for fees paid by individuals for training courses in the areas of information technology and foreign languages.  The training courses, which can be up to two years duration, must be approved by FÁS.  The tax relief, which is at the standard rate of tax, is available for fees of up to €1,270, subject to a minimum amount of €315.  To qualify for the relief, the individual must receive a certificate of competence on completion of the course.

I understand from the Central Bank that based on current construction programme projections and planning time lines, it is expected that the Central Bank would occupy the new building on the North Quays by the second quarter of 2015.The Bank has stated on a previous occasion that any relocation of its headquarters may involve the retention of some activities in its building on Dame Street for a number of years in any event, as the relocation would not take place quickly.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	580	I propose to take Questions Nos. 109 and 110 together.I understand that comprehensive analysis of the options to support the provision of affordable and accessible childcare was undertaken in 2005.Having considered the options available, the then Government introduced the early childcare supplement, providing a direct payment to all families with young children. In addition, certain other incentives were introduced in order to encourage an increase in the supply of childcare places.At that time, tax relief for childcare costs was considered but not introduced, as it would only have been of benefit to those in the tax net and would most likely have been absorbed by childcare providers in the form of higher prices. Analysis showed that a standard rated childcare costs allowance of €4,000 per annum would cost the Exchequer €64 million per annum and would have resulted in a reduced liability to income tax of only €15 per week for those availing of it.The Deputy will be aware that the early childcare supplement has since been abolished as the measure was very costly, poorly targeted and possibly led to increased charges. In its stead, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, which provides for a free pre-school year for children in the year before commencing primary school, was introduced.In my view the concerns raised in the 2005 analysis regarding tax relief for childcare costs are still valid. This is particularly the case considering the major changes in the economy that have occurred in the intervening period. Furthermore, I would have concerns about basing any analysis of the cost of making childcare tax deductible on data provided in reports that were compiled five years ago.To allocate already stretched resources to complete the analysis requested would not, in my view, be an efficient use of these resources. This is especially the case where it is likely that the cost of such a tax relief would be prohibitive for the State at the current time. Furthermore, I am not in a position to release funding to you for the commissioning of such an analysis. Requests for expenditure might be more appropriately addressed to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.

Along with Euribor, it is a benchmark for interest rates around the world.  Additionally Libor and Euribor are commonly used as reference rates for interest rate swaps and other derivative instruments.  The integrity of these benchmark reference rates is of fundamental importance to international financial markets.Barclays Bank has been fined by the UK Financial Services Authority, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the US Department of Justice for attempted manipulation of Libor and Euribor rates.  A number of international investigations are ongoing, including one by the European Commission, and the British Bankers Association is currently undertaking a review of the way Libor is set and is expected to publish its findings shortly.Allied Irish Bank and Bank of Ireland are members of the panel of 43 European banks which contribute quotes for the setting of Euribor but are not involved in the setting of LIBOR, the London Interbank Offered Rate.I am informed by the NTMA that both NTMA and NAMA have substantial portfolios of derivative products, some of which use Libor (or Euribor) as the reference rates.  However, much of that exposure is reduced by netting. The NTMA will continue to monitor the situation in order to asses any potential impact on the Exchequer.I am informed by the Central Bank that this event may have had a very limited impact for some of the financial entities operating here, on account of the widespread usage of LIBOR as a reference price by most banks, including those in Ireland. Thus far the Central Bank has not received any complaints from the regulated banks nor have there been any issues raised with the Central Bank on this issue. In the course of its normal regulatory engagement with the banks it will raise this topic as appropriate.

This issue has been ongoing for far too long at this stage and the Bank is fully aware of my position in terms of the need to have the matter resolved as a priority.   The Central Bank is closely monitoring the situation to ensure that it is resolved as quickly as possible. In that respect, the Central Bank has officials on the ground in Ulster Bank to ensure that immediate priority is given to the backlog issue and ensuring that all customers accounts are brought up to date as soon as possible. The Central Bank has also indicted that they will be putting in place a full restitution regime for all persons that have been impacted and that it will work with the Irish Credit Bureau to ensure that customer ratings are not impacted.The current focus is to get all transactions processed and following that Ulster Bank has said that they will commence the process of refunding customers for any interest or fees and charges that have occurred as a result of this incident. I was pleased to note that the Bank has given a commitment that no customer would be out of pocket arising from the disruption caused by the problems at the Bank.

Notwithstanding this, AIB considers each action on a case by case basis and will adopt an approach which best protects AIB's financial and legal position as it seeks to recover outstanding amounts owed regardless of the jurisdiction involved.PTSB:I am advised that PTSB also adopt an approach to best protect the Bank's right to seek repayment of all outstanding debt in a fair and equitable manner regardless of the jurisdiction involved.IBRC:I am advised by IBRC that the approach of the Bank is to work constructively with each borrower on an individual basis to identify the most appropriate loan repayment plan. IBRC takes a very serious view of borrowers seeking bankruptcy in other jurisdictions as a means of circumventing the repayment of monies owed to the Bank. Where necessary, and as has occurred previously, the Bank will pursue borrowers to ensure bankruptcy is declared in what it deems to be the correct jurisdiction, with the ultimate goal of maximising recovery of loans for the Bank.

In managing its liquidity needs, NAMA must ensure that it has available liquidity over the medium term to meet all of its contractual obligations as they fall due. Such obligations, as outlined, include its day-to-day operating costs, investment to improve the value of the assets underpinning the loans, coupon payments due on its bonds and derivative contract payments. Furthermore, the Agency also provides an important stimulus to the construction sector in the form of advances to debtors for working capital and project funding, some of which is required at short notice. I am advised that updated liquidity projections, based on these various expected inflows and outflows, are reviewed on a monthly basis by the NAMA Board.     In terms of cash management in NAMA, I am advised that cash is either placed on deposit with approved counterparties or the Central Bank or it is invested in qualifying liquid assets (short-term Irish Government securities). In this way the liquidity position of NAMA is actively used to support the ongoing financial commitments of the State.As the Deputy will be aware, the NTMA successfully auctioned € 500m three-month Irish treasury bills on 5 July at an issue yield of 1.8%. I welcome this success which had a bid to cover ratio of 2.8 times and I view it as a very important milestone on Ireland's continuing path to recovery. The interest rate charged by NAMA on the IBRC deal was in line with the commercial terms charged by Bank of Ireland at 2.35% and was higher than the rate paid on the short-term bills issued last week.In relation to the ministerial direction to NAMA on the IBRC financing facility, I should remind the Deputy that this was a short-term interim measure and had been required pending the consent of Bank of Ireland's shareholders' to the IBRC financing arrangement and followed intense discussions on the matter with our European partners.Any such future decision to use NAMA funds under Ministerial direction would be given a similar level of consideration.

NAMA is not prescriptive as to when it will approve payments in the case of unsecured creditors.  Each case is assessed by reference to its own circumstances. This often involves providing the debtor with temporary support so as to give NAMA an opportunity to assess the scope for reaching long-term agreements with them. Very often that involves meeting their short-term liabilities so that they can remain in business.   In cases where the process does not lead to a consensual arrangement with a debtor, enforcement is initiated. In those circumstances, an insolvency practitioner appointed by NAMA is required only to realise the value of NAMA's fixed or floating charges over assets. Understandably, he is not under any obligation to unsecured creditors. In an insolvency situation the ultimate outcome for all creditors will depend on the nature and ranking of their charges. In all cases, NAMA's primary objective is to protect the interests of taxpayers.

However, if it does, this on its own would not be sufficient for the exemption to apply, as only the son holds a certificate.Where the exemption is not available, Stamp Duty is chargeable at the rate of 2% on the purchase price.

This working group had a series of meetings to discuss issues of concern to the haulage industry. I have recently received a submission from the group and I am considering the matters raised. I note the recent trend in falling oil prices and I hope that this continued fall is reflected in the price of fuel for consumers including hauliers at the pumps.   The Deputy may also wish to note that provision was made in the Finance Act 2012 for a strengthened and extended licensing system for mineral oil traders, which will require traders in marked oils to be licensed for that purpose. In parallel with these changes, the Revenue Commissioners have recently made regulations that put in place new requirements in relation to the recording and reporting of oil movements. In particular, traders will have to submit returns to the Revenue Commissioners monthly giving details of fuel transactions. Action is being taken also to obtain an improved fuel marker. The Irish and UK revenue authorities published a joint ‘Invitation to Make Submissions' (IMS) on 28th June for a new fuel marker. The IMS was also published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 4 July 2012.

Taxpayers, however, are not required to separately identify the country of origin of pension income on tax returns and in the time available, the Commissioners are unable to provide up-to-date details of the number of taxpayers returning foreign-sourced pensions.  The following details are the position as at January 2012, for the tax year 2009, in relation to the number of cases reporting a pension.  This is the latest date for which figures are readily available.YearState Welfare pensionsOther foreign pensionsTotal200910,64610,88921,535I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are not in a position to provide an estimate of the amount of income tax that is not being collected on UK-sourced pensions. However the Commissioners advise that the figure of 114,948 quoted by the Deputy is not a reliable indicator of the scale of possible non-declaration.  A significant number of these people may not have any entitlement to a UK pension, or such entitlement may be small.In this context, it should be noted that the rates of UK Social Security pensions are small when compared to the general tax exemption from income tax granted to those aged 65 or over in this State, viz. where their annual income is less than €18,000 for single or widowed persons and less than €36,000 for married persons or those in a civil partnership.The question of information from other jurisdictions is affected by other countries Data Protection Laws, and in general can only arise in the context of Double Taxation Treaties.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they seek information from other tax administrations, under Treaty provisions, about foreign-sourced pensions paid to Irish resident individuals where they are dealing with specific cases. The Commissioners are aware that there are data exchange arrangements in place between the Department of Social Protection and their UK counterparts and they are exploring with the Department of Social Protection (DSP) the usefulness for tax purposes of information available to them, and the possibility of gaining access to such information having regard to Data Protection law and other legal provisions.

The amount of PAYE income tax, Universal Social Charge (USC), and employee PRSI that person would pay is €10,707.

Rather they are available, along with non-tax revenues, capital receipts as well as moneys sourced from borrowing to fund overall expenditure.The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform published the Revised Book of Estimates (REV) for 2012 in February. The REV sets out the voted expenditure allocations for every Government Department and Office, including for areas such as Social Protection, Health, Education, Justice and Agriculture. The REV therefore sets out the areas of voted expenditure that the tax revenues, non-tax revenues and capital receipts collected by the State as well as borrowing undertaken by the State are used to fund.National debt servicing in 2012 was estimated at €6,965 million by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) at the time of the Stability Programme Update (SPU) publication in late April. Last year's Census estimated the Irish population at just under 4.6 million. On this basis, an individual's share of total National debt servicing in 2012 is just under €1,520.As per the website of the NTMA, at end-June 2012 the State's National debt stood at €131.9 billion. Given an estimated population of just under 4.6 million, an individual's share of National debt outstanding at end-June 2012 is just under €28,750.This year's Exchequer deficit was estimated at €18,655 million in the SPU. Given an estimated population of just under 4.6 million, an individual's share of this year's Exchequer deficit is approximately €4,065. Note that this deficit estimate included, as part of non-voted capital expenditure, €3,060 million in respect of the IBRC Promissory Note although settlement of this payment was with a Government bond.As regards 2013 it is not yet possible to provide the Deputy with the detailed information as voted expenditure allocations for 2013 have not yet been decided.

This message has been echoed by the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other Ministers in meetings with their EU colleagues.   The specific mention of Ireland in the statement issued following the summit is a welcome development and is the result of intensive discussions over the past year. It shows that there is widespread recognition for the measures this country has implemented and the significant sacrifices that Irish people have taken to bring our public finances under control.This is an agreement in principle which provides an opportunity for the issue of bank debt to be addressed at an EU level. As the details have yet to be worked out, it is too early to say at this time what the precise implications of the announcement will be.Preliminary discussions on how to separate Irish banking debt from sovereign debt are underway, with a view to concluding in October, but I do not want to prejudice them by commenting on the likely contents of any agreement at this time. Because of their complexity the discussions are likely to take some time. Our shared objective, agreed with our European colleagues is to break the link between banks and sovereigns and we are open to discussing any method of doing this.This announcement is undoubtedly a positive development for Ireland. However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that notwithstanding the very considerable negative effect State support for the banking system has had on the public finances, including the debt level, there remains a large gap between day to day spending and revenues. This needs to be closed so as to enhance further the long-term sustainability of our public finances.

This would prevent any distortion of activity within the Union.The Deputy will be aware that following the ECOFIN meeting on 22 July, the Commission's proposal to introduce an FTT on an EU-wide basis will not now proceed and certain Member States are going to ask the Commission to propose that the tax be introduced via the "enhanced co-operation" mechanism in those states which are willing to introduce the tax.Ireland is opposed in principle to enhanced co-operation in tax matters and will not be one of the enhanced co-operation countries.  Our decision not to participate is consistent with the position we previously expressed that the tax should be introduced on at least an EU-wide basis.  However, I indicated at the ECOFIN meeting that we would not stand in the way of those countries who wish to introduce an FTT.  We will continue to monitor the issue, in particular to ensure the compatibility of any proposed measure with the internal market and with existing taxes on financial transactions such as our Stamp Duty on transfers of shares in Irish companies.I received the ESRI/Central Bank of Ireland report into the FTT in late April.  I did not publish the report immediately because my officials and I needed time to examine it.  It has proven useful in our consideration of the issues surrounding the FTT.

This review will include a focus on lessons learned which will then be utilised in the Bank's on-going oversight of operational risks faced by all banks. In addition, the Irish Payments Services Organisation (in conjunction with the Central Bank) have commissioned an independent review of the risk assessment methodologies applied by clearing companies such as the Irish Paper Clearing Company and the Irish Retail Electronic Clearing Company.On the completion of the reviews mentioned, I would expect that, should the Central Bank need to examine and strengthen its procedures, they will do so.   It is important that the Central Bank satisfies itself that all requirements are met by credit institutions to avoid the occurrence of similar IT problems  in the future.

For these reasons, Revenue focuses on deterring shadow/hidden economy activity and non-compliance through its audit and investigation programmes based on risk analysis, use of Revenue powers and their intelligence and information systems. Last year Revenue carried out 11,066 audits resulting in a yield of €440.46 million. The Revenue approach to the shadow economy is underpinned by close consultation and cooperation with the Department of Social Protection. The primary objective of these activities is to uncover either non-declaration or under declaration of income and/or fraudulent DSP claims. In addition, there is continuing strengthening of legislation to provide for a robust framework within which the Revenue Commissioners may tackle tax and duty evasion. Revenue has a prioritised focus on those sectors that traditionally have been susceptible to shadow activity such as cash businesses. In order to inform the approaches they are taking and help determine where resources may best be deployed, Revenue have engaged on a series of meetings with trade and representative bodies. Increasingly they are finding that bodies and individuals are prepared to share insights and specific information with Revenue with regard to shadow economy activity in times of recession. Revenue is deepening their engagement with the representative bodies and has set up regional shadow economy liaison groups. Any additional information campaign should be considered in the context of measures already in place.8(a) Mandate the introduction of electronic payments by all Government and State agencies by end 2012.A very similar goal is included as part of the Croke Park agreement and this is being worked towards in that context. Under the SEPA regulation the Irish government is committed to migrating the civil service to SEPA compliant payment systems by end Q1-2013. This will facilitate further the introduction of electronic payments.8(b) Remove Professional Services Withholding Tax for service providers.After careful consideration, and in light of the effect that this measure would have on the Exchequer returns, it is not proposed to abolish PSWT for service providers at this time.8(b) Consider a reduction in the preliminary tax requirement from 100 percent to 75 percent for small firms until 2013.After careful consideration, and in light of the effect that this measure would have on the Exchequer returns, it is not proposed to introduce this measure at this time.

This Group has considered the recommendations, including the recommendation that overall responsibility for the General Government Debt (GGD) compilation and reporting processes should be centralised in one organisation.  In response to this it has been agreed by my Department and the Central Statistics Office (CSO) that the primary responsibility for this is to be transferred to CSO.   Given the complex nature of the processes and the amount of work involved in the compilation of the necessary data, it is envisaged that CSO will take over primary responsibility for the Excessive Deficit Procedure Returns required under the Maastricht Treaty for the transmission due in March 2013.

The NAMA Senior Bonds held by Permanent TSB were received in February 2011 as part of the transfer of the former INBS deposit book to PTSB under the transfer order issued by the previous Minister for Finance. As set out in the transfer order, the deposit book and corresponding assets (including € 2.89 billion of NAMA Senior Bonds) transferred to NAMA at that time. Previous to the most recent bond redemption PTSB held € 2.77 billion and following this redemption PTSB hold € 2.575 billion of NAMA Senior Bonds.The text of the transfer order and other details are available on the Department of Finance website: www.finance.gov.ie.

Ireland contributed €345.7 million (net of a 50 basis points service charge) in respect of the first two tranches of the loan in 2010. Ireland withdrew from participation in the facility when we entered the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support.This amount was accounted for as a loan under non-voted capital expenditure.Interest payments on the loan in respect of Ireland's contribution to the facility are due quarterly and are calculated on the full nominal amount of the loan (i.e., including the 50 basis points service charge). The original loan agreement provided that the principal would be repayable quarterly over two years starting in 2013 and that the rate of interest, which is variable, would be based on three-month EURIBOR (the average rate at which euro interbank term deposits are being offered by one prime bank to another within the EMU zone) plus a margin of three hundred basis points (3 percentage points) for the first three years and four hundred basis points subsequently. However, the lending countries agreed in 2011 to extend the grace period and term of the loans and to reduce the margin in the interest rate charged to Greece to 100 basis points (one percentage point). As a result, the principal on Ireland's loan to Greece is due to be repaid over five years beginning in June 2020.The total amount of interest received by Ireland on the loan to date is €25.96 million.As the Deputy will be aware, Greece came to an agreement with its private sector creditors in March 2012 which allowed it to restructure debt held by banks and other private investors. However, that restructuring and the consequent losses for investors did not apply to loans under the Euro Area Loan Facility under which Ireland provided a loan to Greece in 2010.

Bus Éireann are currently processing applications for school transport for the 2012/13 school year. The number and size of vehicles required will be determined by the number of eligible pupils whose applications are finalised by the deadline date at the end of July.  Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport to a particular school on a concessionary basis in accordance with the terms of the scheme.Children who applied for enrolment in their nearest school but who did not secure a place may have their school transport eligibility considered by reference to the distance they reside from their next nearest school. This consideration will only apply where my Department is satisfied that the child's nearest school does not have the capacity to enrol additional first year pupils.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	605	The current European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) Regulation expires on 31 December 2013. On 6 October 2011, the European Commission tabled a proposal for a new Regulation for the period 2014-2020 to the European Council and European Parliament.Substantive discussions on the Commission proposal commenced in the European Council Working Party on Social Questions in early 2012 under the Danish Presidency of the EU and are currently ongoing. Ireland is taking a full and active part in these discussions. A progress report on this dossier was presented to the EPSCO Council of Ministers on 21 June 2012. The current Cypriot Presidency of the EU is seeking to progress the dossier to finalisation if possible. If not, the dossier will fall to be progressed during the Irish Presidency in 2013.Ireland continues to be a strong supporter of the EGF given the important contribution it makes to co-financing approved active labour market programmes in support of eligible redundant workers in this country.It is not possible at this time, and given that discussions on the dossier are ongoing, to surmise whether, or in what form, the Fund will continue in 2014. However, Ireland is negotiating in Council on the basis that the Fund should and will continue.The proposal to include both the self-employed and farmers in the scope of the new Regulation is a significant broadening of the existing position. Ireland is not opposed in principle to these elements of the proposal and together with their colleagues in the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, my officials will be seeking the most positive national outcome in the continuing discussions.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I propose to take Questions Nos. 142 and 151 together.Higher education institutions are autonomous bodies and the level of tuition fees charged for their Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM) programmes, is a matter for the institutions themselves to determine. Accordingly I have no role in the matter. The prerequisite for entry to GEM programmes is an Upper Second or First Class Honours Bachelor's degree in any discipline. GEM students therefore are pursuing a second undergraduate degree and are not eligible for free fees or for student grants. However in order to widen access the fees of EU students are partly subsidised by the State through the Higher Education Authority. For the 2011/12 academic year this subsidy amounted to €11,000 per EU student. In addition the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides tax relief, at the standard rate, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses. I appreciate that for individual students having to meet those fees can be difficult and therefore it is a matter of regret if the loan package in question has been withdrawn by the bank.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	608	The graduate entry medicine (GEM) programme commenced in 2007/08 and has an annual EU intake of 240 students in four institutions: UCD (77), UCC (38), UL (95) and RCSI (30). Information regarding the numbers who have undertaken these programmes is not readily available. I have asked the Higher Education Authority to collate this data and it will be forwarded to the deputy when available. Each institution is responsible for setting its tuition fees which, in 2011/2012, were as follows: UCD (€13,915), UCC (€13,580), UL (€13,915) and RCSI (€15,940).  The fees of EU students are partly subsidised by the State through the Higher Education Authority. For 2011/12 this subsidy amounted to €11,000 per EU student.The establishment of a Graduate Medicine Programme was a specific recommendation of the Report of the Working Group on Undergraduate Medical Education and Training (the ‘Fottrell Report') published in 2006. The Report made a number of recommendations in relation to the reform of medical education and training. It specifically saw the introduction of GEM as a means to increase the number of EU medicine graduates in the context of an evolving health care system and growing population needs. The first cohort of students graduated in 2011.

The Five Year school building programme is focused on meeting those demographic needs.I wish to advise you that my Department is considering the school's request in consultation with my Department's inspectorate. Department officials have been in contact with the Principal of the school and have conveyed this information to him.

The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department's Staffing Circular 0007/2012 that is now published on my Department's website. In these extremely challenging times, all public servants are being asked to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources and teachers in small schools cannot be immune from this requirement.It is anticipated that the staffing arrangements for the 2013/14 school year, including the appeal process will be published in early 2013.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of such supports and the staffing resources available to my Department.There is no automatic system of transfer of resources from one school to another. In considering applications for teaching and SNA supports for individual pupils, the SENOs take account of the pupils' needs and consider the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.Schools had been advised to apply to the NCSE for resource teaching and SNA support for the 2012/13 school year by 16th March, 2012 and schools are currently being notified by SENOs of their resource teaching and SNA allocation for 2012/13, based on the number of valid applications received and, in the case of SNA support, the extent of the care needs of qualifying children.SNAs should be deployed by schools in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

These consisted of twenty new primary schools and twenty new post-primary schools. This announcement did not include a proposal to establish a new primary school in the areas referred to by the Deputies.On foot of recommendations in the Report of the Advisory Group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector, I recently announced an Action Plan to progress divesting Catholic schools in certain areas.Surveying will be carried out in five pilot areas initially in October this year and surveys in the balance of the forty four areas will take place in November. The 44 initial areas where surveys of parental preferences will be carried out include the Dublin 6 and 8 districts.The outcome of the initial surveys will then be made available to the relevant school patrons who will be asked to come forward with divesting options in line with parental preferences within the areas. Full details of the Action Plan are available on my Department's website www.education.ie.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	616	I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is an independent agency with responsibility for determining the appropriate staffing levels in relation to the support of pupils with special educational needs in mainstream and special schools. The NCSE operates within my Department's established criteria for the allocation of supports to schools and the staffing resources available to my Department.The Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate of me to intervene in the resource allocation process which would be to compromise the independence of the role of the NCSE as set out in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, 2004.As I advised the Deputy in my PQ reply of 21 June, the NCSE has confirmed that the SNA allocation for the school in question for the 2012/13 school year is a sufficient level of support to cater for the care needs of all qualifying children in the context of the applications received for the 2012/13 school year. Whereas I understand that schools may wish to maintain current staffing levels, the NCSE must ensure that where there are surplus SNA posts in a school, these must be redirected to meet the needs of children who need this valuable support.I am sure the Deputy will agree that at a time of constrained resources it is essential that SNA numbers are managed and deployed as prudently and as effectively as possible. Resources left in an area that are not in accordance with criteria mean public resources are not available for another deserving area. It is worth noting that this school has been allocated 12 SNA posts for the forthcoming school year, which is an extensive provision of resources by any measure.It is expected that schools seeking to have their SNA provision reviewed, before requesting any review of their SNA provision, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.  It is open to schools to contact their local SENO in this regard, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

The workshops focus on priority issues and challenges that arise for NQTs, and are intended to equip them with a range of effective strategies and skills that can be readily implemented in day-to-day classroom practice, across a range and variety of school contexts.  The workshops also provide networking opportunities and the professional support needed in making the transition from student to teacher. The National Induction Programme for Teachers (NIPT) develops and designs the workshops and the content of the workshops is reviewed on an ongoing basis, having regard to feedback received from NQTs and consultation with Colleges of Education. As the workshop programme evolves and develops, it is expected that the workshops will gradually introduce blended e-learning elements, as appropriate. The face-to-face elements of the workshop programme will continue to be an important feature of the NIPT programme.NQTs have three years to attend the twelve workshops and achieve full registration. NQTs can complete all workshops in any one of the three years, or spread their attendance at the workshops over the course of the three years. In certain extenuating circumstances, the Teaching Council may grant an extension to the three years.There is no fee applicable for attendance at the NQT workshop programme as these costs are covered by the Department of Education and Skills. The Teaching Council receives no income from the Induction programme.

The 2009 National Assessments of Mathematics and English Reading, which are the most recent in this series of national assessments, provide baseline data for future national assessments in English reading at second and sixth class but are not directly comparable with previous assessments. In 2009, test scores were grouped into four proficiency levels (clusters of skill-sets and competencies describing what pupils are likely to be able to do). Those proficiency levels are described in the report of the 2009 National Assessments, which is available on the website of the Educational Research Centre (www.erc.ie). To facilitate comparability across classes and subjects, the cutpoints used to create each proficiency scale were based on predefined percentages of pupils. Thus, 10% of pupils were classified as at Level 4; 25% at Level 3; 30% at Level 2; and 25% at Level 1, with 10% of pupils described as failing to reach Level 1. The next national assessments in 2014 will facilitate direct comparison with the 2009 results.The National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, which I launched in July 2011, contains a range of actions to improve the literacy and numeracy skills of children and young people up to 2020 and these actions are being implemented.

Mobile Bus Éireann Inspectors located throughout the country physically conduct these distance measurements where required; a GIS mapping solution may also be used to complement this process.  In cases where the distance eligibility is marginal or in dispute, vehicles fitted with calibrated measuring devices which measure the distance down to the nearest metre may be used to establish the exact distance.

Local Authorities have the power to decide on road safety measures outside schools to ensure that measures are in place to protect the safety of local school children.

A Fire Safety Certificate is a certificate granted by a Building Control Authority certifying that the building or works, if constructed in accordance with the plans, documents and information submitted to the authority as part of a planning application, would comply with the requirements of the current Building Regulations.The Building Regulations apply to the construction of new buildings and to extensions and material alterations to existing building and to certain changes of use of existing buildings.However, School Management Authorities have a responsibility to ensure that the School's Safety Statement includes an up to date Fire Safety Management Plan which would address fire safety in the building.  All schools should have fire drills and procedures in place for actions in the event of a fire including evacuating the building.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	630	Changes to the Post Primary School Transport Scheme were announced in Budget 2011 and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme.The main change to the current scheme means that from the 2012/13 school year, school transport eligibility for all pupils newly entering a post primary school will be determined by reference to the distance they reside from their nearest Post-Primary Education Centre having regard, as heretofore, to ethos and language.  In general, children who are currently eligible for, and who are availing of school transport, will retain their transport eligibility for the duration of their post primary education cycle unless there is a change in their current circumstances. Children who are not eligible for school transport may apply for transport to a particular school on a concessionary basis in accordance with the terms of the scheme.The planning and organising of school bus routes is an operational matter for Bus Éireann which operates the School Transport Schemes on behalf of my Department. Bus routes are planned in such a way as to ensure that, as far as possible, eligible children have a reasonable level of service while at the same time ensuring that school transport vehicles are utilised in an efficient and cost effective manner.  Services are reviewed over the summer months and may be altered or extended depending on the number of eligible children who apply for school transport, and pay the annual charge, for the following school year.

The particular institution concerned sets their own criteria as to the rate of fees to apply and the issue as to whether the student in question qualifies for the EU or non EU rate is a matter for the fees office of the institution concerned.I have no role in this matter however officials of my Department did make contact with the fees office of the institution concerned who confirmed that this student registered online and as he has a stamp 2 GNIB card was classified as an International student for the purposes of paying tuition fees at the non EU rate.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	632	Teacher allocations are approved annually in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. My Department has published the staffing arrangements at post primary level for the coming school year, 2012/13. The relevant Post Primary circular is 0009/2012 which is available on my Department's website. The staffing arrangements in schools for the 2012/2013 school year can also be affected by changes in their enrolment, the impact of budget measures and the reforms to the teacher allocation process.The reform of the teacher allocation process being introduced for the 2012/13 school year were designed to give a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools. The enhanced resources for schools that operated the LCA programme were redistributed so that support could also be given to new schools joining the programme. Previously schools joining the programme were allocated no additional teacher support.  The new arrangements are to operate on the basis of the standard allocation under the staffing schedule (18.25:1 in DEIS post-primary schools, 21:1 in fee-charging schools and 19:1 in all other post-primary schools)and an additional fixed allocation of 0.5 of a post to each school that operates the programme. This additional allocation of 0.5 of a post will be available to all new schools joining the programme.  The teacher allocation process at post-primary level is largely completed at this stage and all schools would have been notified accordingly.At post primary level, schools will have autonomy on how best to prioritise its available resources to meet its requirements in relation to guidance and the provision of an appropriate range of subjects to its students. Decisions on how this is done will be taken at school level and I am confident that schools will act in the best interest of students when determining precisely how to use the teaching resources available to them.

The arrangements for how schools access these resource hours in teaching posts are set out in the Department Staffing Circular 0007/2012. Under these arrangements a network of over 2,500 full-time resource posts has been put in place in close to 1,700 base schools throughout the country. The list of these schools and the criteria used to select them is set out in the published Circular.These resource posts are allocated on a permanent basis and the teachers in them will undertake NCSE approved (low incidence) resource hours in the base schools or in neighbouring schools. Schools that are unable to access these hours will be allocated mainly temporary part-time posts. It is also open to schools to make a joint application for a full-time temporary resource post.I understand that the school referred to by the Deputy has submitted such an application and my officials will be in contact with the school Board of Management in this regard.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	634	Changes to the Primary School Transport Scheme were announced in Budget 2011 and derived from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the Scheme. One of the changes announced means that from the beginning of the 2012/13 school year children will be eligible for school transport where they reside not less than 3.2 kilometres from and are attending their nearest national school, having regard to ethos and language.Existing eligible children, who are not attending their nearest school, will retain their school transport eligibility for the duration of their primary education cycle provided there are no changes to their current circumstances. Siblings of these children, who wish to attend the same school, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis only, subject to a number of conditions which are detailed in the scheme. In this regard, it is worth noting that the annual charge for concessionary tickets will be reduced to €100 for the 2012/13 school year which is the same charge that applies for eligible tickets.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	635	In September 2011, the school referred to by the Deputy was granted funding for the provision of 2 Mainstream Classrooms under my Department's Additional Accommodation Scheme. In May 2012 the school applied for additional funding for a sliding sound proof partition between both classrooms so that the school could use the rooms for assemblies, choir practice and parent meetings.  This application was refused and the school advised that any building works carried out over and above those approved must be funded by the Board of Management, as was set out in the Department's original letter of approval.I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that there are many competing demands on my Department's capital resources and in this context it must prioritise applications for the provision of much needed additional mainstream classroom accommodation.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	637	I propose to take Questions Nos. 174 and 175 together.Attention to information literacy is a feature of the NCCA's ICT Framework: A structured approach to ICT in Curriculum and Assessment (2007) which is available to all primary and post-primary schools. There are no specific initiatives underway at the moment on information literacy at primary level but information literacy is an integral part of a student's on-going education. It harnesses the young person's natural sense of wonder. The primary curriculum promotes the importance of ICT as a resource which enriches the quality of teaching and learning across the curriculum.The new Framework for Junior Cycle, proposed for introduction in schools in 2014, features six Key Skills that will be embedded in all junior cycle subjects and short courses. One of these is Managing Information and Thinking through which "learners improve their capacity to search for information from different sources. They also develop their skills in judging and discriminating between information. They develop strategies for organising information so that they can understand it and use it later" A key element of this skill is to "use ICT and digital media to access, manage and share knowledge".The new Junior Cycle Framework also provides for short courses to be introduced in schools, some of which will be developed by the NCCA and some by schools themselves. A short course that the NCCA is currently working on is in the area of Digital Literacy which includes topics such as information literacy, personal safety online, digital storytelling, and online privacy.The Senior Cycle curriculum explicitly espouses the central role of self-directed learning, a spirit of enquiry, critical thinking and problem solving. Recently revised syllabi contain references to the student as a researcher. This requires the skills of analysis of a range of data to make judgements based on the student's research. Such an approach is, in reality, at the heart of good practice in information literacy. Strategies to enhance the students information literacy skills are, as noted earlier, contained in the NCCA's ICT Framework document.

The Turnover requirements are 1.5 times the project value, which for small projects of limited duration is not onerous.  In that regard I do not propose to make any changes to the requirements.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	639	Between November 2009 and November 2010, my Department distributed some €92m directly to schools and VECs under the national ICT Infrastructure Grant Scheme. The main priority under this scheme is the equipping of each classroom with a teaching computer and digital projector. Once the baseline is in place schools can allocate any remaining funding under the scheme to other ICT equipment and software for educational use. A number of key support measures were taken to help schools get best value in the use of these devolved grants — in particular, the inclusion of schools in national purchasing frameworks for desktops, laptops, digital projectors and printers, the delivery of a national series of e-learning seminars for school leaders, and the provision of extensive guidance and training on the use of ICT in the classroom.My officials are currently examining ways of assessing the impact of this funding.  A survey will be carried out in the Autumn which will ascertain the availability of infrastructure and the integration of ICT in teaching, learning and assessment.  Ireland's levels of ICT integration will be also benchmarked against international comparisons.

The application is currently being considered and the school authority will be advised of the decision as soon as possible.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	642	In October 2011 the General Scheme of an Education and Training Boards Bill was referred to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  The General Scheme was also published at that time. Following discussions with this Department and relevant stakeholders, the Committee prepared a report which the Minister responded to at a meeting of the Committee on 25 January 2012. The General Scheme was then referred to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government for formal drafting. It is hoped that the Bill will be published during the summer.I have received representations from the National Adult Literacy Agency in relation to the membership of the new Education and Training Boards.  Consideration will be given to those representations in the course of the drafting of the legislation.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	643	The Deputy may be aware that an Anti-Bullying Forum was held on Thursday 17th May bringing together a range of experts, support groups and representatives of the schools sector including parents and students.  I was very pleased to open this important Forum and to provide an opportunity to explore with all the relevant stakeholders how best to tackle bullying in schools and to consider what changes or updating of existing practices and procedures are required to achieve this having regard to what is feasible to implement in the current financial climate.The range of speakers on the day of the Forum included contributions from my Department, Professor Mona O'Moore of the Anti-Bullying Centre, Trinity College, representatives of the National Anti-Bullying Coalition (NABC), and contributors from the school sector from the various perspectives of school principal, parent and pupil. The Forum also gave other stakeholders an opportunity to give their views. The proceedings of the Forum were broadcast live over the internet and recordings of the day's events can be now viewed by accessing the Anti-Bullying Forum web page of my Department's website www.education.ie. The presentations of the various speakers can also be viewed and downloaded from this page.As a follow on to holding the Forum itself, I invited the stakeholders and any other interested parties, including those unable to attend the event on the day, to submit their views on this important topic to my Department by 29th June 2012. I have also established a working group on tackling bullying in schools, including homophobic bullying, cyber bullying and racist bullying. The outcomes from the Forum together with the submissions from the stakeholders and other interested parties will assist the working group in its deliberations. This working group includes representatives of the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, and will draw upon the expertise of a range of organisations throughout their work.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	644	My Department issued Circular M35/05 in 2005 to highlight the potential health hazard of overweight schoolbags and to outline a range of local measures that could be put in place to help alleviate the problem. The circular referred to the recommendations of the previously published report of the Working Group on the Weight of School Bags. This report acknowledged that many of the solutions belong at local school level and made various recommendations in this regard, such as optimum use of storage facilities, developing pupil organisation skills and timetabling.It is a matter for each individual school to determine which particular measures are most suited to its individual circumstances and to how the school concerned organises teaching and learning. The circular and the report of the Working Group on the Weight of School Bags are available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	647	Following the allocation of funding by the Office of Public Works, Cork County Council appointed consultants in February 2011 to carry out a Study aimed at bringing forward proposals for a flood relief scheme for Skibbereen.  The process of establishing the most appropriate solution from the technical, social, environmental and economic perspectives, from the range of potential mitigation options requires detailed technical analysis and extensive consultation with stakeholders. Timelines for the various stages are difficult to predict with accuracy, particularly given the range of issues that can arise.  The Study has been progressing satisfactorily, with two public information days held in the town as part of the consultation process, the first on 23 March 2011 and the second on 25 January, 2012.  These public consultations have helped to inform the development of a preferred option for the scheme which is now emerging.It was envisaged at the commencement of the Study that the emerging scheme would be brought through the planning process by Cork County Council under the Planning and Development Regulations. However, it has recently been agreed that the scheme should be progressed by the Council as OPW's agents using the Arterial Drainage Acts.The proposed scheme will, therefore, be brought forward by means of formal Public Exhibition under the Arterial Drainage Acts.  It is expected that the Exhibition will take place in the latter half of 2012. This is in line with the schedule outlined at the second public information day.  Subject to a successful exhibition, the scheme will be progressed through detailed design and the procurement process for a civil works contractor. The scheme will then be submitted for Confirmation under the Arterial Drainage Acts to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. It is envisaged that this will be in the second half of 2013.In relation to minor works, Cork County Council was allocated funding of €10,000 under OPW's Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme in 2011 for some cleaning works on the River Ilen.  A further application for funding for cleaning works was submitted by the Council in 2012 and is currently being considered in the light of the current criteria and the availability of resources for flood risk management, with a decision expected in the coming weeks.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	649	In relation to the identification of measures to address flooding issues on a long-term basis, the Office of Public Works is continuing to progress the programme of Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Studies. The studies will recommend an integrated management plan and prioritised measures to address flood problems in areas where there is significant risk in each major catchment in the country.Clonakilty has been identified as an Area for Further Assessment (AFA) under the South West CFRAM study and will therefore be subject to a full flood risk analysis to identify appropriate mitigation measures.I am very aware of the impact of the flooding of 28th June, 2012, having visited the town last week to meet with those affected and inspect the damage.Following the flood event of 2009, the Office of Public Works provided funding of €350,000 to Cork County Council under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme for a serious of works to improve the capacity of the River Fealge, which burst its banks in November, 2009. Cork County Council has completed some of the required works and other works are still in hand.Following a recent event, I am advised the Council has submitted an application to this Office on 4th July, 2012 for further funding of €1.216m to complete these works and also to address further issues which have arisen in the wake of the June event.The current application submitted by Cork County Council will be considered having regard to the CFRAM study.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	650	The Office of Public Works has no immediate plans to implement paid parking within Phoenix Park. However the present parking practices pose particular issues for the Park in terms not only of its management, conservation and presentation as a very special historic landscape but also because of the inconvenience posed to users wishing to enjoy the recreational and amenity facilities.The recently published Conservation Management Plan identified the restriction of free public parking in continuous periods of more than 3-4 hours as one item for consideration. Plans will be developed on this in due course.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	651	The Comptroller and Auditor General's (C&AG) special study on public service pensions in 2009 estimated the annual pension cost for public servants to range between 10% and 41%.  The new scheme will reduce these costs by approximately one-third. The employee contribution in the Single Scheme continues to be 6.5% (3% on pensionable pay and 3.5% on net pensionable pay (i.e. reduced for social welfare integration)), which nets to an average contribution of about 5% of total pay for most public servants.There is no fund as public service schemes are pay-as-you-go.  Employee contributions are actual in that pay is reduced to account for these.  Employer contributions are estimated as being that figure necessary to fund the retirement benefits, were a fund to exist, after employee contributions are taken into account.The C&AG derived employer contribution rates for various categories of staff in his 2009 report — see Table below. Without carrying out a substantial and expensive actuarial exercise, the best estimate is to reduce the employer rates derived by the C&AG below for each category in line with overall one-third reduction and that means approximately a 10% or higher employer contribution in the new scheme for the majority of public servants.Notional contribution rates — post 2005 male entrants (C&AG Report 2009)Categories from C&AGgross contribution rateEmployee contributionCurrent notional employer rateSingle Scheme notional employer rateEstablished CS24.6%4.6%20.0%11.8%Non-Established CS9.5%0.3%9.2%6.0%Primary Teacher20.5%4.9%15.6%8.8%Post-Primary Teacher23.1%4.9%18.2%10.5%Garda29.6%5.1%24.5%14.6%Prison Officer27.8%4.5%23.3%14.0%Commissioned  Officer41.2%4.8%36.4%22.7%Enlisted Personnel22.4%0.4%22.0%14.5%Consultant25.9%6.0%19.9%11.3%Nurse (general)17.7%4.7%13.0%7.1%Established in NCSSB22.7%4.9%17.8%10.2%

As regards the State Industrial Employees the information is not readily available as it is not recorded in a manner that would facilitate a retrieval of the data in the manner requested.More than 5 days taken — 114 staff.More than 10 days taken — 48 staff.More than 15 days taken — 29 staff.More than 20 days taken — 16 staff.21 days or over taken — 53 staff.Additionally details of the length of the ten highest incidences of sick leave across these bodies as requested by the Deputy are as follows:1-229 days.2-209 days.3-165 days.4-162 days.5-146 days.6-119 days.7-116 days.8-112 days.9-92 days.10-71 days.It should be noted that the sick days shown above include a mix of paid, half pay and unpaid leave. Furthermore it should be noted that Civil Service sick leave policy dictates that where a period of sick leave spans a weekend, public holiday, or any other day on which the officer was not required to work, and the officer remains on sick leave on the day(s) after the non-working days, those non-working days should be counted as sick leave.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	653	In relation to the identification of measures to address flooding issues on a long-term basis, the Office of Public Works is continuing to progress the programme of Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) Studies, which is due for completion at end 2015 in accordance with the EU Floods Directive. The studies will recommend an integrated management plan and prioritised measures to address flood problems in areas where there is significant risk in each major catchment in the country.I am very aware of the impact of the severe flooding of 28th June 2012 in Glanmire and other areas in Cork.Specifically, in relation to Glanmire, the recent flood events of June 2012 will be analysed and the results incorporated into the CFRAM Plan for the South-West.  The Plan will set out clearly a proposed phasing framework for the flood risk management measures for all catchments within the South West River Basin District including the Glashaboy River.In conjunction with these comprehensive studies, the OPW continues to provide funding under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works and Coastal Protection Scheme to local authorities, to undertake minor flood mitigation measures to address localised flooding and coastal erosion problems within their administrative areas.Cork County Council has recently submitted a minor works application for funding to undertake a study of the Glashaboy River catchment following the serious flooding which affected the Meadowbrook housing Estate (45 houses flooded) and the Hazelwood Shopping Centre (10 units flooded) in Glanmire. This application will be assessed in accordance with the current criteria, the availability of resources for flood risk management and will also have regard to the outcome of the CFRAM process.Over €2.6m has been allocated Under the Minor Works Scheme to date for projects in Cork city and county.

This will allow scope for some targeted recruitment of up to 3,000 in 2012 so as to address needs in key areas of front-line services, particularly in the Health and Education Sectors and other strategic requirements including the EU presidency in 2013.  Final decisions of where recruitment will actually arise will obviously depend on (a) where vacancies arise as staff retire, (b) how Departments and organisations decide to reorganize and reallocate work, (c) the business case made for the filling of any particular post, and (d) the decision made on this business case in the light of other priority demands.It is part of the day to day function of the Boards and Management of all public bodies to assess, budget and plan for current and ongoing staffing requirements within the context of reducing public service numbers.  In support of this, the Strategic Workforce Planning Groups in each sector are currently ensuring that sectoral employers develop plans to deal on an ongoing basis with the operational and strategic consequences arising from the reductions in public service staffing numbers.

Posts to be filled by redeployment are offered in the first instance to the relevant panel or panels. It is a matter for the employer to identify the number and grades of posts to be redeployed in the first instance and to upload the posts onto the PAS panels. Employers can do this early in the redeployment process to maximise the opportunities to place their staff. There is no set time-limit within which individuals awaiting redeployment must be redeployed.To ensure an effective system, Personnel Officers in sending and receiving organisations have been asked to put a dedicated Redeployment Liaison Officer in place to proactively manage the redeployment of staff. In addition, my Department works on an ongoing basis with PAS and other stakeholders to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the redeployment processes and of the panel system in particular.

However such a person would be protected by the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 which allows for the renewal of existing or granting of new contracts where there are valid reasons for doing so. Only if the Body concerned failed to comply with the terms of the Act would the question of any entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration arise.Any person employed in the civil or public service on a fixed-term contract would be regarded as a temporary civil or public servant.

The ten highest instances of sick leave were as follows:Table12302230323042305203618971688144913210116In general, sick absences of up to 183 days (uncertified and certified combined) in any 12-month period, counting back from the date of the most recent absence, will be on full pay, subject to submission of valid medical certificates and social welfare forms (where applicable).Once 184 days' sick absence has been reached in any 12-month period, pay is reduced to half of normal pay. If sick absence continues, paid sick leave will be exhausted once 365 days' sick leave have been taken in any 4-year period, counting back from the most recent absence. Staff who have more than five years' pensionable service may, when paid sick leave has been exhausted, qualify for "pension rate of pay", subject to the agreement of the Chief Medical Officer (CMO). Pension rate of pay is the rate of pay such a person would receive if they were, at that time, retiring from the Civil Service on grounds of ill-health.With regard to the Agencies under the aegis of the Department, the management of sick leave is a day to day matter for the Agencies and I have asked each Agency to contact the Deputy directly in response.

The Association also raised the possibility of future exchequer support. I advised the Association that, notwithstanding difficulties it may be experiencing in managing its finances, Exchequer support could only be considered where the expending of public funds would represent value for money. In the light of our discussion, I understand that the Association intends to submit a proposal to seek Exchequer support in the coming weeks. Any proposal submitted by the Association will have to demonstrate that it represents value for money, which is the requirement in respect of the expenditure of all public moneys.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21667	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	660	Joint Labour Committee, Employment Regulation Orders no longer have the force of law. However, the Government is currently progressing legislation to provide for a new system of Employment Regulation Orders.The judgment of Mr. Justice Feeney delivered,in the High Court, on the 7th of July 2011 declaring that the provisions of sections 42, 43, and 45 of the 1946 Industrial Relations Act and section 48 of the 1990 Act are invalid having regard to the provisions of Article 15.2.1 of the Constitution of Ireland means that Joint Labour Committee Employment Regulation Orders (EROs) no longer have the force of law.Accordingly, the rates of pay provided in all ERO's formulated by JLCs ceased to be legally enforceable from the date of the High Court ruling and employees in employment sectors previously regulated by ERO's now come within the ambit and the pay rates provided for under the National Minimum Wage Act 2000.Contractual entitlements which employees enjoyed prior to 7th July 2011 remain protected by law unless changed by agreement with employers. An employee's rate of pay is a term/condition of their contract of employment (employees have a contract of employment or terms of employment whether notified in writing or not). Any change in an employee's terms or conditions of employment would normally be by agreement between the parties. Such agreement can be expressed or implied, tacit or by acquiescence (i.e it can be formally agreed, informally or verbally agreed or accepted by the employee).Any dispute arising in relation to the operation of employment contracts/conditions falls to be settled either between the parties involved or by availing of the State's industrial relations dispute settlement machinery as provided for under the Industrial Relations Acts. In the event of the parties being unable to resolve a dispute relating to conditions of employment, it is open to the parties to refer the matter to the Labour Relations Commission for investigation under the Industrial Relations Acts (for such an investigation to commence the consent of both parties to participate is required).The Payment of Wages Act 1991 provides that non-payment of wages or any deficiency in the amount of wages properly payable by an employer to an employee is regarded as an unlawful deduction from wages unless the deficiency or non-payment is attributable to an error of computation.If an employee considers a reduction in their wages to be an improper deduction from wages or non-payment of wages, the employee may consider referring a complaint to a Rights Commissioner under the Payment of Wages ActAlternatively if an employee considers a reduction to be a breach of their employment contract they may seek redress for breach of contract in the civil courts.The Industrial Relations (Amendment) (No. 3) Bill 2011, published on 22 December 2011, is progressing through the legislative process. The main purpose of the Bill is to implement the commitment in the Programme for Government to reform the Joint Labour Committee system. The Bill provides for the more comprehensive measures required to strengthen the legal framework for the EROs and Registered Employment Agreement sectoral wage setting mechanisms, under the Industrial Relations Acts 1946 to 2004, in the light of deficiencies in the original legislation.

Quarter 1 2012 labour market statistics show there are 274,000 non-Irish nationals in our labour force of just over 2 million.  Ireland remains a very attractive location for Foreign Direct Investment. Favourable demographics and consistent investment in education ensure a plentiful supply of highly qualified workers with excellent technical, language and customer services capabilities, as well as a reputation for flexibility and innovation.  In addition, Irish employers have access to the EU and EEA labour force in accordance with EU law on freedom of movement or Accession Treaties.I would advise the Deputy that for specified highly skilled and strategically important occupations, where a skills shortage exists, Green Card employment permits may be issued. ICT professionals, professional engineers and technologists are specifically catered for under this scheme. The Green Card permit is issued to the employee and allows his or her employment in the State by the named employer in the occupation specified on the permit. It may be issued for a period of two years. The employee may apply for immediate family re-unification and an application for long-term residence may be made after two years. No labour market needs test (e.g. newspaper and FÁS/EURES advertising) is required prior to making an application. Sensibly, it is a requirement that no more than 50% of staff employed by a company in Ireland may be employment permits holders.In addition my officials advise me that in 2011 we received 6408 new applications for permits of all kinds and that new permits issued in respect of 5200, or 81% of these cases. Notwithstanding this the Employment Permit structure and procedure has been designed and maintained to ensure that it is responsive to Irish labour market conditions while ensuring that key specific skills are available to ensure that the Irish economy expands and develops.

No labour market needs test (e.g. newspaper and FÁS/EURES advertising) is required prior to making an application. Up to 50% of staff employed by a company in Ireland may be employment permits holders.The Department also operates an Intra-Company Transfer (ICT) scheme. This scheme is designed to facilitate the transfer of senior management, key personnel or trainees who are foreign nationals from an overseas branch of a multinational corporation to its Irish branch. Up to 5% of the entire workforce may have such ICT Permits. However for startups this level may be increased on a case by case basis for an initial period. No labour market needs test is required in respect of an application for an Intra-Company Transfer permit. Certain basic criteria must be met.I should add that the Government is also guided by the Expert Group for Future Skills Needs and keeps its permit policy under review and can adapt to changing circumstances.Finally, I would like to advise the Deputy that issues regarding skills availability through the third level colleges and graduate and postgraduate students are primarily a matter for my colleague the Minister of Education and Skills. However, a report produced in January by the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) entitled Addressing High-Level ICT Skills Recruitment Needs confirms that Ireland is a successful major centre for ICT operations with around 75,000 people employed in 8,000 companies. Indeed, ten of the top ICT companies in the world have substantial operations in Ireland.The research undertaken by the Group, the Secretariat to which is provided by Forfás, indicates that the global ICT market is expected to grow by 5% between 2009 and 2014/15 with potential growth rate as high as 20% per annum over the next decade. In order to exploit these opportunities, however, it is crucial to ensure that Ireland's labour force is appropriately skilled. In this context the Group's report found that there are a range of skills and recruitment difficulties within the ICT sector with the result that, as at December 2011, there were approximately 1,800 vacancies in the sector. These vacancies arose mainly due to the lack of graduates with high-level ICT Honours Degrees and above which are required to fill such positions as Computer Software Engineers, ICT Network Specialists and Engineers, ICT Security Experts, ICT Telecommunications, ICT Project Managers and IT Sales and Marketing / Foreign Languages Skills Personnel. The report points out that this challenge is not unique to Ireland as such high level ICT skills are also in short supply globally.In order to address these challenges I, along with my colleague, Mr. Ruairi Quinn, T.D., Minister for Education and Skills, subsequently launched the ICT Action Plan: Meeting the High Level ICT Skills Needs of Enterprise in Ireland. The Action Plan establishes an overreaching target of doubling the annual output from honours degree ICT undergraduate programmes to 2,000 graduates by 2018 and outlines a number of actions that will be implemented to ensure an increased output of appropriately skilled graduates in the medium term 2015-2018.

The Deputy will be aware that the Central Bank is actively engaged with the financial institution concerned and with other institutions in the payments/clearing system to ensure that the current difficulties are resolved as a matter of urgency and also to ascertain what precisely happened in this instance. Once its investigations are concluded, I understand that the Bank will bring any deficiencies in the operation and the legal framework supporting the national payments system to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Finance who has primary policy responsibility for legislative initiatives in this area.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21667	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	664	The Employment Appeals Tribunal is independent in the exercise of its quasi-judicial function and I have no direct involvement in its day to day operations.However, having made enquiries, I understand that the Tribunal has already issued notices of hearing to the parties and that the hearing is scheduled to take place on 1st   August 2012 in Naas.The Employment Appeals Tribunal has seen a significant increase in its caseload in recent years, as it is one of the front-line services directly impacted upon by the economic downturn. The largest increase in claims has been in redundancy appeals but other types of claims have also increased.  Regrettably, this has increased the time it takes for a claimant to have his or her case heard. All appeals are listed for hearing in accordance with their date of lodgment with the Tribunal.The Tribunal has been pro-active in driving efficiencies. Divisions of the Tribunal are sitting longer, hearing more cases per sitting and seeking to manage the caseload to maximise efficiency. These efficiencies have resulted in improvements to the service provided and delivered significant increases in output and the number of cases disposed of, in both 2010 (30%) and a further 11% in 2011, with a further 11% increase to date in 2012 over the same period in 2011.Notwithstanding the efforts of the Tribunal, I believe that the delays that users of the service are experiencing are unacceptable.  This is one of the reasons I am undertaking a root and branch reform of all five Workplace Relations Bodies.The Reform Programme I have commenced will deliver a two tier Workplace Relations structure by merging the activities of the Labour Relations Commission, the National Employment Rights Authority, the Equality Tribunal and the first instance functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the Labour Court into a new Body of First Instance, to be known as the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC). The appellate functions of the Employment Appeals Tribunal will be incorporated into an expanded Labour Court. Work has commenced on the drafting of a Workplace Relations Bill to give effect to the new two-tier structure.The purpose of the Reform Programme is to provide a more efficient and effective system of resolving employment disputes. Substantial progress has already been made in this regard. For example, the establishment of a Workplace Relations Single Contact Portal from January this year has resulted in all complaints now being acknowledged and respondents notified within, on average, 5 working days of receipt of the complaint. In some cases this was taking up to eight months. This service enhancement increases the likelihood of employers and employees resolving issues sooner and has substantially reduced the backlog for certain hearings. I understand that the backlog for Rights Commissioner hearings has effectively been eliminated.The service improvements have also been underpinned by the launch from January this year of a Single Complaint Form for all first instance workplace relations complaints. A Pilot Early Resolution Service commenced on 14th May this year. This service will provide the opportunity in certain cases for employers and employees to resolve issues without recourse to formal adjudication hearings, thus relieving pressure on adjudication services such as the Rights Commissioner Service and the EAT.The two tier model now being designed will deliver a just, fair and efficient adjudication service provided by independent, professional and impartial decision-makers with a target period of three months from the time of complaint to hearing, and written, reasoned decisions within 28 working days of the hearing with published decisions. Finally, I also intend to provide for a more effective method of enforcing the awards of adjudicators.

Through various programmes and initiatives, the CEBs seek to influence student attitudes in favour of enterprise. To that end, the CEBs continue to reinforce entrepreneurship in the education system as a critical element in the future development of small business in Ireland.  A number of initiatives are provided by the CEBs at both primary and secondary level including, the annual Student Enterprise Awards, Exploring Enterprise, Celtic Enterprise and Bí Gnóthach Enterprise.  Over 20,000 students a year now participate in the various CEB-supported programmes implemented in the education sector. Further information on the initiatives run by the CEBs is available at www.enterpriseboards.ie.Enterprise Ireland has a wide range of programmes to address the multi-disciplinary demands of entrepreneurship and the diversity of business types, regardless of the age profile of a project promoter.

I am in the process of introducing a Microfinance Loan Fund, which has a significant entrepreneurship focus, for all would-be entrepreneurs including young entrepreneurs who are unemployed.  Loans will be made available to start-up, newly established, or growing microenterprises, with viable business propositions, that do not meet the conventional risk criteria applied by banks. The potential viability of the business proposal will be the dominant factor in all credit decisions.  However, I believe that the Fund will be of particular benefit to young entrepreneurs, as they do not have the advantage of a favourable credit history and therefore, may be categorised as a high risk by the banks.  Loans from the Microfinance Loan Fund will be administered under the remit of the Social Finance Foundation on behalf of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.The European Progress Microfinance Facility is a European Investment Fund (EIF) initiative to support entrepreneurship and employment through microfinance activities.  Capped guarantees may be provided to eligible intermediaries partially covering their portfolios of micro-loans, or loan facilities may be availed of to increase lending to micro-enterprises.  Initial engagement has taken place between the Social Finance Foundation and the EIF in relation to availing of the EU Progress Microfinance Guarantee Facility.  Formal application will be made for the EU Progress Microfinance Guarantee Facility following enactment of the legislation, which provides for the establishment of the microfinance lending entity, Microfinance Ireland. A rigorous due diligence process is required to secure EIF accreditation.

It has a central role in ensuring that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met. Forfás, under my Department, in conjunction with FÁS, under the Department of Education and Skills provides the EGFSN with research and secretariat support.A report produced in January by the EGFSN entitled Addressing High-Level ICT Skills Recruitment Needs confirms that Ireland is a successful major centre for ICT operations with around 75,000 people employed in 8,000 companies.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	669	I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that for the first half of 2012 the current average times taken to process carer's allowance appeals decided by summary decision is 32.1 weeks and 45.3 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.  Generally the vast majority of cases fall within average times but extenuating factors, often outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, will cause greater delays in some cases. In the light of this, if the most protracted cases are excluded (i.e. those received before January 2011), the relevant waiting times are 30.7 for summary decision and 38.7 weeks for those requiring an oral hearing.  There are 1,606 carer's appeals pending at the end of June 2012.By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial process, the processing of appeals takes time and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.  Once an appeal is received, there is a statutory requirement for a response to that appeal by a Deciding Officer addressing the contentions raised in the appeal.  If new evidence is submitted, a review of the decision will be undertaken by the Department and this may involve a re-investigation of the appellant's circumstances.  When the submission is received from the Department, in many cases there is a need to conduct an oral hearing of the appeal which requires the booking of a venue at a location convenient to the appellant, arranging the attendance of witnesses, notifying appellants and handling cancellations and this adds quite considerably to the time taken to process appeals.In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department has appointed 13 additional Appeals Officers since 2010. In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This has brought the total number of Appeals Officers to 40.  In addition to this, the Office has improved its business processes and IT support.I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.  I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an appeal for the person concerned has not, as yet, been received in that Office.  The application is currently being processed by the Carer's Allowance section of the Department and an appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office will only arise in the event that the person is not satisfied with the decision of the Deciding Officer.The Department is committed to delivering the best possible service to its customers.  Currently the average time taken to award a carer's allowance application is 28 weeks.  I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims at present is not satisfactory but a major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme.  This involves the deployment of information technology solutions and associated business process re-organisation. It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customers. Full deployment of the new system for carer's allowance has been completed this month.  In tandem with the full implementation of the new system, a comprehensive business process improvement exercise commenced on the 2nd July,  the focus of which is to optimise performance and provide improved customer service.

The €100 rate does not apply to certain categories of claimant including:claimants with a qualified child;those transferring to Jobseeker's Allowance immediately after exhausting their entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit;those making a claim for Jobseeker's Allowance where that claim is linked to a Jobseeker's Allowance claim made within the previous 12 months to which the maximum personal rate applied;those transferring directly to Jobseeker's Allowance from Disability Allowance;certain people who were in the care of the HSE during the period of 12 months before he or she reached the age of 18.A rate of €144 applies to claimants aged 22-24.  The adoption of these measures reflected the need to encourage more young jobseekers to improve their skills by either pursuing further study or accessing a labour market programme.Receiving the full adult rate of a jobseekers payment without a strong financial incentive to engage in education or training can lead to welfare dependency.   While many young people with low levels of education and training were able to get work in construction and other areas when the economy was doing well, they are likely to find it much harder to get work over the course of the next few years.  The measures encourage young jobseekers to improve their skills and remain active in the labour market in order to avoid the risk of becoming long-term unemployed and will help them to progress into sustainable employment on a long-term basis.  Where a person is in receipt of a rate of jobseeker's allowance described above and he or she participates in a course of education, training, Community Employment, Rural Social Scheme or Tús, the full normal rate of payment applicable to that course or scheme applies without any reduction for persons aged under 25.I understand that Deputies have been contacted with regard to these measures following a campaign by Focus Ireland.  My officials met with Focus Ireland in May, 2012 in relation to their concerns.  These are being examined and further discussions are planned.More generally, Deputies may wish to note that my Department's role with regard to persons who are homeless is mainly income maintenance. Under the social welfare system, homeless people have entitlements to the full range of social welfare schemes, including supplementary welfare allowance and associated supplements, subject to the normal qualifying conditions.  My Department, through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers and New Communities Unit provides assistance to people in sourcing the most appropriate accommodation available.  In addition, prison and hospital in-reach services are provided to explore accommodation options and, where necessary, liaise with local authorities to identify and source the most appropriate accommodation available for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.  This ensures that where possible, people are diverted away from homeless services and towards community-based supports.

The officer concerned is not currently on a career break from her position in the Department.  An application for a six month career break received by her local management in September 2011 was not approved because of business demands at the time and difficulties finding replacement staff due to the moratorium on recruitment.  The officer subsequently applied for a leave absence of thirteen weeks from 18th January 2012 to 18th April 2012, under the Shorter Working Year (SWY) scheme which was approved by her local management.  The SWY scheme provides for temporary cover for the period of the absence and a temporary officer was recruited for the period up to the 18th April.  In addition, a period of eight weeks special leave without pay up to the 20th June 2012 was approved. Following this a period of annual leave was approved up to 6th July 2012.  The officer was due to report for duty on 9th July 2012, however, she failed to do and has since informed her manager that she remains out of the Country.  Accordingly, she has been removed from the payroll and HR division is examining her current position.The Deputy will appreciate that the pressures of work in my Department are substantial and, while managers make every effort to ensure family friendly policies and facilitate staff, the needs of the customer must be seen as a major priority for the Department.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	680	The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support, to eligible people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.  There are approximately 92,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided a sum of €436 million for 2012.Rent supplement is calculated to ensure that an eligible person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his or her family circumstances, less a minimum weekly contribution of €30 (€35 for couples) which each recipient is required to pay from his or her own resources.  The existing rent supplement assessment provides for a gradual withdrawal of payment as hours of employment or earnings increase.  Those availing of part-time employment and/or training opportunities can continue to receive rent supplement subject to their satisfying the standard means assessment rules.  Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of supplementary welfare allowance, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This ensures that those returning to work or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.Rent supplement is not generally payable where a person or their spouse or partner is in full-time employment, i.e. for 30 hours or more a week.  However, a person on rent supplement, who is accepted as eligible for accommodation under the rental accommodation scheme (RAS), may return to full-time work, subject to a means test, without losing entitlement to their rent supplement payment.  The rental accommodation scheme gives local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the longer-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement for 18 months or more. Details of these cases are notified regularly by my Department to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.On 16th June 2011, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Housing and Planning published a new housing policy framework statement. This framework statement reflects the content of the Programme for Government and sets out the principles to underpin the development of housing policy into the medium term. Specifically, it contains the announcement for the transfer of responsibility in providing housing needs for long term rent supplement recipients to housing authorities.  A multi-agency steering group, which includes representation from my Department, has been established to develop proposals to give effect to this transfer.  This will help achieve a key Government commitment of removing barriers to employment at the same time returning rent supplement to its original purpose, that of a short term income support payment for those temporarily unemployed.

Three representatives from a working group established by Downs Syndrome Ireland, Inclusion Ireland, Irish Autism Action, Special Needs Parents Association, the Carers Association and Midlands Regional Forum of People with Disabilities have been invited to be part of the review group.  It is considered that this broad representation will reflect the issues and views of the vast majority of parents on the matter.Officials from my Department have met with representatives from the DCA Warriors to discuss how they can be facilitated in making a positive contribution to the review process.  Based on those discussions and the understanding that this group has membership from all over the country, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this NGO is being offered a place on the working group.  The terms of reference for the review allows for a consultation process with parents and representative groups to be held. This will allow for all parents and groups not directly represented on the working group to input their concerns and suggestions to the review process.

Any decisions which might be taken by Government on the possible introduction of a statutory sick pay scheme will be considered in that context.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	701	The monthly progress report is a long-standing report produced by FÁS since the late 1990s providing summary overall national data on outcomes for persons referred under the National Employment Action Plan (EAP).  It predates the involvement of the LES in the EAP referral process (which commenced in 2009), and the absence of a reference to this LES involvement is an oversight.Approximately one third of referrals under EAP are now to LES offices, with the remainder being to employment services offices of the Department.The report in its current form and the data collection process underlying it have become out-dated in a number of respects as the EAP has evolved, and particularly in the light of the transfer of the employment service from FÁS to the Department.  It is planned to move to an updated reporting format later this year.

While the survey provides some data on the nationality of the unemployed at the aggregate level, these are considered by the Central Statistics Office to be "broadly indicative", and the data are not available below the aggregate level.Administrative data show that there were 79,098 persons aged less than 25 years on the Live Register at the end of June 2012.  The data do not distinguish place of birth; however, data on nationality are available and these are given in the table:IrelandUKEU 13EU AC 12Non-EUTotalTotal Non IrishJobseekers Allowance65,6141,4391362,3711,30370,8635,249Jobseekers Benefit7,2176719526367,865648Jobseekers Benefit Credits Only3245832137046Total Live Register73,1551,5111632,9291,34079,0985,943The data show that 7.5% of all young people on the Live Register are not Irish nationals.Currently, once they have been on the Live Register for three months, unemployed people — including young people and those originally from abroad — are referred to the employment service of my Department for a one-to-one interview and more intensive assistance through a caseload approach.  That approach provides for the identification of specific barriers to re-employment faced by each individual so that these can be addressed.Profiling of the newly unemployed is now being introduced by the Department to identify those least likely to re-enter the workforce unaided.  This will allow those facing specific barriers to re-employment to be referred for interview and more intensive assistance earlier in their unemployment spell than has been possible up to now.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I propose to take Questions Nos. 243 and 244 together.The Department does not have information about the total numbers of people resident in Ireland with foreign social security pensions as information about an individual with other pension income would only be required by the Department if the person applied for the means tested State Pension (Non-Contributory).  That information is mainly sourced when the person applies for that pension.A person can receive both an Irish contributory pension and a pension from another source such as an occupational or foreign pension.   Their entitlement to the contributory pension is based on their PRSI contribution record.  It is not means tested so information in relation to their other income is not required. In addition, there would be people resident in Ireland with foreign social security pensions who have no Irish pensions.In relation to means tested payments, any monies received by way of a foreign social security payment is assessable as means for the purposes of determining the rate of their social welfare means tested payment.  An applicant for a means tested payment is obliged to declare if they have an entitlement to a foreign social security payment/pension.  If a person has indicated that they previously worked in the UK or in another jurisdiction, then a check will be made with the relevant authority to establish if the customer had an entitlement to a social security entitlement from that jurisdiction.It is the practice that a data match is conducted with the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) in the UK to identify their customers who reside in Ireland and who are receiving a social security payment from the UK and the rate of payment the customer is receiving.  This information is then matched against DSP customers who are receiving means tested income support payments.Once the information is received and the customers are identified, a review of the customer's entitlement is undertaken.  Appropriate action is then taken in terms of amending the rate of entitlement to the DSP payment/pension.  The impact of any increase in the value of the UK entitlement on a customer's DSP entitlement is also dependent on the change in the exchange rate, if any, since the customer's entitlement was last reviewed.  The value of any increase in the UK entitlement may be offset by a reduction in the exchange rate, if the exchange rate has fallen.To date the Department has not provided the Office of the Revenue Commissioners with any information that was received from other States on residents of Ireland who are receiving social security pensions from outside of Ireland.

It is Community Employment policy that participants on any scheme that gives individuals substantive unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults are subject to Garda Vetting.  This policy has been in place since June, 2009 in compliance with Childcare Legislation/Regulations and with legal advice.Once an individual has been selected for a CE position that requires Garda Vetting, their Garda Vetting application can be processed through either my Department or through the employing organisation if they are already registered with the Garda Central Vetting Office.The Garda Central Vetting Office are doing their utmost to process applications speedily. In relation to Community Employment over 1,500 Garda Vetting applications have been made by my Department to the end of June this year in addition to the applications submitted directly by the employing organisations.Applications from my Department are taking approximately 6 weeks on average to process.  Some applications with addresses outside the state, or pending further regional investigation or who submit incomplete forms can take longer to process.

The aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer. There are approximately 92,000 persons in receipt of rent supplement for which the Government has provided a sum of €436 million for 2012.Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a weekly minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. The minimum contribution is currently €30 for a single adult and €35 for couples.Many rent supplement recipients pay more than the minimum contribution because they are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs.A person who claims a one-parent family payment is required to seek maintenance from her/his spouse or the other parent of the child. Maintenance payments are assessed as means for the purpose of determining entitlement one-parent family payment. However, vouched housing costs of up to €95.23 per week in respect of rent or mortgage are disregarded in establishing the rate of one-parent family payment payable.For rent supplement, maintenance payments of up to €95.23 per week are assessed in determining the appropriate rate payable. Where a person has weekly maintenance payments of more than €95.23, the first €75 a week together with 25% of any additional maintenance above €75 can be disregarded for means assessment purposes. This ensures that the family benefits from any maintenance payments received in excess of €95.23.Customers are obliged to notify the Department of any changes in circumstances, including changes in maintenance payments.In every case where a one-parent family payment is awarded, the Department seeks to trace the other parent (liable relative) in order to ascertain whether he or she is in a financial position to contribute towards the cost of the one-parent family payment.  Liable relatives in receipt of a social welfare payment from my Department are not asked to contribute, as, when assessed in line with the regulations, they are determined to have a nil contribution due.  Accordingly there is no mechanism to deduct maintenance at source from any social welfare payment.The Liability to Maintain Family provisions contained in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005 is separate to Family Law legislation.  Any applications to the courts under family law for a maintenance order against the other parent are made through the courts service and are not the responsibility of the Department.

Generally the vast majority of cases fall within average times but extenuating factors, often outside of the control of the Social Welfare Appeals Office, will cause greater delays in some cases.In light of this, the following table showing the current processing times (based on figures at the end of June 2012)   shows the overall average for each scheme along with the average when the older appeals are excluded.These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation.  They include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant, and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. By its nature and because it is a quasi-judicial nature, the processing of appeals takes time even at the best of times and reflects the fact that, by definition, the appeal process cannot be a quick one.In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department have appointed 13 additional Appeals Officers since 2010. In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Service (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This has brought the total number of Appeals Officers to 40. In addition to this, the Office has improved its business processes and IT support.I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.Average processing times (weeks) Summary DecisionsAverage processing times (weeks) Summary Decisions (Excluding appeals registered before 1.1.2011)Average processing times (weeks) Oral HearingsAverage processing times (weeks) OralHearing (Excluding appeals registered before 1.1.2011)Adoptive Benefit15.615.640.440.4Blind Pension22.222.230.430.4Carers Allowance32.130.745.338.7Carers Benefit32.724.435.434.0Child Benefit53.137.558.542.8Disability Allowance31.329.440.836.1Illness Benefit38.436.551.143.7Domiciliary Care28.628.241.837.2Deserted Wives Benefit19.814.647.2—Deserted Wives Allowance14.619.8—47.2Farm Assist20.317.344.935.6Bereavement Grant29.725.5——Family Income Supplement18.818.730.227.4Invalidity Pension36.633.557.637.8Liable Relatives——72.830.4One Parent Family Payment25.623.246.338.5Maternity Benefit32.329.440.040.0State Pension (Contributory)30.821.858.635.2State Pension (Non-Cont)28.027.251.340.4State Pension (Transition)20.020.061.861.3Occupational Injury Benefit0.30.356.044.6Occupational Injury Benefit (Medical)78.7—87.4—Disablement Pension46.139.351.437.0Incapacity Supplement7.77.752.136.8Guardian’s Payment (Con)24.524.556.337.3Guardian’s Payment (Non-con)27.127.182.941.7Pre-Retirement Allowance54.654.6——Jobseeker’s Allowance (Means)20.118.240.534.0Jobseeker’s Allowance24.619.435.929.8Jobseeker’s Benefit16.715.329.328.0JA/JB Fraud Control————Respite Care Grant25.825.838.736.1Insurability of Employment52.041.781.848.8Supplementary Welfare  Allowance14.714.619.119.0Treatment Benefits18.918.9——Survivor’s Pension (Con)——75.055.5Survivor’s Pension (Non-con)28.628.644.634.2Widows Parent Grant23.223.2——All Appeals26.022.040.438.0

The overall aim is to provide short term assistance, and not to act as an alternative to the other social housing schemes operated by the Exchequer.Each claim for rent supplement is determined having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant and in a case where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined.  While documentation is normally required showing that a joint custody arrangement is in place, and being availed of, before a decision can be made, it is a matter for the officer administering the scheme to determine the form of documentation required.  This flexibility supports the officer in fully assessing the circumstances specific to each case.Accordingly it is not proposed to issue  instructions to officers administering rent supplement on the documentation required for claims where the applicant has joint custody of a child.

A person wishing to pursue BTEA will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being of a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications (NFQ) among others.The entry requirements of the graduate medicine course to which the Deputy refers require a person to already hold an honours degree in any discipline which is level 8 on the NFQ.  As indicated above, a person who already possesses a level 8 qualification is not eligible for the BTEA.  State support for education purposes is grounded on a student progressing from one qualification level to a higher one.  The progression criteria is essential and applies to all courses of study.  The scheme was never intended to be an alternative form of funding for people entering or re-entering the third level education system.

These include the amalgamation of the National Library, the National Archives and the Irish Manuscripts Commission.  At the outset, I would like to underline the value which I place on the role of the National Cultural Institutions in this country.  They are the custodians of our arts and cultural heritage.  They also have a key role in scholarship and the national discourse.  That is why €47.25 million is provided for our cultural institutions and bodies in the 2012 Estimates.  The critical role that art and culture play in attracting tourists to Ireland is also well recognised.  Cultural tourism is now a key element of Ireland's tourism industry and the National Cultural Institutions play a very significant role in that respect.  The institutions funded by my Department attracted over 3 million visitors in 2011.In the overall context of the Public Service Reform agenda, one of my key concerns is to ensure that all options are examined so that the most appropriate implementation approach can be adopted for each institution.  The artistic and curatorial autonomy of the cultural institutions is, of course, a major consideration in this regard.  The fact is, however, that all of our cultural institutions are facing very difficult challenges in the times ahead, particularly in relation to resources and funding.  Given the difficult economic circumstances, there has been a considerable reduction in Exchequer funding over the last number of years and this is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.My Department is consulting with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at present, following which these matters will be submitted to Government.

Consent was refused for the works referred to in the Deputy's Question, as they were considered to be damaging to the natural heritage area.  I understand that the individual in question has appealed against this decision.  My Department has established a panel from which to draw upon barristers or solicitors of not less than seven years standing to hear and determine appeals against decisions to refuse consent for the carrying out of certain works in natural heritage areas.An arbitrator has been appointed to hear and determine the appeal in question.

It is, in my view, fully in keeping with the principles of good river management and flood protection that all potential impacts of proposed works be fully considered before proceeding.  The activities referred to by the Deputy, insofar as they relate to the responsibilities of my Department, are governed by the provisions of the Wildlife Acts (if the works relate to Natural Heritage Areas) or the European Communities (Birds and Natural Habitats) Regulations 2011.  Those Regulations, together with the Planning and Development Acts, transpose into Irish law Ireland's obligations under the EU Birds and Habitats Directives. Certain drainage works within certain Natural Heritage Areas and protected European sites (Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas) require the consent of my Department before they can be undertaken.Drainage plans or projects undertaken by State bodies, such as the Office of Public Works or local authorities, must also be undertaken in compliance with the relevant legislation.  Any flood alleviation plan or project must, by law, be screened for potential impacts on European sites and, if necessary, subjected to a more detailed "appropriate assessment" of its potential impacts in view of the sites' conservation objectives.  If it can be concluded that there is not a risk to a European site, then the plan or project may proceed. If, on the other hand, such a risk cannot be ruled out, then the project cannot proceed unless the legally prescribed conditions for derogation can be met.Any project adversely impacting on the otter or bat species, which are afforded strict protection under the Habitats Directive, will also require a derogation licence from my Department before commencing.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	746	Following scientific research conducted by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) indicating that the European eel stocks are in a critical state, the EU introduced Council Regulation 1100/2007, the objective of which is to achieve recovery of the stocks to previous high levels.  The Regulation required that all Member States prepare a national Eel Management Plan (EMP).  Ireland's plan was approved by the European Commission in July, 2009.  Bye-laws, Conservation of Eel Fishing Bye-law No. C.S. 303, 2009 and Conservation of Eel Fishing (Prohibition On Issue Of Licences) Bye-law No. 858, 2009, were signed by the then Minister in 2009 prohibiting the capture of eels.  There was no provision for compensation for those who previously engaged in this fishery on a commercial basis.The then Central and Regional Fisheries Boards (now Inland Fisheries Ireland — IFI) engaged with the eel fishermen representatives to investigate possible diversification schemes; however, no specific funding was identified for diversification.  I understand that a number of former eel fishermen have been contracted by the ESB to undertake Trap and Transport operations to mitigate the impact of hydropower schemes as part of the eel management plan.  There is no property right attaching to public eel licences and consequently the issue of compensation does not arise, given that the closure of the fishery was applied for conservation reasons under the Fisheries Acts.  Given that context and having regard to National economic circumstances, no provision has been made for compensation payments.The National EMP is currently being updated following the provision of three additional years of scientific research and monitoring of the status of eels stocks.  The latest independent Standing Scientific Committee report on eels is available on the IFI website and a link to this web page is also available on my Department's website.  IFI's three-year eel monitoring report is also available online.  Ireland's EMP Implementation report, which details progress on Ireland's 2009 EMP, is due to be submitted to the EU shortly.  In relation to the information contained in these reports and prior to consideration of the continuation of existing measures, a public consultation period has commenced.  The closing date for receipt of submissions to be considered as part of the review of eel plans for Ireland was set as Monday 2nd July 2012.  However, on foot of presentations made to stakeholders as part of the consultation, I have decided to extend the closing date to 11th July to facilitate the receipt of submissions from as many stakeholders as possible.Submissions made during the public consultation period, which included a number of public meetings/seminars, will be considered in formulating proposals for the management of the eel fishery for the coming years.  Three public meetings on the EMPs have been held in Clonmel, County Tipperary on 19th June, in Athlone, County Westmeath on 20th June and in Carrick on Shannon, County Leitrim on 21st June.  Copies of all relevant documents (EU Report, Scientific Report and Monitoring Report) were available at the public meetings and are also available on IFI's website (www.fisheriesireland.ie) or through the link on my Department’s website (www.dcenr.gov.ie).

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	748	In the 1960s and 1970s Irish bass stocks were very severely depleted due to the overexploitation of the species by commercial fishing.  This resulted in the near loss of one of our most important marine sport fish species and the collapse of the accompanying angling tourist industry that serviced this area.  As a result of the serious decline in bass stocks, bass conservation legislation was put in place to facilitate the rebuilding of stocks.  The south and east coastline have shown an improvement in stocks during the last decade but catches are still down on results experienced in the sixties and early seventies.  The west coastline up to Galway Bay has also shown an improvement.Bass in Irish waters are also protected by a number of measures including the Bass (Conservation of Stocks) Order 1990 which regulates the activities of Irish fishermen within ICES sub-areas VI and VII: commercial fishing for bass is prohibited, the taking of bass using nets is prohibited, and Irish fishing boats must not have bass on board or engage in trans-shipment of bass.  This order also sets the legal size of capture for bass at 40cm.  The slow pace of stock recovery indicates why all conservation measures and legislation needs to remain in place.  Bass is the only marine species which is protected in this way, primarily for angling purposes.  Angling for bass is also subject to control and anglers are limited to two fish in a 24 hour period, there is a close season from 15th May to 15th June and bass cannot be sold.  Many bass anglers now practice catch and release voluntarily.The Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and subsequently Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) have always given their full support to the Bass Conservation measures introduced by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and the Marine and will continue to do so in the future.  Bass is a most important and sought after shore caught angling species attracting many anglers from home and abroad.  This resource brings in additional sustainable revenue to many rural areas around our coastline.  In 2007, angling brought circa 128,000 visitors, 68% of whom stayed between 6-14 nights in the country.  The estimated spend by visiting anglers was €87.4m.  It is estimated that circa 31,000 of these visiting anglers were sea anglers.  In this regard and to underpin the importance of Bass as a key sea angling species the IFI is in the process of finalising a National Policy on the management of the species to ensure that it is only exploited in a sustainable manner into the future.

The maximum charges which can be imposed for roaming services within the EU is also regulated by EU harmonisation measures, in the form of EU Regulations.  The most recent such Regulation, Regulation (EU) No. 531/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 June 2012 on roaming on public mobile communications networks within the Union, which commenced on the 1st   July last, imposes decreasing annual maximum wholesale and retail charges as set out in the following table:Retail (excl VAT)Wholesale (excl VAT)Making a phone call/minute€0.29 cent from July 2012,€0.14 from July 2012€0.24 from July 2013 and€0.10 from July 2013€0.19 cent from July 2014€0.05 from July 2014Receiving a phone call/minute€0.08 from July 2012,—€0.07 from July 2013 and—€0.05 from July 2014—Sending a text message€0.09 from July 2012,€0.03 from July 2012€0.08 from July 2013 and€0.02 from July 2013€0.06 from July 2014€0.02 from July 2014Data usage/Mbyte€0.70 from July 2012,€0.25 from July 2012,€0.45 from July 2013 and€0.15 from July 2013€0.20 from July 2014.€0.05 from July 2014The prices permitted by the EU Regulation are maximum prices.  Service providers are permitted and encouraged to charge lower rates.  At least one operator in Ireland advertises that it imposes no additional charges for roaming within the EU.  Most other mobile operators advertise that they impose no additional roaming charges or reduced charges for roaming in Northern Ireland, providing customers opt to take service from a named service provider in Northern Ireland usually operating with the same brand name e.g. 3, O2 or Vodafone and T mobile in the case of e-mobile.  The detailed terms and conditions may vary depending on the account type and package chosen.  Customers should consult with their service provider to identify the charging options available and to ensure they can manually select the most appropriate service provider when roaming in Northern Ireland or disable the automatic switching function to avoid inadvertent roaming within the State in border areas.I will continue to work with my EU colleagues and at a Government policy level, to reduce the cost of cross-border mobile phone charges.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	751	Ongoing discoveries of oil and new methods of extraction of oil and gas continue to change the fossil fuel landscape as well as having impacts on global energy markets.  Ireland, however, remains critically dependent on imported fossil fuels, particularly oil and natural gas, which are subject to price volatility and supply risks.  This dependency underlines the immediate and long term imperatives of enhancing energy security and moving to more sustainable forms of energy.  It is also critical for climate change targets.Latest International Energy Agency analysis continues to point to a tight balance between global oil supply and demand, with price impacted by ongoing geopolitical uncertainties and fluctuating economic demand in OECD and developing economies.  Volatility in global oil prices and continued supply risks underscore the Government's commitment to delivering national energy efficiency and renewable energy objectives which are aimed at moving the economy away from over reliance on imported carbon intensive fossil fuels.  Irrespective of new global oil and in particular, gas scenarios, Ireland needs to sustain all efforts to reduce the fossil fuel bill and reduce emissions.The electrification of transport offers potential for Ireland, not just in terms of energy savings but also because of the opportunity to better utilise grid sourced renewable electricity, as work continues to progressively deliver on the target of 40% renewable generation by 2020.The Biofuel Obligation Scheme is also enabling the sustainable growth of an Irish biofuels market affording opportunities for indigenous biofuel producers and displacing traditional oil products in the transport sector.The Government is also committed to continuing and enhancing the delivery of significant energy efficiency improvements across the commercial, public and private sector.  Energy efficiency will progressively reduce Ireland's dependence on imported fossil fuels, while supporting energy competitiveness and security as well as employment and economic activity and reducing emissions.

The oil market is fully liberalised and deregulated.  Notwithstanding increased global oil production, the International Energy Agency oil market analysis continues to point to a tight balance between global oil supply and demand with price impacted by ongoing geopolitical uncertainties.The National Consumer Agency, under the aegis of Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, carried out a detailed survey on consumer oil prices.  The survey found that the prices charged by Irish retailers for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil and that prices at the pump reflect the volatile market price, as well as transportation costs, trends in euro/dollar exchange rates and other operating costs, together with the impact of taxation on oil products.  There are no plans to carry out a further examination of the sector at this time.

The scheme required that projects were operational by end 2010.  However extensions of time have been granted for projects to build out after that date, although the end date of the scheme remained the same.As there were no other REFIT schemes available for onshore wind energy until REFIT 2 opened in March 2012, an extension of time to build out was granted to those projects seeking extensions between the closure of REFIT 1 and the introduction of REFIT 2, while noting that the backstop date remained 2025.  This project was granted an extension in time, at their request, to build until June 2012.  I understand that a further extension to end 2013 has been requested.The REFIT 2 scheme opened in March 2012.  It caters for onshore wind projects built between 1/1/10 and 31/12/15.  REFIT 2 is on the basis of a minimum price for exported electricity of the REFIT reference price (which is the same as in REFIT 1) plus a balancing payment.  The manner in which the balancing payment operates is the main change between REFIT 1 and REFIT 2My Department is finalising advice for my consideration in relation to whether to grant further extensions to extensions already granted to projects in REFIT 1, in view of the fact that the new REFIT scheme is now in operation.  All relevant project developers will be informed as soon as possible of the outcome of my considerations in light of the Department's advice to me.

As shareholder I do, however, have a strong concern in relation to the ongoing commercial position of the Company and I regularly liaise with the Company in this regard.  The Company has been adversely affected by a significant and ongoing downward trend in its core mail business.  In response, the Company has, sought to control costs and diversify operations whilst continuing to provide a high quality national service.  I fully support the Company's strategy in this regard.In this context, I have stressed to my Government colleagues that the increased use of the post office network should be considered by public sector bodies where this is appropriate.  In the context of the public sector transformation agenda, I will be engaging with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to new public sector business processes to ensure that the post office network is considered in this regard.An Post has many strengths and has the largest retail presence in the country.  I have impressed on the Company the need to further exploit its unique position in this regard and have been supportive of its attempts to diversify its income streams and to win a wider range of commercial contracts offering higher margins.Overall, it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide customer focused network of post offices.

Given their nature, it is not possible accurately to predict the exact location, scale or intensity of such localised downpours.  An aggravating factor was the already saturated ground due to the wettest June on record.As the primary response agencies, Cork local authorities will report comprehensively to their elected members on the flooding and response.  When all details and analyses of the flooding event that occurred in Cork last week are to hand in the near future, a detailed report will be prepared for the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning in order that we can learn from it and improve our overall resilience to deal with severe weather events of the kind witnessed last week.The Office of Public Works is the lead agency for flood risk management in Ireland.  However, I understand from the OPW that they are not directly involved in the operation of any flood warning system in County Cork.  I further understand from the OPW that Cork County Council very recently (4 July 2012) submitted to them a minor works application for funding under the Minor Works Scheme to undertake a study of the Glashaboy River catchment following the serious flooding which affected the Meadowbrook Housing Estate and the Hazelwood Shopping Centre in Glanmire.  The purpose of the study is to identify appropriate alleviation measures.  The Council would intend to submit a further minor works application on the identification of such works.

Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge by 31 March 2012, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.Article 4 of the Local Government (Charges) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 721 of 2011) made under the provisions of the above Act, as amended by section 19(1)(h) of the Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011, prescribes a fee of €10 for the payment of a NPPR charge by a person attending at the offices of a relevant local authority providing such payment services.  The €10 charge is payable by that person to the relevant local authority with the said charge from 1 January, 2012.Over-the counter payments are resource-heavy for local authorities and this is reflected in an additional fee if a person chooses to use an administratively-expensive payment option when others are available.  A €10 transaction charge was also recommended by the Local Government Efficiency Review Group to apply to all payments other than those made electronically.The €10 fee does not apply in any circumstances in the case of persons making payment of a household charge at the office of a local authority. There is no proposal to introduce a fee for payment of the charge by cheque.

A licensing authority must be satisfied that the tax class for which an application is being made is the appropriate class for the vehicle in question and may seek whatever additional documentation it deems necessary in order to be satisfied in this regard, including evidence of the existence of employees in order to be satisfied that the reduced rate of motor tax available to commercial vehicles is correctly being applied to the vehicle.

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €230 million in the county during the period of the Programme.The Water Services Investment Programme currently includes two projects in the ‘Contracts to Start' category of the Programme under Bantry Sewerage Scheme. Both of these are now completed resulting in the construction of a new waste water treatment plant in Bantry, the upgrading of the existing waste water pumping station and the provision of waste water transfer pipework between the town and the new waste water treatment plant.  The infrastructure installed under these contracts is fully operational since early 2011.Bantry Sewerage Scheme is also included in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2013 in the ‘Schemes at Planning' category of the Programme.  This Scheme will provide for the upgrading of the sewage collection system in Bantry town and the elimination of various separate waste water discharges to existing storm water culverts, which are unconnected to the town's existing waste water collection network. The Design Brief for the appointment of Consultants to prepare the Preliminary Report for this element of the scheme was recently submitted by Cork County Council to my Department and this will be assessed as soon as possible. The Preliminary Report, when completed, will make recommendations on the necessary upgrading of the sewage collection network, will outline the costs involved and will also provide the time scale for the delivery of the additional works.

Currently there are 35 Local Action Groups contracted, on my Department's behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding. Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations.Projects that require funding of €150,000 or more must seek final approval from the Department before a final decision can be made by the Local Action Group.  Pobal has no involvement in the assessment and approval of such projects. The project referred to in the question is one such project and funding of €322,528.41 has been sought.  The assessment of higher value projects (projects with a grant approval of €150,000 or more) usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant local development company.  It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications.  It may also, in some instances, result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme.These assessments also consider whether the project as proposed addresses the needs of the local community in the best possible way.  I am sure you will appreciate that a full and detailed assessment of all projects is vital. It must be remembered that currently, project expenditure under Axes 3 and 4 of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 is co-financed by the European Union at a rate of 85% and, accordingly, comes within the remit of a strict regulatory regime which requires that each project must be compliant before any funding is awarded.An application regarding the project in question has not as yet been submitted to the Rural Development Section of my Department. I understand that the Local Development Company dealing with the application does not have sufficient funding available under the Basic Services Measure of the RDP for the proposed project.  Recently, as part of a number of changes that I introduced, I announced an additional €10m in funding under the Basic Services Measure of the RDP which is in the process of being allocated to the 35 Local Development Companies.  Each Company was asked to make a submission regarding its need for additional funding and the overall value of those submissions is approximately €34m.  Accordingly, in the context of the available funding and the level of demand, it will not be possible to allocate funding to all eligible projects.The project mentioned by the Deputy will be evaluated in that context.

The charge is set at €200 and liability for it falls, in the main, on owners of rental, holiday and vacant properties in the State.The Act has a starting position of a universal liability for residential property in respect of the charge.  It goes on to exempt certain buildings and owners from this liability, the most important exemption being where a property is occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence on the liability date.  Where a property is not occupied by the owner as his or her sole or main residence, it falls liable for the charge, regardless of whether the owner's usual residence is in the State or abroad.Further exemptions provide for buildings that are newly constructed but unsold and form part of the trading stock of a business; buildings with heritage merit; buildings let by local authorities for social housing or by voluntary housing bodies; buildings which are the subject of a shared ownership arrangement with local authorities; and buildings on which commercial rates are paid and which are wholly used as dwellings.  In addition, exemptions apply where a person purchases a property for use as a principal private residence provided they dispose of their existing property within six months; where a charity owns a property, and where a spouse or ex-spouse has an interest in a property after a divorce or separation agreement but does not reside there.  Granny flats and principal private residences that have to be vacated due to long-term illness are also exempt if certain criteria are fulfilled.I have no plans at present to review the exemptions provided under the Act.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	775	My Department currently supports an ambitious programme of regeneration projects to deliver integrated physical, social and economic regeneration, ranging from large-scale urban regeneration projects such as those in Ballymun and Limerick city to smaller estate-wide regeneration projects in Dublin city and in a number of regional towns around the country.This year my Department is providing some €90 million to support the national regeneration programme. Regeneration goes beyond a bricks and mortar solution in improving the accommodation and lifestyles of residents of run down local authority estates and flat complexes. Regeneration seeks to address the underlying causes of disadvantage and social exclusion and to create vibrant and sustainable communities. The projects supported by my Department take a broad focus, beyond the remediation of the physical environment, also to deliver social and economic regeneration of the areas concerned.To qualify for regeneration funding, local authorities and regeneration agencies are required to prepare comprehensive evidence-based masterplans, which provide a vision for the physical, social and economic regeneration of the area concerned and set out a framework for delivering on the objectives of the plan. The plan should include detailed strategies and implementation arrangements for delivering all three strands of regeneration and for addressing the socio-economic and infrastructural deficits that contribute to the social exclusion of the community concerned. Beyond this, regeneration masterplans are project-specific and it is a matter for the local authority, in consultation with tenants, the local community and relevant statutory bodies, to determine the nature and extent of individual regeneration projects.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	776	I propose to take Questions Nos. 332 to 334, inclusive, together.The operating rules of Axis 3 and 4 (LEADER) of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP) require legally binding leasing arrangements for any land where works of a capital nature are being carried out by the entity seeking funding (promoter). The promoter must provide evidence of Title/Leasehold in respect of capital projects involving land, e.g. sites of building construction/renovation, fixtures, traffic ways, etc.  Leases in respect of such projects must run for a minimum period of 5 years from the date of the final grant payment to the promoter. Where a lease or evidence of title is not available a legal document declaring that the project promoter has permission to carry out the project activities concerned for at least a 5 year period, signed by a person/entity recognised as being the person/entity in charge of the property in question and the promoter, will suffice. A solicitor must witness the signing of this document.Where leasing arrangements as described above are in place, and not withstanding the full and robust consideration of all other elements of the proposed project, a project situated on Coillte land may be eligible in principle for funding from the LEADER elements of the RDP.  Section 109 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides the statutory basis for the establishment of a Community Fund. A local authority may by resolution establish a fund (in this section referred to as a ‘‘community fund'') for the purposes of supporting community initiatives and may accept contributions to such fund by any voluntary, business or community group, other local authority or public authority or other person and may itself make contributions to such fund. The establishment of a fund is discretionary but requires a resolution of the Council.The Rural Recreation Section of my Department has previously provided funding to Coillte to support the implementation of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy and for the development and maintenance of recreation facilities such as walking and cycling trails. Future support of this nature is subject to the availability of funding.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	777	The Programme for Government provides for the establishment of a new State-owned national water authority, Irish Water, to take over responsibility for managing and supervising investment in water services infrastructure and to manage the domestic water metering programme. The Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the EU/IMF committed Ireland to undertaking an independent assessment of the establishment of such an authority.The first phase of work on the independent assessment has been completed, and the published report is available on my Department's website. The Government decided in December 2011, based on the recommendations in the independent assessment, to establish a public water utility company to take over the operational and capital delivery functions of local authorities in the water services area.Work is now focused on the development of an implementation strategy which will address transformation planning in more detail. This strategy will provide the platform for dealing with a broad range of implementation issues during the transitional phase.  The implementation strategy is being developed in collaboration with other relevant Government Departments, local authorities, Bord Gáis and NewERA.  The strategy will focus on maintaining the delivery of a critical public service during and following a restructuring process, and will give further clarity on the next steps that will be taken in this reform process.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	778	My Department has been identified, in the Small Advisory Group's Report — The Voice of Small Business , as having lead responsibility for implementing recommendations in relation to local government reform and efficiencies, commercial rates, property taxes, water charges and the taxing of commercial vehicles.With regard to local government reform, the Government's broad policy approach was set out in the Programme for Government.  In line with this, I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly for an extensive programme of local government reform.  Subject to the Government's decisions, I will publish a comprehensive Policy Statement setting out a clear vision for the future of local government and proposals to achieve it, with particular focus on strengthening structures generally at regional, county and sub-county levels, expanding the role of local government, maximising operational and organisational efficiency and improving governance, oversight, local political and executive leadership and citizen engagement.With regard to the recommendations contained in the Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group, I established an independently chaired Implementation Group in April 2011 to drive forward relevant recommendations of the Report, with a focus on key recommendations that will remove costs and yield early savings.  The Group has recently completed an interim report and I am considering its contents in the overall context of the Local Government Reform Programme.With regard to commercial rates, local authorities have responded positively in recent years to requests to exercise restraint in setting commercial rates.  68 rateable local authorities when adopting their 2012 budgets maintained their ARVs at 2011 levels, and 19 reduced theirs.  Overall, the average change of ARV from 2011 to 2012 shows a decrease of 0.31%.  There are currently no plans to review the regulations or other legislation relating specifically to the payment of commercial rates.With regard to property taxes, an independently-chaired Inter-Departmental Expert Group was established to consider the structures and modalities for an equitable valuation-based property tax.  The Group has recently completed its work and submitted its report to me.  I will now be considering the approach to the report in consultation with my Government colleagues.With regard to water charges, the Memorandum of Understanding with the EU/IMF and ECB commits Ireland to introducing water charges for households during the programming period.  However, no decision has been taken by the Government on the exact date for the introduction of water charges.  The Government considers that charging based on usage is the fairest way to charge for water and it has decided that water meters should be installed in households connected to public water supplies.With regard to the taxing of commercial vehicles, Article 3 of the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992 provides that a licensing authority must be satisfied that a vehicle is correctly taxed.  Departmental Circular MT4/1, issued in August 2010, contained an instruction to licensing authorities that an applicant, in particular in relation to small vans and adapted goods vehicles, should be asked for supporting documentation which can include, but is not limited to, evidence of registration for VAT, a Tax Clearance Certificate, a commercial insurance certificate, or a copy of a "Notice of Tax Registration Form".  Form RF 111A Goods Declaration Form requires an applicant who is applying for a vehicle to be taxed at the goods rate to provide a Revenue registration identity number to confirm that he or she has a business registered for tax purposes.  The Road Traffic Act 2012 places obligations on insurers to provide details of insurance policies.  Assisted by this legal framework, it is understood that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is currently working with the Irish Insurance Federation (IIF) to obtain insurance details of vehicles in electronic format.The Department is also identified in the summary list of actions as responsible agency for accelerating the national revaluations process.  This is a matter for the Commissioner of Valuation.

Insofar as the planning application process is concerned there is a facility for the public/third parties to make submissions, and to appeal a decision of the planning authority to An Bord Pleanála as the independent planning appeals body.  In relation to development by a local authority the Planning Acts and Regulations similarly make provision for input from the public, whether in the case of decisions made by the elected members of the local authority, or, as is the case where the development would require assessment under the Environmental Impact Assessment or Habitats Directives, An Bord Pleanála.The forward planning process also makes provision for statutory consultation with the public in relation to the preparation of development plans and local area plans.  Furthermore, I am a statutory consultee in the forward planning process in the context of my overall responsibility for the planning policy and legislative framework to support proper planning and sustainable development, and I have delegated powers of direction under Section 31 of the Planning and Development Acts where I am of the opinion, inter alia, that a plan fails to set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of an area.The Planning Review Report I published, on 12 June 2012, together with the Government's response to the report of the Mahon Tribunal, within the coming weeks, will further underpin a fair, open and transparent planning system.

In the present economic circumstances it is to be anticipated that the ability of some borrowers to service housing loans may become restricted and that a number of loans may fall into arrears.Section 34 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 provides local authorities with powers to deal flexibly with distressed borrowers, and they have exhibited admirable forbearance over the years in dealing with such cases.  In March 2010 my Department issued guidelines to local authorities, based upon the Central Bank's first Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, which continued the tradition of handling arrears in a manner that is sympathetic to the needs of the particular household, while also protecting the position of the local authority concerned.To reflect the content of the Central Bank's revised Code of Conduct — which replaced the previous code from 1 January 2011 and was informed by the deliberations of the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt — my Department recently issued updated guidance to local authorities in consultation with the County and City Managers Association.  This will further enable local authorities to provide a range of flexible repayment options for households in difficulty.In particular, the introduction of a Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP), which closely mirrors the suite of options available in the commercial sector, will present borrowers in difficulty with a range of alternative payment agreements, which can be accessed to ease the particular circumstances of each case.  This process will feature a standard set of options including, in cases of certain unsustainable mortgages, the facility of mortgage-to-rent. Local authorities have been restructuring loans for some time using their own internal practices.  The introduction of these revised guidelines will standardise the approach across the whole sector, introduce a systematic structure to this area and provide borrowers with a transparent and accessible model for arrears resolution.I expect that the adoption of these revised guidelines will serve simultaneously to help resolve mortgage difficulties for both local authorities and their borrowers.

In this regard, application of the legislation in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority.However, I have recently issued guidelines to local authorities in relation to the operation of the "care and management" provisions of the Local Government (Charges) Act 2009 in the context of individual situations where genuine hardship in having to discharge a liability in a single payment can be demonstrated.  The guidelines set out the modalities for local authorities in relation to entering into payment arrangements for the discharge of outstanding liabilities in instalments over a specified period.  I expect local authorities to implement these guidelines appropriately.

In addition to my answer on that occasion I would point out that in many instances.  95% of all visa applications are approved and that the overall average rate of visa approval is 92%.While I am not averse in principle to the establishment of an immigration regime specifically geared to the technology sector, it would have to be on the basis that there was concrete evidence of a particular skills deficit in the labour market that cannot be filled by Irish or EU citizens.  That labour market assessment would ultimately be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  In this regard it should be borne in mind that the technology sector spans a broad range of skills with differing levels of supply and demand.I would also envisage that applicants for any such programmes would be subject to a rigorous assessment of their qualifications and experience to ensure that their skill sets are appropriate for the sector in question. In any event, the existing visa application arrangements are entirely flexible and designed to cater for the widest possible range of applicants who may wish to come here as workers, visitors, professionals and so forth.

This includes persons identified in the course of investigations into offences contrary to the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 and the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008.An Garda Síochána has conducted a number of investigations to combat human trafficking, including child trafficking, and will continue to do so in line with information/intelligence available to them.  Ongoing training takes place for members of An Garda Síochána who are aware of the signs of human trafficking, including child trafficking.  As with all crimes, members of An Garda Síochána are vigilant in their efforts to combat the crime of human trafficking and especially the trafficking of children.  Locations and the circumstances of human trafficking can significantly vary and the intelligence led approach of An Garda Síochána has to be based on the particular circumstances which arise.Under the National Action Plan to Prevent and Combat the Trafficking of Human Beings in Ireland a Working Group on Child Trafficking has been established and is chaired by my Department's Anti-Human Trafficking Unit; this Group has representatives of State organisations including An Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive; non-governmental organisations and international organisations.  The purpose of this Working Group is to progress actions in the Plan related to child trafficking.  Specific issues of concern can be raised within this forum and directed, as appropriate, to the representatives from An Garda Síochána.A Guide on Services for Victims of Child Trafficking has been finalised and is available on the website www.blueblindfold.gov.ie.  An information leaflet setting out the signs of child trafficking will shortly be available for distribution and will also be put on the website.

On taking office, I raised a number of cases of white collar crime with the Garda Commissioner and I am being briefed on an ongoing basis on the progress of the investigations.  I am assured by the Commissioner that the resources allocated to the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation are sufficient to meet the demands placed on it and I will respond as necessary to any further legislative needs raised by An Garda Síochána or any of the other bodies involved in the investigation and prosecution of white collar crime.I should mention that the primary regulative and investigative agency for the offences under the Companies Acts which includes falsification of accounts (Section 22(3) 1986 Companies Act) is the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and the primary regulative and investigative agency for the Investment Intermediaries Act and the Stock Exchange Act is the Central Bank.My commitment to tackling white collar crime was further underscored by the swift action I took, within eight weeks of taking up office, to move urgently to draft and seek Government approval to the introduction of additional legislation.  This new legislation, the Criminal Justice Act  2011, was enacted on 2 August 2011.  The main purpose of this new legislation is to address delays in the prosecution and investigation of complex white collar crime by improving certain important procedural matters and strengthening Garda investigative powers.  The Act's provisions are based on the experiences of those involved in investigations and prosecutions of white collar crime.  It provides new procedures and powers which will speed up both current and future investigations, including investigations into offences in the areas of banking and finance, company law, money laundering, fraud and corruption.I am also bringing forward a new Bill to clarify and strengthen the law on corruption and to replace a number of overlapping Corruption Acts stretching back to Victorian times.In so far as the statistics cited by the Deputy are concerned, these relate to the outcome of the criminal prosecution process and the Deputy will appreciate that my role does not extend to the bringing of prosecutions, or indeed to the determination of guilt, which is a matter for the courts.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	789	The person concerned arrived in the State on 21 December 2003 and made an application for asylum the following day.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 29 October 2004, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.  Representations were submitted on behalf of the person concerned at that time.On 10 October 2006 the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006), came into force.  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.The wife of the person concerned made an application for Family Reunification on 15 February 2010.  As is standard practice where an application for family reunification has been made in addition to an application for Subsidiary Protection and representations for consideration under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the family reunification application will be considered first and a decision notified.  This application was refused and the wife of the person concerned was so notified by letter dated 6 January 2012.The person's application for Subsidiary Protection will be considered next.  In the event that this application is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.  Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	794	Under the Garda Síochána Acts 2005-2007, the Commissioner is required to submit, before November of each year, a policing plan for the forthcoming year.  Any proposals for the closure of Garda stations or the altering of Regional or Divisional boundaries must be set out in that plan.  The Policing Plan for 2013 has not yet been prepared and therefore it is not possible to say at this stage what it may contain although I expect that it will contain measures to address the ongoing issue of rationalisation of the Garda station network.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	795	I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service that the number of Certificates of Naturalisation issued in the years 2005 to 2012 were approximately 1,400, 1,400, 1,500, 3,100, 4,500, 6,400, 10,700, and 12,300 in the year to date respectively.The top ten nationalities naturalised since 2005 are Nigerian, Filipino, Indian, South African, Chinese (including Hong Kong nationals), Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Ukrainian, Russian Federation nationals and nationals of the United States of America.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	796	I very much share the Deputy's concern about the incidence of street violence and anti-social behaviour.  There is little doubt that much of this is fuelled by excessive drinking, as well as the use of illegal drugs.An Garda Síochána is using the strong legal powers available under the Public Order Acts and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts to keep our streets as safe as possible, including prosecutions where appropriate.  The powers available include the seizure of alcohol to prevent under age drinking in public places and to forestall public disorder or damage to property.  Gardaí may also issue fixed charge notices for the offences of intoxication in a public place and disorderly conduct in a public place.  These are a more efficient use of Garda resources and avoid court proceedings when an offender pays the penalty.I am in regular contact with the Garda authorities about these matters and these contacts will continue.However, this problem is not simply a matter of law and order.  Rather, it requires action by parents, educators and those who sell alcohol, not only in public houses, but right across the retail sector.  I have indicated that, in the coming months, I intend to put in place new regulations to prohibit the below cost selling of alcohol and also alcohol promotions that encourage excessive drinking.

The destruction of these firearms was authorised by the Chief Superintendent in charge of the Garda Technical Bureau.  I am further informed by the Garda authorities that, for security reasons, it would be inappropriate to provide further details in relation to this matter.I am also advised that a request for tender for the destruction of ammunition stored at Clancy Barracks issued on 19 November, 2001. The tender issued to 13 companies with expertise in the area and these included companies which were Irish based and companies which were based outside the State.  In addition, I understand that the successful company was paid by the Garda authorities on completion of the service required.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	800	The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland which are registered with the Gardaí for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to work with children and/or vulnerable adults. The primary purpose of the process is the protection of children and vulnerable adults.Garda Vetting Disclosures are predicated on the signed authorisation of a vetting subject for An Garda Síochána to disclose to the registered organisation "details of all prosecutions, successful or not, pending or completed, and/or convictions which may be recorded in respect of them in the State or elsewhere"; or alternatively that there are "no prosecutions or convictions recorded in respect of them".The Garda Central Vetting Unit does not provide Garda clearance.   The function of the GCVU is to make disclosure, in accordance with a written authorisation from the vetting subject to the registered organisation.  Decisions on the suitability of the person concerned rest at all times with the recruiting organisation to which a vetting disclosure is made.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	801	The matter referred to by the Deputy concerns the client of a solicitor who is dissatisfied with the legal services provided by that solicitor. Under the current regulatory regime, the Law Society of Ireland, the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal and the Office of the Independent Adjudicator are the statutorily independent bodies charged with investigating or resolving complaints against solicitors under the Solicitors Acts 1954-2008 and their attendant regulations.Under these statutory complaints structures the Law Society is, therefore, the usual or main route of redress for aggrieved clients of solicitors, outside of the courts. The Society's Complaints and Client Relations Committee, which includes lay members, determines complaints lodged directly to it by members of the public. The Society provides guidance on "making a complaint" at its website, www.lawsociety.ie.The Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal deals with complaints of misconduct and applications to it are either referred by the Law Society or made directly by members of the public. The Tribunal members are appointed by the President of the High Court and act independently of the Law Society. Further details are available on the Tribunal's website www.distrib.ie.Persons who are unhappy with the Law Society's handling of the complaint may also forward their complaint to the Office of the Independent Adjudicator [www.independentadjudicator.ie]. The Independent Adjudicator was established to provide an independent forum to which members of the public could apply if they were dissatisfied with the manner in which the Law Society had dealt with their complaint. It is important to note that the Adjudicator’s role is to investigate the handling of the complaint by the Law Society and not to investigate the substance of the original complaint.Under current law, therefore, it is not my function as Minister to determine or to intervene in disputes or difficulties between solicitors and their clients. Nor would it be appropriate for me to give legal advice on specific cases or to make a complaint on a person's behalf.  Rather, these are matters to be dealt with by the designated statutory bodies or through the courts. Persons considering taking legal action against a solicitor may find it more prudent to first seek independent legal advice on the strength or otherwise of their position.  It will then be a matter for the persons concerned to decide which course of action might be best suited to the circumstances of their complaint and to approach the relevant disciplinary body on that basis.The Deputy may also wish to be aware that the Legal Services Regulation Bill 2011, which is due to commence Committee Stage following the summer recess, will establish a new, independent, Legal Services Regulatory Authority with responsibility for the oversight of both solicitors and barristers. There will be a new complaints system to deal with complaints about professional misconduct independent of both the Law Society and the Bar Council backed up by a Legal Practitioners' Disciplinary Tribunal. Members of the public who wish to make complaints will no longer do so through the Law Society or the Bar Council but through the new Legal Services Regulatory Authority. There will also be a new and more transparent legal costs regime based on a set of Legal Costs Principles provided in statute for the first time and a new Office of the Legal Costs Adjudicator whose determinations on disputed legal costs will be published.

The maximum aggregate time a non-EEA student is permitted to be in the State as a student is seven years.  The person has been advised of her options in this regard and has been granted a temporary extension of permission to remain until the 17 August, 2012 in order to consider the options available.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	804	Section 6A of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as inserted by section 4 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 provides that a person born in the island of Ireland shall not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless a parent of that person has, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person's birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years.  The section does not apply to certain persons including those born to parents one of whom is at the time of the person's birth an Irish citizen, British citizen or a person entitled to reside without restriction. For the purpose of calculating reckonable residence  under section 6A certain residence is excluded from consideration including unlawful residence, residence covered by a permission granted under Section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004 for the purpose of study and residence covered by a provisional permission granted pending  determination of an asylum application.Applicants for certificates of naturalisation are required to provide evidence that they were resident and that they had the permission of the Minister to remain in the State for the prescribed period. Periods for which an applicant did not have the permission of the Minister and periods for which permission granted for the purpose of study are not reckonable for the purpose of satisfying the residency requirements.Upon application for a passport, the Passport Office of the Department of Foreign Affairs assesses the child's entitlement to citizenship based upon the parent's reckonable residency. If the parents do not have sufficient residency the child does not have an entitlement to citizenship. It remains open to the parent of the child to make an application for a certificate of naturalisation on their behalf under section 15 of the 1956 Act when the child has 5 years reckonable residency in the State.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	805	Section 86 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides that the Property Services Regulatory Authority shall prepare and maintain a register of residential property sales prices in the State. I am advised by the Authority that it expects to publish the register by the end of September 2012.  It is anticipated that the residential property sales prices register will comprise a database searchable by a number of criteria including address of property, value of property, by county, city or town.  The information which will be contained in the database will be the full address of the property, its sale price and date of sale.  The register will, at the outset, cover all sales between 1 January 2010 to date of publication.  It is anticipated that the information will be updated regularly and will be current within 30 days of the actual date of sale of the property.Section 87 of the Property Services (Regulation) Act 2011 provides that the Authority shall establish and maintain a database relating to commercial property leases. It is anticipated by the Authority that the commercial leases database will be put in place during the early part of 2013 and that it will contain data relating to leases entered into after 3 April 2012.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	806	The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for over 19,000 organisations in Ireland who are registered with the Gardaí for this purpose and which employ/engage persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.The current average processing time at the GCVU is 3 weeks approximately.   This, in my view, is well within acceptable limits. Seasonal fluctuations and the necessity to seek additional information on particular applications can, however, result in this processing time being exceeded on occasion. Registered organisations have been advised to take account of these processing times, and the possible need for additional information to be provided in some cases, in their recruitment and selection processes.I would remind the Deputy that since I became Minister I have taken a number of measures to ensure that the time it takes for the processing of vetting applications improves significantly. I remain very conscious of the need to keep the time required to obtain a vetting to the minimum possible.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	807	The law relating to powers of entry and search for the purposes of criminal and civil investigations is detailed and complex. Members of the Garda Síochána and many other persons by virtue of the particular office that they hold have powers to enter or search private property without the consent of the occupier, and in some instances without a search warrant. It should be said that the majority of Agencies and Bodies that have such powers operate outside the aegis of my Department.Insofar as my Department is concerned, a number of Bodies have powers of entry and search, in the course of their investigations.  These include the Garda Síochána, the Private Security Authority, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, the Data Protection Commissioner and the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.Members of the Garda Síochána have a wide range of common law and statutory powers to enter a private premises. These  powers are restricted in terms of their purpose and the circumstances in which they may be used. Such restrictions arise from the need to balance, on the one hand, the duty of a member to enforce the law and protect individuals and, on the other, the rights of individuals to ownership and privacy. In addition, the Deputy will be aware that Article 40.5 of the Constitution affords special protection to domestic dwellings providing that they are inviolable and may not be forcibly entered save in accordance with law.Examples of the powers available to members of the Garda Síochána include the common law power to enter a private premises without a warrant in order to save a life within;  section 6 of the Criminal Law Act 1997 which permits the entry and search of any premises to effect an arrest; and section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 which permits a member to apply to a District Court judge for a search warrant for the purpose of gathering evidence in relation to the commission of a serious offence.

Considerable resources are deployed to process applications and these resources together with the necessary administrative arrangements are kept under review.As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that a tender for repair works in respect of Ballygar Station has recently been issued by the Office of Public Works.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	810	Decisions in relation to Garda operations and the deployment of Garda resources are a matter for the Garda Commissioner.I am advised by the Garda authorities that the burglary referred to by the Deputy was reported in person at around 10pm at a Garda station in Co. Donegal.  Rather than wait for the return of  the local patrol car, which was on patrol in the locality, and given that the premises was around 700 metres from the station, the Garda member on duty immediately accompanied the victim of the crime in her car to check out the premises and to expedite the Garda inquiries into the burglary.  Additionally, the member sought to reassure the victim with his immediate presence.While care must be taken in relation to publicly commenting on individual cases, and while nothing should be said that intrudes into individual privacy, I do feel it appropriate to say that in the light of the circumstances I have outlined, I believe that the action of the Garda member in this case demonstrated the determination of An Garda Síochána to serve the community in the most effective and practical way possible.More generally, I am, of course, happy to express my appreciation and support for the work of An Garda Síochána on my own behalf, that of the Government, and, in particular, on behalf of the communities they serve.

In that context I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are not in a position to provide details of overtime allocations for the sub-districts referred to by the Deputy.  I understand that this is due to the fact that Garda overtime expenditure arises on the basis of operational requirements and is not specifically linked to individual locations.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	820	The Deputy will be aware of the process leading up to the publication of the Commissioner's policing plan for each year. That process has not yet been completed for the policing plan for 2013 and it is therefore not possible to state what it will contain although I do expect that it will contain proposals for the further rationalisation of Garda stations and Districts. In this regard, each Regional Officer is tasked with conducting an impact assessment on the demands placed on each Garda district and station within their region.The overall operational effectiveness and resilience of the Garda Síochána is also being examined and covers such areas as the broad range of policing activity and resources including courts, escorts, protection posts, station opening hours, training, contracts/procurement, civilianisation and specialisation and partnerships with other agencies to enhance overall efficiency in the justice system. The objective of this review is to identify opportunities to achieve further efficiencies in the Garda Síochána while at the same time ensuring that the commitment of An Garda Síochána to the community is not diminished.  The analysis of the assessment findings from the Northern Region, within which the Donegal division is located, is awaited.  The Garda Commissioner has reiterated the commitment of An Garda Síochána to continue to provide a professional and effective policing service within the prevailing economic conditions. However, the Garda Síochána is not immune from the harsh economic realities which are impacting on the community and the public sector alike.

She was recorded by An Garda Síochána as a possible victim of human trafficking but the person did not wish to make a statement and left the jurisdiction, travelling to the UK. There was no further information available to An Garda Síochána and the matter could not be progressed further.No victims of human trafficking came to the attention of An Garda Síochána in Waterford Garda Division in 2011.

This is further broken down into 840 operators and 174 supervisors.  A minimum of two persons per unit are trained in the use of these machines.  A more detailed breakdown is not readily available and would require a disproportionate amount of Garda resources to elicit the information requested.The information in relation to the distribution of the 22 new machines and the time and cost of training is not readily available. I have requested the information from the Garda authorities. I will be in contact with the Deputy when the information is to hand.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	825	Lead responsibility for the implementation of the recommendations of the Report referred to by the Deputy rests with my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.Section 4 of the Report makes reference to the need for reform of our personal insolvency regime.  In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that I have brought forward proposals for radical reform of the law in this area.  These are contained in the Personal Insolvency Bill 2012 which was published on 29 June last.  The Bill is currently at Dáil Second Stage.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	826	To date, ten complaints concerning allegations that rendition flights were transiting through Shannon Airport have been received from members of the public in the past five years which have been subject of investigation by An Garda Síochána. No evidence of rendition was disclosed in any of the investigations and as a result there were no prosecutions.All complaints of this nature are dealt with in line with the advices provided by the Attorney General/Director of Public Prosecutions.An Garda Síochána are fully committed to investigate all alleged breaches of the criminal law including alleged offences involving the use of aircraft at Shannon Airport.There are statutory powers of search and entry bestowed on the Garda Siochána under various legislative provisions. However, these powers may only be exercised in circumstances where a member of An Garda Síochána reasonably suspects that an offence has occurred. The mere assertion of wrongdoing by a member of the general public is clearly insufficient in this regard.  In the circumstances, there is no basis for the suggestion in the Deputy's question.

The documentation requested is for the purpose of establishing that the Non EEA national who wishes to remain in the State comes within the criteria for permission to remain in the State on the basis of a de facto relationship with an Irish National. In particular, the person should be in a position to provide evidence of a durable attested relationship of at least two years. The following documentation must be provided:1. Evidence of finances of both parties.2. Evidence of relationship of at least 2 years duration  (i.e. tenancy agreements, utility bills, bank statements, etc).I understand that these applications are processed without the requirement of an interview with the applicant.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

Considerable resources are deployed to process applications and these resources together with the necessary administrative arrangements are kept under review.As well as being a significant event in the life of its recipient, the granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation as provided for in law is also a major step for the State which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	829	The Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) of my Department is charged with responsibility for the accommodation of asylum seekers while their applications for protection are being processed.  Currently, there are almost 5,100 persons accommodated in 37 RIA centres located throughout the State.The person referred to in the question made an application for asylum on 11 March, 2009, was deemed an unaccompanied minor by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC) and referred to the HSE which has responsibility for the care of unaccompanied minors under the Child Care Act 1991.Where an unaccompanied asylum seeker minor in the care of the HSE reaches 18 years of age, he or she may be referred by the HSE to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) for transfer to adult accommodation and service provision.  In circumstances where the HSE deem such a person to be particularly vulnerable, the period in HSE care can be extended beyond 18 years of age at the HSE's discretion, as happened in this case.In this case, the person concerned was placed in a foster home accommodation by the HSE and remained there until 20 January, 2012 when she was transferred to RIA for adult accommodation within the Direct Provision system, at which point she was 20 years of age. Discussions took place with the HSE Separated Children's Team prior to her arrival in RIA accommodation.  RIA was informed that she was undertaking a pre-nursing course which would be completed in May 2012.  It was agreed to offer this person accommodation in Viking Lodge in Dublin, a RIA accommodation centre, until June 2012. The person concerned was informed by letter dated 9 December, 2011 from RIA that she would be placed in Viking Lodge until June, 2012, after which she would be transferred to one of the designated "aged-out-minor" centres outside of Dublin.  This would be in keeping with RIA's policy to disperse such persons to centres outside Dublin, generally family centres which have established links to HSE services and NGO supports.Further discussions took place with the HSE Separated Children's Team in December, 2011 and in January, March and April of 2012 as to which RIA family centre would best suit this person following the completion of her pre-nursing course.  In May, 2012 representations were made on her behalf by the Dun Laoghaire Refugee Project (DRP) and Crosscare to the effect that she should not be transferred from Dublin. RIA and the HSE held to the view that this person did not require a placement in Dublin.  On 30 May, 2012, the person was informed that she would be transferring to Globe House, Sligo on 5 July, 2012.Further representations were then received from the Irish Refugee Council (IRC) which included a letter from DRP stating that she had received a place in a two year Social Care course in Inchicore College which the DRP were funding. The IRC also forwarded medical information regarding this person which was sent to the independent medical referee. His subsequent advice was that this person can be safely transferred to another location with the proviso that her medical records follow her.For unconnected reasons, the transfer to Sligo has had to be postponed to the beginning of August.  RIA has been informed that, in the meantime, further representations will be made on this case and these will, of course, be considered further.  I am informed by RIA that the enrolment of this person in a two year course in Dublin to begin in September, when she was aware of her pending transfer to outside Dublin, will not be a factor in determining the final outcome in this case. As things stand, and pending consideration of any further representations in this case, RIA intends to proceed with this transfer in August.

However, grant-aid was refused in relation to the completion of a slatted cubicle house as this investment had not been the subject of a grant-aid application when the Scheme closed. The person named appealed this decision in August 2008 however the original decision of the Department was upheld.As the grant-aid must be limited to items listed in my Department's letter of approval, I regret that no further grant-aid is payable in this case.

I understand that in the case which was the subject of recent media reports, the local authority veterinary service has carried out checks and the shelter concerned routinely uses the services of an approved rendering plant.The Control of Dogs Acts 1986 and 1992 place statutory responsibility for dog control and licensing services (including the provision of shelters for stray and other dogs) on local authorities.

During the course of this inspection discrepancies were found that resulted in a claimed area of 6.65ha being reduced to a found area of 3.43ha. If the total area found is not sufficient to support the number of entitlements held penalties will be applied per the Terms and Conditions of the scheme. In this case the number of entitlements held by the person named is 6.4. As the difference between the area declared and the area found was more than 50%, under EU Regulations no payment was due in respect of the 2011 scheme.The person named was informed of this decision and of his right to seek a review. He was also informed of his right to appeal the outcome of any such review to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office. Such a review was requested, the outcome of which was to uphold the original decision. An appeal has been lodged with Agriculture Appeals Office who will be in contact with the person named to arrange a hearing in due course.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	855	I propose to take Questions Nos. 419 and 420 together.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB), under the auspices of my Department, has a statutory remit to ensure that "each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education”. In particular, the NEWB has a key role to respond to instances where children are not attending school regularly, or where there is concern about a child’s educational welfare. The Educational Welfare Service, and its network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs), is a key resource for the Board in delivering on this statutory remit.The NEWB further has strategic and operational responsibility for the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme and is developing an integrated service to better respond to the complexity of issues that impact on children and young people's attendance, participation and retention in the education system.With regard to the issue of caseloads, when a young person is referred to the Board by a school, parent or another agency, the initial work of the EWO is to assess the nature, scope and depth of the problem.  Each case generally falls between two distinct categories i.e. those requiring intensive casework and those requiring brief interventions.I have been advised by the Board that in 2011, the Board's EWOs worked with 3,845 children requiring Intensive Casework. Of the 3,845 cases, 1093 were new cases. In addition, EWOs worked with a further 12,062 children by providing assistance through Brief Interventions.The NEWB is staffed with 72 front line personnel (57 Educational Welfare Officers, 12 Senior Educational Welfare Officers and 3 Regional Managers) and a further 19 staff in management and administrative support work in head quarters and at regional locations. The Board also has strategic and operational responsibility for 403 HSCL co-ordinators, 250 full-time SCP staff and several hundred sessional SCP personnel which are overseen by 5 Service Managers in the Board.Vacancies that arise in staffing front line services for children and young people at risk of early school leaving are prioritised by my Department in so far as possible working within Government policy on public service numbers and the moratorium on recruitment.The Board has prioritised the introduction of a new integrated practice and case management system bringing together the Educational Welfare Service, the Home School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme.

The report contains a comprehensive analysis of non attendance data in primary and post primary schools including information about absences and suspensions and detailed data about attendance patterns in urban and rural schools, schools in disadvantaged areas and special schools. The data in the report links to the attendance data reported for earlier years. The report is available on the website of the NEWB at www.newb.ie.The overall reduction in the rate of absenteeism in 2009/2010 is welcome. However the number of children who continue to miss school each day is a concern because of the implications that such absences hold for children and young people's educational and developmental outcomes. Almost €38 million has been allocated to my Department in 2012 to support children and young people's participation and retention in education through the services of the NEWB, in particular, through the School Completion Programme and Home School Community Liaison Scheme which target children in the most disadvantaged communities in the country.The NEWB, under the remit of my Department, has prioritised the introduction of a new integrated practice and case management system.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	857	The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, which I published in 2011, provides clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect. It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the care of the organisation. The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First and the Heads of the Bill have been prepared and submitted to the Committee for Health and Children for their consideration.The Deputy will be aware that Children First has operated on the basis of voluntary compliance since it was first published by the then Department of Health and Children in 1999. Significant resources have been put in place to support the implementation of Children First and in the case of the HSE and An Garda Síochána, Children First has formed an integral part of their existing operations and practices. The HSE has provided training, information and advice on the implementation of Children First throughout the HSE, voluntary and community sector. In addition to the existing structures in place to support Children First, significant additional resources have been provided to the HSE over the past three years to increase the number of social workers in the child welfare and protection area. The recruitment of these additional social workers was included in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan, as was the commitment to place Children First on a statutory basis.  This additional resource will be of particular assistance to the HSE in driving forward the process of implementation of Children First.
Currently, under Children First, organisations are required to appoint a Designated Officer. The Designated Officer has responsibility that staff and volunteers are vetted, recruited properly and are trained in safe practices with children and in recognising signs of abuse and neglect.  In the proposed legislation, it is intended that the Designated Officer along with certain named professionals will have statutory responsibility to report information about abuse to the HSE. The obligation to report abuse extends to abuse and neglect wherever it occurs, that comes to the attention of the Designated Officer in the course of his/her work or volunteer activities.To assist Designated Officers and certain named professionals make a determination as to whether to report abuse, a "Guidance for Reporting of Abuse" is to be developed by my Department. This Guidance will deal with issues such as definitions, thresholds and appropriate routes for the reporting of abuse. The Guidance will assist designated officers and professionals named in the legislation, in their considering a number of factors to see if the concern reaches the threshold of a report under the legislation. This approach is intended to ensure that only those cases which require an assessment by the HSE are brought to its attention. As regards the allocation of resources to community based welfare services, this will be a matter to be considered both in the context of the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency and the Regulatory Impact Analysis which will accompany the preparation of relevant legislation.The HSE is actively reviewing the impact of current vacancies, including recent retirements at national and regional level. The National Director of Children and Families Services, Gordon Jeyes,  will apply his discretion over the course of the year to the filling of vacancies, having regard to identified need and subject to services being delivered  within available resources, taking account of recent early retirements, identified need and subject to services being delivered within available resources.The recruitment of the additional social workers is one element of a wider reform agenda within the HSE, through which I believe we can deliver better outcomes for children and families. This reform agenda will lead to the establishment of a new Child and Family Support Agency which will provide a dedicated focus on child protection and will support families in need.

Under the provisions of the legislation, such adoptions may take place up to the end of October 2013.As regards adoptions thereafter, Russia has not ratified the Hague Convention and there appears to be no immediate prospect that this will happen.  Therefore, future adoptions from Russia, beyond those provided for under the transitional arrangements, may only be possible under a bi-lateral agreement.  The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010.  Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.It is the role of the Adoption Authority to make an assessment of whether the inter-country adoption legislation and practices in a non-contracting state, in this case Russia, are in compliance with both Irish legislation and the principles of the Hague Convention.  As part of this assessment the Adoption Authority has reviewed a draft bilateral agreement presented to it during previous discussions with its Russian counterparts and has provided me with an initial assessment in this regard. As a result of this, the issues which may require further exploration with the Russian authorities have been considered. I have recently asked the Adoption Authority to engage further with the Russian authorities on issues raised in their report to me.

The policies include procedures for staff and management to follow in recording and addressing sick leave levels.  These arrangements recognise that staff may from time to time encounter challenges to their health and well-being and that management of sick leave must be done in a fair and consistent manner with the objective of addressing the cause of the sick leave and ensuring regular attendance.Management information systems are in place to record, monitor and analyse patterns of sick leave. Failure to comply with the sick leave regulations is considered as serious misconduct and the disciplinary code may be invoked.

Under Children First, organisations are required to appoint a Designated Liaison Person. This person acts as a liaison with outside agencies and a resource to any staff member or volunteer who has child protection concerns. He/she is also responsible for ensuring that the standard reporting procedure is followed , so that suspected cases of child neglect or abuse are referred promptly to the designated person in the HSE Children and Family Services or to An Garda Síochána where there is an emergency and the HSE is unavailable. The Designated Liaison Person  should ensure that they are knowledgeable about child protection and undertake training as necessary.In the legislation, it is proposed that the Designated Officer along with certain named professionals will have statutory responsibility to report information about abuse to the HSE. The obligation to report abuse extends to abuse and neglect wherever it occurs, that comes to the attention of the Designated Officer in the course of his/her work or volunteer activities.To assist Designated Officers and certain named professionals make a determination as to whether to report abuse, a "Guidance for Reporting of Abuse" is to be developed by my Department.

Issues such as that raised by the Deputy are clearly set out in the guidance.  I have asked each Department to prepare a sectoral plan which sets out the current mechanisms for assurance of compliance with Children First policy as well as identifying those areas where improved mechanisms or supports are required to ensure full implementation.  I expect to receive drafts of those plans in the coming weeks.

The general review process followed by the AAI in such instances is detailed on the Authority's website. In the case of Kenya the AAI requested the preparation of a legal opinion and awaits receipt of same. Owing to the variable nature of the process in respect of each individual country, and the need to engage with legal experts in the country being assessed, there is no definitive or set timescale for the completion of such reviews. The AAI will provide all relevant information relating to reviews on its website at the appropriate time.

These transitional arrangements may lead to adoptions from Ethiopia taking place up to the end of October 2012. The Adoption Act 2010 also contains provision for a one year extension to declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt which may lead to a one year extension to this date.Ethiopia is not a signatory of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.  In these circumstances, adoptions from Ethiopia which are not covered by the transitional arrangements referred to above would require a bilateral agreement between Ireland and Ethiopia. The negotiation of bilateral agreements on inter-country adoption with states who have not ratified the Hague Convention is governed by Section 73 of the Adoption Act 2010.   Any bilateral arrangements which might be entered into would be required by law to meet the minimum standards set out in the Hague Convention.A delegation from the Adoption Authority visited Ethiopia in April and held exploratory meetings with the Ethiopian authorities regarding the system of adoption which operates in that country. The delegation, in the course of its visit, held preliminary discussions with the Ethiopian authorities around the potential for a bilateral agreement on inter-country adoption. The Authority submitted its initial report which summarises the conclusions and recommendations of the delegation's visit.  In addition, the Embassy in Ethiopia recently submitted a detailed background note on inter-country adoption in Ethiopia.  The AAI has stated that it is seeking further legal advice in Ethiopia on whether adoptions there are full or simple adoptions.  At the time of making its initial report the Authority indicated that it would contact me again once it has received this legal advice and completed its consideration of the matter.The Authority has recently confirmed to me that it will submit its further report on adoption in Ethiopia as soon as possible.

The programme was open to both community not-for-profit child care facilities and private child care facilities, that are currently participating in one of the three child care programmes implemented by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs (DCYA).  The maximum grant available was €50,000 (including VAT).  The aim of the funding is to provide support to child care settings to address remedial, maintenance and renovation work, or to purchase equipment.Following a robust appraisal 290 applications were approved for funding.  The successful applications were those that represented the most complete, coherent, precise and compelling cases for funding.  The investment has been directed, to the greatest extent possible, to addressing the most urgent works, and supporting the quality of services making the greatest impact for disadvantaged children and communities.The capital programme was administered by Pobal and behalf of this Department.  The Pobal website informed applicants, whose applications were declined, of the steps to be taken to obtain information on how their application was appraised.  Applicants could request by e-mail a call-back from Pobal if they wished to discuss their application further.   The reason for the decline/partial approval would then be explained to the applicant and if the applicant still had concerns about the reasonable treatment of their application, a written request to Pobal for a review of their application could be submitted.   The review of such applications will be considered shortly by a Review Panel which is being led by my Department.I understand that at this stage, Pobal cannot take any further requests for individual consultations or requests for reviews.  I also understand that the service in question has not made contact with Pobal since the decision to decline the application was transmitted to them.It is not possible, prior to the conclusion of the Estimates and Budgetary Process for 2013, to determine whether capital funding will be made available to my Department under December's Budget.

The equivalent budget figure for 2011 is estimated at €529.7 million. Reliable data for 2009 and 2010 is not available on a comparable basis in the absence of a standardised national reporting system which accurately captures expenditure across all children and family services.In preparation for the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency work is under way on disaggregating the Children and Families budget from within the overall HSE financial determination. This necessary work will be completed in the latter half of 2012 in preparation for the planned establishment of the new agency early in 2013. This process is likely to lead to some further revision of the above figures having regard to the detailed service composition of the care group.It is my intention and that of the National Director, Gordon Jeyes as the Chief Executive Officer designate for the new Agency, to ensure that there is full transparency with regard to the composition of the budget for the new Agency when established.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	873	The gross estimate provision for my Department in 2012 is €426.980 million. This represents an increase of €7.8 million, or 2%, on last year's outturn. In addition, the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2012 indicates, for the first time, a dedicated sub-head budget provision of €550.7 million for HSE children and family services. The equivalent budget figure for 2011 is estimated at €529.7 million. The HSE figures are the subject of ongoing validation and refinement in the context of the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency. The Agency will be established early next year and will take over responsibility from the HSE for children and family services.I acknowledge the service pressures within children and youth services, including those arising from demographic factors. In the context of the wider economic situation, I am satisfied that the increased budgetary provision in 2012 demonstrates that significant priority has been afforded to the services funded by my Department and the HSE in these areas.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	874	My Department is currently engaged in a Workforce Planning exercise to compare our current workforce with future workforce requirement relative to the delivery of commitments under the Programme for Government and other strategic objectives of the Department. This exercise is examining how best to have the right people with the right knowledge, skills and competencies deployed appropriately. It is taking account of all managed movement into, around, and out of the Department including retirement, recruitment, promotion, secondment, transfers and redeployment opportunities.As part of this process, specific skills in the area of legal, financial, research, economic, change management and human resources have already been identified as requiring development. Officials of my Department are in discussion with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in this regard with a view to addressing this requirement from within approved numbers and within the overall existing Vote provision for my Department.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	876	I propose to take Questions Nos. 444 and 445 together.As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children's and young people's outcomes is my primary objective.  Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children's opportunities for social and educational development. In 2012, some €230 million in all will be provided by my Department for these schemes. This year some 66,000 children throughout the country will benefit from the free preschool year in the Early Childhood Care and Education programme, while some 26,000 children in low income households will benefit under the Community Childcare Subvention programme.My Department supports the delivery of a range of youth work programme and services, including programmes for young people living in disadvantaged communities. In 2012, funding of €56.8m (current expenditure) will be invested in provision for youth. The programmes are delivered by the voluntary youth work sector. They include "out of school" projects in non-formal education settings and projects which aim to divert "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas from the dangers of substance misuse; as well as the provision of community centres, youth facilities and sports clubs. Over 500,000 young people including those who are disadvantaged or marginalised benefit from the youth work programmes and services provided by the voluntary youth work sector by some 1,100 youth work personnel. This work is supported by a large volunteer base estimated to be in the region of 60,000.Some 31 national and major regional voluntary youth organisations are supported under the Youth Service Grant Scheme to provide universal youth work opportunities for over 200,000 young people aged between 10 and 21. These programmes promote and support young people's development and well-being and assist them in becoming self-reliant, responsible and active participants in society. Young people who are disadvantaged are a particular priority, for example young homeless people, those who are at risk of substance misuse and young travellers and funding of the order of €39.6m supports a range of programmes and initiatives for these young people. Support is also provided to some 1,600 local volunteer led youth clubs with almost 90,000 members (€1m in 2012) and to 28 youth information centres which provide young people with easy access to information on rights, employment, education and training opportunities etc (€1.4m in 2012).Youth cafés have become increasingly prominent  as a total of €1.7m has been allocated to date by my Department to support the provision of youth cafés as a means to provide young people with opportunities in the community. My Department estimates that between 75-100 youth café facilities now operate across the State. These facilities are proving hugely beneficial to local communities in terms of broader engagement with young people. Capital funding of €2.25m has been provided to my Department for 2012 and 2013 for youth projects, including youth cafés.  I expect to announce plans for the distribution of this funding in the very near future.Dialogue and networking opportunities with young people and youth service providers is extremely important as it helps me and my Department provide relevant and responsive services and supports for young people.  A number of groups including the National Children's Advisory Committee, the National Youth Work Advisory Task Group and an International Expert Reference Group are assisting my Department in the development of youth policy and service for the future. My Department is currently developing a Children's and Young People's Policy Framework. Already some 67,000 young people have been consulted. A public consultation on this Framework is underway at present. The consultation is aimed at voluntary and community groups, national and local organisations, families and all those that work with children and young people.Furthermore, as part of the Structured Dialogue process with young people during Ireland's Presidency of the EU, I will host a three-day event in Dublin which will bring together young people and policy-makers across the EU to jointly discuss and feed into youth policy at national and European level. I am exploring ways to involve as many young people as possible from a range of backgrounds into this structured dialogue process at local, regional and national level so that their views may inform the development of youth policy objectives and services for the future.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	885	For Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) teams to work effectively, a range of disciplines, skills and perspectives are required so that children and adolescents are offered a care and treatment package appropriate to their individual needs. The Third Annual Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service Report 2010-2011 has highlighted gaps in the completion of CAMHS teams.  Therefore part of the special funding of €35m allocated to the HSE in 2012 will be used to complete the multidisciplinary profile of the existing CAMHS teams by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health profession (medical, nursing, clinical psychology, social work, occupational therapist, speech and language therapist, child care worker) is represented on every team.HSE approvals have already issued to the four Regional Directors of Operations to allow for the process of the filling of the posts in each region to commence.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	891	I have not held any discussions with the private health insurers in relation to the drug referred to by the Deputy. The main legislative provisions for the regulation of the Irish private health insurance market are included in the Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2011 and insurers are free to design their own health insurance schemes and to enter into agreements with health service providers under this governing legislation. It is not the role of the Minister for Health to become involved in the day to day operations of any private health insurance company.I am aware that the drug to which the Deputy refers (Ipilumumab) is a treatment for advanced melanoma in adults and is recognised internationally as a significant advance in the treatment of melanoma. In relation to treatment of patients in the public system, the HSE's National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) has overall responsibility for providing access to appropriate cancer treatments that meet clinical needs, including emerging drug treatments. The HSE/NCCP has recently announced that Ipilumumab will now be made available for use by eligible patients and I welcome this development.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	895	Section 11 of the General Medical Services (GMS) GP Capitation Contract, which was introduced in 1989, provides that the medical practitioner shall provide for eligible persons, on behalf of the Health Service Executive, all proper and necessary treatment of a kind usually undertaken by a general practitioner and not requiring special skill or experience of a degree or kind which general practitioners cannot reasonably be expected to possess.General Practitioners (GPs) who hold General Medical Services (GMS) contracts with the HSE must not seek or accept money from medical card or GP visit card holders for services covered under the GMS contract.  In circumstances where the taking of blood is necessary to either:(a)  assist in the process of diagnosing a patient; or(b)  monitor a diagnosed condition;the GP may not charge the patient if they are eligible for free GMS services.At my request, the HSE has written to all GMS GPs reminding them of their obligations under their contract in respect of services such as phlebotomy and advised them that charges should not be applied for such services.The HSE is encouraging eligible patients who believe they have been inappropriately charged by a GP for routine phlebotomy services to seek a refund from the GP in question.  Alternatively, they may wish to follow up with the HSE and the matter will be fully investigated.  Formal complaints will be dealt with through the HSE's Consumer Affairs Service.It is appreciated that because of the nature of the GP/patient relationship, it may be difficult for patients to make such complaints.  Where public representatives are made aware of GPs charging GMS patients in error, they may wish to notify the HSE directly.The Programme for Government provides for the introduction of a new GMS GP contract with an increased emphasis on the management of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular conditions.  It is envisaged that the new contract, when finalised, will focus on prevention and will include a requirement for GPs to provide care as part of integrated multidisciplinary Primary Care Teams.  Officials in my Department are in consultation with the HSE with a view to drawing up a new contract.  The appropriate arrangements in relation to phlebotomy services and other such services will be considered as part of the new contract.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	896	I propose to take Questions Nos. 466 and 468 together.Funding from the €35m special allocation for mental health will be used primarily to strengthen Community Mental Health Teams in both Adult and Children's mental health services which will ensure, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.It is planned that 414 staff will be recruited to the mental health service to deliver on the €35m package of special measures. In order to establish this staffing requirement, a detailed gap analysis of the present composition of 185 Community Mental Health Teams was undertaken.  The specific need in relation to each team in all of the four main regions was identified as quickly as possible after the Service Plan was decided.  HSE approvals have issued to the four Regional Directors of Operations for the filling of the posts in their areas.  The process of recruitment commences immediately on approval.Of the 414 posts involved , the HSE has had to convert 31 of these in the Dublin Mid Leinster region to nursing that will be assigned in the immediate term to acute in-patient services.  However, it is intended that this will be done in the context of introducing a nursing floor for the acute in-patient and community services in that region consistent with the provision of safe services in line with A Vision for Change as well as the Mental Health Commission Quality Framework for Mental Health Services and the roll out of the clinical care programmes.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	897	I propose to take Questions Nos. 467 and 469 together.The budget for the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) is set by the Health Service Executive.  In 2011, the total funding available nationally through the HSE for suicide prevention was about €9 million of which €4.1 million is administered by NOSP and is used to fund voluntary and statutory agencies delivering services in the areas of prevention, intervention, postvention and research.  The remaining €5 million is available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives.  In 2012, an additional €3 million (part of the special allocation of €35m for mental health) has been made available to NOSP to implement suicide prevention initiatives in line with Reach Out.Since the launch of Reach Out   and the establishment of the NOSP, there has been a significant amount of cross-sectoral working which has resulted in considerable advances in suicide prevention.  The NOSP has implemented many of the action areas engaging a strategic approach in four key areas — delivering a general population approach to mental health promotion and suicide prevention; using targeted programmes for people at high risk of suicide; delivering services to individuals who have engaged in deliberate self harm; providing support to families and communities bereaved by suicide; and commissioning research into suicidal behaviour.  Initiatives progressed to date include:ASIST and Safetalk suicide awareness training programmes.The tough economic times programme.Mental Health awareness campaigns.Supporting voluntary organisations in their work on suicide prevention.Developing all-island co-operation in the areas of promoting positive mental health and tackling the issue of suicide.Funding a number of Suicide Community Assessment Nurses (SCAN) to work within primary care to provide an effective and coordinated response for people   who are in distress.The establishment of a Working Group to address the issue of reducing access to the means of suicide and self-harm in a national and coordinated way.In addition, the National Office recently established a Working Group to review the current activities in this area and to determine the priorities within suicide prevention to ensure that we maximise the available resources.  A report on the NOSP's activities is published annually and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The report for 2011 is expected to be published in September.

I also considered the possibility of provision from within existing state resources.The absence of data for aeromedical support in the Irish context indicated the need for a pilot project, in order to assess the type and extent of service, if any, that might be required to support the National Ambulance Service (NAS) in the west.I am pleased to announce that, in co-operation with my colleague Alan Shatter, Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence, a pilot has now been put in place to gather this information and it will run for 12 months. The pilot service, based in Custume Barracks, Athlone, which began on 4th June, will allow the HSE to determine how best to provide support to the NAS emergency ambulance service in the region in the longer term and how we can, realistically, improve response and transit times, and improve outcomes, for seriously ill people.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	910	I propose to take Questions Nos. 482 and 483 together.There are always more infrastructure projects than can be funded from the Exchequer's health capital allocation.  The Health Service Executive's 2012 health capital allocation for health infrastructure at €334m represents 61% of its 2008 allocation.  All projects must be considered in the context of the HSE's overall capital programme which is a multi-annual programme developed over a rolling five year period.  The Executive is required to prioritise capital infrastructure projects within its overall capital allocation taking into account the existing capital commitments and costs to completion over the period.  Therefore it is essential to assess all projects other than those where there are existing capital commitments in place, on their merits, to ensure that the limited capital funding available goes to those developments which are of the highest national importance.  The proposed Capital Plan 2012-2016 requires my approval with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I am in the process of approving this plan and seeking consent.   Details of the plan will be published by the HSE following its approval.Delivery of health infrastructure in a service matter.  Therefore your question has been referred to the Executive for direct reply.

The HSE, through its Occupational Guidance Service, works with schools, service providers, service users and families to identify the needs of young people with disabilities who are due to complete their second level education.   The aim is to address the needs of individuals in the following ways:Health-funded rehabilitative training;Health-funded day services;FÁS-funded vocational training;Approval to extend education placement for a specified time.The demand for day services, including rehabilitative training, for school-leavers continues to grow. The HSE expects that approximately 650 school-leavers will require services in 2012. This year, disability services are required to cater for demographic pressures such as new services for school leavers from within their existing budgets. In previous years demographic funding was provided to meet this need. 2012 budgets have been reduced by 3.7% and the moratorium on staff recruitment gives rise to additional challenges in service provision.The HSE is currently working with all relevant service providers to maximize the use of the available places. Service providers and the HSE have come together under the auspices of National Consultative Forum to identify how the needs of individuals who require day and rehabilitative training places can be responded to within available resources.The National Consultative Forum recognises that the key to ensuring that available resources for people with disabilities are used to best effect is through constructive collaboration between non-statutory providers and the HSE.  There are already many excellent examples of collaborative working between providers and the HSE in innovatively responding to the needs of individuals.The HSE and disability service providers have agreed that notifications will be issued to families from 10th   July if a place is available or if the individual is to be placed on a waiting list.   The HSE and the disability service providers acknowledge that the waiting period is a difficult time for individuals and their families. Every effort is being made to achieve an equitable and sustainable outcome.

The available data relates to episodes of hospitalisation from these conditions and this information is presented in the table below.  The data are derived from the Hospital In-Patient Enquiry (HIPE) system which records details on each in-patient and daycase discharge from all publicly-funded acute hospitals.  It should be noted that if a patient is admitted more than once for a specific condition, each admission is counted separately in HIPE. For this reason, the figures should not be interpreted as prevalence estimates for these conditions.  The data for 2011 is provisional.Similar to all chronic disease management, the treatment of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis in children requires a combination of self-help, primary care and specialist care services.In relation to specialist services, the SDU are supporting hospitals in achieving a 9-month maximum waiting time for inpatient and daycase surgery.Crohn’s DiseaseUlcerative colitisYearAges 1-15 yearsAges 16-30 yearsAges 1-15 yearsAges 16-30 years199461387642551995533855028319965138851310199777392543531998474506233219995250148351200051543463532001776864643320029573051416200312980241455200488844404252005119964424092006130112838554200714014235863120081911407576632009163149274733201021217108582620112681737113921Source:  HIPE, Information Unit, DoH.Data refers to occurrences of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis with principal diagnosis codes of ICD9 555 and ICD9 556, for years 1994-2004.

As a result, it is essential that pharmacists undergo comprehensive education and training in order to provide the best patient care.The minimum requirements for the education and training of pharmacists are set out in an EU Directive on the recognition of Professional Qualifications which requires that the pharmacist qualification must consist of a five-year programme of education and training, with a minimum of four years of full-time university-level academic studies and a minimum of six months practical training in either a community or hospital pharmacy.Currently in Ireland, 3 schools of pharmacy at Trinity College Dublin, University College Cork and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) provide an accredited 4 year pharmacy degree programme. The fifth year of in-service training (the National Pharmacy Internship Programme) is currently delivered as a transitional measure on behalf of the Council of the PSI by the RCSI. Successful students are awarded a Masters degree   in Pharmacy and are entitled to apply for registration as a pharmacist.  In June 2010 the Council of the PSI decided to move to a 5 year fully integrated programme of  education and training in pharmacy. The fully integrated Masters degree will continue to include practical experience of working with patients, carers and other healthcare professionals but these practice experiences will be more clinically focused in order to meet the needs of patients and the health system. In addition, the integrated degree will also facilitate interprofessional education in order to promote collaborative working with GPs and other health professionals.Practical in-service training is a key aspect of pharmacy education and training. Training placements are provided to pharmacy graduates by pharmacists in community, hospital and industrial practice. I am advised by the PSI that it closely monitors the availability of training placements. There are currently 190 placement opportunities available annually to meet the needs of 170 students. However, the numbers of community and hospital placements have decreased in recent years due to the financial situation.The pharmacy educational reforms are expected to lead to more streamlined referrals to general practitioners, and ensure that these referrals are more clinically informed to improve patient care. These reforms will commence in 2013 and are intended to ensure that pharmacists can play a critical role in the delivery of future integrated health services in Ireland.

I welcome this development, and believe that it will help improve competition in the market.  The decision of Irish Life to invest in GloHealth is a commercial matter for the Board of Irish Life, in keeping with its remit as a commercial insurer. Both Glohealth and Irish Life are regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland.The European Court of Justice judgement to which the Deputy refers concerned  the VHI's derogation from the EU Non-Life Directives which had exempted it from the requirement to be authorised by the Central Bank.  The Court of Justice of the European Union ruled against the State on 29 September last.   The Government is committed to addressing the findings of the European Court of Justice by dealing with the VHI's regulatory status.  Irish officials have met with European Commission officials of both the Directorate General for Competition and the Directorate General for Internal Market and Services since the beginning of the year and will continue to engage with them on an ongoing basis.

The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.  As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012, the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.  As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and hospital involved.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	927	Shortages of essential medicines are currently a cause of concern not just in Ireland but throughout Europe and the rest of the world. It is a problem affecting health systems in all countries and impacting on patients world-wide. Medicines shortages can be the result of one, several or any combination of factors throughout the pharmaceutical supply chain such as manufacturing difficulties, industry consolidation, and commercial decisions by manufacturers to withdraw unprofitable lines.Irish Medicines Regulations place an obligation on both manufacturers and pharmaceutical wholesalers within the limits of their respective responsibilities, to ensure the adequate availability and supply of medicines on the Irish market in order to meet patient needs.  Eltroxin, which contains the active substance levothyroxine, is a long-established medicine that is used to control hypothyroidism, congenital hypothyroidism and juvenile myxoedema. It is marketed in tablets containing 25, 50 and 100mcgs and is the subject of a marketing authorisation in Ireland.Before anyone is allowed to market a medicine in Ireland they are required to apply for a marketing authorisation from either the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The IMB and EMA examine the safety, quality and efficacy of medicines. The Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) for Eltroxin is the Mercury Pharma Group of which Goldshield Pharmaceuticals is a part. The product is manufactured under contract in the United Kingdom.  The current shortage of Eltroxin emerged in February 2012 when the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency suspended the authorisation of an alternative levothyroxine 100mcg tablet product, which was not on the Irish market, with the effect that the overall supply of levothyroxine on the Irish and UK markets was reduced.The Health Service Executive (HSE) and the IMB have been managing the shortage of Eltroxin and issued a joint communication (26th April 2012) via the Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland (PSI) updating pharmacists on management of the shortage. The HSE put in place special arrangements to reimburse suitable UK licensed product stock and this was notified to community pharmacists on 1st   May 2012. The HSE and IMB continue to closely monitor this issue to ensure ongoing access to this important medicine. In addition, the PSI has recently published guidance to registered pharmacists on managing medicines shortages.The MAH for Eltroxin is continuing to liaise with the IMB and HSE on this matter and has confirmed to the HSE there are stocks of 50mcg and 100mcg in the country at the moment with further supplies of the 25mcg expected this week. To avoid stockpiling of this product in some locations and to ensure that all patients throughout the country have access to this medicine, the Mercury Pharma Group has had to apply a quota system to quantities supplied to pharmacies.   My Department has been engaging with the IMB,  the HSE and the PSI to identify ways in which the Irish system can manage medicines shortages as effectively as possible in order to minimise the impact on patients. International efforts to effectively manage medicines shortages are also being considered.

Under the Drug Payment Scheme, no individual or family pays more than €132 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.  In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.  Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultation.

The purpose of the review is to ensure that the Food Standards Agency in Northern Ireland, the Public Health Agency, the FSPB and DHSSPS work effectively, in complementary roles, and provide maximum value for money in respect of the provision of high quality scientific and policy advice relating to food safety, diet and nutrition. This  DHSSPS review is expected to be completed soon and it can be anticipated that its final recommendations will be made available within a matter of weeks.  This review  will not require any alteration or amendment to the statutory remit and scope of the FSPB.I recently met with the CEO of the FSPB and members of its Advisory Board. At that meeting I outlined that I had asked officials in my Department to also review the work of the FSPB  — a review which would finish after, and take into account the findings of, the DHSSPS review. Both reviews are exploring the scope for greater efficiencies, and the respective roles and responsibilities of organisations working in the food safety, diet, and nutrition areas North and South so as to avoid duplication and maximise value for money.  These reviews will help clarify the role to be undertaken by FSPB and will also inform consideration of their 2012 Business Plan. I have also emphasised the need for this review process to reflect FSPB's Island of Ireland remit. It has been agreed that approval of FSPB's Business Plan needs to await the outcome of these reviews.  The outcome of this process will be subject to agreement at Ministerial level and will thereafter be brought to the North-South Ministerial Council at the earliest opportunity.

This is being tackled through the clinical programmes and also through the re-organisation of our hospital system and the establishment of our hospitals into groups. The creation of hospital groups and trusts is at the heart of the Government's reforms of the acute hospital sector. In June the Minister announced the appointment of Professor John R. Higgins to work with the Special Delivery Unit (SDU) in the role of Chair of a Strategic Board to assist the Department of Health in the design and establishment of Hospital Groups.Both Beaumont and Connolly Hospitals have had an opportunity to meet with Professor Higgins and to make a contribution to the fact finding phase of the work of this Board.  In addition, both hospitals are working together on service developments including joint consultant posts and service re-alignments such as general urology moving from Beaumont Hospital into Connolly Hospital to facilitate an expansion of the National Kidney Transplant Programme and the continuing development of the National Cancer Programme at Beaumont Hospital.  The final decision about the arrangements for hospital groups will be a matter for Cabinet.

This draft report is the first stage of a two-stage process in relation to this research on the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland. This first stage is an independent academic research report, which is based on an analysis of published medical reports and research. The draft report contains information about how frequently symphysiotomy was carried out in Ireland and compares rates with other countries. The second stage in the research, which is now underway, is a consultation process on the draft report involving patient groups, health professionals and in particular the women who have undergone symphysiotomy.The final report, which will take full account of the consultation outcomes and include recommendations, will be presented to me for consideration of any actions that may be required to address the issues concerned.  The researcher expects to complete the final report in the Autumn. I then intend to publish the report after it is presented to me, subject to the usual legal considerations but I do not anticipate any significant difficulties in that regard.  I do not wish to express any views on the draft report which is going through its planned consultation phase to preserve the independence of the research process and to allow the women in particular to provide their views in the consultation concentrating solely on the research report and without being possibly deflected from that process by any statements from me.  I remain determined to bring this matter to a conclusion for all women concerned as soon as possible.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	942	Since concerns were first raised in March 2010 regarding the issue of breast implants, provided by the now defunct French company Poly Implant Prosthese (PIP), my Department's clear priority has been to try and ensure that the three treating clinics involved in the issue provide professional and appropriate care to their affected clients. However despite intensive efforts, by the office of the Chief Medical Officer, such appropriate care on the scale required has not been forthcoming.  Despite intense discussions one provider has failed to deliver an appropriate care package for its clients. Consequently it has been decided that the necessary care required by the affected recipients of these implants should be made available via an alternative route, i.e. the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF).  Accordingly the Department has now commenced work on sourcing an alternative service via the NTPF. This will encompass surgical consultation, radiology if required and removal of implants if this is deemed clinically necessary.  The Department intends to seek recovery of the costs incurred by the NTPF from the relevant service provider.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	943	In October 2011, the Minister for Health wrote to Fast Food chains operating in Ireland to request that they introduce calorie posting in their restaurants and received a very positive response. It is in this context that the Department of Health commissioned the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) to conduct a public consultation on the introduction of calorie posting on fast food outlet and restaurant menus.  The Minister launched the FSAI's public consultation process in February 2012, with a view to gathering information which would inform the next steps in the process.  The final outcome of that consultation process was launched by the Minister on 4th July 2012.The Calorie Posting initiative is only one among several that are being progressed by the Special Action Group on Obesity which the Minister set up in 2011.  This group comprises key stakeholders, and is chaired by the Department of Health.  The group includes representatives from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills, the Health Service Executive, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and Safe food   and its remit is to examine and progress a number of issues to address the complex and multi-factorial problem of obesity.The Special Action Group on Obesity is concentrating on a specific range of measures to combat the growing obesity problem, one of which is the Calorie Posting initiative.  The Group will work with other Government Departments in a cross-sectoral approach to help halt the rise in overweight and obesity.  It is recognised that alone no single initiative will reverse the trend, but a combination of measures should make a difference.  It is essential to recognise that a small but sustained positive change in the eating behaviour of a large number of individuals can have a major effect on the obesity crisis.The Minister has indicated that he is very much in favour that the programme of putting calories on menus in Ireland be introduced on a voluntary basis at first, because it is clear from the consultation results that the food industry will need significant technical support in order to implement it.  To this end, the Special Action Group on Obesity is actively working on the development of an action plan to facilitate the implementation.  There are a number of issues which SAGO now needs to address, for example, technical support for providing calorie content information for small restaurant/coffee shop owners; priority based implementation; how the scheme might work in restaurants whose menus change frequently etc.  It is envisaged that calorie posting commence in the coming months when these considerations are finalised and the necessary implementation mechanism has been devised.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	944	The Value for Money (VFM) and Policy Review of the Disability Services was initiated by the Department of Health in June 2009 and was conducted under the auspices of the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative 2009-2011. The purpose of the Review was to assess how well current services for people with disabilities met their objectives and support the future planning and development of services.  The period under review was 2005 to 2009.The Review was overseen by an independent chair, Mr. Laurence Crowley, and had two other independent members, as well as members drawn from the Disability Sector, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, and the HSE. It is expected that the report will be submitted to the Government for consideration in the near future and, if approved, will be published as soon as practicable thereafter. It would not be appropriate for me to speculate on any of the findings of the report in advance of its consideration by the Government.However, separate from the VFM Review, the Deputy may wish to note that the Disability Services Programme is primarily delivered through the provision of a wide range of services and supports, including residential, day, multi-disciplinary therapies, early intervention and early childhood services, respite, home support, assisted living services and other support services. These services and supports are provided to people with disabilities by the HSE and by voluntary service providers through approximately 24,000 staff across many different disciplines, grades and skills. Consequently approximately 85% of the disability budget is expended on staff pay and the balance on non-pay.

The object of the Council is to protect the public by promoting high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the  registrants of the following 12 health and social care professions designated under the Act: clinical biochemists, dietitians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists.  In time, only registrants will be entitled to use these titles.These 12 professions were designated in the Act which is being implemented on a phased basis, and currently 2 registration boards have been established.  These are the Social Workers Registration Board and the Radiographers Registration Board.  It is hoped that the remaining 10 registration boards and their registers will be established by end 2014.While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance, to 12 health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health to include,  if he considers it appropriate and in the public interest to do so, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, as appropriate. Section 4 of the Act  provides a definition of a health and social care profession and also sets out the factors governing the subsequent addition of any further professions into the regulatory system at a later date, including:(a) The extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge;(b) The extent to which the profession has established itself, including whether there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession's practitioners;(c) The existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed entry qualifications;(d) The profession's commitment to continuous professional development;(e) The degree of risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public from incompetent, unethical or impaired practice of the profession;(f) Any other factors that the Minister for Health considers relevant.The priority at present for my Department is to develop statutory registration for the 12 professions specified in the Act in the first instance. The extension under the Act of statutory registration arrangements for other health and social care professionals will not be considered until after the initial designated 12 professional grades have been fully dealt with.Government approval was given in July 2011 to the drafting of the Health and Social Care Professionals (Amendment) Bill  to:(i) remove difficulties in relation to the effective operation of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council, in particular to urgently provide for the Minister to continue to appoint professional representatives to the Council from the designated professions under the Act, whose term of office expired in March 2011, and(ii) implement Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications in respect of the professions designated under the 2005 Act and provide a legal base for the assessment of qualifications which are outside the scope of the Directive.Drafting is now at an advanced stage and as the proposed amendments are technical in nature and simply facilitate the more effective operation of the Act it is hoped that the Bill may be enacted at an early date. It is not my intention to revise the terms and provisions of the Bill at  this juncture to include the regulation of any  additional health and social care professions not designated under the Act.

The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health, which was established in 2004, monitors new and emerging issues on fluoride and its effects on health and related matters.The Expert Body confirms that, based on the review of all previous and current international and national scientific data, the balance of this scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be effective for protecting the oral health of all age groups.  The EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), published its ‘Opinion on critical review of any new evidence on the hazard profile, health effects, and human exposure to fluoride and the fluoridating agents of drinking water' in 2011.  The main conclusions of the SCHER report are that there are no known health implications from fluoridating water at levels used in the EU. There is also extensive evidence in Ireland from a series of national, regional and cross-border studies conducted between 1984 and 2006 that fluoridated drinking water substantially improves the dental health of children and adults.The Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960 provides that the HSE make arrangements for the fluoridation of public water supplies.  The HSE makes the necessary contractual arrangements in relation to these responsibilities. There are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	952	I met with the Irish Thalidomide Association (ITA) and the Irish Thalidomide Survivors Society (ITSS) last year.Having taken legal advice, I am satisfied that the State does not have a legal liability for the injuries suffered by Irish survivors of thalidomide.  However, I have previously indicated that I am willing to enter into discussions about a financial gesture of goodwill towards Irish survivors of thalidomide, which will be constrained by virtue of the current economic circumstances of the country and the many demands made on limited resources.  The Irish Thalidomide Association has stated that it fundamentally disagrees with the State's position above and it is unwilling to engage with me on this basis.  I also informed both organisations that the Government's main concern is to address their health and social care needs.  The first step in this process is to identify the needs of each individual. The Health Service Executive (HSE) and Dr Paul O'Connell, Consultant in Rheumatology and Rehabilitation, Beaumont Hospital have developed a protocol for an appropriate assessment process. The ITA is unwilling to engage in this process also.The protocol envisages that the multidisciplinary assessment process will include medical, nursing, occupation therapists, physiotherapists, social workers and/or other designated staff as appropriate. It is proposed that the assessment will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team in Beaumont Hospital. Phase II will be conducted by a multidisciplinary team in the community, preferably in the home. In addition, Beaumont will establish and maintain links with more established centres in Europe.  The draft Protocol for the Multidisciplinary Management Plan for the Care of Survivors of Thalidomide in Ireland was sent to the ITSS. The ITSS were asked to review the draft protocol and revert to the HSE with any observations.However, the ITSS has written to the HSE regarding the extent and scope of the assessment process. Some major issues raised by the ITSS, including an independent agency, housing, heating and transport are unfortunately outside my Department's remit.  I have written to the ITSS requesting them, in good faith, to continue to engage with the HSE in developing and participating in a health care assessment process. The process and its outcome will provide information which will assist us in addressing the future health care needs of Irish survivors of thalidomide.

As we saw earlier this year with the capsizing of the "M/V Costa Concordia" with the tragic loss of thirty lives this is a critical area in ensuring safety. In Ireland we have a number of categories of passenger tour boats.Passenger tour boats carrying more than 12 passengers are referred to as passenger ships and they can operate on the inland waterways and at sea. Passenger tour boats carrying not more than twelve passengers are referred to as passenger boats and there are several hundred such boats operating around our coastline and on our lakes and rivers.  Each passenger boat and ship is surveyed by Surveyors from by my Department.Passenger ships are subject to annual surveys and passenger boats are surveyed every two years.  These surveys cover all aspects of the vessel including hull structure, watertight integrity, machinery and electrical arrangements, crew qualification and operational matters such as musters and drills.  The Merchant Shipping Acts require any Irish ship greater than 80 gross tonnage to enter into an agreement with the crew and complete an official logbook. In addition, in accordance with EU Regulation 336/2006 on the implementation of the International Safety Management Code and its application  to passenger ships which operate to sea, the vessels must have a certified safety management system in place called Domestic Safety Management (DSM) and the vessels must hold a DSM logbook as well.

I have therefore referred these elements of the Deputy's question to the NTA for their direct reply. Please advise my office if you have not received a response within 10 working days.There are currently no funding streams within my Department from which funding support of the type envisaged for local authorities or public transport operators could be made available.  Grant assistance towards the purchase of vehicles using alternative energy technologies and matters relating to the natural gas grid and supply are matters for agencies and companies within the remit of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that he has been informed by Bord Gáis Networks (BGN) that they are actively working with Bus Éireann on a trial to be launched in Cork soon to use CNG within Bus Éireann's city fleet.

In the case of the EU Directives on fitness to drive — 112 and 113 of 2009 — Ireland chose to follow the Directives closely, while the UK chose to exercise its right to adopt more stringent measures.  I believe that this has led to a misunderstanding on the part of the Deputy.The Irish legislation states that applicants for a licence in Group 2 — categories C1, C, D1, D, EC1, EC, ED1 or ED — who have monocular vision, should have an adaptation period of at least six months before driving, and that afterwards driving is allowed only after a favourable opinion from vision experts.In the UK, people with loss of vision in one eye are, with one important exception, barred from holding a Group 2 licence.  The exception is the ‘grandfather rights' to which the Deputy refers and relates solely to licence applicants for category C1.  The UK allows people with monocular vision to apply for a C1 licence if they passed their driving test prior to 1 January 1997, but only if they satisfy eyesight tests for the remaining eye.In other words, the UK authorities chose to exercise their right to adopt a stricter approach than was required to comply with the EU Directives, and then gave one exception to those strictures.  As Ireland chose not to adopt such additional strictures, the question of ‘grandfather rights' as an exception to additional strictures did not arise.

In essence, the argument for allowing partial parking is that it would alleviate certain parking difficulties in the city, while the arguments against relate to safety.  I believe the arguments against a change substantially outweigh those in favour of change.Footpaths are provided for the safety of pedestrians and to segregate vulnerable road users from passing or parking traffic on the roadway.  Footpaths are not constructed to the same specifications as roads and are not built to bear the weight of vehicles.  Local authorities could face problems such as potential damage to kerbs, paths and utility access covers.  Finally, if pavement parking is allowed in some areas, it could become a matter of habit for many people and difficult to restrict to the areas where it is legally permitted.In the absence of any new evidence or arguments for allowing partial parking on pavements, I have no plans to change the law in this regard.

The possibility of relocating the containers to a location closer to the newly constructed all weather pitch to facilitate the storage of equipment in a more secure location is currently being examined by the local authority.I am also informed that it is a long term objective of the local authority to eliminate containers from Hartstown Park and, subject to the availability of funding, to seek to build a new facility which will incorporate changing and storage facilities at a site adjacent to the all weather facility and a local school. No application was received from the local authority under the 2012 Sports Capital programme for such a project.Should an application be made under the next round, I shall be happy to give it full consideration.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-07-10 00:00:00	Prelude	972	I established the National Integrated Rural Transport Committee (NIRTC) earlier this year to oversee and manage a partnership approach to implementing integrated local and rural transport. The Committee which is chaired by the National Transport Authority, is drawn from organisations representing key stakeholders in the local and rural transport integration process including rural transport groups, the HSE, Pobal, Local Authorities, Bus Éireann and policy makers from relevant Departments.The Committee has been meeting on a monthly basis since April to ensure momentum is maintained in addressing the many complexities associated with effective integration of local and rural transport service provision. The structure of RTP Groups, the nature of local and RTP operations and the extent of HSE and school transport services varies across different areas as does the amount of data available. Consequently, the NIRTC established sub-groups to examine the four key areas of health related transport services, school transport services, logistics e.g. trip-booking systems, ticketing, information, and appropriate structures to support integration. The sub-groups are involving other stakeholders in their work and seeking input from relevant sources as appropriate.The key area of work for the sub-groups is to identify constraints or high-level impediments to integrated local and rural transport, along with recommendations on how these should be managed.  The output from the sub-groups will also inform the design of  model areas to test  how integrated local and rural transport services can best operate to achieve greater synergies, better meet identified transport needs and deliver increased value for money for the Exchequer.The outcome of the model areas will inform the wider national roll out of integrated rural transport services on an incremental basis. The sub groups are expected to make an initial report to the NIRTC later this month who will then report to me.   In the light of the reports from the sub groups and NIRTC  I will be reviewing progress and deciding on the next steps.This new approach, bringing together all of the key stakeholders is endorsed by Government and is the first time that a national focus and coherence has been brought to the delivery of an integrated rural transport service. This reflects the importance that the Government attaches to the contribution that a carefully designed and efficient rural transport service based on local needs, will make to overcoming social exclusion in rural areas.
