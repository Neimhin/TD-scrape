        </question>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_9">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together. All relate to staff in my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">There are six members of staff in the communications unit, all of whom are civil servants. Five are on secondment from other Departments and one staff member is from my Department. A seventh member of staff transferred to the Department of Social and Family Affairs on 11 January 2002 and no replacement has yet been appointed. The total projected 2002 cost for the unit is €262,505. It should be noted that €102,209 of the total 2002 cost is a direct cost to my Department. The average cost to the other five Departments involved is €32,059.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">The unit provides a media information service to Ministers and their Departments. It furnishes news updates and transcripts which ensure that Departments are kept informed in a fast and efficient manner of relevant news developments. It is conservatively estimated that in a full year it saves Departments approximately €175,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The political advisers appointed to my Department since the recent general election remain broadly the same as before with some changes in personnel. Dr. Martin Mansergh and Mr. Peter MacDonagh have resigned. I have appointed Mr. Joe Lennon, former Government press secretary, as special adviser. He is replaced by Ms Mandy Johnston as Government press secretary. Mr. Iarla Mongey continues to be deputy Government press secretary and head of the GIS. In addition, Mr. Carl Gibney has been appointed as special adviser to the Government Chief Whip to replace Mr. Frank Lahiffe. A list of current special advisers will be circulated in the Official Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">There has been no increase in the number of special advisers who assist me in dealing with the complexities and volume of Government business. Under the current Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, there are a total of 33 politically appointed programme managers, special advisers and press secretaries who assist the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Ministers across all Departments. Of these, seven are civil servants. This compares with 31 under the last Government, seven of whom were civil servants, and 55 under the rainbow Government, of whom one was a civil servant. A list of all non-established and contract staff in my Department will also be circulated. In addition, a number of staff employed have been employed on an unestablished basis in the grades of administrative officer and cleaner.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">Following the incident to which Deputy Quinn refers, an official in my Department was suspended from his duties pending an investigation under the Civil Service disciplinary code. The Deputy will appreciate that pending the outcome of the investigation it would be inappropriate to comment further.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">There are five vacancies at present in my Department. These are at administrative officer, staff officer and clerical officer level. Recruitment to fill these vacancies is in line with normal Civil Service procedures. Staff are assigned by the Civil Service Commission.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_60">I thank the Taoiseach for his comprehensive reply in respect of the communications unit. As regards the incident that occurred following the publication of the interim report of the Flood tribunal, is it usual for personnel from the Department of the Taoiseach to ring radio shows? In the context of the investigation being carried out, has the Taoiseach determined who ordered that phone call to be made?</p>
          <p eId="para_61">Will the Taoiseach confirm whether the information collected by the communications unit for the use of Ministers and their Departments is made available to the Fianna Fáil Party, as distinct from Departments?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_62">As regards the Deputy's first question, it was totally improper for the individual to do what he did. It was totally against the rules and ran counter to the impartiality of the Civil Service. To the best of my knowledge, the individual acted on his own behalf and has stated so. He has been contacted in writing and, in accordance with the Civil Service regulations, he has a period in which to furnish a reply before the disciplinary hearing. However, it is totally improper and incorrect for a person to act in that way. Needless to say, it was not done with my approval or the approval of anyone within the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">As regards the second matter raised by the Deputy, the communications unit is totally separate from the Government Information Service's press unit, and the information it garners is only for Ministers and Departments. It is staffed only by civil servants and has no relationship with Fianna Fáil; such a relationship would be totally improper.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">During the general election the communications unit continued to do its work, sending information to Ministers and to Departments. Needless to say, it played no role – nor was it used – as a communications unit by the government parties during the election campaign. During the general election the government parties had their own communications units. The communications unit monitors the main news bulletins on RTE Radio 1, Lite FM, FM 104, 98FM, Today FM, Newstalk 106 and INN/County Sound. It produces a fairly short, one or two-line synopsis of all the issues on the news programmes, which goes to Departments. The communications unit provides transcripts, tapes or other information as required by Departments, rather than obtaining them from outside agencies as happened prior to this. The unit's role is to take such information straight from radio news programmes, listing the main items.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The information supplied by the unit has been sought under the Freedom of Information Act on numerous occasions, and formed the basis of a detailed reply to a parliamentary question quite recently. Therefore, the information produced by the communications unit is in the public domain.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin:</from>
          <p eId="para_69">Since it is so impartial, could the work of the information unit be shared among all political parties? Would the Taoiseach be willing to have that inane information circulated to all political parties so we can all be informed of the topics of concern on each of the radio stations?</p>
          <p eId="para_70">Arising out of the Taoiseach's response to Question No. 8, are there broader inquiries going on within the GIS to ascertain if there were other instances where established civil servants made partisan telephone calls to radio stations on behalf of the Government parties or whether the individual concerned had made previous such telephone calls? When did the head of the GIS become aware of this telephone call, and how and when did the Taoiseach become aware of it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_9">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_71">To take the second question first, when the personnel section of the Department was made aware of it, it immediately suspended the official and informed the head of the GIS and me. I was down the country at the time and they informed me immediately. On their authority, the head of personnel suspended the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">There is no wider investigation or examination, although there is an examination, as part of the disciplinary code, to see if this individual was involved in a similar practice on any other occasion. That is part of the disciplinary matter and, of course, all that will have to be taken into account, under the Civil Service written procedures, in determining what action is taken against the individual involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">To answer the first question, it is a service. Previously the Government of the day used the services of outside contractors to provide scripts or recordings of programmes. It was a service for which they were paid and there were a number of people in that business.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">The communications unit replaces that service. The information goes to a few hundred people in Departments within the Government system. By and large, these are officials other than the members of the Government. Therefore, it is a service to the Government and to Departments. It is not a service to the political system. Individual press offices undertake that particular service for political parties. On that basis it would not be proper for the communications unit to supply that information to the entire political system.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">If anyone looked at the documentation, he or she would see that it does no more than provide a service to Departments. It is done without spin, providing nothing other than factual information on what is on the news every day.</p>

It had nothing to do with the Nice referendum, but perhaps these statements should also be monitored by the communications unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">One of the Taoiseach's key advisers, a man who has given considerable and detailed expertise to the country in terms of our dealings with Northern Ireland, was elected to the Seanad.

          <p eId="para_91">The Government appointed Ms Mary Hanafin as Minister of State at my Department and Government Chief Whip. Mr. Dick Roche was appointed Minister of State at my Department and at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">As Chief Whip, Deputy Hanafin is primarily responsible for the organisation of Government business in the Dáil and for the Government's programme for Dáil reform. She also oversees preparation of the Government's legislative programme and has responsibility for the Central Statistics Office. I have also assigned her special responsibility for information society development. A large number of Ministers and Departments have responsibility for advancing various aspects of the information society agenda and Deputy Hanafin will monitor progress, with particular regard to advancing strategic priorities. Co-ordination will be facilitated through the Cabinet committee on the information society, on which the Minister of State will have a lead functional responsibility, supported by the policy unit in the Department of the Taoiseach which supports her work.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">Deputy Roche will play a key co-ordinating role in the ratification of the Treaty of Nice. He will also play a pivotal role in advancing preparations for Ireland's Presidency of the European Union in 2004. In addition to these duties, Deputy Roche will have a heavy workload within the Department of Foreign Affairs, representing the Government at meetings in a wide range of contexts related to European affairs matters and representing Ireland at EU meetings at Minister of State level on European Union affairs.</p>

          <p eId="para_94">It appears that Ireland is slipping further down the international league in the area of e-commerce broadband access. What is the role of the Minister of State in this regard and what resources has she at her disposal to reverse this trend, which is critical for the development of the country in the years ahead?</p>
          <p eId="para_95">Is the Taoiseach happy with the system through which advisory roles are adopted, consultants appointed and contracts awarded for broadband cable laying? It appears that a number of previously defunct companies have reappeared under new names and have acquired contracts. Is the Taoiseach happy that all is well in this area?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_24">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_96">I will not answer detailed questions. In some cases these are a matter for the Minister of State and in others for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources Deputy Dermot Ahern. May I clarify the specific responsibilities of the Minister and Minister of State regarding the two issues raised by Deputy Kenny? Questions relating to a specific area of implementation are a matter for the Minister or Minister of State with responsibility for that area. The question asked by Deputy Kenny is in the area of telecommunications infrastructure. This is the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who is fully responsible for the roll-out of the broadband contracts and the various initiatives that are proceeding. I am sure he is anxious to report to the Deputy on what has happened, the contracts that have been published and who is involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">The other issue relates to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin. Because there are a number of Ministers involved in the area of communications infrastructure, there is a requirement that this involvement is co-ordinated. The Cabinet committee on the information society includes all the relevant Ministers, and the e-strategy group at secretary general level is also co-ordinated from my Department. The information society implementation group of assistant secretaries is also co-ordinated.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">There are a number of groups pulling the information society together across a great range of Departments and agencies. It is best that somebody at the centre is co-ordinating the activity. That person is not involved in day-to-day matters or in actually doing these things, but is co-ordinating and ensuring that the information society, e-government policy, e-business and all the other initiatives that have been launched in recent years, and the initiatives presented by the Information Society Commission, are dealt with. That is the role of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_99">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Given that the mechanics of the Dáil have changed in terms of new representation and numbers, and given the extra responsibility placed upon the Minister of State as a consequence, does the Taoiseach envisage a readjustment of responsibilities, subsequent to the Nice treaty being, I hope, passed, whereby a dedicated Minister of State could concentrate fully on this most important area for the development of the country? The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin, must attempt to run the business of the Dáil in the changed circumstances that apply here while also shouldering the critical responsibility of the implementation of e-commerce broadband access. Has she the resources to see that is implemented on time and to our advantage? I am trying to help the Minister of State.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_26">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_100">I do not envisage that being a difficulty. There was previously a void in the system in that no Minister had specific responsibility for co-ordination. There is now a Cabinet committee on the information society and the lead role in that will be taken by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Hanafin. However, the groups and people driving this – whether the Information Society Commission, the e-strategy group of secretaries general or the implementation group of assistant secretaries – co-ordinate their activities within their Departments. A number of Ministers are directly involved and, increasingly, they and their officials, as the Deputy correctly said, put considerable time into this. In my Department and in others, the e-government initiative is taking up a considerable amount of the time of senior officials. The Minister of State's role is to co-ordinate those committees, to keep abreast of their activities and to give a ministerial leadership role. I have no doubt the Minister will be able to do that.</p>

It is important that a Minister of State be assigned to oversee an important initiative like the information society. Officials from outside the Department of the Taoiseach meet in my Department to discuss the information society, so it makes sense that the co-ordinating Minister should be assigned to my Department.

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_60">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_136">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a statement to the House on An Agreed Programme for Government between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Our programme for Government is both clear in intent and specific in detail. It is the agreed agenda for this partnership Government over five full years.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">Since 1997 Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in government have worked extremely well and productively together in providing good government for the country, but now for the future much more remains to be done. A five year programme for Government is by necessity an ordered series of priorities and An Agreed Programme for Government 2002-2007 sets out further objectives to build on the success we have achieved as well as the important issues remaining.</p>
          <p eId="para_139">In implementing the commitments in An Agreed Programme for Government we will bring forward and progress the most ambitious legislative programme in the history of the State. Given the large number of specific commitments set out in the agreed programme, it would be impossible in the time allotted to detail each of the important elements of the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_140">The cornerstones of the agreed programme are based on our desire to build a better Ireland for everyone and our promises at the last general election to protect and expand prosperity for all; strengthen peace and reconciliation; guarantee improved pensions; reform and develop our health services, and invest in better public services. The programme sets out an agenda for all major aspects of Government activity and is divided into five major parts.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">Part One contains sections on peace, defence and international affairs. As I said in the Dáil on the day I was re-elected Taoiseach, building a lasting and just peace on this island is the Government's great political goal, the priority that I have and will continue to put above all else. The agreed programme also repeats the clear commitment of both parties in their election manifestos to hold a new referendum on European enlargement. This campaign is taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">Part Two deals with a range of economic issues. It reflects the great task of not only extending prosperity in time but also expanding it in scope to reach all our people. All promises in the Government's action programme are predicated on the need to keep the public finances on an even keel. The economic section in the Government's action programme states:</p>
          <p eId="para_143">The EU Stability and Growth Pact provides the overriding framework for our budgetary policy. Under the pact Ireland has given a sovereign commitment to keep the finances of general government close to balance or in surplus and to take corrective action when there is an actual or expected divergence from this objective. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will respect this commitment.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">Over the past five years in government we have been true to our word and worked towards this objective. We will be in a strong position to accelerate rapidly when the international economic outlook improves because of the prudent approach of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in government over the past five years. Since mid-year it has become apparent that there are strong pressures on expenditure in certain areas, particularly on demand-led schemes in the health sector and capital expenditure on roads. Contrary to the allegations that the Government has been rowing back on the commitments made before the general election and in An Agreed Programme for Government, extra funding is being provided for these priority areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">In the health area, for example, we recognised the need to respond to pressures on demand-led spending. Government has agreed a projected outturn for the Department of Health well ahead of the original allocation for 2002. Similarly, we have provided additional money for the roads programme. In order to live within the expenditure levels set out in the approved Estimates it has been necessary to review our priorities and reallocate resources within the total expenditure level.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Part Three deals with the broad heading of ensuring balanced regional development. In particular, the national spatial strategy will be published and the Government work to make sure all parts of Ireland see real progress will be a central priority for the new Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">Part Four deals with a strategy to build a caring society, and in particular a commitment, as resources permit, to reach a minimum €200 per week for pensioners and €150 for all social welfare payments and the implementation of the health strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Part Five is called, Supporting Civic Life, and deals with good government, sport, culture and the Irish language and includes, in particular, the Government's wish to negotiate a renewed partnership agreement. I have outlined publicly my views on the importance of this challenge.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_61">
          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_149">Given that the Taoiseach and the Progressive Democrats have been true to their word, how does the Taoiseach relate this to the extent of the truth of the mismanagement of the public finances? Given that the programme for Government does not contain costings or timetables, and that the Taoiseach and his partners in Government are true to their word, does the Taoiseach now propose to introduce a revised programme for Government with realistic timetables and costings? The current programme is merely a list of aspirations.</p>
          <p eId="para_150">If, arising from the programme for Government, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are committed to sustaining economic growth and see investment policies as central to this, how does that tally with the reality of €900 million in adjustments or cutbacks?</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_152">How is that compatible with the highest inflation rate in the European Union and a national development programme that has ground to a halt?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_64">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_153">The Government action programme is predicated on the need to keep public finances on an even keel. The economic section in the Government's action programme states that. All our policies must be governed under the EU Stability and Growth Pact that provides the overriding framework for budgetary policy. Under that pact, Ireland has a commitment to keep the finances of general Government close to balance or in surplus and to take corrective action when otherwise occurs. Preparations for the Book of Estimates for next year are predicated on that basis. As I said in reply to Deputy Howlin last week, all of the commitments set out for 2002 in the budget and the Revised Estimates of February 2002 will be honoured. The expenditure commitments outlined, which the Minister for Finance increased by 14%, will be honoured in full. There will be adjustments in some areas to deal with additional amounts on top of that 14%. The Minister has not managed to control the commitments at 14% yet, but we will see the final figure at the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">It is not a question of resources being cut in any of these areas, resources are extensively over the provisions. The House does not need me to quote the figures again but across health, education and infrastructure, more money is being spent than was in the Book of Estimates. Social welfare spending is up by €1 billion, or 25%. It is incorrect, therefore, to say there have been cutbacks. Even though there were enormous increases in the last year, because these are demand-led schemes, they still must be paid for and the Minister must provide resources in addition to those large increases. That is why there must be some reductions and the Minister will continue to seek them. The real difficulty with this year's public finances is that income, particularly corporation tax, is far lower than was expected.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin:</from>
          <p eId="para_155">Does the Taoiseach accept that one of the key areas in the agreed programme for Government for which his Department is responsible is working towards a new social partnership agreement? Does the Taoiseach accept that that objective is at odds with the statement made by the Minister for Finance at the weekend when he implied that workers got too much money from the last agreement and that was one of its liabilities? What is the Taoiseach's attitude to yesterday's IBEC statement indicating that it would seek wage increases in the new agreement below the rate of inflation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_66">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_156">We are just about to issue invitations to commence discussions. As happened in the five previous rounds, all of the social partners will set out their negotiating positions and, as always, those positions will not be compatible. Over the five agreements, we have sometimes had increases which were below inflation and were very good at reinvigorating the economy while at other times we have had increases that became a floor for discussions with people moving toward ceilings which created great difficulty. All of those things happened over the past 15 years and it is clear to anyone looking at the economy that we must be careful in the negotiation of this agreement. We must stay competitive and squeeze the inflationary pressures that are still there because in everyone's analysis we are very near to full capacity and there have been price increases in service areas, which has created difficulties. The main thing is to stay competitive to maintain existing jobs. While world economic conditions remain as they are, we must keep our export markets open and strong to be ready to pick up as soon as we get through the global downturn. That has to be the broad basis.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin:</from>
          <p eId="para_157">The attitude of the Minister for Finance to a new partnership agreement is one of hostility. Does the Taoiseach want to state that it is not the Government's position? Has he discussed the matter with the Minister and what, specifically, is his understanding of the Minister's attitude to a new social understanding?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_68">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_158">The Minister for Finance has set out his support for social partnership agreements many times. A Minister for Finance also has to set out the economic reality that obtains and in this case the income base he believed he would have at the end of the second quarter he does not have at the end of the third quarter, not to mind what he had on budget day. Corporation tax is down to 28%.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_160">It is corporation tax, not workers. We have to enter these discussions as best we can, and as always, try to see how much of the agenda of the social partners we can fulfil. It has to be done based on current economic realities. The last time around the same Minister for Finance was in a more lucrative position and could offer not only favourable percentages, but percentages which were used as a basis for discussion to achieve higher rates. That has created many difficulties.</p>

Is the Monaghan approach a template for this Government in terms of the undermining and diminution of acute hospital services at other sites throughout the jurisdiction?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_84">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_178">The health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services up to 2011. As part of the preparatory work for the strategy, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners, conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of the subsequent report entitled, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity – A National Review, the Government decided in the context of the strategy to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">In tandem with the publication of the report, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals at a cost of €65 million. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 258 of these beds have been commissioned under this initiative to date. The latest advice to my Department from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards indicates in excess of 600 beds will be in place by year end and that the remainder will be commissioned early in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">The average number of public beds available in July 2001 was 10,339. The equivalent figure for July 2002 was 10,574. It is a feature of all acute hospital systems that the number of beds in use in a hospital at any time will fluctuate depending on a number of factors. Examples of such factors include temporary ward closures due to essential maintenance and the periodic provision of additional temporary beds.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_85">
          <from>Ms O. Mitchell:</from>
          <p eId="para_181">It is now clear that the 709 beds cannot be delivered despite the €65 million provided for them. Can the Minister justify spending €65 million, in theory to commission new beds, when 343 beds were closed during the first three months of this year? This equates to the loss of 16,000 bed days. Does it make economic sense that such sums of money should be spent while beds are lying idle?</p>
          <p eId="para_182">The Minister stated that the number of beds fluctuates. Everybody understands the need for refurbishment and maintenance. Is he aware, however, that 30% of all bed closures are due to staff shortages and that the equivalent figure for Dublin, where most acute beds are located, is 60%? What measures are planned to retain nurses in the system given that 70% of each cohort of nurses will have left the nursing profession within 18 months of finishing training? This is an enormous attrition rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">While I welcome the contribution made by Filipino nurses – it has been widely praised – is it wise to depend so heavily on nurses who may leave the system at any time? In the Mater Hospital, for instance, up to 25% of nurses are foreign nationals working on two year contracts who can leave the country at any time.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">In the context of the upcoming budget, how will the Minister justify to the Minister for Finance the continued investment in health when it is clear that much of the money going into the health service has been misspent and spent to ill effect to the extent that everybody in the health sector is dissatisfied? There has been a total failure to tackle the underlying structural problems which are causing the waiting lists and dissatisfaction with the service.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_86" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children">
          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_185">It was always understood in terms of commissioning additional beds this year that the bulk of them would come into commission at the latter end of the year because of the obvious logistics involved in putting them into operation, recruiting staff and other such factors. It is on target. I met the boards, including all the chief executive officers, in September. They informed me and my officials that they expect the figure of 600 additional beds will be exceeded and that some of them will enter commission in January and February 2003. This is the first time we have had such a concentrated, deliberate expansion of beds in our acute hospital capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">There will always be bed and ward closures due to refurbishment and maintenance. It is an ongoing feature of the hospital sector. Sometimes these figures are opportunistically used to try to create an impression of beds being closed everywhere, which is not the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">With regard to nursing, the retention of nurses and turnover have improved significantly as the regular and annual surveys carried out by the Health Service Employers' Agency are beginning to indicate. While there is still a problem in the Dublin area where we are short about 1,000 nurses, the gap is being closed by agency nurses and overtime. I do not hear hospital directors around the country make the same cries about shortages that they made when I took up this position two and a half years ago. We had to go abroad to recruit nurses. They are making a very important contribution to our health service, which should be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">It has been acknowledged on all sides of the House, including by members of the main Opposition party, that in the late 1980s and early 1990s many interested parties called for the number of places in nursing training colleges to be reduced. This led to the kind of shortages we have experienced in recent years. However, since 1998 alone we have recruited some 5,500 nurses to work in both expanded and existing parts of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">To turn to the Deputy's core point on dependency, we also have a record number of training places. While we cannot tackle issues from the past, such as the then absence of manpower planning, we are providing a record number of training places – 1,640 – this year.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_87">
          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_191">Domiciliary care allowance was introduced in 1973 by way of circular 24/73 and is payable under section 61 of the Health Act, 1970. Following a request by my Department, a national health board working group was established towards the end of 1999. One of the main objectives of this group was to examine all the various disability related allowances which come under the remit of my Department, including the domiciliary care allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">During the course of discussions of the national health board working group, the health boards informed my Department that until July 2002 DCA operated on the basis that it was paid to applicants from the date of diagnosis or when care and attention in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age commenced. This was despite the fact that circulars governing the scheme stated that the allowance could be paid in respect of eligible children from the date of application.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The group made recommendations to my Department in May this year with a view to standardising the procedure for the allowances across all the health boards. My Department decided to issue the group's recommendations by way of circulars as departmental policy with effect from 1 July 2002. The DCA circular states that the allowance:</p>
          <p eId="para_194">may be paid in respect of eligible children from birth to the age of 16, who have a severe disability requiring continual or continuous care and attention which is substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age. The condition must be likely to last for at least one year. Where medical confirmation is supplied which predates the actual date of application and the Health Board's Senior Area Medical Officer is satisfied that the child required continual or continuous care and attention, substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age, then payment may be made from the date that the Senior Area Medical Officer is satisfied that such additional care and attention was required.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">This circular gave effect to what the health boards had informed my Department was already the practice and was issued on the basis of written assurances received from the working group, which included all the health boards, that the cost of implementing the revised circulars on a variety of allowances, including domiciliary care allowance, would be budget neutral. However, subsequent to the circular of 1 July being issued, the Southern Health Board advised my Department that any backdating of DCA, as indicated in the circular of 1 July, would have a cost implication for that board.</p>

          <p eId="para_200">In light of this, my Department, while committing to examine the issue further, rescinded the circular of 1 July, replacing it on 26 July with the following wording: "Where a child qualifies for DCA, payment should be made from date of application." When I became aware of the circular of 26 July 2002 I instructed my Department to revert to the position of 1 July 2002 which, as I have already stated, permitted the allowance to be backdated "to a date when the Senior Area Medical Officer is satisfied that the child required continual or continuous care and attention, substantially in excess of that normally required by a child of the same age."</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Prior to 1 July 2002 it had been health board policy, supported by my Department, that payments of DCA could be backdated prior to date of application if it was clear that the applicant was not aware of his or her entitlement. In these cases payment of the allowance was backdated to the date where the child would have become eligible.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The assessment of entitlement to and payment of the domiciliary care allowance in an individual case is a matter for the relevant health board. It is a matter for the senior area medical officer in the relevant community care area to decide whether a child qualifies for DCA on medical grounds.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</from>
          <p eId="para_203">I thank the Minister and the Ceann Comhairle. The Minister will recall that there was widespread concern during the summer recess among parents of children with disabilities at reports that the Department had sent a circular – obviously the circular of 26 July to which my question refers – the effect of which would be that families would lose out financially. The Minister went some distance in explaining how this came about and pointed out that a decision has been taken to redress the matter. Is the current position that the health boards retain a discretion <i>vis-à-vis</i> the retrospection of payment to the appropriate date, namely, the date of first assessment or of the determination of the child's disability? Is it the case that there are different interpretations or applications of the circular between different health boards within the jurisdiction?</p>
          <p eId="para_204">Will the Minister also assure the House that services and welfare support for people with disabilities will not only be maintained, but improved this year and these most vulnerable people in our society will not be the subject of the axe wielded by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy?</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_205">The policy position is contained in the circular issued on 1 July on the DCA, which states that the allowance may be paid in respect of eligible children. That is covered in the reply. That circular informs the policy to be adopted by the health boards. All this arose from an attempt to streamline and standardise the administration of the scheme emanating from the health boards through the national health board working group which was concerned that there may have been different applications of the scheme in health board areas in the past. The majority of health boards indicated through that working group that they had always operated on the basis of going back to diagnosis. It was in that context that the position was formalised in the circular of 1 July and that remains the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">In terms of disability generally, we have substantially increased funding during the past four or five years on disability issues, both intellectual disability and physical and sensory disability. These are issues that will continue to receive priority attention.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_95">
          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_208">The Deputy may wish to note that since 1997 there has been an increase of almost 27,000 in the approved employment ceiling for the public health services in whole-time equivalent terms, bringing the approved ceiling to 92,500.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The volume of direct employment in the system has increased beyond this level for a variety of reasons. These include: demographic pressures and record levels of funded activity; the need to provide for additional replacement staff due to changing work practices; changes in the composition and structure of employment growth, reflecting, for example, improved skills mix; and reductions in vacancy levels resulting, for example, in reduced dependence on agency staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">This year alone 6,000 new posts were approved. Against this background, the Government decided that an indicative number of 800 posts should not be filled as a corrective measure. This represents less than 1% of the total numbers employed.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">In mid-July last my Department advised each health board of a range of measures to be taken to ensure that health expenditure in 2002 remained consistent with the approved levels for the year. In this context, each health board was requested to achieve savings through an adjustment in planned employment growth. All health boards were informed by my Department at that time that the adjustment in employment growth was to be undertaken in such a way as to have minimal impact on services. On 17 July the chairman of the Chief Executive Officer Group of the health boards wrote to a senior official in my Department regarding the planned employment adjustment, highlighting the potential impact on services from a concentration of the measure on the management-administrative grade category. The letter also drew attention to the need to review the management-administrative classification since the current grade category encompasses a very broad range of personnel, many of whom are engaged in direct patient services. I am happy to provide the Deputy with a copy of this letter.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">Following further consultations with the health boards my Department again wrote to the chief executive officers in early August agreeing that the measures to be taken would be applied across the entire employment profile for 2002 and the scope for non-filling appropriate posts across all grade categories would be considered. This letter emphasised that the adjustment in the numbers of posts previously notified to the boards was indicative only and reiterated that front-line services were not to be affected by the adjustment. This decision was taken in view of the breadth of functions, including many clinical support and service provision roles, embraced by the management-administration category.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Since responsibility for the precise measures to be taken to yield the planned result in service and cost terms rests with each health board, my Department has worked closely with the chief executive officers of the health boards to establish clearly the parameters of the required employment adjustment. This is also against the backdrop of very rapid growth in employment levels in recent years and the need, in any event, to manage employment levels within the approved employment ceiling for each health board.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">My Department is in ongoing discussions with the chief executive officers about the measures required to ensure more accurate and timely monitoring of employment trends and to ensure measures to be put into effect in 2002 serve the twin objectives of minimal adverse effect on service levels and effective management of overall resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_216">Will the Minister accept there is a clear conflict between the spin he put on these job losses and his statement that there will not be an impact on patient care and the clear warning given by chief executive officers that "administrative-managerial posts cannot be reduced by the numbers required without impacting significantly on service levels, service quality and service developments."?</p>

          <p eId="para_218">They also stated in the letter that this will cause considerable industrial unrest and will impact on morale and service delivery. Surely the people working at the coalface who are trying to keep the health service going advised the Minister in clear and certain terms that what he was doing would impact on service delivery. Despite the spin he made in relation to increased funding for health services – nobody is arguing the figures – will he accept that health boards are severely over budget, hospitals cannot cope because of the increased demands for many services and they cannot keep within the budget requirements set by the Minister without that having a direct impact on patient care? Will he come clean about the impact of the statements he made and the decisions made by the Government as soon as the election was out of the way? During the election the Minister stated on RTE that there would be no cutbacks. Despite the extra money invested in the health services, will the Minister accept they have been subject to cutback after cutback in terms of the care provided and the job cuts outlined in terms of the 800 posts he named?</p>

          <p eId="para_221">I expected a reply of that type from the chief executive officers. To be fair to the health boards, the chief executive officers would respond in such a manner. When I examined the Department's census in terms of employment levels in 2001, a matter on which we worked with the health boards, we discovered that from July the health boards were in excess of their approved ceiling. The matter of the famous 800 posts arises against a different backdrop. Originally the backdrop was that 6,000 jobs were to be created in 2002 because of the estimate that had been allocated, but at the end of 2001 health boards were considerably in excess of their employment ceiling levels. It is difficult to accept that the measures we announced could have the type of effect on front-line services articulated in that letter.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Subsequently two boards did not lay off staff. They were able to effect the savings under subheads other than the employment subhead, and that gives the lie to that letter. Some chief executive officers took different routes to resolve the issue and come up with the indicative savings which did not affect their employment profile.</p>

          <p eId="para_223">Some 85 posts in the Western Health Board area were not filled as a consequence of the Minister's decision and another approximately 80 jobs were lost. Either those jobs are necessary for service delivery in the health boards or they are not. If they are necessary, how can the Minister justify those cuts and if they are not, what were the health boards or the Department doing in permitting this to happen?</p>

      <b>Mr. Neville</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
      how many of the 31 recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children report on the orthodontic service in Ireland which have been implemented; the recommendations implemented; his views on whether the lack of co-operation of all regional consultants has had serious effects on the delivery of the orthodontic service; and if he will make a statement on the allegation by a senior consultant orthodontist that it is the intention of his Department to prevent him and his colleagues delivering orthodontic services (details of letter supplied).
      [18162/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_226">The delivery of orthodontic services is a matter for the chief executive officers of the health boards in the first instance. I understand that the chief executive officers have established a review group on the public orthodontic service which is considering the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Health and Children in the context of the historical development of the service and the national health strategy. I understand the review group is made up of senior administrative and clinical personnel within the health boards, including the senior consultant orthodontist to which the Deputy refers. The work of this group will inform the development of an orthodontic action plan, which was one of the recommendations of the joint committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">My Department is continuing to support the development of the public orthodontic services. In line with at least five of the recommendations of the joint committee, my Department expects to fund 11 dentists this year for internationally recognised specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and the UK. These 11 trainees are in addition to the six dentists who commenced their training last year at the Dublin Dental School and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion in Northern Ireland. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for internationally recognised specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">These training programmes are made possible by co-operation between the health boards, the majority of consultant orthodontists and the dental teaching institutions. Recently, two dentists that had been sponsored for such specialist training have qualified and taken up duty in the Western Health Board. My Department has also funded the recruitment of a professor in orthodontics at Cork University Dental School to facilitate the development of an approved training programme leading to specialist qualifications in orthodontics. The chief executive officer of the board has informed me that Cork University Dental School is in discussion with an interested candidate for the post, 18 months on from the post being sanctioned. Capital funding of approximately €1.269 million was provided to the orthodontics unit there for its refurbishment to an appropriate standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Other recommendations of the joint Oireachtas committee are also being acted upon. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The number of specialists in orthodontics posts for the health boards is being finalised, using the estimated number of children eligible for orthodontic treatment under the 1985 guidelines; these national manpower requirements will feed into an orthodontic action plan. Health boards are initiating reviews of their assessment waiting lists as recommended. The committee also stated that it would support a public-private mix of staff and facilities that would lead to a continuous reduction in the number awaiting treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_231"><i>Additional information.</i>The committee referred to the need to employ orthodontic auxiliaries in the public orthodontic service in order to increase caseloads. A scheme for the creation of this grade – to be known as orthodontic therapist – is being finalised by the Dental Council in conjunction with officials from my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">The number of patients in orthodontic treatment has begun to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services begin to take effect. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the quarter ending June 2002 there were 19,055 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 1,760 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">The Joint Committee on Health and Children has rightly drawn attention to the fact that the co-operation of all regional consultants is required for an efficient service to be delivered in all health boards. I strongly agree with the committee's view that the interests of children are paramount and must take precedence over all other interests. My Department stands ready to support increased co-operation among the relevant stakeholders. I strongly urge those involved – whether through their representation on the review group established by the chief executive officers or through a separate mediation procedure – to strive for that increased fuller co-operation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_105">
          <from>Mr. Neville:</from>
          <p eId="para_234">In referring to the chief executive officer group, is the Minister aware that the consultant orthodontist to whom he referred has withdrawn from the group because the terms of reference do not address his concerns? He will not participate in the group any longer because he has lost full confidence in it. Is the Minister satisfied that a waiting list of seven to eight years for orthodontic treatment is acceptable? This has happened as a result of disputes between various groups within his Department and the health boards on how best to provide orthodontic treatment. I know the Minister is concerned about this. Surely it is time to address the differences between consultant orthodontists, the dental association and others who are in total disagreement as we witnessed at the meetings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children. Groups vigorously disputed how to provide orthodontic treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Is the Minister aware that the senior consultant to whom he referred has spoken about corruption, abuses, squandered money and the unfairness of destroying good training programmes while supporting poor ones by his Department? The withdrawal of his programme has substantially increased waiting lists in the Mid-Western Health Board, Eastern Regional Health Authority and to some extent in the Western Health Board. The Minister knows exactly what I am talking about. These programmes provided a service which was independently assessed and shown to deliver trainees and service during training which substantially reduced waiting lists. The reintroduction of those would have an immediate and dramatic effect on waiting lists rather than the long-winded, long-term programme which the Minister has outlined to us. I do not know how long we will have to wait for the appointment of a professor of orthodontics in Cork.</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_237">The committee quite rightly said that the co-operation of all regional orthodontists was important and essential to the proper roll-out of the programme. As I said to the consultants concerned, I cannot deal with the sins of the past and what happened in the 1990s and 1980s. This has been an issue since I was appointed Minister two and a half years ago. I know there has been a festering row that has not been conducive to the good provision of services in the areas outlined by the Deputy. I have sought to take steps that do not reopen old sores but rather provide additional services.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">I provided €5 million at the start of 2001 to appoint additional consultants. To be fair to the Eastern Region Health Authority it made significant inroads in making additional appointments. There are about 1,700 additional people receiving treatment now. We have been frustrated in the Southern Health Board area. A range of interviews took place for the position of professor of orthodontics but the person that came forward withdrew. I now understand that the process has been undertaken again and a person may be about to take up that position. Equally, we gave funding for an additional consultant in both Cork and Tralee. While a candidate has gone through the interview process, the person has yet to take up the position.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Deputy Ring last year raised the issue of putting money aside to purchase private treatments in the meantime. I am committed to building up the public service and getting more people into training and that is happening. As a short-term measure while this is coming on-stream, we decided to allocate some of the treatment purchase fund money to the health boards to allow people to receive orthodontic treatment.</p>

      the discussions he has had in relation to the crisis in Monaghan General Hospital since Dáil Éireann last met.

          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_247">The provision of services at Monaghan General Hospital is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board. As the Deputy is aware, I visited Monaghan General Hospital earlier this year and engaged in extensive consultation with hospital management, staff, local representatives and members of the general public. I have maintained regular contact with the board with regard to service issues at the hospital and have been briefed on its efforts to find agreement on a safe and sustainable future for the hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">The board is engaged in continuing dialogue with the hospital consultants in the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group and with the professional bodies in relation to the future configuration of services at Monaghan hospital. The board is of the view that the resolution of the current difficulties will require input from the relevant professional bodies, including the Royal College of Physicians, Royal College of Surgeons, the College of Anaesthetists and the Medical Council as well as that of Comhairle na nOspidéal. It will also require the co-operation of the clinical staff of the Cavan-Monaghan hospital group. I have recently had discussions with the chief executive officer of the board regarding the proposal for a forum on the future configuration of services at the hospital and I have also spoken to local Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">I would also like to advise the Deputy of a number of important service developments which are being progressed at Monaghan hospital. Project teams have been recently established to advise on development of all five acute hospitals in the North-Eastern Health Board area. The primary role of the Monaghan hospital project team is to prepare an outline planning brief for the development of the hospital site.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">My Department has approved a number of new services at Monaghan hospital in recent months. These include new consultant posts in dermatology and geriatric medicine. Other developments recently approved include additional investment in consultant-led surgical and anaesthetic services. Approval has also issued to the board for the recruitment of five additional medical support staff. Over the last three years, in excess of €4.064 million has been allocated to the hospital in respect of various capital projects. The main projects completed included the refurbishment of the female medical ward, a new modular theatre and extension to the car-park. In addition, a major equipment replacement programme costing almost €1.27 million was undertaken throughout the hospital, which included specialist cardiology and patient monitoring equipment. I recently issued approval to the North-Eastern Health Board to the funding of the boiler plant upgrade. A significant level of capital investment in Monaghan General Hospital is proposed in the short-term. Plans are being advanced by the board for the development and upgrading of the high dependency unit at the hospital in addition to substantial upgrading and refurbishment of ward accommodation, the development of the emergency treatment unit and the development of a midwifery-led unit. The associated capital cost is of the order of €7 million.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</from>
          <p eId="para_255">In that case I will take a different tack. The Minister previously referred to the commitment of boards to the provision of a high quality, efficient and cost-effective service. Does he really believe the North-Eastern Health Board is actively involved in the provision of a high quality, efficient and cost-effective service in terms of acute care services at Monaghan General Hospital? The reply he gave to my original question has been given on many previous occasions. Is he aware of the devastating hardship visited upon the people of Monaghan – primarily its women and children – following the loss of its maternity unit and all in-hospital gynaecological services, and is he aware that there is now no in-hospital paediatric care available in the county?</p>
          <p eId="para_256">Is the Minister also aware of the effect of the off-call diktat of the North-Eastern Health Board executive in respect of the status of Monaghan General Hospital and the fact that people who should be brought there by ambulance are redirected to other hospital sites? Is he further aware the College of Surgeons will withdraw accreditation for all surgical training posts from 31 December? Does he realise the effect this will have in terms of the future delivery of services at Monaghan General Hospital? This is a serious matter which warrants and merits a much more hands-on and direct intervention on the Minister's part and that of the Government than has been in evidence since his visit to Monaghan on 22 January last. The Minister has not returned to meet the locally elected and accountable representatives of Monaghan County Council and Monaghan Town Council, who have never had the opportunity to follow-up on his commitment to meet them in the intervening period of now eight months.</p>

          <p eId="para_259">I thought the Deputy was referring to the period since the general election. The time for flag-waving and holding meetings with various delegations is over. It is time we moved to find a solution to the impasse that arose following the report of the College of Anaesthetists with regard to what was and was not accreditable within the hospital. The Deputy and everyone else knows that it was an issue of accreditation which caused the most recent crisis in the hospital in terms of the employment of junior doctors. The Deputy is a member of the North-Eastern Health Board and well placed to form his own judgments on its executive.</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_261">The executive of the North-Eastern Health Board has made it clear to me on numerous occasions that it is doing everything possible to try to resolve this matter in the context of meeting the requirements of the professional bodies. On 18 September significant proposals to allow for the full restoration of medical services and at least 70% of surgical activities in Monaghan General Hospital were discussed. The chief executive officer and senior management from the North-Eastern Health Board met consultants from the hospital in that regard. I regret, however, that the proposals were rejected. If they had been accepted, it would at least have staved off the scenario which the Deputy indicated will come about in December and we could then have considered how we could either enhance or improve the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">People appear to be locked into particular positions in respect of this matter and it will be difficult to get them to sign off on a resolution at this stage. I have spoken to Deputies and I am open to dialogue, but not with up to 25 delegations. I know that the depth of feeling in Monaghan is significant and sincere, but we need to draw up concrete proposals with regard to how these matters might be resolved. We have been providing more assistance than the Deputy might think in terms of trying to bring this issue to a successful conclusion and getting services and, in particular, surgical activities back up and running.</p>

I believe Cavan and Monaghan hospitals working together will be crucial in respect of resolving this issue.

Activity levels within the hospitals are up 13%, which does not accord with the picture the Deputy has painted. That is a significant increase in any one year, much of which was taken up by day case activity. Accident and emergency attendances are down by 2% from the previous year.</p>

There is much working out to be done yet. There have been additional pressures on the hospitals, particularly due to insurance costs and the winter vomiting bug, but there has been an additional allocation of 17.1% to the ERHA in respect of the Dublin academic teaching hospitals. That is significant by any standards. Earlier this afternoon the Deputy was accusing us of over spending and throwing money at health. Now we are told it is not enough.</p>

That is likely to have a serious impact on hospitals who currently have budget over-runs. Can the Minister guarantee that the problems the major teaching hospitals in Dublin are facing will be resolved and that he can provide the additional funding to ensure they will not be in an even worse position next year? Medical inflation is running so high at present that even though the Minister has provided additional funding, and nobody is arguing that point, it is insufficient. This is not the run up to an election. The Minister is facing reality now and, unfortunately, it appears that patients are facing a reality that could have a serious impact on their health.</p>

We thought from the outset that this year was going to be difficult. This House set up the Eastern Regional Health Authority as a basis for the re-organisation of services in Dublin. When the initial legislation was passed some years ago the objective was to create an authority that would enter into service agreements. It would receive an overall budget from the House and would deal with the Dublin academic teaching hospitals and the more than 30 other agencies that provide services.</p>

      <b>Ms O. Mitchell</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Health and Children</b>
      if he will reconcile his reply to a parliamentary question of March 2002 that there was "no transfer of funds directly or indirectly" to the Medical Protection Society with the information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, of an agreement made in May 2001 whereby his Department indemnifies medical practitioners for all the claims over and above 80% of the minimal subscription fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_298">I propose to take Questions Nos. 85, 266 and 273 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The agreement which was entered into between my Department and the Medical Protection Society in May 2001 was intended to ensure that consultant obstetrician-gynaecologists in practice in Ireland could continue to secure professional indemnity cover at an affordable cost. The risk that up to 30 of them would not be able to continue in practice arose from a decision by the Medical Defence Union to increase the cost of indemnity cover from £68,000, or €86,342, to £393,000, or €499,007, for this group. I was concerned that the inability of this small group of practitioners to secure indemnity cover for the period leading up to the introduction of enterprise liability would precipitate a crisis in the provision of obstetric services. Apart from its impact on the public services, it could have led to the closure of the two remaining private obstetric facilities at Mount Carmel Hospital, Dublin, and at the Bon Secours Hospital, Cork.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">In an effort to avert this crisis my Department wrote to the Medical Defence Union and the other mutual defence body, the Medical Protection Society, asking them for proposals which would allow obstetricians to have access to secure and reasonably priced indemnity cover for the 12-18 months leading up to the introduction of enterprise liability. The proposals received from the MDU and the MPS were evaluated by officials of my Department and their external insurance advisers. They recommended acceptance of the MPS's proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">The agreement with the MPS provides for the subscriptions of Irish consultant obstetricians to be placed in two funds to cover consultants in the public sector and the private sector. When enterprise liability for consultants is introduced the balance remaining in the fund relating to consultants in the public sector will be transferred to the Exchequer less any moneys expended on claims against those doctors which had been lodged after the effective date of the agreement. The liabilities arising from these claims would be transferred with the balance of the fund. The fate of the fund relating to consultants in the private sector would be the subject of discussions with the MPS and representatives of the private consultants at the appropriate time in the context of the long-term arrangements to be made for this group.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The agreement does not provide for any transfer of funds to the MPS, whether directly or indirectly, other than the normal reimbursement arrangements in place for consultants in the public hospital system. These arrangements apply to consultants in all specialties whether members of the MDU or MPS. The agreement with the MPS provides for the public consultants' fund to be transferred to the Department within one month of the introduction of enterprise liability for consultants. The position of the fund has recently been reviewed with the MPS and I can confirm that no payments have been made from it to date. I am satisfied that the moneys placed in the fund plus investment income will be transferred to my Department in 2002. Therefore, the factual position is that there has been no transfer of funds to the MPS regarding these liabilities.</p>

          <from>Ms O. Mitchell:</from>
          <p eId="para_303">In reply to a parliamentary question last March, the Minister said there was no transfer of funds, directly or indirectly, to the Medical Protection Society. However, it became clear from information obtained under the Freedom of Information Act a couple of months later that in the previous year the Minister had agreed to provide limitless funds to the Medical Protection Society. That offer was not made to the alternative insurer. There has been a complaint to the European Commission that this is contrary to EU competition law. Will the Minister agree that he has placed himself in an invidious position in respect of European law? It would not be accepted for any other Department to favour one company over another. The proposals sought did not give any indication that the Department was willing to prop up one company but not the other.</p>

          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_304">My advice is strongly to the contrary on the points advanced by Deputy Mitchell. There was a real danger of a crisis being precipitated in this area as a result of the decision of the Medical Defence Union to increase the cost of indemnity cover to the degree it proposed. I have been in ongoing discussions with the Medical Defence Union for some time and our discussions did not relate to this issue to any significant degree. They concentrated on the issue of historic liabilities and the wish of the Medical Defence Union that the State should, almost without condition, accept responsibility for any arrears or payments into the future that would arise from claims against the MDU. These are termed "historic liabilities". That was the main issue when we were working on enterprise liability. The MDU also raised this issue, particularly latterly, in the discussions.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">Everybody understands the circumstances and there is no argument that a serious issue was involved. However, will the Minister reassure the House that he is certain he has acted legally? Would he not have been better advised to go through a formal tendering process to ensure there was no ambiguity or misunderstanding, to put it at its best? There is now an aggrieved party which believes it was not given an equal chance and a complaint has been made to the European Union. Can the Minister be certain he applied the correct mechanism to go through this process?</p>

          <p eId="para_327">My Department is currently examining all issues relevant to the establishment of a national hospitals agency, including the implications for the future discharge of functions currently vested in Comhairle na nOspidéal. Work is also at an advanced stage on two related projects, both of which will have implications for the role and functioning of this agency. These are the national task force on medical staffing and the audit of structures and functions in the health system, both of which are due to reach their respective conclusions early in the new year.</p>

          <from>Ms O. Mitchell:</from>
          <p eId="para_329">I was surprised not to find any proposals to establish a national hospitals agency in the Government's legislative programme, although this matter is fundamental to the national health strategy. If the Minister does not take decisions about hospitals and where consultants are to be deployed, decisions cannot be made about hospital beds or where nurses are to be deployed. This is the hard decision that has to be made. If the national hospitals agency is not going to be established in the near future, there is precious little chance that waiting lists will be reduced or that major funding decisions will be taken in the coming years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_178">
          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_330">Both reform strands of the overall strategy are going ahead at full speed. A consultancy was awarded in July to Prospectus, a company that is currently undertaking the audit of structures and functions in the health system. The work of the national task force on medical staffing is also proceeding under the chairmanship of Mr. David Hanley. We expect both reports to be ready by January 2003 but it is important there is some synergy between both groups in terms of outcome. Both groups will keep each other up to speed with developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The Deputy is correct in saying that the establishment of the national hospitals agency is an important part of the organisational reform of the health services contained in the health strategy. It is important one should proceed with some degree of deliberation to ensure that in establishing the agency the i's are dotted and the t's crossed. It would be possible to establish it on an interim basis under existing legislation. Alternatively, depending on the outcome of these reviews, if primary legislation is necessary it will ensue, but it may not be necessary in the interim.</p>

          <from>Ms O. Mitchell:</from>
          <p eId="para_332">What impact will the absence of any decisions about the location and designation of hospitals have on the industrial relations problems that are brewing in hospitals concerning non-consultant hospital doctors? It will be impossible to solve their problems without solving all the other problems that exist throughout the acute hospital services. Can the reports of the national task force on medical staffing and the audit of structures and functions in the health system be brought forward to avoid industrial chaos in hospitals?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_180">
          <from>Mr. Martin:</from>
          <p eId="para_333">The two groups that are due to report are not industrial relations fora. It would, therefore, be most injurious to both processes if they were to become embroiled in the area of industrial relations. When we commenced the audit of structures and functions in the health system and, in particular, the national task force on medical staffing, it was clear to all parties that industrial relations issues were not to come within their remits. That would undermine totally the new structures and reforms that need to be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">The existing agencies continue to organise a configuration of services and specialities. Comhairle na nOspidéal is the key body with statutory responsibility for sanctioning the allocation of consultancy posts, specialty by specialty, across the country.</p>

These job losses will also affect Iarnród Éireann which provides a rail service there. The company is the last heavy industry left in the region.

          <p eId="para_367">On behalf of the Government, I express our grief and sadness at the terrible tragedy of the death of Alan Higgins. We sympathise with his family, his immediate friends and his community. Everybody has been deeply moved by the tragedy. Having overcome so many difficulties in his life, to have been stabbed in such a way makes it all the more appalling. Added to that is the other stabbing tragedy in the city over the weekend and all the other violent crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">I accept what Deputy Kenny and Deputy Howlin have said, that attacks of this nature have become more prevalent in recent years. There is no denying that. Unfortunately, unprovoked attacks are not confined to late at night or the early hours of the morning. Although such attacks more frequently occur at those times, there have been vicious attacks in the late afternoon after school and college. There have been such attacks in the early evening and in this city they have occurred not only at weekends, as used be the case, but on every night of the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">In reply to Deputy Howlin's question, many new legislative measures have been introduced. Innovative public order legislation has been introduced, there have been targeted Garda operations, there has been a strict enforcement of the liquor licensing laws, there has been an extension of the use of closed circuit television, and there has been a increase in the number of garda in the areas where they are most required. The National Crime Council has commissioned independent research on this very issue of public order and its findings are due out at Christmas. There have been many more legislative provisions and the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill has been enacted. There have been Garda operations such as Operation Encounter and Garda activities as a result of the CCTV system.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">Following cases, such as the most recent ones, as always, the question is asked "are there any other legislative measures required?" and this will be looked at.</p>

          <p eId="para_375">This tragic incident took place at 11.10 p.m. and it is not a question related to liquor licensing. The implementation of the outstanding relevant provisions of the Children Act has to be completed. We continue to support and strengthen the network of gardaí involved in youth diversion, which has expanded from 12 areas into 64 areas. The gardaí support the enforcement of the liquor licensing laws with particular reference to provisions relating to the mandatory temporary closure of pubs and off-licences. The rules are there. If they are abused, the powers provided by this House should be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has informed me that three youths have appeared in the Dublin District Children's Court in relation to the death of Alan Higgins. One youth has been charged with manslaughter, as per the instructions of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Two youths have been charged with theft under section 14 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act. All three have been released on their own bail into the custody of their parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">In reply to the Deputies, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will do all he can with the Garda to address this issue. The prevalence of these acts of violence by youths is unfortunate, and it is a serious cause for concern. I am not too sure legislation is the only way of dealing with it. I hope the National Crime Council, in the independent research it has commissioned, might throw some light on measures other than legislation, CCTV, and extra gardaí. It is sad that very young people who should be involved in normal activities now feel they must go armed on to the streets, even into quiet areas, to engage in this type of activity.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_378">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. However, is this not an indication of total failure? The statistics we are now hearing show that the initiatives to which the Taoiseach refers have failed. The extent of crime increased by 18% between 2000 and 2001, the numbers of sexual offences are up by 83% and the number of murders by 33%. Anyone involved in participative democracy in the community knows about the invasion of young lives by drink and substance abuse. Is it not now clear that, in this case, some young people were given drink by an adult and is this not an indication that, sad though this case is, it is not isolated? We may find more such incidents on streets in other towns throughout the country? Does this not mean the Government should review, not just the legislative programme, but also the existing facilities and resources and the implementation of existing initiatives to make as many people as possible understand just how fragile our democracy now is? Have we reached a critical point where young people are afraid to walk the streets of our towns in pursuit of normal activities and their parents are frustrated, concerned and deeply fearful of the abiding image of a late night telephone call or of a garda or ambulance calling to the door? The initiatives mentioned by the Taoiseach have failed and it is time he reviewed them and provided extra resources involving community and other agencies to rectify this problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_214">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_379">The review of procedures and current legislation, which the Deputy suggests, is ongoing. A terrible tragedy such as this one brings those issues to the fore. Initiatives such as CCTV cameras, and a review of the Firearms Acts, which cover the possession of knives, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and the Children Act are ongoing. Legislative measures are being amended, powers are being strengthened and laws updated. A host of such legislation is before the House. However, more must be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Operation Encounter focused on public order difficulties occurring in the community and paid particular attention to night clubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers of people congregate and where there is potential for disorder. The target hours of the operation are determined locally based on the circumstances of the particular town or city and attention is paid to ensuring the owners and managers of the relevant premises are fully aware of their responsibility. The Garda call with owners, speak to them and give them instruction as to how measures should be enforced. Additional resources have been made available to do this and each regional commander has been asked to draw up his or her own plans to prioritise the deployment of these resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">There appears, nevertheless, to be an unfortunate level of aggression in a certain number of young people. These problems do not happen all the time but happen too frequently. The closing of licensed premises does not stop young people going to other venues or using older people to buy drink on their behalf in off-licences. The Minister, with the Garda authorities, will review procedures and tighten them, where possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">Operation Encounter is having an effect in some areas, but this effect must be widespread. When we discussed the extension of public house opening hours, the point was made that limiting the opening hours of licensed premises does not stop the availability of drink or drugs, as Deputy Kenny said. The Government will again look at the circumstances to see if more can be done, while implementing the measures already in place.</p>

Leaving aside my natural reaction that this is a bit rich coming from a Government which has already flouted the people's will on this issue as declared last year, it raised a question I wish to put to the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">Why not adopt such a motion before the referendum? Every party and Deputy in this House and both sides in the referendum campaign support enlargement.

          <p eId="para_414">Deputy Kenny was correct when he said that we are involved in a constitutional referendum. The people hold the sovereign view on this issue as has been decided many times in the Supreme Court. A Dáil motion will not resolve that. However, it is useful to have on the record from Deputy Ó Caoláin, as newly elected leader of the Technical Group, that all Members of the House support enlargement. It is clear that the best way of ensuring that enlargement is implemented for the applicant countries – the ten that are ready plus the others – is to ratify the Nice treaty. The only legal and administrative way to bring about enlargement of the European Union is for the people to ratify that in a referendum. We are all agreed on that and we should not try to invent new mechanisms. There is only one mechanism and that is a referendum to ratify the treaty in a legal fashion by voting "Yes".</p>

I realise the Deputy is in a position of power and authority as the leader of the Technical Group, but he cannot tell ten countries to change their systems. That is a stupid idea.</p>

          <p eId="para_421">In the immediate aftermath of the general election, after a campaign in which we heard that no cuts in public expenditure were planned or envisaged, we learned from a leaked memo that €900 million worth of cuts were to be implemented for next year. We learned this weekend that this amount has now increased to €1.7 billion. Will the Taoiseach confirm that it is now an agreed target to reduce public expenditure next year by €1.7 billion? Does he agree with the statement made by the Tánaiste on Friday last that what are now required are more aggressive cuts? Does he agree with yesterday's statement by the Minister for Finance that the budgetary situation is much worse than was understood when the €900 million in cuts were deemed necessary and that, therefore, more significant cuts are now envisaged? Where will the axe fall and when will we know?</p>

          <p eId="para_426">In reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin's question, we will stick with the growth and stability pact to remain close to balance or in balance for the coming years and at the end of a five-year period we will be back in balance. That is the stated position and what the Government will try to achieve. The reality of the income decline in recent months is that statistics for the nine months to the end of September, in areas such as corporation tax, show a reduction of about 28%. Such a major shortfall in income is creating difficulties. Expenditure is continuing to grow at between 14% and 17%. The commitments outlined by the Minister for Finance in the Revised Book of Estimates in February will be met in full. Additional areas, such as demand-led schemes, will also be paid for.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I can inform Deputy Kenny that there are no proposals to raid external reserves or anything else. The Book of Estimates for this year will be produced sometime in mid-November and the budget will be outlined in the first week of December. All the matters I have mentioned will be dealt with then. I am confident that the figures for next year will show increases in public expenditure, just as there were enormous increases this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_428">The Taoiseach has not answered my question in a clear manner. We know from the original leaked memo that cuts of €900 million are planned for next year. Another memo, leaked this weekend, indicates that there will be a further €800 million of cutbacks. This means that there will be total cuts of €1.7 billion. I ask the Taoiseach to inform the House whether the Minister for Finance is looking for a ballpark figure of €1.7 billion in public expenditure cutbacks in 2003? If the figure is not €1.7 billion, what is it? Where are the priorities in terms of the axe? Does the Taoiseach accept that if cuts of about €1.7 billion are being sought, it will represent a cut of 7.3% of all current expenditure? This would have an enormously depressive effect on the economy.</p>

        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_340">
          <from>The Taoiseach:</from>
          <p eId="para_608">I welcome this opportunity to make a statement to the House on recent developments in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement derives its strength and authority from the sovereign will of the people expressed in the referenda in 1998. The effort to secure full implementation of all aspects of the Agreement has been further strengthened by the consistent support of this House. It is, therefore, appropriate that we have this occasion to reflect on the current situation and to mark our continuing commitment to the Agreement and the efforts that we are seeking to make to ensure that it is protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The Government has been a committed and honourable partner and has approached all aspects of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement in a fair and even-handed manner. This has been, and will remain, the basis on which we approach our task, a task which still, despite all the improvements and positive changes, demands our consistent and undivided attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Over the past number of weeks, the two Governments have been engaged in extensive contacts with one another and the pro-Good Friday Agreement parties in Northern Ireland. In more recent days, I have had a series of meetings with the First Minister and the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble; the leader of the SDLP and Deputy First Minister, Mark Durkan; Sinn Féin President, Gerry Adams; and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. I have also had contact with the leader of the Alliance Party, David Forde. Regrettably, despite this intensive activity, it has not proved possible to resolve the current impasse. As a result, the British Government decided that devolved government in Northern Ireland should cease from midnight last night. It is a setback, yes, but a defeat, no.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Yesterday the Irish and British Governments issued a joint statement following the announcement on suspension. Our joint statement is a clear demonstration of our common commitment to the Agreement and our intention to proceed with its full implementation. The two Governments, as they have been at other vital stages in the process, are united in their determination and clear in their assessment of what needs to be done to address the current situation. As we said in our joint statement, we are saddened by the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive but we believe that devolved government cannot be made to work effectively in circumstances where there has been a breakdown of trust between the parties. It is, nonetheless, our sincere wish to have devolved government restored as soon as possible, and in a way that will last without further disruption, once trust between the parties has been restored.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The challenge in the period ahead is to restore that trust. It may not be easily achieved but I firmly believe that it can be done. The period ahead must be used to the best possible effect. I hope it will be a period of calm and clear thinking. There is a great deal at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">There are many who have tried to make the devolved government in Northern Ireland work. There have also been outstanding contributions by Ministers in the Executive on all sides to try and make a difference and to apply themselves to good and fair government for all the people of Northern Ireland. It would be wrong at this moment of difficulty not to acknowledge this. Northern Ireland is blessed with many talented politicians who, working together, have shown that they can serve the interests of both communities. It is our collective task to create the circumstances in which they will be again able to come together in an inclusive partnership Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">It is very important that we do not allow a setback to become a terminal crisis. It will only become such a crisis if we let it become one and, despite the difficulties and differences, I do not believe that any of the parties want this to happen. Why would they? There has already been too much invested in making Northern Ireland a new and different place from the past and people can see that this is a better Northern Ireland – a Northern Ireland at peace, albeit imperfect, and a place of opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">While the devolved institutions may now be suspended, the Good Friday Agreement is not. This is the vital distinction. The two Governments are determined to implement all aspects of the Agreement that are within their powers to implement. We do not want a vacuum to develop. Both Governments will be active, in consultation with the parties, in encouraging the conditions in which devolved government can be restored in advance of the scheduled elections.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">However, for this to happen, it will require more than just the dedicated efforts of the two Governments. All political parties who subscribe to the principles and purpose of the Agreement must also play their part. Nobody bears sole responsibility for what has happened and no one party on its own can reopen the door to the restoration of devolved government. We will need to work together to overcome this latest challenge but, just as we have managed to overcome other serious difficulties in the past, I believe that we can do so again.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">We have made it very clear that we did not support the exclusion of Sinn Féin from the Northern Ireland Executive. I have listened with great care to the strong views of the Ulster Unionist Party on this issue. I understand their concerns but I do not believe that exclusion would have been the correct response, or a response consistent with the central purpose of the peace process.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">Since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement on 10 April 1998, we have had many historic, ground breaking events. Northern Ireland remains a society in transition from conflict to peace but the changes brought about by the Good Friday Agreement have been transforming Northern Ireland for the better. The principles are agreed. Partnership, equality and mutual respect will continue to be the basis for governance in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">Profound progress has been made that has helped to consolidate peace. There is no going back to the bad days. A new landscape is being etched with the principles of the Good Friday Agreement and this is being done in ways which are entirely positive for all the people of Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_620">In many ways, the current difficulties have been in the making for some time. It is sadly ironic that one of the most fertile periods in the process of implementing the Agreement has also been accompanied by a gradual erosion of confidence in the capacity of the Agreement to achieve the transitions that the people of Northern Ireland require. Deputies will recall that, following the discussions at Weston Park, the two Governments published a comprehensive package of proposals on 1 August 2001, designed to address the key outstanding areas of the Agreement – policing, arms decommissioning, the normalisation of security arrangements and the stability of the political institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_621">Over the past 12 months, substantial progress has been made in all of these areas. The Police Service of Northern Ireland has come into being, drawing recruits on a 50:50 basis from both communities. A policing board, representative of both communities in Northern Ireland, has been established to oversee the PSNI and has demonstrated great courage and cohesion in addressing a number of difficult and sensitive issues. A new chief constable has been appointed and has made a positive start. North-South policing co-operation is being pro-actively advanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">We have had two acts of arms decommissioning by the IRA which were verified by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning, the latter of which involved a substantial and varied quantity of arms being put permanently beyond use. Unfortunately, the IRA's initiative in this area was not matched by corresponding moves on the loyalist side. In addition, the significance of this move by the republican movement was not sufficiently acknowledged by some elements of unionism. At the same time, there were significant announcements about normalisation of security arrangements in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">Furthermore, following very effective interventions by the First and Deputy First Ministers, the British Government announced in May that a number of military facilities in Northern Ireland were being transferred to the ownership of the Northern Ireland Executive for economic and community use. Swords were indeed becoming ploughshares.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">However, while progress on demilitarisation has been made, I believe there is scope for doing a good deal more. For many Nationalists, there is still a far too intrusive security presence with little evidence of visible reductions despite the Agreement and the enormous improvement in the security situation throughout Northern Ireland. This is an issue which must be progressed more rapidly and more actively and we will be pressing this point in our engagement with the British Government through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Over the past year, the institutions of the Agreement have, despite some difficulties, been operating in an effective and inclusive way. Not only were the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Executive delivering progressive and accountable government for the people of Northern Ireland, but the North-South Ministerial Council, NSMC, and the British-Irish Council, BIC, were undertaking programmes of work which brought practical benefit to the people of this island and of these islands. Last Wednesday's meeting of the NSMC was the 65th meeting of the council bringing together Ministers from both parts of the island, representative of both traditions, for the benefit of all our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">Unfortunately, the positive impact of all of this progress was, at the same time, being undermined by many security-related confidence sapping reports and allegations. These were compounded by a summer of turmoil at the community interfaces in north and east Belfast in which paramilitaries, on both sides, were deemed to be involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">The glass in Northern Ireland is more often regarded as half empty rather than half full. These developments were allowed to overshadow the substantial progress that had been made and this was compounded by the negative voices of those whose escalating demands for reassurance on the bona fides of Sinn Féin was, for some at least, a code for their outright opposition to inclusive government.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">In addition, some of those who set the most exacting standards for the republican movement seemed less concerned about the systematic and ongoing violence of loyalist paramilitaries, despite the fact that, as certified by the PSNI, the majority of the serious violence, including murder, was coming from that quarter.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The outcome of the Ulster Unionist Council on 21 September represented the emergence of a policy which was deeply disappointing to many Nationalists. Regrettably, that policy was not just directed at achieving the required transition from paramilitarism to exclusively democratic means. It also was targeted at other core elements of the Agreement, such as policing, which created a perception that leading elements within unionism were now seeking to turn back the clock on the agenda for change represented by the Agreement. The resolution also clearly signalled that failure to achieve a major advance on the transition from paramilitarism to exclusively democratic means would result in the withdrawal of the UUP from the Executive in January.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">The fall-out from the arrests and the related search of the Sinn Féin offices in Stormont on 4 October accelerated a political crisis which was already evolving and would, in any event, have come to a head in January. It also raised very serious issues of trust and confidence. For many Unionists who supported the Agreement and wanted this accommodation to work, recent events were the final straw.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">I am very conscious that, arising out of these events, four individuals have now been charged and face prosecution. I do not wish to say anything on the detail of those charges which in any way compromises that judicial process. However, the arrests have undeniably given rise to a widespread perception that a number of people closely associated with Sinn Féin were involved in activities which were inconsistent with a commitment to exclusively democratic methods.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">It also needs to be acknowledged that the precise timing of these arrests and their high-profile manner, particularly the search of the Sinn Féin offices in Stormont, have led to some suspicions that their purpose was essentially political, namely to place Sinn Féin in the dock at a time when, as a result of the UUC meeting of 21 September, Unionists were under some critical scrutiny. While I do not necessarily share this view, its wide currency among Nationalists indicates a deficit of confidence in that community as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">As always in Northern Ireland, both sides need to be reassured. There has been a good deal of critical comment on the unnecessarily high profile manner in which the PSNI carried out the search of the Sinn Féin offices at Stormont. I welcome the Chief Constable's apology on the manner of this search. This reflected a new and refreshing willingness to acknowledge when mistakes were made and to learn from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Before I met the British Prime Minister last Wednesday night, I said that the Northern institutions could not work if the required underlying trust between the parties was absent. While I greatly regret that the British Government has felt it necessary to suspend the Assembly and Executive, it is difficult to escape the reality that the basis of trust and confidence for their continued operation, for the moment at least, has been undermined.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">How do we now rebuild trust and confidence among the parties in Northern Ireland? Two things need to happen. We need to ensure that the transition from paramilitarism to exclusively democratic means is clearly advanced towards a definitive and unambiguous end-point and that this transition is apparent to all. Transition also involves clear obligations for loyalism. Second, we need to clearly demonstrate that the Agreement remains the template, that the two Governments intend to deliver fully on its provisions and that we are not for turning on our commitment to its fundamental values and principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">I have always been willing to acknowledge the major contribution which the Sinn Féin leadership has made to the peace process and I do so again here this evening. Its key role in persuading the IRA to call a ceasefire, agree to independent arms inspections and undertake two acts of decommissioning has been essential to creating the conditions for a political process and for sustaining it. This summer's IRA apology was also an important and welcome development. Moreover, Sinn Féin has undertaken a number of initiatives which have been designed to build greater confidence, including Alex Maskey's commendable outreach to unionism as Mayor of Belfast.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">Unfortunately, the confidence building potential of these actions has, to a great extent, been dissipated by a number of confidence eroding events, including the most recent arrests. There is no escaping the reality that these have caused damage and affected confidence. Eight years after the first IRA ceasefire, and four and a half years after the Agreement, people in Northern Ireland have a legitimate expectation that the transition to exclusively democratic methods should be much more advanced than it is today.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">In the context of prisoners being released, welcome progress on the normalisation of security arrangements, substantial changes in policing and the operation of inclusive government in Northern Ireland, there is a diminishing tolerance for the vestiges of paramilitarism, especially when it involves the kind of murderous attacks we have seen over the past year from the UDA and LVF and the kind of recent barbarous punishment attacks in Derry and South Armagh.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">From the outset, we all recognised that the required transition would take time, could only be progressed in the context of the full implementation of the Agreement and would be retarded, rather than advanced, by the politics of ultimatum. Time and space have been accorded to the republican movement to take the required steps.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">The steps taken to date have been very helpful. However, there is a desperate need for further progress, not because the British Government or the Unionists demand it but because the people of Ireland are entitled to it. It is simply the right thing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I welcome the statement from Gerry Adams this morning that the issue of armed groups needs to be dealt with and that this includes the IRA. Like him, I recognise that the process cannot be confined to a single issue but there can be no doubt that this is key if the deficit of confidence that currently exists within the Unionist community is to be overcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">In terms of its own principles and analysis, the republican movement must recognise that embracing the democratic path was the correct course and that its continued integration into the democratic fabric represents the best way of fulfilling its political objectives and effectively representing its community.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The loyalist community has suffered greatly over the years. Its communities are in urgent need of economic and social regeneration, as well as reassurance about the political path ahead. A number of its political leaders, particularly within the PUP, have made important contributions to the peace process and have shown great political courage and leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The Government wants to have a relationship of mutual respect and partnership with loyalism. However, those godfathers of violence within loyalism, who seem only to be motivated by sectarian hatred and their self enrichment, merely impoverish their own community, as well as inflicting suffering on the Nationalist community. We fully support the determination of the Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, to apply the full rigour of the law to those who pursue such a vicious and murderous agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">We need to rebuild confidence in the process. We need also to recognise that confidence is a two-way street. If we are asking the republican movement to abandon finally any residual attachment to a dual strategy, we must equally challenge Unionists to fully and unequivocally embrace the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The Prime Minister, Mr. Blair and I in our statement yesterday reiterated that it is essential that each community has confidence in the commitment of the representatives of the other to the full operation and implementation of the Agreement. The Agreement represents a profound charter for change involving the entrenchment of equality at the heart of all aspects of life in Northern Ireland. There is no cherry-picking of the Agreement, there is no "Agreement-lite" that might be more palatable for those Unionists who are averse to its inclusive elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">I am convinced that the vast majority of Unionists support an inclusive Northern Ireland based on full equality for all. Their challenge now is to make that commitment more manifest, particularly to the minority within their own ranks who harbour the illusion that it is possible to turn back the clock to some form of Unionist supremacy. That will simply not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">In the temporary absence of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland, it will fall to the two Governments, as guardians of the Agreement, to take the initiative in managing the period ahead. The Prime Minister, Mr. Blair and I agreed the broad outline of that strategy when we met in Downing Street last week and it is reflected in our joint statement yesterday. A core element of the success in the peace process over recent years has been the partnership between both Governments. The strength and vitality of that partnership will be particularly important over the next few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, under strand three of the Agreement, is the main mechanism for bilateral co-operation between both Governments and has a special focus on non-devolved matters in Northern Ireland. The conference will have an important role to play in managing the period ahead and ensuring that the gains of the Agreement are fully protected and defended, particularly in vital areas such as policing and North-South co-operation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will address this issue in greater detail in his statement. I expect that he will meet the Northern Ireland Secretary of State in the context of the BIIGC next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I will make one matter clear regarding the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. It is an institution established by the Agreement and operates within its terms. It is not a threat to anyone. It does not represent joint authority nor is such a scenario the desired outcome of the Irish Government. We want to see devolved government operate on an inclusive basis in Northern Ireland; we want partnership government between the Unionist and Nationalist traditions; we want to have a mutually beneficial partnership with Unionists through the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council. From the experience of recent years, we know these partnerships have worked, have an even greater potential in the future and that the people of Northern Ireland want them to endure.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">In the period between now and the scheduled Assembly elections in May, we will work with renewed determination to try and rebuild the basis of trust and confidence between the parties; to restore the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland as soon as possible and, in the meantime, in close partnership with the British Government, to protect and develop fully the principles and achievements of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">The statement by President Bush yesterday underlines his continuing interest and support for our determination to achieve full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. The US has been a consistent and committed supporter of the peace process and its continuing willingness to assist in our efforts is something that is greatly appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Between its negotiation and its implementation, my five years as Taoiseach have revolved around the Good Friday Agreement. With each passing day, I am more and more convinced of its authority and validity. There is simply no alternative to the Agreement, not just because it was solemnly endorsed by the people and is now reflected in the constitutional fabric of both Ireland and the United Kingdom, but also because it is simply inconceivable that any dilution of its core principles would attract the support of both communities in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The genuine sense of loss that has accompanied suspension is testament to the yearning for self-government that unites all strands of political opinion in Northern Ireland. Let us now build on that; re-establish the trust and confidence between the parties that is required; show, through the solidarity of the two Governments, that partnership politics works and that the wreckers will be confounded.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">Despite yesterday's setback, I am convinced that with the continuing support of all parties in this House, which I appreciate, we can and will realise the full promise of the Agreement.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_341">
          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_656">The suspension of the Northern institutions announced by the Secretary of State yesterday morning is as regrettable as it was unavoidable. The trust between the two communities, already an ephemeral, fragile thing, was broken beyond immediate repair by the persistent, insistent suggestion of collusion, continuing paramilitarism and, more recently, possible espionage. Beatings in Derry, escalating street violence, ongoing events in Colombia and, just this weekend, arrests in Bray, brought a still-new scenario to a familiar and sad end.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">People on both sides of this conflict who have suffered and hoped for so much might well be wondering if anyone, anywhere had the wit to write down the truth of what they had before they forget it, if not for their own sakes, then for the sake of their children. One wonders how those who gave it their all feel today. There is the woman who spoke on an RTE news programme on Saturday and said that she wanted the process to work for her 13 year old grandson. She looked straight to camera and said that it was what she is praying for. It is vital that this suspension does not become a political apocalypse, but that it is contained and managed as a mere interruption to the workings of the Agreement which has proved itself – if not by the day then by times – to be eminently workable. For the sake of the 3,680 people who lost their lives in the Troubles, it can be no other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">Just as there is no plan B with the Treaty of Nice, neither does the Good Friday Agreement come with a second option. It is, as the Taoiseach has said, the only show in town and those who have made it their political life's work to discredit and destroy it have failed at every step to produce anything like a credible alternative, possibly because in their hearts they know that life in Northern Ireland cannot remain unaltered beyond that fateful Good Friday. Fine Gael is, of course, committed to the Agreement as the only viable basis for a lasting settlement in Northern Ireland. It is clear that everyone with a stake in the process, and those who support it, must hold their nerve at this critical time. We must not and cannot give up what has been achieved. The full implementation of the Agreement remains the absolute priority. It is only by complete implementation that its full potential can be realised and such implementation means addressing the entire range of decommissioning, policing, demilitarisation and human rights issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Just a few weeks ago in the company of the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the SDLP conference in Belfast, I welcomed comments from two traditionally polar players in Northern Ireland. On one side, the new Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, said encouraging things about creating the kind of police force in which all the communities, especially those whose relationship with the police had been complex and traditionally mistrustful, could have complete faith. On the other side, Gerry Adams said equally encouraging things about the future of policing and the still-controversial policing board. As I welcomed those comments, in another hall not too far along the waterfront the Agreement was being unravelled. Even a day is a long time in politics when it comes to Northern Ireland which is why it is vital that we move immediately to prevent a continuing vacuum into which the hopes, dreams, aspirations and even lives of those on both sides of the conflict might be sucked.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">To prevent such a vacuum, it is a political imperative that both Governments work together through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference to progress strand three of the Good Friday Agreement. In this time of political uncertainty, the Assembly elections acquire a new criticality and there is absolutely no justification for postponing them beyond the planned date in May. Moreover, the Governments should move immediately to convene meetings with each of the pro-Agreement parties. These meetings should address only the free implementation of the Agreement and no changes to what has been agreed should ever be considered. Such meetings would elicit right away the criteria considered by each side to be vital to restoring the trust and confidence so necessary for the restoration of the institutions. They found that trust before on a very long road and on a very cold Good Friday. It can and must be restored for all the communities involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">The time for dark and dirty secrets on both sides of this conflict is over. If there is to be trust, there must be real movement on all the fractious issues, among them decommissioning, collusion and policing, rather than stalling and posturing, and that movement must take place now. I suggest to the Taoiseach that consideration be given to reconvening the Forum on Peace and Reconciliation, which was never formally disbanded, to provide a structure within which parties committed to the process can propose solutions to the current impasse. It is clear that we need to rid ourselves of the inertia which caused this most recent suspension. In recent months, the mood has been changing significantly and the euphoria of the 84% all-island acceptance of the Agreement has been replaced by uncertainty. The security force presence, at its highest level since the ceasefires were declared, is a pressing case for all paramilitary organisations to turn their backs on all forms of violence and disorder. There is an onus on the republican movement to take appropriate action to demonstrate its commitment to exclusively peaceful means of achieving its objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">I recently met the leadership of Sinn Féin and believe that its leaders are committed to the working of the Agreement and to an eventual peaceful process for Northern Ireland and all our people. Given how much the republican movement has gained from this process, it beggars belief that it needs to hold on to such large quantities of semtex explosive, which is not and has never been a defensive weapon. Is it now part of that cause to regard it as some kind of republican family heirloom? The glamorous whiff of cordite, or semtex, proved something of a political aphrodisiac in certain quarters in America until 11 September when terrorism came to be seen for what it was, as terror and only that from whichever quarter it comes. Whatever its sentiments, the republican movement needs to give it up and time is one thing that current circumstances do not provide for in abundance.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">For those elements of the republican movement now so unfamiliar with semtex explosive that they find it difficult to locate, I tell them I heard a man speak in Glencree, County Wicklow, recently who knows how to do so. Colin Parry says it has an unforgettable smell which pervaded the cubicle where his son, Tim, was brought fresh from the IRA bombing in Warrington. He has no need of heirlooms. Sinn Féin must now deliver on its oft-stated objective of seeing the IRA disbanded. I am not in a position to set deadlines or timescales, but if we accept the validity of the argument and the suggestions and commitment of the leadership of Sinn Féin to the peace process and the full working through of the Good Friday Agreement, then that must be contained within it.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">At this critical time, I appeal to moderate Unionists to stick with the process and reiterate their commitment to the Agreement and the principle of power sharing. Great credit is due to all those who worked out the Agreement. It brought a new political reality to Northern Ireland and a new political vocabulary to Northern Ireland watchers everywhere. Suddenly, after that bitter cold Good Friday, Sir Reg Empey was talking about trade and tourism, Bairbre de Bruin was balancing her hospital budgets and Martin McGuinness was assessing the validity of school curricula. Suddenly there were possibilities. Once bitter enemies now sat together at the Cabinet table of the Assembly. Only Ian Paisley said, "No". While the others have been institutionally silenced, he is the one who is still talking and still saying, "No".</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Sinn Féin has shown commendable commitment to fully implementing the Agreement, as has David Trimble. The Unionists stayed in the Assembly after Castlereagh and Colombia. Instead of saying, "No", we say, "Never". No person or party should be allowed to throw away the great achievements of the Good Friday Agreement. The success in reducing the number of contentious flashpoints as a result of the establishment of the Parades Commission is a case in point. The number has been reduced from 300 to 11 or 12. That could only have happened by direct negotiation, dialogue, discussion and compromise. The parties can progress their objectives by working within the structures established by the Agreement in a way which would be impossible without it.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">If we are to have continued success, more work must be done to accommodate the discrepancy of histories that has become the history of Northern Ireland. I am not being simplistic. I recognise the enormity of the suffering on all sides of the conflict. However, the poor on both sides are the forgotten people of the Troubles. Regardless of religion, the poor suffered most and will suffer again if the Agreement is not worked. They are the easy targets. I recall Gary McMichael saying how proud he was to represent some of those banished to the fringes of society by lack of opportunity, education, jobs and hope. Gerry Adams and Mark Durkan would say the same. The violence we see these days invariably involves young men from the working class neighbourhoods of Short Strand, Tigers Bay, Twinbrook and Glencairn. The women also turned out when Holy Cross became a critical issue. These people stand to lose everything because they have had nothing. Having shown them how the world could be and those early traces of happiness and opportunity, will we now recommit them to their ghettos from which escape, intact, is virtually impossible?</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Can we now have generosity, not gesture, from Sinn Féin which has gained a lot from the Agreement? Can Unionists demonstrate their capacity to live with power sharing for the future? Can all sides pay attention and dispense with paramilitary activity? Can both Governments and agencies concentrate on working the Agreement through to completion and finality? We cannot afford any difference of opinion between the Government led by the Taoiseach and the British Government on where we stand with the Agreement. If that happened and the institutions were suspended, it would create a vacuum in which those who do not support the Agreement would triumph.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">There is no escape from the Agreement as the sole hope for Northern Ireland. There is nothing else. If it is to work now – it must work now –there must be no more deadlines or posturing. The destructive blame game which has characterised the life of the Agreement must become the end game. The ultimate objective must include the devolvement of justice and policing issues to the institutions. That would mark a political coming of age in Northern Ireland. That crucial development could only take place in the proven absence of paramilitarism. Both can yet be achieved, but only within the parameters of the Agreement. Today the institutions stand suspended over an abyss. The life of the citizens of Northern Ireland is uncertain. They know the net will only hold for so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">I wish the Taoiseach well in his deliberations on this matter and hope he arrives at a position with the British Prime Minister whereby the pro-Agreement parties are called together at an early date. I hope a genuine attempt is made to rebuild the confidence and trust necessary to restore the institutions. I hope the parties involved, including Sinn Féin, will demonstrate that they are fully and absolutely committed to working through the Agreement to its finality to secure a peaceful life for everyone. I hope unionism shows trust and confidence in its own belief that it can live with power sharing for the future. The bar has been raised as a consequence of what has happened. A single small gesture will not be sufficient to restore the institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I wish the Government well. It will have our full support. The parties involved in this process must bring influence to bear on paramilitarism in all its forms in order to restore confidence and trust and enable the institutions, for which many have worked long and hard, to be set up again. People can see the benefits of the Assembly and the decisions taken by Ministers of the parties in the Assembly. That is what we want. It may be worthwhile reconsidering recommendations from the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. My party will support all efforts which will allow the institutions to operate again. We look forward to devolved government for the people of Northern Ireland which is supported by both Governments.</p>

          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</from>
          <p eId="para_671">I wish to share my time with Deputies Sargent, Joe Higgins and Finian McGrath.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The suspension of the Good Friday Agreement institutions by the British Government represents a temporary success for the anti-Agreement Unionists. Their strategy to block political change can only be short-term. They know this process will have to be revived and the Good Friday Agreement fully implemented. The current crisis does not date from the raid on Sinn Féin's offices in Stormont, but from the Ulster Unionist Council meeting of 21 September when the anti-Agreement forces in that party finally succeeded in having their programme adopted. That programme seeks the rolling back of changes which have taken place, the exclusion of Sinn Féin and the renegotiation of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">We in Sinn Féin, let Deputy Kenny note, are totally committed to ensuring the full implementation of the Agreement which was supported in referenda by the overwhelming majority of the Irish people. It must not be forgotten that the people of the Twenty-six Counties made very significant changes to the Constitution on the basis that the Agreement provided for an inclusive Executive, an all-Ireland ministerial council and all-Ireland implementation bodies. There is an obligation on the Government, therefore, to help ensure that these institutions are re-established at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">Sinn Féin is fully aware of its obligations under the Agreement which we have fulfilled throughout this process. All parties and both Governments must work to achieve complete demilitarisation and the ending of all armed groups. Both Governments, in particular, must ensure that a political vacuum is not created – I am sure the Taoiseach is noting these points. Last night's suspension of the institutions will do nothing to advance the Good Friday Agreement. On the contrary, it will serve to exacerbate an already difficult situation by providing anti-Agreement Unionists and members of the British establishment, including a large section of the security apparatus, with the impetus to attempt to row back even further on the Agreement. This must not and cannot be allowed to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">This is the people's Agreement. It is massively endorsed throughout the island. It is a contract achieved on our part and on the part of the Government in good faith. It involved compromise on all sides and had uncomfortable aspects for all parties. This was the nature of the Agreement and the long, drawn-out negotiations which led to it. John Reid, in suspending the institutions for the fourth time, has done the Ulster Unionist Party's dirty work. He has slavishly played out its threat to bring down the Executive if, as it demanded, my party was not excluded. He and his Government have joined David Trimble and the other nay-sayers in the Ulster Unionist Party to undermine an agreement which had already brought us a long way from the bitter conflict which preceded it. An internal Unionist battle for party political advantage is now being waged between the UUP and the DUP, with the Assembly and the Executive being used as the battleground and the destruction of the Good Friday Agreement as the ultimate prize.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Last night's suspension was never about Columbia, Castlereagh or the raid on Sinn Féin's offices in Stormont. It is, however, about bringing an end to changes that were required of unionism in respect of the Agreement. It is the reluctance of Unionists to share power and be part of real change that is driving their agenda to have Sinn Féin ejected from Stormont. For our part, I defy anybody to point to areas where Sinn Féin has not lived up to its responsibilities in relation to the Agreement. We have been one of the driving forces behind it. Our commitment to the peace process and the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement is absolute. It is a pity others have not been so committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The British Government must not be allowed to present itself as some sort of impartial arbiter. It, too, has responsibilities in all of this. There are a range of issues involving all aspects of the Agreement which are within its power and that of the Irish Government. The British Secretary of State, John Reid, in particular, has been slow to fulfil his responsibilities in relation to demilitarisation, policing, criminal justice and other matters. We need to know from the two Governments what they intend to do to address these matters. We need to know how they plan to honour the commitments they made yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">We are waiting to play a full and constructive role in re-establishing the institutions and having the Good Friday Agreement implemented in full. We need to focus on the benefits which have accrued from it in recent years. We need to be mindful of the fact that the situation in Ireland today is dramatically better than it was ten years ago and that by building on the progress made thus far, we can only improve matters still further. We know it is not yet a perfect peace. There are difficulties now and there will probably be more difficulties ahead. However, the reality is that the Good Friday Agreement offers the best and only way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">We all need to redouble our efforts to save the Agreement from collapse. We have worked too hard to allow Unionist party political interests and the British security services to destroy it. The Government must play a more robust role in defending the integrity of the Good Friday Agreement and in tandem with it we will not be found wanting in our responsibilities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_343">
          <from>Mr. Sargent:</from>
          <p eId="para_680">This is a sad day and we regret very much the return of direct rule of Northern Ireland from London and the abandonment of the democratic institutions, including the Assembly. I hope this is a short, interim period of difficulty. There is no doubt the Good Friday Agreement is a very delicate, if democratically endorsed, balancing arrangement which needs a considerable amount of nurturing and careful work by all sides at this point. In some ways, it is like an ugly duckling which we continue to hope will grow and blossom as intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">However, the danger in the Good Friday Agreement is that unless it is worked at and worked through, we will find ourselves further institutionalising sectarianism. To that extent it is important that both sides continue to be as generous as is humanly possible in the face of the difficult pills each has been asked to swallow. To an extent, each has been asked to turn a blind eye, with Unionists being asked to accept policing changes and demilitarisation, even if it is a long time coming, and republicans being asked to accept decommissioning. A large degree of tolerance and toleration is still required.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">It is very regrettable that we are in a position in which allegations and the future outcome of the deliberations of the courts are being prejudged. It is a sad day for democracy when the Judiciary is not given the time to come up with the results of its own work. In the political sphere, we need to get on with rebuilding damaged trust. In the absence of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which is understandable, it is important that this Parliament tries to fill the vacuum which has been created. As well as talking, there should be more listening to the different views and insights available on both sides of the House. We also require briefings of the Opposition. While I agree with the Taoiseach that such a polarised environment is not the right time for elections, neither is it a time for megaphone diplomacy. I hope he will agree to provide Opposition briefings, as happened when the rainbow coalition was in power, at times when difficulties are being confronted.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Internationally, my party has a very keen interest in finding ways of governing which do not result in the institutionalisation of sectarianism. While I realise politics is about the art of the possible, it is in some ways bizarre and ridiculous that parties in the Assembly, such as the Alliance Party, have to declare themselves to be from one or other side of the political divide. We should consider using more advanced forms of proportional representation, even to elect the Executive or the Assembly. We should examine ways of letting the people have their say, in as much as possible, in devising the structures that will make politics work.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">Many have spoken of the danger of a political vacuum. One does not want to overstate that, as such references often have a self-fulfilling prophecy. When there are apparently so many in the wings, dissidents on the loyalist and the republican sides, it is important we maintain a delicate balance between the over-reaction of a large-scale security response and the underestimation of the dangers of a political vacuum. I urge the institutions, in as far as they are still in place, to continue, in so far as possible, at official level in terms of strands two and three to highlight that what we have to date is a level of progress which we will cherish and build on rather than give up or allow to deteriorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">On a positive note, I ask the Taoiseach to indicate where we are in terms of continuing to build on the structures in place and of minimising the sense of rejection that currently prevails given that direct rule has been re-established in the interim. I wish the Taoiseach and the Government well in working at the coalface with the British Government and the parties in the North to re-establish the institutions that have been stood down. I ask the Taoiseach to consult the Opposition parties so that we can communicate and reflect on where progress can be made without having to issue statements and views through the media which may not be helpful.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins:</from>
          <p eId="para_686">I preface my brief remarks by saying that I have major problems with Sinn Féin's policies and strategies, but the armed police raid on the offices of Sinn Féin parliamentarians was a sinister development and an implied threat to democratic rights, and those responsible should be stood down.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">The Socialist Party, North and South, is not surprised by the collapse of the political structures in Northern Ireland. Speaking in the Dáil on 21 April 1998 on the first occasion after its signing, I stated that the Good Friday Agreement was fatally flawed as a mechanism for a permanent solution to the problems of sectarian division in Northern Ireland. Far from being an attack on sectarian division, the Good Friday Agreement institutionalised sectarianism in the structures that were put in place. It presumed a permanent division of communities. The Good Friday Agreement tried to straddle the fundamental contradiction where the Ulster Unionist Party regarded it as a copperfastening of Northern Ireland within Britain and Sinn Féin regarded it as a transition to a United Ireland. Both could not be correct. The institutionalised structures encouraged the playing of the sectarian card by the main protagonists on both sides to ringfence their core support.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">Meanwhile the Protestant population will never accept a United Ireland on the current basis and the Catholic population will never be reconciled to amalgamate into the British state. The political parties based on sectarian divisions are hopelessly unable to bridge these divisions, as are the British and the Irish Governments. The ripening economic policies pursued by the Executive in Northern Ireland based on privatisation and public private partnerships, the so-called private finance initiative, further undermine confidence in them among working people.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">Over the four years an intense process of polarisation of the communities has ensued. Demographic studies, which are set to point to an increase in the Catholic population, will merely add to this sense of insecurity among Protestants. The fear of the Catholic community, subject to attack by Loyalist paramilitaries, is very real, although there are attacks from both sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">There is an alternative, the outlines of which were seen in the wake of the savage murder of the young postal worker, Danny McColgan, when postal workers united and took strike action against that and when, on 18 January, 100,000 workers united. Protestants and Catholics took to the streets of Northern Ireland in revulsion at that sectarian attack. What took place on 18 January had an effect. For a period the fighting died down, the sectarian attacks and the attacks on public service workers lessened, but instead of developing a campaign in the workplace and into the communities, the trade union leadership let the movement dissipate and within months the bigots were back in operation and the politicians were able to put their sectarian agenda back politically centre stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">A bold independent policy and strategy to unite the working class is the basis of resolving the problems that confront them. That remains the only way for a fundamental resolution to sectarian division, which is at the core of the problems of Northern Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_345">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath:</from>
          <p eId="para_692">I welcome the Taoiseach's statement. Long before I was elected to this House I supported the peace process, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and the Good Friday Agreement. I am concerned about the suspension of the Executive. Coming from the Connolly tradition, I am concerned that we will allow a political vacuum to develop. The records were waiting in the wings and, therefore, I am not surprised that this happened. I caution that we are emerging from 30 years of conflict and it will take time to heal. I urge people not to panic in the short-term. If one reflects on other conflicts, whether in the Middle East, Asia or Africa, one will realise the healing process and the process of peace and reconciliation will take time. This is a time for keeping one's cool and for decisive leadership. Sadly, some of the parties in the North, such as the DUP, are not making a positive contribution, although I was heartened to see Gerry Kelly and Gregory Campbell in a discussion programme on television last night. That was a slight move in the right direction.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">I must point out inaccuracies in some of the statements made. From my contacts in the North, the majority – 95% – of the violence during the summer came from the loyalist section. From talking to people on the ground, I heard that this loyalist violence was often provocative in terms of trying to draw republicans into conflict.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I feel strongly about racism and sectarianism and put them in the same vein. It is important that we challenge the question of sectarianism, particularly in the Six Counties, in the same way that we are trying to challenge racism in the Twenty-six Counties. It is important to realise that the peace process belongs to us all and not only to Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour, Sinn Féin, the Green Party and the Technical Group. It belongs to the citizens of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I will not take moral or ethical lectures from John Reid or Mr. Haass on the question of violence, given their support for potential bombing in Iraq and issues such as that. Their job is to develop the peace process. When talking about a peace process, it is important to talk about making peace with one's enemies. I believe in my heart and from talking to different sides in the conflict that people are genuinely serious about the peace process. I believe strongly that Deputy Ó Caoláin, in making his comments, was speaking for the republican movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">We all need to take risks on this issue. People who do not do so have no alternative. If we want to fill the vacuum, we need to introduce legislation which would provide for representatives from the North to sit in the Dáil, as a contribution to the development of the peace process. I asked the Taoiseach a question on this matter recently. Disarmament is an issue, as is trust. I agree with the Taoiseach when he said that exclusion does not work.

The Labour Party strongly supported the vindication of rights of small parties in the House and continues to do so, but it is quite wrong that with 21 Deputies we should lose precedence to four spokespersons from parties smaller than ours, including the representative of a party with one Deputy. We must look again at the Standing Order. If there is to be an alliance of parties with a single spokesperson representing a number of Deputies, then so be it. The notion that the Labour Party should lose precedence to four consecutive speakers is not—</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_352">
          <from>Mr. Howlin:</from>
          <p eId="para_705">I do not think anybody envied the decision Dr. John Reid had to make this week. Suspension, in so far as it keeps the edifice of the Good Friday Agreement intact, was, by common consent, the least worst option. Despite the rhetoric of those primarily responsible for suspension, the republican movement and Unionists, they know this too. In Northern Ireland the blame game is everything. The republican movement will undoubtedly portray itself as the victim in this process. It is not. If it cared sufficiently for the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement, its military wing would have made far more progress in living up to its own obligations under the Agreement than it has. Many in the House are tired with having to harp on about decommissioning for which we have been calling for four years now. We heartily welcome, note and applaud every small step as an important contribution to the process and know that republicans successfully present our continued calls for decommissioning as in some way undermining the important road on which they are travelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">We know, too, that young voters do not see the IRA the way we do. Many do not recall the gut wrenching horror of the events of Bloody Friday or Enniskillen. They will not even remember Bono singing about it with rage and anger soon after the bombing. We recognise the attraction that a whiff of sulphur brings to politicians in an age where coalition building has become the norm. Even the memory of the Teebane atrocity when the IRA murdered eight Protestant workmen as recently as 1992 has been overshadowed, thankfully, by the peace process. It is a dynamic process that is shared by all of us who aspire to permanent peace on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">There are fundamental principles at stake. No political party is entitled to a private army. The IRA turned a civil rights campaign into a sectarian war. It killed, maimed and imprisoned. Now it has largely turned away from that path. By any definition, it has come a long way, but the brutality and thuggishness remain as recent events in Derry testify. The IRA continues to reserve the right to bully and intimidate its own community. Such behaviour and this kind of organisation have no role, function or place in the Ireland all of us are striving to build. The IRA should be stood down now.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">I believe the republican movement is committed to democracy, but playing by these new rules has proven to be a difficult learning curve for many. Gerry Adams's past may force him to use double speak, but his contribution to the peace process remains enormous. I do not believe he wants to go back to the days of murder and mayhem. He needs to go forward at a quicker pace. The Good Friday Agreement is not the property of republicans to be implemented at their pace and when it suits them. They regard the Agreement almost as their own to be offered its benefits, yet not be bound by all its obligations. The Agreement belongs to all the people of these islands. That includes decent Unionists who voted for the Agreement to bring about the decommissioning of weapons targeted at their community for far too long. Can republicans be surprised that Unionists are weary when this has not happened in the four years since the Agreement was signed? Republicans cannot be excluded from the peace process either. It has been built on the principle of inclusivity and it has been inclusivity that has sustained the republican ceasefire since 1997. Excluding republicans from government seems to be an end in itself for too many Unionists, sometimes it seems to be all that they desire.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">The current crisis in the peace process has two immediate starting points. The first is the recent arrest of republican movement officials for political and military espionage as evidence of increased IRA activity and the organic link between Sinn Féin and the IRA. The second is the decision of a few weeks before of the Ulster Unionist Council to embark on a policy intended to exclude republicans from the Northern Ireland institutions. Republicans have presented themselves as the victims, not the instigators, of their problems. It is an excuse to which they are absolutely addicted. As usual we have been given a lot of denials and no answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">The strength of anti-Agreement Unionism within the Ulster Unionist Party undoubtedly parallels declining support for the Agreement within the Protestant community. This should be of concern to us all. Growing confidence within the Nationalist community is perceived not as a vindication of the politics of inclusion but by a majority of Unionists as a threat. Unfortunately, since it was voted on over four years ago, there has been no great effort to sustain support for the Agreement within the Unionist community. At each and every stage the wreckers in the DUP and recalcitrants in the UUP have been allowed dictate the agenda. Republican concessions to the growing crisis within Unionism have been small and too late. Not surprisingly, Unionist rejectionists are more interested in what happens in the other community rather than their own. They feel no particular responsibility for the loyalist attacks on Catholic communities that have continued over the summer and make further IRA decommissioning more difficult to achieve. A deliberate attempt has been made to provoke the IRA back into conflict and it is to its credit that it has resisted that provocation, yet Unionist politicians react with horror at the notion that this is something for which they should take responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">As sections of their own community spiral into circles of violence and corruption, the indifference from both the DUP and the UUP has been staggering. Condemnations have been issued, but there have been no substantive efforts to get to grips with the crisis evident within loyalist communities in recent months. At least republicans have attempted to bring their whole community with them. Unionists' "nothing to do with us" attitude is simply not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The net result has been the collapse in trust between Unionists and republicans and once more the parties – such as the SDLP – and communities that dreamed of and sustained the Good Friday Agreement will pay the price, as will all the people on this island. A functioning Executive has transformed Northern Ireland and its relations with this State. It has been no accident that the island has seen a period of unprecedented prosperity and that Northern Ireland recently received the most substantial tranche of investment in its history. However, this success has not proved sufficient to enable people see the wood for the trees, yet it is also progress that cannot be allowed slip away.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">The farmers of Northern Ireland know the importance of having their own Minister for Agriculture to deal with their affairs. Our aim now must be to make this suspension as brief as possible. To achieve this will require substantial movement on all sides. I stated I believe the IRA should be stood down. All parties in the House should approve a motion to this effect and I commit the Labour Party to working with the Government should it wish to table such a motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">As Deputy Kenny suggested, the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation should be reconvened to restate our collective commitment to pursuing national goals by exclusively peaceful means. Substantial decommissioning should take place with immediate effect. There should be no more drip feeding – we want the real thing and all weapons decommissioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">It is time for republicans to end their brutal policies of policing, beatings and intimidation. It is also time for them to stop playing politics with policing in Northern Ireland. For their part, Unionists must realise that without republicans there is no peace process. They should stop hankering for the old days and dreaming of a deal with the SLDP that excludes republicans. They must also act on the crisis within loyalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Devolution has worked. It has been good for Northern Ireland and all its people. It must be restored as quickly and effectively as possible. We must recognise that this is a problem for Northern Ireland's elected representatives to resolve. Blaming Tony Blair or Bertie Ahern is a cop out. Neither man is responsible for the loss of trust that has us where we are today. Neither man was in Colombia, Castlereagh or engaged in shenanigans in Stormont. Both the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach support the restoration and full working of the Good Friday Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">To be successful though we must take brave actions. Extreme republicans and Unionists see the attraction in having a polarised and divisive electorate on the next occasion that Northern Ireland goes to the polls. They believe they will reap the dividend of an embittered electorate. Despite their assumptions, however, it is a strategy fraught with risks. The people of Ireland have rewarded republicans for their peace strategy. it is now up to them to prove once more that they are determined to pursue that strategy to its final destination. In the meantime, it will fall on both Governments to pursue the full implementation of the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Policing is an urgent necessity. The ham-fisted intervention at Stormont two weeks ago was clumsy and insensitive. However, the apology offered by the Chief Constable about the manner of the raid is evidence of the PSNI being held to account by those fully engaged in the policing process. Again, the SDLP, the backbone of the Agreement, should take some comfort in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">One of the most unsavoury aspects of the motion passed at the Ulster Unionist Council was the threat it posed to policing reform. Put simply, the changes agreed with the SDLP at Weston Park should be proceeded with by the British Government and it is the responsibility of the Irish Government to ensure this happens. Most importantly, Sinn Féin cannot have it both ways. An urgent crackdown on loyalist paramilitaries is necessary. This can only be done by the police and should be conducted with the support of the whole political community and that includes Sinn Féin. Progress should continue on the equality agenda. Work on the Bill of Rights should continue and the North-South dimension should be given life by the coherent working together, in a determined fashion, of both Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">This, the fourth suspension of the Agreement, is particularly sad. In recent months the Executive has shown drive and flair and achieved much. How this particular period in our history will come to be seen will depend on what happens from now, not what happened previously. All parties must again show their commitment to the only game in town, the Good Friday Agreement, and its full and speedy implementation. They should do so soon. Political vacuums are especially dangerous anywhere, but particularly dangerous in Northern Ireland. While not the sole authors of the difficult situation in which we find ourselves, that onus rests particularly on the republican movement. By any standards, substantive progress on decommissioning and the end of the reality and threat of violence are long overdue.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell):</from>
          <p eId="para_721">In the absence of the Tánaiste, I speak on behalf of the Progressive Democrats. I echo, not only the words, but also the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach who again demonstrated a sense of statesmanship and purpose which is badly needed. It would be easy for him to feel major disappointment and natural for him to apportion blame for his disappointment to other Members of the House or individuals outside it. It would also be easy for him to indulge in something that comes naturally to many of us when a political project into which we have invested major capital and patriotism on a practical basis stands suspended, namely, engaging in a process of recrimination, but he has not done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">I acknowledge that almost all of the contributions to the debate have been sensible and constructive. It is worthwhile recording that the majority of Members have spoken about the Good Friday Agreement as something of lasting value which it is our duty to sustain and reinvigorate.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The Taoiseach has stated on a number of occasions that whereas the Executive and Assembly may stand suspended, the Agreement does not. There are those who believe there is some alternative to the Agreement. I inform them that no such alternative exists or is on offer. Some feel they can, by withholding both their commitment to the democratic process in Northern Ireland and their willingness to stand by the expressed will of the peoples of both parts of this island and of these islands, force a radically different outcome on the Irish people. That is a forlorn hope. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, have indicated, not simply in recent days but over months and years, an absolute commitment to sustain the Good Friday Agreement. The commitment is not undertaken or shaken off in the light of this or that political event; it is an ongoing commitment which will not be deflected by events such as have caused the latest setback in the administration of devolved powers in Northern Ireland by the Executive and the Assembly.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">Some in our community believe – it is a tiny minority, but it exists and we must address ourselves to this fact – there is a future in paramilitarism, that the transition from paramilitarism to parliamentarianism envisaged by the Good Friday Agreement is not worth the candle, that there is a higher good to be served by violence and that there is a surer path to fulfilling their aims than the one set out in the Belfast Agreement. They believe that if they can destabilise the consensus which existed in Northern Ireland at the time of the adoption of the Good Friday Agreement, set back the clock and restart the semi-declared sectarian civil war, they will emerge the victors from that process. In doing so they believe they are not merely fulfilling their own political ambitions, but also keeping faith with an historical mandate they seem to find in events of nearly a century ago. Nothing could be further from the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Many speakers mentioned the obligation to avoid the emergence of a vacuum in Northern Ireland which would be exploited by the pedlars of sectarianism and the propagators of violence. Whatever we say in that regard, one thing must be made clear to anybody tempted to view matters through that prism. The two Governments stand by the Agreement, of which they are the joint guarantors. Central to the Agreement is an unambiguous, unreserved and absolute rejection of paramilitarism, violence and the like. The obverse side of that rejection is the endorsement of the principle of consent. I was pleased to hear Deputy Ó Caoláin say his commitment to the Agreement is absolute. If the principle of consent is accepted by the Sinn Féin Party – I take the Deputy at his word – those who reject it and believe in the principles of conquest, sectarianism or sectarian violence are a small minority indeed.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">That small minority might feel that in murdering a construction worker on a British Territorial Army base in Derry they are continuing a struggle of worth. There is no point engaging in the comparative or competitive rhetoric of reprehension against such acts, but anybody who thinks it achieved anything for Ireland is sadly mistaken. Anybody considering carrying out more such activities is also sadly mistaken. If they think something more spectacular could achieve something of value for Ireland or for their view of Ireland, they are equally mistaken. They are sadly mistaken, not just because they fly in the face of logic and history or because they are confounding anybody's sense of morality or decency, but also because they underestimate the will of the two Governments, the guarantors of the Agreement, to ensure such tactics will not be rewarded with success.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The Agreement is not suspended. There are huge opportunities to pursue the process of bringing about equality and equal treatment in Northern Ireland. They are not put in abeyance by the mere fact that the required degree of trust no longer exists, for the moment, for the continuance of the Assembly and the Executive. There are huge opportunities to show that ordinary politics works. The Taoiseach has pointed out that the British-Irish Intergovernmental Council is not some trojan horse of joint authority. It is what is provided for in the Belfast Agreement, the default mechanism where devolved powers are no longer being exercised. Through that mechanism the two Governments can demonstrate to everybody on this island, be they on the loyalist or republican extreme or people wavering on the edge of violence or the issue of whether to return to violence, that politics still works, that creating paralysis does not and that not implementing the Agreement is not to be rewarded with political concessions at a later stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">Those who believe – there are some – this is their opportunity should reflect again. This is an opportunity for everybody to reconsider where they stand. However, those who believe the impasse in Northern Ireland gives them an opportunity to drag that society back to the unfortunate history from which it recently emerged are profoundly mistaken. In the last analysis, the success of the Agreement is going to be copperfastened by the determination of the two Governments to ensure it succeeds. If its enemies, deluded as they are, think that by a reversion to violence they will "get lucky", to use a phrase used on one occasion with cold intent, they will discover that in taking that path they will become very unlucky indeed.</p>

          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell:</from>
          <p eId="para_730">We are dealing with two minorities on this island, the Nationalists, a minority in Northern Ireland, and the Unionists, a minority on the island of Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement and the process that emerged from it have set out a concrete way in which the hopes, ambitions and needs of both minorities can be accommodated.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">I acknowledge that Sinn Féin has, like other parties, made a contribution to the peace process. However, I must say something in a direct and, I hope, unprovocative way. That party arrogantly refuses to recognise the contributions of others. There have been significant milestones along the way – the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Framework Agreement – which are all brushed aside. It is most provocative and difficult to accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">I had the opportunity to study Irish politics at Queen's University, with a leading Sinn Féin strategy adviser, an honourable and decent man to my knowledge. I abhor the sight of what I call "Paisleyism". I am concerned about the activities of loyalist paramilitaries whom I condemn. They appear to be living in a time warp. It is sometimes difficult to conduct civil political exchanges with Sinn Féin. If one tries to be civil with it, one can find it is thrown back in one's face. It seems to mistake courtesy for cowardice. If we are to have real discussion and argument, we must start from a basis of mutual respect. As Deputy Howlin said, the real fall guys in all this are the SDLP, whose members have over a long period rendered a great service to the Nationalist community and the population of this island generally. The SDLP's representatives do not go around like Christ crucified saying, "Look at us, we are suffering and we have lost." They take it in their stride and have never taken a gun to anybody. Perhaps more of us in this House should speak up for the SDLP.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">I have some concerns about Sinn Féin which I would like to discuss with it. One of my concerns is the reason, four and a half years after the Good Friday Agreement was signed, the IRA is still in existence. I do not understand the reason that is so and would like someone to explain it. What is the extent of the spying in which Sinn Féin, allegedly, has been involved? Has it brought those activities to this House? I wonder about that when I see some of the allegations that have been made. While the jury may still be out on that matter, such thoughts are on my mind and the minds of others in this House, although they may not be expressing them openly.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">I do not wish to say anything that would prejudice the trial of those currently detained in Colombia. It is reasonable to wonder, however, whether members of Sinn Féin, their associates and the IRA were up to these activities in various jurisdictions. I have no way of knowing. I accepted in good faith all that was said when the Good Friday Agreement was signed. All my instincts tell me that they mean what they say, and I hope that is so. When one sees them doing things of this kind, however, one has to ask questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">It is extraordinary that Sinn Féin has taken a particularly strong line on the Nice treaty debate. Does this mean it now actually recognises Bunreacht na hÉireann, since it is seeking to change it? I would like to put these and other questions to Sinn Féin, and I am sure it would like to pose questions also.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Sinn Féin got a good deal from the Good Friday Agreement. Fine Gael is the second largest party on this island, while the Labour Party is in third position. Sinn Féin, however, is permanently in government in Northern Ireland and also represented permanently on the North-South Ministerial Council, in addition to having representation in this House. That indicates the rewards available for putting aside a violent, military past. We need to get things off our chests without having to listen to Mr. Adams portraying himself as a latter-day martyr. The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation should be reconstituted in order that all of us committed to the process begun by the Good Friday Agreement can have our say, as well as listening to one another and exchanging views in an attempt to engender some mutual respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">I wonder if Jeffrey Donaldson, David Burnside and others realise the sympathy they generate for their opponents, including the paramilitaries, when they engage in such gameplaying? Given the situation in which we now find ourselves, both Governments are determined, quite rightly, to ensure the Good Friday Agreement continues to proceed. We must ask ourselves, however, what sort of Ireland we, as Nationalists, would want and what sort of arrangements would we make if ever the consent of the majority in Northern Ireland was for the unity of this country. That is another issue the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation could consider during what I hope is an interregnum in the North.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">Sinn Féin cannot continue to occupy the democratic and paramilitary spheres. I realise the difficulties for the leadership of the republican movement, which I hope is in transition, but 1998 is a long time ago. We are now heading towards 2003 and it is time to retire P. O'Neill and get on with the democratic process. In the meantime I hope both Governments will advance the agenda on policing, decommissioning and demilitarisation as well as a Bill of Rights. Progress can be made in these and other areas towards implementing the Good Friday Agreement. I urge both Governments to press ahead with this agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">As Deputy Kenny suggested, both Governments should convene meetings with each of the pro-Agreement parties to address its full implementation. They should indicate that, although the institutions in Northern Ireland have been suspended, the Good Friday Agreement has not been. We will approach this situation constructively and seek solutions to problems. We look forward to the opportunity, which we hope the Government will provide, of an early meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in order that the concerns I and others in this House have can be discussed face to face, in a civil and respectful way.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">I am glad that this, the most significant topic concerning our island, has been placed on the Order Paper for discussion. I am disappointed, however, that more time was not allocated for discussing it. As a representative of a Border region, I realise its significance. While it may sound personal and parochial, I recognise the significance of the events of the past week in Northern Ireland. Some may call it Groundhog day syndrome whereby matters seem to be going well, yet an event may arise which causes problems. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others have been trying to stop the inevitable. We have witnessed the intense political activity, but it has proved impossible to overcome the current impasse. The outcome has been disappointing.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">It is obvious that there was a common commitment to the Good Friday Agreement and most parties were in favour of its full implementation. Devolved government in the North has now been suspended because of a breakdown of trust among the parties, with which the vast majority of people are unhappy. Devolved government should be restored as soon as possible in such as way that we will not have to discuss the matter further. The politicians of all shades involved in the Northern Executive are capable of making the Agreement work. We must help to restore the confidence and trust that will ensure they return to their ministerial jobs. They are good at this work when they get the chance to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The Taoiseach said a great deal was at stake. We have focused in this debate on the good effects of the Agreement for the Six Counties, but it has also brought benefits for the entire 32 Counties. It is terribly important for all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">I was born in Derry in November 1968, a city in which in later years I spent a lot of time with my mother's family. I encountered the permanent helicopter surveillance, the military presence and the Border security, although I did not live there. While I spent seven years at college in Belfast, I did not grow up amid the challenges of life presented in the various communities within the Six Counties. However, I did teach in areas central to tension and strife. I met children who had been caught in the middle and saw the impact they had. As I did not live among them, I cannot reach into the depths of the suspicions of the other side, a predisposition on both sides of the community. At a slight geographical remove, I have seen the scars, whether overt or unrealised, physical, psychological or economic.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">I have worked in a political capacity with various cross-Border groups for many years and understand what David Ervine said at a University of Ulster political meeting 15 years ago, long before the peace process had kicked in, that the issues affecting both communities are largely the same – housing, jobs and a secure environment for growth and day-to-day movement. As he said at the time, the problems of the nineteenth hole on the Malone Road did not affect one community or the other, but every other issue did strike a similar chord. This is a cross-party understanding. There are mutual beneficial advances that have happened in the past and can happen in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The suspicions will be difficult to overcome because they are so deeply rooted due to the segregation of communities. When one attends a political conference, one realises the extent of the lack of understanding, the sheer lack of interaction between one community and the other. There is a lack of understanding of the cultures from which people have come. This applies to a large number on both sides.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">To plug the Nice treaty, peace and reconciliation fund moneys have had a minor impact. It is an area of great potential. We should not underestimate the value of the European Union in this regard. However, issues such as the ongoing violence, whether overt or otherwise, drive almost impossible wedges into an already delicately balanced situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">The Good Friday Agreement led to the emergence of local faces who were going to try to solve local problems. A cross-Border group of which I was a member met Alfie Dubs and Malcolm Moss. I could give the House a litany of British Ministers who came and listened to us, patted us on the back and said we all came from different political parties from the Border area and were great to be sitting together. We did not want to be seen as sitting talking together; we were there with an agenda, with common issues which we wanted resolved. We were there as representatives of the north west region who had seen an east-west divide, whether in the Six Counties or the 26 Counties, and were on a common mission to resolve the issues. We were getting platitudes, but, without disrespect to the individuals concerned who were not from the area, they did not understand the area or have the same affinity to it which those in the Executive had.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">Tip O'Neill said all politics is local, although it is debatable whether it was he who said it originally. He is a Buncrana man, an area in which there are many sensible people. If we could get politics back to being local, where it should have been, it would be great. Personally, it was great to work with various Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">We must do whatever we can to get back on track. There has been success. In recent weeks a car ferry was inaugurated and 150,000 people came into the region over three months. That was not a lose-lose situation for anybody. Most political parties were engaged in active negotiations and all political parties were represented at the opening a fortnight ago. As everybody in the region sees the value of what has happened, we should leave no stone unturned in returning to the previous position. I hope all involved can get the Executive up and running again with haste.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford:</from>
          <p eId="para_750">I wish to share my time with Deputy Durkan.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">While I welcome this opportunity to make a few comments, I am saddened that we must discuss another suspension of the Good Friday Agreement and listen to so many involved, not necessarily in this House, in the blame game. The Good Friday Agreement was a compromise. Like any other agreement, it was not perfect. I had great difficulty accepting the fact that prisoners from both sides of the political and religious divide could be released, even though they had clearly committed murder in cold blood in church buildings and elsewhere. I had hoped arms and bombs would be given up. While the prisoners were released on time, both extreme groups, giving lame excuses for their need for arms, have still not given them up. There is no need for arms if democracy is what we desire.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">The Fine Gael Party has been committed to peace and generosity on both sides of the divide in Northern Ireland. Former Taoisigh, Liam Cosgrave, Garrett Fitzgerald and John Bruton, led the way towards talks in Northern Ireland. Recently Mr. Gerry Adams questioned the right of Fine Gael to ask hard questions and even my party's commitment to a lasting peace, yet in his next comment mentioned the name of George Mitchell, forgetting the fact that Deputy Bruton, as Taoiseach, was involved in his appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">All of the major parties in this House have shown commitment to each other and the people of this island in the hope of achieving a workable agreement on which great progress has been made. I, too, believe there is no going back to the bad old days. Over 3,000 people were murdered in 30 years of conflict while many more thousands suffered from fear, depression and sickness, often leading to early death.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">In recent years the Stormont Assembly and Ministers have shown how politics can work. The activities of Minister Bríd Rogers and her Department, working with their counterparts in Dublin, clearly showed during the recent foot and mouth disease crisis the benefits accruing to the island from this type of co-operation. I want to see more progress in the area of animal health. The restoration of the Ulster Canal is another truly cross-Border project, which, if the Agreement was implemented correctly, we could see working.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">First Minister David Trimble and Deputy First Minister Mark Durkan have shown what can be done in working with all of the parties. However, there are genuine fears. Protests outside churches and schools are not part of democracy. So-called Protestant groups murdering each other do not help either. The Colombia Three, spying in Stormont and vans in Bray containing sledgehammers, balaclavas and Garda uniforms do not create confidence.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">I welcome the statement by my constituency colleague, Deputy Ó Caoláin, that Sinn Féin is totally committed to the Good Friday Agreement and do not doubt his personal commitment. However, actions speak louder than words. We need to see real commitment on all sides to return to the drawing board. Certainly, my party and I are committed to working with the Government. I congratulate others on their efforts to bring about lasting peace.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_358">
          <from>Mr. Durkan:</from>
          <p eId="para_757">We are all saddened that we have arrived at this junction and express the wish that the peace process and the structures put in place, agreed and supported by the overwhelming majority of the Irish people, can be soon restored. The peace process and the power-sharing Assembly had been based on trust which must remain intact. All of the participating parties in the power-sharing Assembly must have trust in each other. There must also be trust between the respective communities. If trust is removed, there will then be a serious problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">Those committed to the peace process and the power-sharing Assembly in recent years have held the high moral ground. That is important. There is a danger, however, that some of that moral ground may well be eroded by what has happened in recent weeks, particularly in the past week. I appeal, therefore, to those involved to recognise that, when the process of democracy is taken on board, other processes must be left to one side. There is no sense in attempting to run the two in parallel. Neither is there sense in blaming those who raided someone's offices. The question automatically arises, "For what purpose was the information being collected?" It was not being collected for political purposes. It is damaging to the cause of nationalism and republicanism and power sharing.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">I appeal to all who pander to those who go along that route to think seriously about its consequences. We all know what I am talking about and I do not wish to exacerbate the situation. We must all give our full support to the Minister and the Government in the negotiations to ensure the process is brought back on track.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">To compare the current situation with that which existed seven, eight or ten years ago when there was widespread killing on a daily and nightly basis is ludicrous. There can be no such comparison. It is quite clear that there has been a huge improvement, but more work is needed. A price will have to be paid if we take our eyes off the ball for an instant or if someone decides to go his or her own route for even a short period of time. We hope the price being paid is only a temporary one.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_359">
          <from>Mr. Ferris:</from>
          <p eId="para_761">I welcome the Taoiseach's acknowledgement of Sinn Féin's positive contribution to the development of the peace process to date. I particularly welcome his recognition that we have undertaken, unilaterally, a number of initiatives aimed at building greater confidence among the Unionist community. I point to Alex Maskey laying a wreath at the cenotaph and acknowledging in a commemorative way the dead of the First World War.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Sinn Féin's efforts to build a relationship with the wider Unionist community have been ongoing for more than a decade. There are those within the Unionist family who do not want to share power with Nationalists. Unfortunately, they have been setting the agenda in recent years and trying to upset any chance of unionism coming to terms with the equality of nationalism within the Assembly and the institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Some of the commentary during this debate has been regrettable. I refer particularly to the contributions of Deputies Howlin, Gay Mitchell and Crawford. The commentary regarding people at present before the courts creating an innuendo of guilt is disgraceful. There was no mention from these Deputies about the proven collusion between the RUC-PSNI and loyalist-Unionist paramilitaries, which is a reflection on the inequality of their contributions. I vividly remember Deputy Ruairí Quinn speaking at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation when he stated the RUC was a corrupt and irreformable police force. This same force has been drafted into the Police Service of Northern Ireland, as it is now known, without accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">It is imperative for all of us to work collectively, as we have done in recent years, to ensure the Good Friday Agreement survives and is implemented in full. Sinn Féin will continue to play a positive and constructive role in bringing about its full implementation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs" eId="spk_360">
          <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Cowen):</from>
          <p eId="para_765">I am disappointed to have to address the House under these circumstances. Yesterday's announcement and the developments which gave rise to it have highlighted the fact that we are, once again, entering a period of difficulties in the ongoing implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. However, these difficulties are not insurmountable and the Agreement has not been suspended. It is still the only agenda, and I have every hope the Northern Ireland institutions will be restored in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">As the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair said yesterday, the two Governments believe it will be possible for the institutions to be restored "in a way that will last without further disruption once trust within the parties has been established."  The breakdown in trust between those involved will not be a simple issue to resolve. There are many layers of trust which need to be woven together on all sides and at all levels, from community relations at the interfaces to power sharing at the highest level.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">As the Taoiseach said, the great political strides of recent times have, sadly, been accompanied by decreasing levels of confidence in the commitment of some to the full operation of the Agreement. For that reason, it is essential that the transition to democracy, currently ongoing, be brought to completion. It is no longer possible for the use, or threat of use, of force or other non-democratic means to have any place in politics on this island. This transition can and should be substantially advanced now.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">Suspension is a serious development and not an outcome that any supporter of the Agreement would have wished for. However, in the absence of sufficient trust between the parties let us focus our energies on the extremely challenging business in hand. It is not in anyone's interest to allow a political vacuum to develop. Having brought the process to such an advanced state of progress, we cannot now renege on our responsibilities and let matters descend inexorably into stalemate. I need not remind Deputies of the dangers, as we have seen to our cost during the years, inherent in a political vacuum. Equally, we cannot simply allow the edifice of achievement the Good Friday Agreement embodies to be dismantled slowly, by a thousand cuts and erosions. The basic political fact of life is that the Agreement is the only sustainable basis for an accommodation that is acceptable, fair and honourable to both Unionists and Nationalists.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">In the years since the signing of the Agreement in 1998 and its endorsement by the people, North and South, we have begun to see its enormous transforming potential. If anything, we have tended to take that transformation for granted. Since November 2001, when the institutions were restored after the first act of IRA decommissioning, the Executive and the Northern Ireland Ministers have clearly demonstrated the potential of partnership politics based on mutual respect and equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The Executive, under the joint leadership of David Trimble and Mark Durkan, has achieved notable success, particularly since the IRA's move on decommissioning in October 2001, in bringing together representatives from both communities to work collectively with common purpose. The real politics which the work of the Executive represents made a substantial impact, with locally accountable Ministers taking decisions on matters such as agriculture, industrial promotion, health and education, which are of genuine importance and significance in the lives of the people of Northern Ireland. The successful operation of the Executive has provided incontrovertible evidence that the values underpinning the Agreement – partnership, mutual respect and equality – can be brought to bear in a meaningful and practical way for the benefit of both Nationalists and Unionists alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The Assembly has also been operating very successfully. It has proved itself to be a forum that can withstand robust debate on controversial matters. The seriousness with which parliamentarians from all traditions have taken on their responsibilities is laudable. Their contributions, including in committees scrutinising the work of Ministers and Departments, have been marked by commitment and diligence.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Meetings of Ministers from both parts of the island through the North-South Ministerial Council have become such a regular feature of ministerial calendars, North and South, that there is no adverse comment when they take place. This is because at these meetings Ministers from both parts of the island have been taking decisions that are benefiting all of our people in a practical and meaningful way and, in the process, promoting real partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Similarly, all-island implementation bodies have been established under the Agreement and have now been in successful operation for more than three years. They operate in sectors as diverse as trade and business development and food safety promotion and their practical achievements are many. The all-Ireland tourism organisation, Tourism Ireland Limited, is a model of sensible co-operation in a sector that is economically vital on both sides of the Border. The marketing campaigns of Tourism Ireland Limited are undoubtedly crucial to the well-being of the tourism industry throughout the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The Good Friday Agreement is the only basis for progress in Northern Ireland. We remain completely committed to its implementation and will continue to work in every possible way to achieve this objective. The two Governments, therefore, will again need to create confidence in the management of the process on an ongoing basis. Our agenda is clear: we need to re-establish trust on all sides, to safeguard the Agreement's achievements to date and to secure progress on the areas which remain outstanding. The bedrock of the Agreement is provided by the partnership of the two Governments, and this central relationship will continue to provide the underlying stability and support for the redevelopment of trust among the parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">One of the ways in which the two Governments will continue to co-operate bilaterally is provided for under the Agreement under strand 3 of which the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference was created. It allowed for the creation of the conference and its standing secretariat. The conference provides a platform for co-operation between both Governments on all matters of mutual interest. However, it particularly recognises the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland and the extent to which issues of mutual concern arise in that regard. The conference is tasked with meeting on non-devolved Northern Ireland matters, including <i>inter alia</i> the areas of rights, justice and policing. Meetings of the conference are to be co-chaired by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and it is our intention to meet in this format in the very near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">However, I emphasise that, contrary to some unhelpful speculation, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is not, by any means, a method for the creation of joint authority by stealth or a way in which power-sharing might be taken off the agenda in favour of an intergovernmental track. The conference provides a basis for the ongoing co-operation that will facilitate the two Governments in the management of the process until the restoration of the institutions. While co-operating through the conference, our ultimate aim is directed towards the full operation of the institutions, including the restoration of the Assembly and the Executive.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Both Governments are agreed that the North-South implementation bodies established under the Agreement and Tourism Ireland will continue. We will be working closely with the British Government in the period ahead to give practical effect to the need to ensure that these bodies can carry out their important functions. Since their establishment, these North-South organisations have flourished under the direction provided by the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive with more than 700 people now employed throughout Ireland in locations such as Enniskillen. Cork, Scarriff, Newry and Omagh. In a short space of time, they have become a vital part of the economic and social fabric of the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">In the critical area of policing, I share the Secretary of State's assessment of the Policing Board as one of the key achievements of the Agreement to date. Since its creation, the board has shown that it is capable of dealing with controversial and sensitive issues in a positive and cohesive way. I was therefore glad to hear that its existing members will remain serving on the board during the period of suspension, continuing their admirable work on the new beginning in policing. While much has been achieved on this issue, there is undoubtedly more to be done to bring the sought-after goal of a police service acceptable to all sides of the community to full operational reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">We regard policing as a core element of the Agreement and will continue to drive forward the agreed agenda for change, including the introduction of the additional legislation by the British Government provided for under the revised implementation plan. The progress achieved on policing through the Agreement should not be materially affected by the suspension and we will continue to work to move the agenda forward in the weeks and months ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">In the time since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement we have made great progress on a wide and comprehensive agenda for the benefit of everyone on this island. This does not mean that we should lose sight of the need to move even further down that road towards a full normalisation of society to make a clean break with those elements of the past which have no place in the new democratic dispensation.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The Agreement signalled the route map for a new beginning for a divided society. Yet, in recent times and throughout a tense summer, we have witnessed a persistent roll-call of events we all hoped had been consigned to the past – sectarian murders, vicious sectarian attacks, pipe-bomb attacks, punishment beatings and shootings. There is no place for such activities in a democracy. Continuing and effective policing reform is the best guarantee that the rule of law will prevail and that those responsible are made accountable for their criminal activities. Vulnerable communities are entitled to the protection of effective and consistent policing. Conversely, the Police Service of Northern Ireland, which undertakes that difficult task, is entitled to expect the support of all the community whom it wishes to serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">As we work to bring a speedy end to the period of suspension, we need to make continuing progress on other aspects of the Agreement where full implementation has yet to be achieved. In this category, for example, I cite the Bill of Rights for Northern Ireland, which has yet to be brought to fruition. In addition, in the area of security normalisation, there may be scope for further progress on the removal of intrusive installations without any negative impact on the capacity of the security forces to counter the operations of those who are determined to undermine the Agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">I wish to make clear to the House that the Government will be doing all in its power to secure an early restoration of the devolved institutions. Until the institutions are restarted, we will work in close co-operation with the British Government to re-instil confidence and trust in the process, to continue to operate all parts of the Agreement which can be maintained and to implement those aspects which remain outstanding. There is a legislative commitment to the holding of Assembly elections on 1 May 2003 and I look forward to those taking place. In the final analysis, it is the people of Northern Ireland who must give their verdict on the custodians of devolved government. I sincerely hope it will be possible to see a full restoration of the institutions before this milestone.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Side by side with the institutional developments, we will work to ensure the implementation of other aspects of the Agreement which have been delivering benefits to all the people, benefits in the areas of human rights, equality and reconciliation. These are essential in showing that the path of partnership and mutual respect can bring gains for all in demonstrating beyond doubt that there is more to politics than a zero-sum game.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The two Governments do not underestimate the responsibility or the challenge of working towards rebuilding confidence in each community, which is essential to the full operation and implementation of the Agreement. As guardians of the Agreement, we are willing to assume this responsibility and challenge, working in close co-operation with all the parties. With their continued will and determination, the ongoing welcome and valuable support of this House and the democratic authority that the Agreement itself represents, I am confident that the devolved institutions can be restored and partnership politics again made a reality for the people of Northern Ireland in the challenging period ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">If sufficient political will and courage is demonstrated, it remains possible for us to make the necessary quantum leap forward out of the present impasse. To achieve full implementation of the Agreement, everyone and every party in the process needs to embark on a rendezvous with reality.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_363">
          <from>Mr. Hogan:</from>
          <p eId="para_803">I am glad to have the opportunity in Private Members' time to address this important issue. The report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board was published in April of this year. The findings of that report brought widespread focus on the insurance sector and the prohibitive cost of insurance faced by business, consumers and young drivers in particular. Such was the level of public concern at the MIAB report that insurance costs became an election issue last May. There were a number of single-issue candidates who ran election campaigns based on reforming the insurance market in Ireland. When candidates run on a particular platform, it involves a serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Since May, I have heard alarming stories of small and large businesses facing closure or rationalisation as a result of rising employers or public liability insurance costs. Every month, each of us gains first-hand experience of, and exposure to, higher insurance costs, typically in the form of higher motor or house insurance premiums.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">We need only look at the figures. Household insurance was up 35% in one year, motor insurance was up 18% in 2001 alone, businesses have experienced a staggering 71% increase in their insurance costs and 20% of companies have reduced their workforce as a result of higher insurance costs. This is a major national concern that requires urgent Government action. It is particularly an issue for young people, companies in the construction sector, the hotel industry and the haulage sector, to mention just a few areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">Despite the public outcry about insurance costs, this is the first time this House has had a substantive debate on the issue of insurance and the report that was published in May. It is regrettable that this is the case in view of the difficulties experienced by many people. The problem has resulted in job creation in many companies. There have been many studies by consultants and promises of action but few hard measures to tackle the high cost of insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">The Tánaiste has rightly been recognised as an active and diligent Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Over the past five years, she has introduced many reforms across all sectors of her brief. The Tánaiste has been seen as reforming, challenging and keen to ensure that the interests of the consumer do not play second fiddle to vested interests content with cartels. Regrettably, on this issue she may have lost some of her reforming spark. She seems content to address the concerns of the MIAB at the speed of a slow bicycle race. Since the report was published, we have seen the introduction of flawed regulations, the establishment of further consultative studies and an unfortunate mix of prevarication and delay. On 18 June 2002, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment told the House that tackling the insurance crisis was her "political priority". The full implementation of the recommendations of the MIAB report, at the earliest possible opportunity, was identified as a key measure to tackle the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The purpose of this motion is to recognise the crisis in the provision of insurance cover in Ireland and, importantly, to debate the inadequate measures taken by the Government to address the key causes of the difficulties. We need to examine the background to the problems in the insurance sector. The effects of inflated insurance premiums are affecting every sector of Irish life. Motorists are being unfairly discriminated against on the grounds of gender or age. Young people do not have safe and controlled places in which to play, such as skateboard parks, as such facilities cannot be insured. Small companies are making employees redundant, as they cannot afford to pay exorbitant insurance costs while retaining a full complement of staff. Service providers are working without insurance, placing themselves and their employees at risk in many cases. Other businesses are including a surcharge for the expense of their insurance bills when quoting for projects. Banks are now insisting, in many cases, on evidence of insurance cover before giving clearance for overdrafts.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">In an ISME survey released last month, 46% of respondents said they were less optimistic about business prospects than 12 months ago. This is an increase of 40% on the response to the same question in the spring of this year. The sales order books of 45% of respondents to the survey are below normal levels for the time of year. One of the reasons given for this is that they are cutting back and reducing costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">According to another business organisation, IBEC, personal injury compensation now costs more than €2 billion annually. The organisation found in a recent survey that the profitability of 91% of companies had been affected by an increase in insurance premiums. A major impact was recorded in 48% of these cases. The employer and public liability premiums of IBEC's members have doubled, at least, since 2000. The cost of such insurance accounts for more than 5% of the payrolls of small and medium sized enterprises and for about 3% of the payrolls of larger companies. Alarmingly, 60% of companies stated that they had experienced difficulties in obtaining an insurance quotation. The Small Firms Association recently identified insurance costs as one of the major causes of difficulties among small firms. Such costs represent one of the major increases in payroll costs and thereby lead to job losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">In their pre-budget submissions, the social partners, including the CIF, the Irish Hotels Federation and the Irish Road Haulage Association, will make the case for decisive and early Government action on the issue of reducing the cost of insurance. In an economic downturn, small businesses can help to add buoyancy to the economy. The success of the Irish economy in recent years is partly due to the strength and support of the small business sector. If insurance costs are causing major problems for small businesses, there will be a reduction in their activity. The subsequent reduction in other costs will ultimately lead to a reduction in those companies' labour forces. Small businesses cannot survive with the constraint of high insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">Government inaction is at best allowing to continue, and at worse perpetuating, inefficient insurance practices such as excessive legal fees and a dishonest claims culture which is rife in Irish society and which should be tackled. A number of key areas requiring Government action are identified in the MIAB report. There are inefficient practices and a lack of competition in the insurance sector. A number of reinsurers have pulled out of the Irish market in recent years. Seventeen companies were licensed to deal with non-life insurance business some years ago, but now there are only five. This is worrying and will lead to a lack of competition in the marketplace. Companies are allowed to charge what they wish for many sectors of the insurance business. Excessive fees are being charged by professionals in many industries, such as the legal, medical and engineering sectors, and this has to be tackled. The high awards offered by the Judiciary will have to be examined. Society's attitude of accepting or turning a blind eye to fraudulent or exaggerated claims will have to be challenged through new legislation. We will have to make it less attractive for people to risk making unfair claims.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">The business sector does not have confidence in the Government's ability to tackle this issue. This results, in part, from the attitude of the former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Noel Treacy, at the time of the collapse of the Independent Insurance Company last April. A total of €23 million is still owed to Irish businesses that ended up with no insurance, through no fault of their own. Deputy Treacy asked the hotel and construction sectors to provide him with details of the extent of the problems caused by the collapse of Independent Insurance. He promised that their concerns would be brought to Government and suggested that assistance might be considered. Unfortunately, however, nothing has happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">I know from my contacts with the CIF that it went to a great deal of trouble to put together a dossier to help the Minister of State to bring proposals to Cabinet to resolve this issue which has caused a great deal of hardship to small and medium sized firms. I ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to follow up this issue and to prevent a further loss of confidence in the ability of the Government to deal with insurance problems. The Government did not seek to negotiate a settlement following the collapse of an insurance group that had entered the Irish market from the United Kingdom. Independent Insurance had a UK licence and had received a great deal of business that would otherwise have been done by Irish companies. It pulled out of the Irish market without considering the problems of companies who had to forego insurance in the short-term.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">The economy will be the first major casualty of the insurance crisis if action is not taken. This problem has been on the horizon for a number of years, but is reaching crisis proportions this year. It is not as if we were not aware of the extent of the problem before Dorothea Dowling's report. The inability of many small firms to pay their insurance costs, or in some cases to receive an insurance quotation, will result in problems in competitiveness on a global scale. This is no longer about a pending crisis, as the crisis is already here. Indigenous businesses will not be able to compete on a European or global stage if the playing field is not level. There has been a reduction in direct labour costs to businesses in recent years, following changes in the tax code, but there has been a massive increase in indirect costs, particularly in insurance, energy and telecommunications.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">In the ISME survey I mentioned earlier, insurance costs were the primary concern of 34% of businesses. This highlights the seriousness of the issue and casts doubt on the future prosperity of such businesses. About one in five ISME members has had to let go people. If we translate that, on a conservative basis, to the national level, it can be estimated that between 50,000 and 60,000 jobs could be in trouble because of the crisis in the insurance sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">Small businesses like Noel Barry Joinery in Cloyne, County Cork, are being hardest hit at present. Mr. Barry searched desperately for insurance for six weeks after discovering that the syndicate that had previously insured his firm had left the Irish market. The company's premium last year was £13,000 and while an unaffordable increase was feared, Mr. Barry had not anticipated non-availability of insurance cover. The company was shocked to find that many insurance companies practically laughed and refused to consider quoting for its business. Only days before the company was due to close its doors, rather than operate without insurance, the Barrys managed to secure insurance for a premium of €35,000. This represented a massive increase on the previous year's figure. Noel and his wife had to decide which two of their four employees to make unemployed, as they could not afford to pay both their insurance premium and the wages of their staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">One could question why Noel Barry Joinery had such trouble securing insurance. One might imagine that the company had a string of claims against it, or a questionable safety record. Noel Barry Joinery has never had a claim against it. These problems are particularly difficult for the Barrys as they had only recently invested in a state of the art workshop that could facilitate more than ten craftsmen, but which now has only three people working in it. Every week, the company has to raise an extra €525 to cover the cost of insurance, before beginning to consider wages, rent, machinery and other costs. Every new customer is made aware of this additional tax on the Barry's business, and every quotation that is sent out by Noel Barry Joinery has a 10% surcharge to cover insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Small companies such as this no longer have the luxury of competitiveness. Today they are only interested in keeping the doors open. Every week there are reports of companies shutting their doors since they can no longer operate within the constraints placed on them by significant insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">The Tánaiste will be aware of the formation of the Alliance for Insurance Reform, a business group which has been established for the purpose of lobbying on business insurance costs. It reported that in the past month two engineering firms in Cork had put more than 20 employees on protective notice because they could not obtain insurance. They will not go public with this problem. Other examples include a Kildare businessman who builds custom made kitchens and was about to sign a contract for delivery of 168 kitchens for a housing development in Cork but was instead forced to lay off his three employees. His insurance company also exited the market without notice and it was too big a risk to continue with an uninsured project.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">A small specialist garden furniture producer in Carlow was offered a contract that would require taking on four more employees, but the project was awarded to a company in another country because Irish producers are considered too high a risk to secure insurance. There is a small country business in the west comprising a forecourt and garage with a tool hire division. The latter provided 40% of the business income and this year no insurance provider would quote the company for this part of the business as it was considered too high a risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Jobs are being lost to other countries. One County Monaghan knitwear manufacturer followed a worrying trend when it transferred three quarters of its operation to eastern Europe two years ago. Every job lost becomes an additional burden on the State and every business which closes lessens the resilience of the economy on the global trading stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">This problem is not only confined to businesses. Inflated insurance costs have further far reaching effects on the quality of life of our people. Children have fewer opportunities to socialise in safe, controlled environments. A skateboarding park in Dublin and an equestrian centre in County Kerry both closed recently because insurance was not available. Westport House in County Mayo and a holiday village in Omeath, County Louth, may not open for the 2003 season. The latter complex has both leisure and hospitality facilities, but insurance cover increased from €62,000 plus €2,500 excess last year to €273,000 plus €6,000 excess this year, an increase of 440%. It is likely the leisure facilities, the most expensive part of the complex, will not be available next year. These are examples from everyday life that all of us come across on a regular basis and demonstrate the urgency required to address the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">On Friday, 20 September, the Tánaiste informed the national conference of the Insurance Institute of Ireland that the personal injuries assessment board would be established on an interim basis, pending the introduction of legislation required to put it on a statutory footing. I am surprised this has not been included in the Government's legislative programme for this session despite the Tánaiste's comment that it is a priority. However, she indicated she would bring proposals to Cabinet in the near future. It must be ensured in regard to the PIAB that another expensive layer of costs will not be passed on to policyholders by insurance companies. The PIAB must make a meaningful and real difference to the cost of processing claims, otherwise it should not be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The Tánaiste promised to reduce insurance costs, but her colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, introduced new court limits that might have an adverse effect on insurance costs when he was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. She also promised us measures to tackle the lack of competition in the insurance sector, but she has had political responsibility for this matter for the past five years. She did not gain responsibility overnight. She has also had responsibility for the approval of mergers and acquisitions since 1997, of which there have been many in the insurance sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The MIAB report noted that in 1996 four companies accounted for 50% of the motor insurance market while in 1999 three companies accounted for at least 67% of the market. Did the Tánaiste approve mergers between insurance companies? Did she refer such mergers to the Competition Authority? If the deals were subject to EU approval, did she make concerns known to the Union's competition directorate before such deals were approved? It is important that these questions are answered, particularly in the light of her Department's involvement in a study of competitiveness in the insurance market in conjunction with the Competition Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">With due respect to the personnel involved, I am deeply uneasy that the Department has a role in a study of competition in the insurance market. The Competition Authority was established independently and resourced to carry out such studies. Accordingly, the Department should not have a role. It has been suggested that from time to time the Department has suffered regulatory capture by the insurance sector and has taken its eye off the consumer's interest in performing its regulatory duties. I am sure I will be informed differently later. It is perhaps a case of poacher turned gamekeeper, but, increasingly, reinsurers are pulling out of the market while licensed insurance companies which have set up in Ireland with the help of the IDA and the benefit of tax breaks in the IFSC are refusing to trade and compete for business.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">What is most alarming about the MIAB report and the Government's reaction to its damning findings is that the current position might suit everybody except policyholders who are expected to fund the existing mess. Many of them earn extremely low incomes and need a car to keep their jobs. Many do not have the money to spare to fund the current inequitable and inefficient system. They believe the insurance sector is rotten and their welfare is the last factor taken into consideration by these large multinational companies. This is the primary complaint of policyholders who have witnessed insurance companies settle iffy claims in the past without consultation. Claimants who have an accident should be involved in the insurer's decision to settle or compromise proceedings arising from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">The finding in the MIAB report that attracted most attention when it was published was the conclusion that the claims cost of motor insurers in Ireland was among the highest in Europe and that they reported more than 11 times the post-tax profit of their UK counterparts between 1983 and 1999. This finding has conveniently been forgotten and the insurance industry and its representative bodies are happy to move to other issues that may suit their agenda. However, this issue must be tackled and there must be more transparency in regard to the claims cost of insurance companies and the claims reserve declared by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">A number of years ago the insurance industry lobbied successfully for the abolition of juries in personal injury trials and the removal of the two counsel rule. We were all assured that if these measures were taken, premia would be reduced, but the legal fees remained the same, possibly because the sole senior counsel doubled his or her fee. Within a short number of years, however, the industry was crying out for additional measures which it promised would reduce insurance costs. Insurance broker fees were even reduced by 50% in 1989 on the basis that insurance premia would reduce. I did not question this at the time because I had a vested interest, but I question that measure now.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">We need more than lip service to reducing the cost of insurance from these companies. If the Government and Oireachtas of the day are prepared to take measures to reduce insurance costs, we are entitled to ask insurance companies what they are prepared to do to reduce premia. An action plan with a timeframe for implementation is needed and insurance companies must play their part if the Government and the Oireachtas are prepared to do likewise in terms of health and safety, road safety and reducing the legal and professional fees associated with insurance premia.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">The legal profession must take a fair share of responsibility for the current crisis. I am disappointed, but not surprised, that the Law Society is unable or unwilling to engage with the MIAB, content instead to sit on the sidelines trying to sabotage the findings of its report. There is no doubt many lawyers have earned considerable sums as a result of a claims culture that has depended more on a weighty tome entitled, The Golden Pages, rather than a distinguished legal text. Policyholders have sometimes been encouraged to take spurious claims that insurance companies were all too ready to settle while ordinary consumers paid for this marriage of convenience between the legal profession and the insurance sector. A self-regulated profession, in tandem with a poorly regulated insurance sector, is squeezing the ordinary policy holder. To many, civil litigation is run for the convenience of lawyers with scant regard for the interests of the public. It is created around a web of mysterious costumes, phrases and fee structures designed to remove the system from the everyday experiences of the people who pay most for its excesses and inequities. The Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform should tackle this vested interest and establish a system of civil litigation that pays more attention to the needs of the 21st century rather than the anachronisms of the 18th and 19th centuries.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">This will be the true test of the Government's reforming zeal. It is important that the Government response to the insurance crisis is co-ordinated, effective and focused. To give consumers any confidence in her ability to address this crisis, the Minister must publish a specific timetable for the implementation of the outstanding elements of the MIAB report, detailing when each recommendation will be implemented and by whom; expedite the study she has initiated into competition in the insurance sector; remove her Department from that study and make it solely an issue for the Competition Authority; introduce jointly with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a programme aimed at reducing legal costs in Ireland; and encourage the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Attorney General to introduce urgent reforms to the system of civil litigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">The insurance crisis would benefit from examination by an Oireachtas committee. All may not be as it appears and the insurance industry, the legal profession and the Department all need to clarify their positions on this question, explain how this situation arose and help resolve all those issues for the benefit of the consumer. A committee is an appropriate means of investigating this matter and could model its work on the DIRT inquiry. In many respects the MIAB report would act as a book of evidence and be the basis on which we could get answers to difficult questions from key players. There is a public demand for such an initiative. Dáil Éireann should be seen to act swiftly.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">I hope the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment will introduce these measures as a matter of urgency. She will have the full support of the Fine Gael Party in doing so. By supporting our motion, and taking the steps we have outlined, the Minister can demonstrate her commitment to tackling this crisis. There is no time for any further wishy-washy actions and commitments. I hope the Minister will do this without any further delay or confusion, that she will redeem herself and her Department at this late stage, and get the shine back on her reforming zeal.</p>

        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_364">
          <from>Mr. Murphy:</from>
          <p eId="para_836">A major issue leading up to the election was insurance for young drivers and it remains a major issue. Young people still cannot get insurance and many people fear the loss of their jobs because many small employers cannot afford employers' liability insurance. Both Government parties were very strong on these issues in their manifestos and in the programme for Government. They knew the crisis was looming but failed to act. It would be reasonable to expect that a pro-enterprise party like the Progressive Democrats would deal with this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">The cost of insurance is causing the loss of jobs and is having a major effect on the competitiveness of the economy, something the Progressive Democrats Party and Fianna Fáil talk enough about when wage increases are mentioned. Many companies are now evaluating whether it is worthwhile to continue trading. If current trends continue there will be major job losses. Companies find it impossible to insure drivers who are under 25 years of age, causing problems for those that offer apprenticeships to school leavers. It is also a disaster for those young people who cannot take up an apprenticeship until they can get insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">The CIF surveyed its members and found that insurance rates rose by between 40% and 45% in 2001 and are rising at a much higher rate this year. The cost of employers' liability and public liability is particularly high for small companies, shopkeepers, building contractors and pub owners. For those who can afford to stay in business, insurance will add significantly to overheads, adding to inflation and, in turn, to job losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">It is nearly impossible for small builders to get adequate insurance that will allow them to work for any public body, private person or company grant aided by the State in any way. This will ultimately mean job losses and a severe shortage of contractors who can carry out work legitimately. Work will not be done or it will be done at severely inflated prices because of the lack of competition. It will particularly affect essential repairs grants for the elderly, the disabled persons' grants and the improvement works scheme for councils. It will result in risks being taken by people who find themselves with no other choice if they are to continue to make a living. It is very serious from the contractors' point of view but equally serious from the public's point of view. We are not talking about anything grandiose, but the carpenter and his mate, the plumber, the electrician, the stonemason and the cabinet maker all being prevented from working because of the Government's lack of foresight.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Insurance is now one of the greatest challenges facing community groups as they can no longer afford it. Most club activities will stop in the coming months as a result. Community halls will close. Gymkhanas and pony riding schools have no chance of surviving. Festivals, shows and outdoor events will be at risk. In my constituency a playground in Boherbue has already closed and many more, like Newmarket, will be closed in the near future if Cork County Council cannot take over the insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">The impact is particularly harsh in rural areas where there is no alternative to having a car. People must go to work and school but there is no public transport. The farming community is already facing a major crisis over increased costs and declining prices for their produce. Insurance costs are continually adding to this burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">Does the Government realise the seriousness of the crisis? The problem in the insurance sector will add significantly to the economic crisis we already face. Action is needed now to get immediate results. We cannot spare any time in trying to solve this problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_365">
          <from>Mr. Naughten:</from>
          <p eId="para_843">Motor insurance has increased by at least 40% in the current year for commercial motor fleets and by up to 80% for young drivers and haulage firms. A 22 year old named driver with a full licence will see his insurance increase from €500 to €2,000 in the current year. It is common now for young drivers to get quotations of up to €5,000. As Deputy Murphy said, it is not an option for young people in rural areas to have a car; it is a necessity if they want to go to work because there is no public transport. The insurance industry has already told us that similar increases are on the way in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">This issue could be addressed by looking at road safety and the carnage on our roads. What has the Government done on this issue? This year, it has reduced the funding available for road safety initiatives and for the NRA to improve dangerous sections of roads by 20%, a reduction of €3.8 million. The road safety strategy published by the Government in 1998 is now a disaster; it is two years behind schedule. When the new road safety strategy is launched that there will be no timetable for its implementation because the Government has been embarrassed by its failure to meet the timetables set in the current road safety strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">The Government's greatest achievement in terms of road safety in the last five years was to ban the use of mobile phones in cars. We all know how that initiative finished up. It was the greatest cock-up in road safety history and the Minister must redraft the legislation after making a joke of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The National Roads Authority is unaccountable to this House and polices itself in relation to upgrading roads where they cause accidents. The condition of roads is never considered by the NRA to be a contributing factor to an accident, yet many people tell of black spots where there has been a litany of accidents. To further compound matters, the Garda is fighting for road safety with one hand tied behind its back. Traffic units are hampered and using them to generate cash for the State is not addressing road safety. They are treated as a cash cow by the Department of Finance. Traffic accidents cost ten times more than crime each year, but the Garda traffic units are under-resourced and frequently switched to other duties. Too many of the units are working with too few gardaí in old vehicles and without sufficient computer and clerical support which are the key issues in relation to the penalty points system. The Department of Finance consistently failed to provide the Garda and the Department of the Environment and Local Government with the resources to introduce the penalty points system on schedule on 1 January 2000. We await it still, while the Minister proposes to implement an <i>ad hoc</i> proposal which it is doubtful would stand up if challenged in the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">We allocate 4% of Garda resources to traffic duties compared to 9% in the UK. Traffic accidents cost the State approximately €700 million annually and there is clear evidence that many people drive unsatisfactorily. The only way to address that is to ensure proper policing to encourage people to abide by the rules of the road. The establishment of a statutory driving instructors register is fundamental to ensure young people are properly trained and have the skills to drive. With the legislation we have in place, I could go out in the morning, put a sign on the roof of my car and become a driving instructor. If the same thing happened in our schools with unqualified teachers training students to sit the leaving certificate examination there would be a public outcry. Yet, we allow young people to sit behind the wheel of a car without providing structure and training for them or the instructors who are supposed to impart driving skills to them. Out of every 20 people who sit the driving test, only nine pass it first time and the result sheet those who fail receive is double Dutch, leaving them with no understanding of why they have not succeeded. Surely, in this day and age we can ensure that a person's failure is explained because they cannot improve unless they know what mistakes they have made.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">In their manifestos, the Government parties proposed measures to address this issue which were lifted from the Fine Gael policy document of August 2000 when we appealed to the Government to implement them, though nothing was done. While the Tánaiste has made numerous proposals relating to the personal injuries assessment board, announced two years ago by Deputy Treacy, nothing has happened. In the programme for Government there is a list of things to be tackled in relation to the cost of insurance, but going by the road safety strategy we have looked at today it will be another seven or eight years before any action is taken and the issue of insurance is properly addressed. The Government has talked the talk but has not been prepared to commit to introducing legislation to address the cost of legal fees, bottlenecks in the system and to ensure competition in the marketplace. This evening, the Tánaiste will describe the initiatives she proposes, but the critical issue is when they will be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">Inflation is a huge issue again and one of its implications is for the cost of transport. Haulage firms are being put off the road by the massive insurance costs they face. Some have closed and many have scaled back. There are sectors of the industry which have not seen price increases since the 1970s and to compensate for that they have improved efficiencies by increasing the size of loads and the height of trailers. Last week, the Taoiseach told the House that he is going to ban such high trailers which is his solution to the cock-up we have made in the Dublin Port tunnel. The circumstances elaborated upon in relation to business by Deputy Hogan are arising again and I hope the Tánaiste will set out what she will do over the next couple of months to address the issue.</p>

          <p title="amendmentProposal" eId="para_850">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p eId="para_851">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_852">"recognising:</p>
          <p eId="para_853">– that the major determinant of the price of insurance in Ireland is the cost of personal injuries claims;</p>
          <p eId="para_854">– the proportion of the cost of claims accounted for by legal and other professional costs; and</p>

          <p eId="para_861">– notes the enhanced activities of the Health and Safety Authority and the decline in the frequency of workplace accidents."</p>
          <p eId="para_862">To prevent Fine Gael losing the five minutes the party generously gave the Minister for Foreign Affairs at the end of the last debate, I propose to take 25 minutes. I wish to share time with Deputy McGuinness.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">I thank the Fine Gael party, Deputy Hogan and his colleagues, for tabling this motion and I accept that we are facing very serious circumstances with regard to the cost and availability of insurance. Like every public representative, I receive a constant stream of representations from individuals and businesses facing huge increases in premiums or, indeed, facing difficulties in getting cover at all. This is happening in all areas of the insurance market, from motor insurance to employer liability to public liability insurance. Increased insurance costs constitute a major threat to the existence of many small and medium sized companies and have serious ramifications for the economy in general. There have already been job losses. A recent ISME insurance survey indicated that 96% of small businesses have experienced an average 71% increase in insurance costs while one in five companies has reduced its workforce, primarily as a result of insurance increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">An Agreed Programme for Government contains a comprehensive set of actions to address the rate of injuries and deaths on our roads and to tackle the high costs of insurance, particularly motor, personal and employer liability. These include measures to improve road safety and driver behaviour, reduce the legal cost of accident claims and to make the insurance market more consumer friendly. The emphasis is on a co-ordinated set of actions across a range of Departments. We have had excellent analysis of the reasons for our high insurance costs, particularly by the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, and the focus must now be on action. The establishment of a personal injuries assessment board must be accompanied by improvements in court procedures and I welcome the proposals for reform of the Bar Council and the Incorporated Law Society. In particular, I will work closely with the Ministers for Transport and Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that we move forward with a series of co-ordinated moves, our objective being to ensure a fair and efficient compensation system that in no way penalises the victims of accidents. The interim board of the MIAB will enter into constructive discussions with interested parties to achieve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">I acknowledge the difficulties faced by the insurance industry including the high level of claims and awards, poor returns on investment and difficulties in obtaining reinsurance. The report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board, published on 17 April last, is the most comprehensive study and analysis of our motor insurance industry ever undertaken and provides a sound basis for addressing the problems we are experiencing in the insurance industry. Its analysis, conclusions and recommendations extend to other areas of liability insurance and it contains 67 recommendations covering a broad spectrum of activities which impact on the market. This was the first Motor Insurance Advisory Board to secure access to insurers' raw data on premium income and claims costs on which detailed analyses are presented in the report. It pulls no punches in contending that vested interests and inefficiencies may collectively account for as much as half the premium paid by the law-abiding motorist. The MIAB further confirmed that the cost of insurance is determined by three main factors, including frequency and severity of accidents, cost of claims within the current compensation system and the operation of the insurance market. These factors have to be tackled to achieve better value for money for policy holders. While there is clearly room for significant improvement in our safety record, there have been improvements in road safety and workplace safety. In addition, the proposals by the Minister for Transport to introduce a penalty points system for speeding offences later this month should further contribute to less carnage on our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The following are some of the major findings in this report. Motor insurance premiums in Ireland comprise 1.6% of GDP. Litigation costs, including legal and expert fees, add 40% to every €1 paid in compensation for injury sustained in motor accidents.Young male drivers aged 17 to 20 years on provisional licences produce substantial insurance losses. They are involved in many accidents resulting in the most serious of claims at a frequency which is disproportionate to their representation as policyholders. Charges for young female policyholders are not justified by their claims costs and these policyholders have been described by insurers as subsidisers.The consequences of uninsured driving are becoming more acute with the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland estimating that they add 8% annually to the costs of claims in the aggregate motor insurance market. The market for private motor insurance is not competitive, a situation which is compounded by the fact that motor insurance is compulsory, thereby limiting the usual market forces dictated by consumers. The level of mergers has reduced 17 separate motor insurers in 1993 into just five companies in 2001, some of whom moreover operate under various product images without the identity of the insurer being apparent to our customers. Vested interests and inefficiencies may collectively account for as much as half the premium paid by the law abiding motorist.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">The Government decision on the MIAB report provided for the establishment of an implementation group to immediately progress the recommendations and report to Government. The group comprised senior personnel from the responsible Departments and representatives of IBEC, the Consumers' Association of Ireland and the chairperson of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. The group examined each of the 67 recommendations. Departments submitted individual action plans with related target timeframes that specified the measures needed to give effect to the recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The resulting action plan will provide a precise road map for implementation of the recommendations contained in the MIAB report. This will include identifying the stakeholder responsible for delivery of each recommendation, a statement of the timeframe for implementation and, most importantly, a projection of the expected impact on claims and premiums. The action plan will be brought to Government by the end of this month and will then be published immediately. The plan will focus on improvements to court procedures, the provision of greater information to the consumer and implementation and enforcement of the Road Traffic Acts. It is my intention to oversee the implementation of the action plan in co-operation with a number of colleagues in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">The MIAB was essentially concerned with motor insurance, but the recommendations also relate to other forms of insurance and to the public and employer's liability market in particular. A number of the recommendations of the MIAB report have already being implemented. The motor insurance regulations for 2002 deal with a minimum period of notice for renewing motor insurance policies and the format of the no claims bonus certificate. I will deal later with the joint Competition Authority and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment consultancy study on competition in the insurance market. The Irish Insurance Federation has implemented, or is in the process of implementing through codes of practice, a number of other recommendations. These recommendations relate to such matters as giving reasons in writing for refusing a quotation, recognising the driving experience of retired drivers who have a record on their employers' fleets, rating policies based on accident free driving rather than risks based solely on age and desisting from the practice of requiring collateral insurance business to be placed with the company before supplying a motor quotation. The IIF is also at an advanced stage of negotiations with IBEC on claims settlement guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">One of the major recommendations of the MlAB was for the establishment of a personal injury assessment board. The PIAB will be established on an interim basis pending the enactment of the legislation required to put the board on a statutory footing. I expect to name the members of the interim board within the next month following Government consideration of the report of the implementation group on the PIAB. The board will concentrate on building relationships with interested parties and on establishing the database of court awards in compensation cases and on other preparatory work so that the statutory board can hit the ground running once the legislation is passed.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">Establishing the database of court awards in insurance compensation claims will be critical to the work of the statutory board when it becomes operational. The PIAB is not designed to reduce levels of compensation, as has been unhelpfully suggested in some quarters. The board will instead bring about reductions in the cost of delivering compensation. This will reduce insurance costs, while hugely benefiting the policyholder.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">In connection with the cost of delivering compensation, I would like to put on record the figures contained in the report of the Motor Insurance Advisory Board. The board found that for motor third party personal injury non-compensation costs as a percentage of compensation costs was 39.5%; non-compensation for employer's liability as a percentage of compensation was 45.9% and for public liability non-compensation as a percentage of compensation was 56.4% in the year 2000. These levels are clearly not sustainable and the objective of the PIAB is to reduce them.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">l am concerned about competition in the insurance industry and the Competition Authority and my Department are sponsoring a study to examine the key areas of motor, employer's liability and public liability insurance to see if there are any anti-competitive practices or constraints on competition. Reaction from interested parties is now being sought on the proposed scope of the study, that is, motor insurance, employer's liability and public liability insurance, and the approach to be taken. Following the period of consultation, the terms of reference will be finalised. The scope of the study is being limited to motor, employer's liability and public liability insurance in order to reach useful findings and recommendations on those key areas in a reasonable timescale. However, if consultations reveal particular synergies arising from the inclusion of other non-life insurance, for example, home, commercial property, professional indemnity and personal accident and travel, consideration will be given to the terms of reference. As regards the approach to be taken, issues relating to rivalry between companies and barriers to entry will be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">With the establishment of IFSRA we are moving into a new era of financial regulation which will contain an effective mechanism to balance the legitimate concerns of consumers with requirements for effective solvency supervision. Solvency supervision is still important. We do not want a repeat in Ireland of the collapse of Independent Insurance in the United Kingdom. IFSRA will be concerned with both prudential and consumer protection for all financial services. The legislation charges IFSRA as a whole – its board, statutory officers, senior management and job holders – to have regard to consumer issues. The IFSRA statutory consumer director post will be the consumer's financial advocate. The director will be responsible and accountable to the Oireachtas, will prepare a strategic plan and will also be concerned with the education of the consumer. We will also see with the establishment of IFSRA increased dissemination of information of interest to the consumer in making a choice on purchasing insurance products.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">The actions I have outlined constitute a comprehensive approach to addressing problems that have developed over the years in the Irish insurance market. I intend to pursue them with vigour and seek a similar commitment from other actors in the market. When addressing the annual conference of the Insurance Institute of Ireland last month, I indicated that we would be expecting reductions in premiums to follow from the Government's comprehensive action programme. The insurance industry's response will be carefully monitored. The acid test will be in the impact felt in the consumer's pocket and on the bottom line of individual enterprises.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMcGuinness" eId="spk_367">
          <from>Mr. McGuinness:</from>
          <p eId="para_876">I welcome the initiatives taken by the Minister in this important area. I commend her for taking an interest in the insurance industry. During the last Dáil the Committee on Enterprise and Small Business did a lot of work in this area. While we engaged with the insurance industry at many meetings during that time, we received little co-operation. The information we got from the industry was often misleading. The committee examined several reports in great detail. The findings of one of these reports almost entirely contradicted those of another, and the information available to the Department at the time contradicted that given to the committee. Looking back, very little was achieved despite the many hours members of the committee spent considering the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">As far back as 1977 insurance for young drivers was a significant issue. While the market has changed considerably since then, an examination of the role played by the insurance companies in the investment markets shows no indication that matters are improving. Their market performance shows a marked decline in their return on investments. I have no doubt, therefore, that we will see increased insurance premiums in the next 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">Insurance is the biggest issue threatening growth in the economy. I am aware of companies which have failed to get their insurance renewed. Companies involved in a range of activities, in my constituency and elsewhere in the country, have faced difficulties getting their insurance renewed or have been forced to pay substantial increases in their premiums. To highlight the type of problems companies have experienced with the insurance companies, I will quote from a letter I recently received from a constituent:</p>
          <p eId="para_879">My broker invited renewal at a certain premium and I then went round the market to see if I could improve on it. In every case, I was asked who was the holding insurance company. When I asked why they needed to know that, I was told that they could not offer a better quote than the renewal premium offered by the holding insurer, even though they had access to better rates from that office. They would only offer the better rate to someone who was not already insured with the holding office. Further, they all confirmed that if they offered a rate and it later emerged that I was already insured with that office, they would withdraw the offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">That is the type of activity occurring in the marketplace. On joining the European Economic Community, everyone presumed there would be competition in the insurance market and we would see a levelling out of the insurance premiums being paid. That has not been the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">In terms of the transport industry – here I declare an interest – insurance premiums have gone through the roof to the extent that a leading national company recently closed its doors after refusing to renew its insurance at the premium on offer and having failed to find another company which would offer it insurance. Transport operators are being attracted to go with a company based in the United Kingdom by an offer of a 7% reduction in premium if they switch. As the company in question will not guarantee that current levels will apply in the years ahead, companies accepting the offer could be left high and dry after two or three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Recent increases in the insurance premium for my local authority, Kilkenny County Council, resulted in a dramatic reduction in all council activities, in other words, a massive cut in services. Significant increases in premia for local authorities will have a negative impact on economic development this year and there is every indication that the same will apply next year. We will be in serious difficulty because small businesses have cut back on their activities or staff levels to cope with the increase in their insurance costs. The problem is beginning to impact on every business in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">In recent months the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland conducted a survey which indicated that the most significant problem facing small businesses was the fact that they could not determine their insurance premia from year to year. Every day officers at county enterprise board level are dealing with the problems small businesses face as a result of their inability to meet the costs of renewing their insurance. Some operators in the small business sector in my constituency have no insurance cover for their factory because they cannot afford to renew the premium. Faced with the choice of closing up or continuing without insurance, they opted for an extremely dangerous route.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">While I welcome the various initiatives taken by the Minister, I remind her that time is pressing. There is no business in the current environment which can continue to develop and retain its workforce in a climate of uncertainty. It is critical that the action taken has an immediate impact on the marketplace. It is also necessary to engage with the insurance companies, which also face difficulties. I do not want the number of companies operating here to decrease again. There are only five real players in the market and it is important that they are kept on board. If possible, the Minister should act to attract other companies to enter the Irish market in order to ensure we have real competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The Minister referred to the legal profession. There are problems with the way in which cases proceed through the courts and the legal costs associated with taking claims. It is unfortunate that the high cost of fighting claims through the courts means that the insurance industry finds it preferable to settle claims out of court. Insurance companies openly admit that they do not proceed in many cases despite having an extremely good chance of winning and thus exposing the fraud in our culture which allows people to take such cases. If this issue is not addressed, we have no hope of attracting foreign insurance companies to enter the market. They are all very aware of our legal system.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">In addition to the 67 recommendations, which I hope will be considered quickly by all the Departments concerned, it will be necessary to take on the vested interests in the legal profession and deal them a blow which would create a fairer, easier system in which insurance companies will consider it worthwhile to contest claims. If we do not take the full range of measures described and fail to change the system by which claims are processed in the courts, we will continue to struggle and Irish companies will continue to be penalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">The transport industry is essential for the importation and distribution of goods. In many cases the additional cost of the new insurance premia have not yet impacted on the companies it serves. The increase in insurance premiums, when passed on – the companies concerned have no option other than to do so – impacts on the market. The cost of services increases, the cost of goods being delivered to the marketplace increases and consumers have to pay more for products. We are all aware of the increase in the price of goods here. Insurance costs will add to those prices, causing serious problems for our economy, which faces a challenge over the next year or more. I encourage the Minister to take action in the short-term and, if necessary, to use the committee structure of these Houses to engage with the insurance companies concerned to strike a better bargain for everyone.</p>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan:</from>

        <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_370">
          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan:</from>
          <p eId="para_890">There is not a person who would not agree with this motion, although I would add to it in two respects. First, while the Motor Insurance Advisory Board's report is welcome, direct and honest, some of its recommendations do not go far enough. I call on the Government to examine other possible solutions to this undoubted crisis. Second, the motion is deficient in that while it condemns the Government for its failure to tackle the crisis, it does not state that it is responsible for the crisis. The issue is that not only did the Government not tackle this crisis, it is part of the cause of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">I particularly target the Minister's party in being part of the cause of this problem. The complete deregulation or lack of State regulation in this crucial market has led to the current state of affairs. The Progressive Democrats would openly say that they do not believe in regulation of the market. They believe in letting business people at it and that market forces will deliver. That is what has been done in this instance. The various sectors of the market have taken that opportunity, in effect, to increase their profits at the expense of the public and the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Prior to being elected to this House I worked in a small company that traded internationally. Our insurance costs were five or six times those of our competitors in neighbouring countries, which greatly affected our competitiveness. The founder of the Progressive Democrats, Des O'Malley, was active in this area. He opened up advertising for lawyers, which has played a significant role in the way litigation business has developed. One need only open the Yellow Pages and note the 30 to 50 pages of companies advertising for litigation business, one can only guess at what cost, to get a fair indication of what is happening in the litigation business.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">Some legal friends have put the case that litigation business has its benefits. It acts as a regulator in ensuring business maintains certain safety regulations or people display caution in various aspects of life due to the legal challenges taken in regard to poor practice or damages, and that is a valid argument. Any reasonable judge having regard to how this area of litigation has developed would agree that this development has gone from a controlling role which the legal profession could beneficially provide to one where the legal profession is mainly concerned about maintaining its profits. It is important the Minister takes on this profession. Tinkering with the system, which is what I believe the Law Society and others are suggesting, is not the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">The Minister very much espouses competition and is trying to break up monopolies and cartels where they exist, but I blame her and her colleagues in the Progressive Democrats for allowing insurance companies to change, under her watch, the nature of the insurance industry. From my experience – I can only speak from that viewpoint as I have not done a scientific analysis of the position – a small number of companies operate in a manner in which there is not free competition or freedom of choice. I found it incredibly difficult to get motor insurance quotations and a number of people have had the same experience. The Minister is responsible for this area and questions must be asked about why that was allowed to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Insurance companies do not have an interest in lowering premiums as long as they maintain their profit margin, which is a matter of concern. Higher premiums do not affect them, they affect their customers. The insurance industry has benefited from rising insurance premiums in recent years. Its concern was to maintain its profit margin, and it did so with a much larger revenue stream.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Another reason for increased insurance costs relates to the medical profession. The Minister needs to be strict and strong in terms of how that profession is brought within the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">I argue that the Minister should examine options such as the no fault insurance system, which operates in Australia, Canada and other countries. Tinkering with the system will not make the difference that is needed. I favour a no fault insurance system as the way forward.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_371">
          <from>Mr. Crowe:</from>
          <p eId="para_898">There is common ground on this issue in that we all want to see some movement on the problem. I welcome the fact that the Minister talked about taking action on this issue, but the view of the public, particularly young people trying to get car insurance, is that there has been very little action on it. A taxi man told me last night that he was involved in an accident last year through no fault of his and following it was quoted an insurance premium of €11,000, as a result of which he will no longer be able to afford to work as a taxi driver. We have all heard of young people being quoted crazy insurance premiums such as €7,000 to €9,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">We all welcome the MIAB report and its recommendations, but the public will ask when will its recommendations be implemented. We welcome the fact that the issue of insurance costs is included in the programme for Government. The Minister spoke about the PIAB and about a committee being set up in the next month. That represents some movement in dealing with this issue. A former Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, spoke about setting up such a board a year ago. People want action on this issue because they are being ripped off. The MIAB report clearly states this is the case. We want an impact immediately in terms of addressing this issue. We do not want to talk in terms of another report and some other development down the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">I am aware of a 46 year old man with a clear driving record who got 17 insurance quotations last year which varied from £480 to £1,158. The premium quoted seems to depend on the mood of the person in the company. If the person concerned has had a bad day, he or she may quote a potential customer a crazy premium.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">Many speakers referred to increases in insurance premiums. The reason given for the increases is the number of insurance claims being dealt with in the courts. Others factors include the lack of road safety and unsafe cars on the road. Unlike other countries we issue provisional licences to people who do not have a clue how to drive. It is a crazy system which needs to be addressed. Driving education is included in the school curriculum in the United States and other countries. That is something we may need to consider. There should be a system to support young drivers. For instance, if someone from Tallaght wants to get a job in Intel in Leixlip he or she has no way of getting there other than by using private transport. If one is given a quote of €6,000 to €8,000 for insurance one is discriminated against in that one cannot take up such a job. That is why people are looking for immediate action.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">The State should consider setting up its own company. Europe tells us we cannot regulate prices but there is one way of doing so. PMPA was set up years ago because people could not get insurance. This is a way in which the State could help lower prices. There were 17 insurance companies in 1993 and they have been merged into five. This issue needs to be addressed immediately.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyMcHughIND" eId="spk_372">
          <from>Mr. McHugh:</from>
          <p eId="para_903">I regard the problems surrounding the insurance industry as among the most critical issues facing our people. The problems are multi-faceted. We have heard about problems relating to motor and business insurance. The MIAB report deals in fair detail with the problems relating to motor insurance. The fieldwork has been done and it is now a matter for the Government to show its commitment to finding solutions by implementing the recommendations of that report.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">Very little attention is paid to the problems with business insurance. I am inclined towards the view that the crisis in business insurance is not understood. I know of one instance where a small employer was quoted an insurance premium with a 700% increase on last year. Such an increase is unsustainable. In a case where there has been no claim such an increase is immoral, unacceptable and unjustified. In my view there is collusion within the insurance industry. I request that any investigation carried out by the Minister include the issue of collusion. I say that there is collusion because when that small employer was faced with that increase he sought quotes from other insurance companies, but they refused to offer a quote. That increases my suspicion.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">These insurance problems have many knock-on effects such as price increases in goods and services, company closures and job losses. I am not scare-mongering – I speak to people every day and am aware of the problems. I will not list detailed figures or actions that must be carried out. We all know what needs to be done. Many recommendations are contained in the MIAB report and many of them are relevant to the business insurance industry. The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, are aware of the problems. I know they have a commitment – the Minister outlined it this evening. For the good of employers, employees, consumers and the country, speed is of the essence.</p>

        <speech by="#LiamTwomeyIND" eId="spk_373">
          <from>Dr. Twomey:</from>
          <p eId="para_906">Car insurance and jobs are the obvious losers in this debate but there are other hidden costs to society. There are restricted opening hours in playgrounds because it is not possible to provide constant supervision. There is a decrease in those participating in voluntary work because of the fear of litigation. We are killing the spirit of enterprise because it is so costly to start up a business. Who do we blame? We have a compensation culture that is out of control, professional fees are exorbitant and there is a lack of competition in the marketplace. Other less obvious reasons have been quoted. Drink drivers continue to be involved in a substantial number of road traffic accidents as evidenced in accident and emergency departments in our hospitals. Uninsured drivers are still a significant factor if we are to take court reports as fact. There are health and safety issues at work.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">We have only one group to blame if there is a lack of action and legislation in this area – the Members of the Oireachtas. These motions are of little benefit unless they are given substance by having the law changed. Watered down and weak recommendations are useless when we are facing a crisis as serious as that of insurance costs. We need radical and far-reaching changes in the next 12 months. I hope that by 15 October 2003 these will be resolved to the benefit of all our citizens. It is up to us as Deputies, especially those on the Government benches, to make the first move. It is for the Government to resolve this crisis. I supported a recent public meeting that highlighted this issue. The anger from people across a large sector of society was amazing. These meetings will continue in my Wexford constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">I am delighted to have been able to make my short maiden speech in Dáil Éireann and to have equal speaking rights with all other Members. The Technical Group hopes to show leadership in the House. It does not consider some of its Members to be more equal than others. Since I am not fully in tune with procedures and protocols, I will not mention the name of a Deputy who was critical of us earlier. It may be a sensitive time for that individual to be talking about change. He will have to get used to the variety of arguments from this side of Dáil Éireann.</p>

          <from>Ms Harkin:</from>
          <p eId="para_909">Individuals, small family businesses and larger businesses contact my office on a daily basis to express their utter disbelief at the enormous rise in insurance costs, their extreme concern about the survival of their businesses, their inability to obtain insurance cover in the first place and the absolute frustration that young drivers are unable to obtain cover because of excessive costs – that has a particular relevance to rural areas. This is evident not only in my office; the problem is nationwide. Jobs have been lost and continue to be lost. Enterprises, in many cases small enterprises, are quietly shutting their doors. I know of a small enterprise in a newly opened community enterprise centre in my village that had to close its doors because of a 300% rise in insurance costs. The sports and leisure centre in Carrick-on-Shannon has been closed for many weeks, not because it could not pay its insurance premium but because it could not even get a quote. That is a community organisation of volunteers providing sport and leisure facilities who could not continue with their work because they were unable to obtain insurance cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">I know of businesses that operate without insurance cover or that have only insured part of their enterprise. That is crazy for both the businesses and the public. Despite the ongoing problems, I believe even greater problems are looming. While small operators are going out of business and large companies are letting workers go, all companies are spending excessive amounts of money on insurance premia. This means that next year, when they want to invest in research and development, purchase new premises and employ new staff, they will not have that money to spend. The problems we are experiencing this year will have multiplied by this time next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">I accept that the Tánaiste does not have a magic wand, but she does have a responsibility to ensure that the crisis in insurance provision in this country is dealt with effectively and speedily.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan:</from>
          <p eId="para_915">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. It relates to a company called Comerama in Castlecomer, County Kilkenny. This is not just a firm which provides jobs for 200 people; it is a business that has a major employment impact on a place the size of Castlecomer in north Kilkenny. Comerama is the only company to employ that number of people in north east Kilkenny. Any difficulties it might have in terms of its business or finance would have a devastating impact on Castlecomer and north east Kilkenny in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The company in question is involved in the manufacture of textile – mostly woollen – goods and it has come under increased pressure as a result of competition from cotton yarn producers. Stocks have built up and Comerama is finding it increasingly difficult to offload those stocks this year. I accept that there is probably an over-capacity in this industry worldwide and that there will be a general shakeout in respect of woollen mills. There is some evidence that the latter is already happening in some European countries, particularly Germany. Movement is taking place in terms of the capacity issue. However, the employees and management at the company are anxious to find a mechanism which will allow Comerama to remain in business in both Castlecomer and Bunbeg, County Donegal, until the extent of the shakeout that will result from the over-capacity to which I refer becomes evident.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">An excellent relationship exists between the management of the company and its employees. They have already made sacrifices in the past to reduce costs. This year they went on a three-day week and previously they went on short time to help the company overcome its short-term difficulties. However, there is a danger that, when measures such short-time working, cutting costs and co-operation are used, a company may not re-enter full production. The management indicated recently that it wants to cut production costs to 20% of full production. This could result in a serious loss of employment and the closure of the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">I request the establishment, if possible, of a working group comprising representation from the management, the unions, the Department and the statutory agencies – particularly Enterprise Ireland – which can consider ways to protect the future of the plant and as many jobs as possible and allow the company trade out of its difficulties until the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> similar companies throughout the world becomes apparent.</p>

          <from>Mr. McGuinness:</from>
          <p eId="para_919">I also wish to highlight the difficulties being experienced by north east Kilkenny. I raised this matter on the Adjournment two months ago and I highlighted the problems being faced by this company. I understand that meetings were held with Enterprise Ireland and I know that the Department is fully aware of the problem. However, I also raised this issue 12 months ago as a result of worldwide difficulties with regard to the product Comerama manufactures and because, in light of the company's importance to north east Kilkenny, it was essential that positive action should be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">This company has operated in Castlecomer for the past 33 years and has employed up to 180 people and part-time and seasonal staff. Alongside the difficulties being experienced in world markets, the company has incurred major costs. Last year, for example, it paid out £1.5 million in energy costs – an increase of £250,000 on the previous year. There is no company in this tight market which could sustain that type of increase in costs at home while, at the same time, dealing with major difficulties on the world market in terms of its product.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">I request that Enterprise Ireland continue its discussions with the company while also considering the position of the other major players in north east Kilkenny and discussing with them ways of perhaps expanding their workforces with a view to taking up any slack that might result from decisions taken at Comerama. The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, visited Castlecomer and was informed about the 93 different enterprises and small businesses which operate in the area. With the co-operation of the Department, other agencies and, perhaps, the county enterprise board, I believe there is scope to expand and grow these indigenous businesses while also helping the two major companies – Comerama and Ormonde Brick – operating in the area to expand their activities and their workforces.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">A report was carried out a number of years ago on the activities and status of businesses in north east Kilkenny. In my opinion, the Department would benefit if it considered the findings of this report and examined the potential the suggestions it contains might have in terms of impacting on the growth of various businesses in the north of the county.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">The Minister or Minister of State should meet the various community groups – particularly the two enterprise groups – in Castlecomer. No Member is more aware of the difficulties the community in Castlecomer experienced as a result of the closure of the coalmines than the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Deputy Pattison. He has played an extremely positive role in respect of all the development which is taking place in north Kilkenny. There is a positive attitude among people in north Kilkenny which is mirrored in the report to which I referred earlier in respect of the development of small businesses. If it was arranged, I believe a meeting with the Minister and the various agencies could prove fruitful. If everyone focused on the difficulties being experienced by Comerama at present, the foundation might be laid either for the further development of the company in a different direction or the development of other offshoots in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">I hope such a meeting will be arranged as soon as possible because the problems at Comerama are grave. As Deputy Hogan stated, if the level of employment should fall or the short-term working arrangements remain in place, the long-term outlook for a company with worldwide headquarters in Castlecomer would not be good.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeamusPattison" eId="spk_380">
          <from>Mr. Pattison:</from>
          <p eId="para_925">I thank the Deputies for affording me the opportunity to comment on this important matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">There is no doubt that there is a dark cloud hanging over Castlecomer and the surrounding area. There is an urgent necessity to take action. I was a Member of the House when the last dark cloud passed over Castlecomer, about 35 years ago. We can learn from the actions taken at the time by the Government of the day and the various Government agencies, such as the IDA, together with the local authorities and the community in Castlecomer. All came together and had a great deal of success in replacing the jobs of approximately 500 coalminers.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">The area had been for many hundreds of years a traditional coalmining area. The closure of the mines was a calamity and the industry which is the subject of this debate was one of the main replacement industries located in Castlecomer following the closure. I join my constituency colleagues in appealing to the Minister to pull out all the stops in dealing with this issue. It was done before and, with the same co-operation, can be done again. Workers, employers and management have already co-operated to keep this firm going.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">The Minister could do something practical in the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill by providing for exemptions for payments made to short-time workers on unemployment benefit. When workers opt for short-time work, in an effort to preserve their employment and the company, their unemployment benefit is added to their earnings for tax calculation purposes. It is a small matter but would assist in generating further management and worker co-operation in trying to get over this difficulty in the textile mills. If the company can get through this difficulty, it might be able to survive. Every effort should be made to accomplish this. I hope my suggestion is given serious consideration in the context of any planned income tax adjustments.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_381">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern):</from>
          <p eId="para_929">I thank the Deputies for raising these matters on the Adjournment. The Minister of State, Deputy Aylward, has also been in contact with me and the Department about them.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">This is the second time in a matter of months that Comer International has been raised on the Adjournment. It was also discussed on 26 June last. At the time it was working a full seven day week in both plants in County Kilkenny and County Donegal but this was being reduced to a five day week. The two manufacturing plants, Comer International Limited in Castlecomer and Comer Yarns in Bunbeg, County Donegal between them manufacture 7,000 tonnes of high quality undyed worsted yarns each year. There are 180 employees in Castlecomer and nearly 200 in Bunbeg.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">The industrial development agencies, particularly Enterprise Ireland in relation to the County Kilkenny plant and Údarás na Gaeltachta in relation to the County Donegal plant, have been trying to assist the company with its current difficulties for some time. High stock levels and a slow down in drawing down from customers forced the company to place staff on short time earlier in the year. Further action has now become necessary due to continued difficult retail conditions. The company has had to respond to the existing market conditions in order that it can maintain a strong position in the international marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">The present position is that the plant in County Kilkenny will operate three days on, three days off, but the larger production line, employing between 110 and 120 people, will be phased out over the next few weeks. These workers will then be laid off temporarily. This will leave approximately 60 workers on the smaller production line. The plant in County Donegal will operate on a three day week for the next couple of months.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">An overall strategic review of business worldwide will be undertaken over the next few weeks. The prospects for the future will only become clearer when the review has taken place. This will probably be in December. The difficulties at Comer International have been brought about by a number of different dynamics coming into play. Eight years ago there was a surplus of wool and its price was suppressed. This has now changed and wool prices have risen by 25%, but wool spinners have not been able to pass this on to clothing manufacturers. Retail sales have been poor worldwide, which has also reduced the demand for cloth. The latest situation in Castlecomer and Bunbeg only serves to re-emphasise the fact that the clothing and textiles sector continues to face considerable challenges. Castlecomer and Bunbeg are not unique in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">Competitiveness is the key. We have to be able to compete in the global economy. There are a number of competitiveness issues, but, in clothing and textiles, the cost of labour is always high on the agenda. It is becoming harder to compete with imports from countries where the cost of labour is significantly lower than in Ireland or the rest of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">The industrial development agencies have the competitiveness agenda high on their list of priorities. They are working with their client companies to make them as competitive as possible. Comer International is an important exporter as well as being a large regional employer in the south east and the north west. Significant investment has been made in the companies during the years, the most recent being in April this year when assistance was given by Enterprise Ireland to support training in County Kilkenny. The company has been operating in Castlecomer for over 30 years and is both a significant and important contributor to the local economy. Enterprise Ireland will continue to work with the company while the strategic review of operations is taking place.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The industrial development agencies are active in County Kilkenny. Enterprise Ireland has approved over €900,000 for the renovation of an old mill for use as an enterprise centre. Construction work on this project is due to commence before the end of the year. Employment in Enterprise Ireland supported companies has been increasing in recent years and had reached 3,771 last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_937">With regard to IDA Ireland, in 2000, Deutsche Bank announced 200 jobs for Kilkenny in its global accounting centre. Current employment is at 100. Also in 2000, Infoscore announced 100 jobs in its Kilkenny software development centre and currently employs 22 people. In 2001, Fileflow announced 25 jobs in its software development centre and employment has now reached 20 people. There have been no job losses in IDA supported companies in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">Education also has an important role to play. Kilkenny has access to third level institutions which have developed outreach campus facilities in the city, particularly Carlow Institute of Technology and the National University of Ireland in Maynooth. The courses currently on offer through the outreach campuses include science, business and engineering.</p>
          <p eId="para_939">There have been a number of project announcements by overseas companies, supported by IDA Ireland, in County Donegal in recent years. The most significant of these include Prumerica in 2000 and 2001 with 600 jobs, Pacificare in 1999 and 2001 with 310 jobs and Keith Prowse in 2002 with 120 jobs. Government agencies are actively supporting the needs of firms operating in the clothing and textiles sector to assist them in ensuring the long-term viability of their companies. A number of projects have been undertaken by Enterprise Ireland, such as improving communications and design, increasing public relations activities and establishing production networks and strategic partnerships. One of these initiatives included a directory of County Donegal clothing and textile companies produced with an industry profile. Enterprise Ireland is also active in promoting inward buyer missions which include clothing and textile companies nationwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_940">I am satisfied that all the development agencies, including the county development boards and the county enterprise boards, will continue to promote counties Kilkenny and Donegal for suitable industrial projects. I hope to see a positive outcome from the forthcoming review of Comer International's operations.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle:</from>
          <p eId="para_944">I urge the Minister of State to depart from his prepared script and respond to some questions and concerns I wish to raise, not only about the announcement that has been made, but also the way it was made. At 8 a.m. today workers at IFI learned of their impending fate from the Internet website of a British newspaper. At noon the company denied the report. Yet, at 4 p.m., management at the Cork plant in Marino Point told workers that the board of directors had met and made a decision that the company was due for closure. Does the Minister find it acceptable to treat a workforce in this way, particularly in a company that is 51% owned by the State? As the company's trustee, the Minister has guardianship of the majority shareholding but she has played hard and fast with the workers' emotions. In recent weeks hope was given when, in fact, despair was the inevitable outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">The IFI plant at Marino Point has been enduring a lingering death due to Government under investment which meant the plant could not be brought up to speed in terms of health and safety requirements and environmental safeguards. If such investment had been made, not only would the plant be viable but the 200 jobs at Marino Point would have been secured. These jobs have been lost in the last traditional heavy industry in the Cork Harbour area. Jobs have already been lost there in Irish Steel, Irish ISPAT and the Verolme Cork Dockyard.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">Government negligence has been further compounded by the inevitability of this closure being known well in advance, yet no Government plan was put in place to provide alternative jobs prior to such an announcement. On these grounds the Minister and the Minister of State should apologise to local people for the decisions they have made.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">The Minister should indicate what safeguards exist for the workers who lost their jobs today. As a semi-State company, will its workers receive standard redundancy payments or a protected level of redundancy? What is the role of the other shareholder, ICI in Britain, with regard to the future of IFI? Will money be provided to deal with the considerable contamination that exists at each of the IFI plants? Has an analysis been undertaken of the cost of closing down the plant compared to the cost of keeping it up and running with proper environmental and health and safety requirements in place?</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The Government has been playing a game with the community of Cork Harbour, including Great Island, and most particularly the IFI workers and their families. The decision to close the plant will have major reverberations in the Cork area, as well as the other areas in which the company operated, including Arklow and Belfast. We must ask what implications this decision will have for cross-Border and cross-community relations.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">We are not seeking a bland statement prepared by a civil servant. We are seeking concrete answers as to how this situation has come to pass, what safeguards exist for the workers' future and whether the Government is prepared to take responsibility for having brought about this situation. The blame lies firmly with the Government which holds a majority shareholding in trust for the Irish people, yet it betrayed that trust to the detriment of all concerned.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_386">
          <from>Ms McManus:</from>
          <p eId="para_950">I thank Deputy Boyle for sharing his time and thus allowing me to speak about the jobs losses in Arklow in my constituency. It is regrettable that the Minister is not present in the House for this Adjournment debate. The announcement concerning 620 jobs losses was made in a terrible manner. The board announced without warning that it was seeking liquidation approval from the Government. The loss of 200 jobs in Arklow is a major blow to the town which historically has been an unemployment blackspot. IFI operated as an employer during the dark days and the good times, but this devastating announcement has been made overnight. The announcement was not made in the boardroom of a multinational company because the decision ultimately rests at the Cabinet table. Even at this late stage, the Minister could sit down with the company and work out a deal. That is unlikely to happen, however, because the political commitment to secure these jobs clearly is not there.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">I want to hear answers to key questions. What will happen to the IFI workers? Most of these men are highly skilled and have been in work for a long time. They are not the kind of people who can easily find alternative employment. Will they receive a good and fair severance package? Historically, good deals have been struck in the company when people were made redundant. Many people have been made redundant at IFI over the years. We want a guarantee that these people, who suddenly find themselves unemployed as a consequence of this decision, will receive fair treatment. The company put forward various proposals, including seeking a loan to get it over a bad patch, but today's news has been shocking. The workers should be treated with respect. They should be given a package which recognises the circumstances in which they find themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">What commitment will the Minister give to ensure that the IFI site in Arklow will have a future as an industrial plant? Jobs must be created to replace those that have been lost in the town.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_387">
          <from>Mr. M. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_953">IFI is jointly owned by ICI, with 49% of the company, and the State through Nitrigin Éireann Teoranta (NET) holding 51%. As the Deputies are probably aware by now, the board of IFI decided today that it could not continue trading and has recommended the appointment of a liquidator.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">Having effectively lived next door to IFI since it first went into operation – as well as being able to count among my friends and neighbours many of the IFI employees in Marino Point – today's announcement comes as a personal disappointment. It is obviously a matter of extreme disappointment that, despite the efforts of all those involved – including the workers, the worker directors and the management – it has not been possible to find a solution to the severe financial difficulties at Irish Fertilizer Industries. Clearly, this will be devastating news for the workforce, their families and the local businesses involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The Minister and I will be taking steps immediately to ensure that everything possible is done to assist those concerned to find alternative employment as quickly as possible. FÁS, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland will immediately examine what needs to be done in Cork and Arklow, with the priority being to provide whatever retraining might be necessary, and to seek alternative investments for these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">My Department has also been in contact with the Northern Ireland authorities regarding the Belfast situation. The company operates in a volatile market which is going through a tough trading period. The market is plagued by considerable levels of over-supply resulting in poor prices, while costs remain high. The company experienced significant losses in the past year, around €35 million, and, despite the identification of a number of significant cost savings as part of recent efforts to save the company, it was still not possible to establish a basis for a viable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_957">The Government, through NET and ICI as joint shareholders, has been supportive of the company, including by means of the provision of €34 million in recent years. Since inception in 1961, the value of Exchequer support for NET and IFI has amounted to nearly €750 million in present day terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">Unfortunately, since its inception in 1987, the company has struggled to deliver a commercial rate of return and, as a result, it now requires large borrowings just to fund day-to-day operations. These borrowings are on top of the €200 million in debt which was retained by NET at the time IFI was established in 1987. The debt retained by NET had risen to over €250 million by 2001 when most of it was taken over by the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">While a recent request for funding was submitted to the shareholders, the additional funding sought would not – even on the basis of the company's plans – have established a viable basis for going forward. Instead, the objective was to enable the company continue trading for a number of months. The company believed that it might be possible to dispose of the assets of the company for a higher price at a later stage. The shareholders considered that the plan was extremely fragile and that even minor shocks would have, yet again, made the company's position untenable. Accordingly, they did not have confidence in the plan and, contrary to the misleading impression given in the article in <i>The Guardian,</i> both sides were agreed that the provision of further funding in such circumstances could not be justified. I can also confirm that the suggestion in <i>The Guardian</i> that some form of trade sale was on the cards is inaccurate. Efforts made in recent months, on behalf of the shareholders, did not attract any prospective buyers for the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">At this stage, the focus will have to move to ensuring an orderly wind-down of operations. Both shareholders will, of course, co-operate fully with the company and the liquidator in an effort to ensure that process can be as smooth and efficient as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">I am surprised at Deputy Boyle's barefaced hypocrisy. Only a few months ago he was looking for the closure of that plant.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_390">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte:</from>
          <p eId="para_964">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this tragic event. The fatal stabbing near his home of a law abiding Dublin teenager has deeply disturbed a public almost inured to wanton acts of violence. People everywhere are acutely concerned that elements in our society have become so depraved that a respectable law abiding youth can lose his life in a casual but vicious assault motivated, it is suggested, by the robbery of his watch and mobile phone.</p>
          <p eId="para_965">A young person of good character, innocently walking home after saying "goodnight" to his girlfriend, is set upon and fatally stabbed at the relatively early hour of 11.10 p.m. What kind of society have we become?</p>
          <p eId="para_966">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may reasonably say that neither he nor his Government nor the Garda Síochána can be expected to have been able to intervene to prevent this young man's death. However, this Government and its predecessor have complacently presided over a more violent society where the cheapening of human life is a regular experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_967">Within a half an hour of doctors at Beaumont Hospital failing to save Alan Higgins's life, another unlawful killing took place a few miles across the city. These two were only the latest casualties of a violent culture that seems to have transfixed the Minister and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_968">The terrible loss of young life, and the unimaginable grief visited on parents and loved ones, prevents one tonight from dwelling on the sick joke of zero tolerance touted for political advantage only by the Minister's predecessor. What practical measures are promised by the new Minister?</p>
          <p eId="para_969">The casual wanton regular violence on our streets is a symptom of a sick and divided society where either the law or its enforcement, or both, is inadequate. If the alienation of sections of our youth from normal society is reflected in the casual unlawful killing of a neighbouring teenager, then the challenge facing Government goes beyond renovation of the criminal law. The safety of our citizens, young and old, is the primary responsibility of Government and the Garda's own figures highlight the extent of failure we are now experiencing.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">The coarsening of life in huge tracts of urban Ireland is being ignored by a comfortable political elite which is either unwilling or unable to grasp the extent of youth alienation in many areas. A Government that sought to spend almost €1,000 million for an elite sports campus at Abbottstown, when a fraction of that money is spent in working class communities to provide youth and sports facilities, is badly out of touch.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">This wasteful inexcusable destruction of a young life is a tragedy for everyone involved and for our society. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_391">
          <from>Mr. M. Ahern:</from>
          <p eId="para_972">In the first instance, I wish to extend very sincere sympathy on behalf of the Government and on my own behalf to the family of Alan Higgins who so tragically lost his life in the early hours of Sunday morning and also to the families of other recent victims of similar crimes. The circumstances of their deaths can only add to the grief of losing one so young. In the case of the most recent victim, I am aware that three youths appeared in the District Children's Court today on charges in relation to the matter. The House will appreciate, in these circumstances, that I am limited as to what I can say about any individual case.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">I thank Deputy Rabbitte for raising this matter for debate. The Government is very concerned at the recent fatal stabbings of young persons in our towns and cities. The serious nature of these offences, which are often committed by young people, underline the continued need for robust responses to offending behaviour and the need to readily adapt to changing levels and patterns of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">The Deputy will be aware that the programme for Government sets out a number of commitments which will assist the Garda authorities in dealing with crime of this nature, in addition to existing legislative provisions. The Government recognises that in-depth analysis of the underlying causes of crime is required as well as priority action to deal with particular issues. The Government's response is multifaceted and the programme for Government includes proposals in relation to innovative public order legislation, targeted Garda operations, a strict enforcement of the liquor licensing laws, an extension of the use of closed-circuit television systems and an increase in Garda numbers by 2000, which will be targeted to benefit those areas of greatest need.</p>
          <p eId="para_975">The Government also recognises that it must continue to address a wide range of societal issues, some of which are outside the remit of the criminal justice system, which contribute to causing crime. In the criminal justice system, it will ensure that all aspects of the criminal law, whether in relation to substantive offences, the law on evidence, powers of investigation or otherwise, are adequate to combat crime and protect the public. The Minister is examining, as a priority, the need for additional measures in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_976">To address concerns about public order, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has re-introduced the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill, 2002. This Bill, when enacted, will give the Garda significant additional powers to assist them in dealing with drunkenness and disorderly conduct. The purpose of the Bill is to augment the law so as to tackle the problem of drink-related late night disturbance and the growing problem of late night street violence which has its origins in or outside licensed premises and fast food outlets in urban areas. It applies to pubs, off-licences, discos, night clubs, dance venues of all types, amusement arcades, chip shops, take-aways and mobile food vehicles. Existing Garda powers in this area will be strengthened and it will extend the sanctions which may be imposed on offenders under the Public Order Act, 1994. In addition to this legislative response, the National Crime Council is conducting research on public order and its findings are due to be published in early 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_977">The Garda authorities also have a range of powers under the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act, 1990. This Act contains a number of controls regarding the availability and possession of knives, offensive weapons and other articles. Obviously, this legislation recognises that there are various purposes for the possession of knives and only penalises in cases where they are carried for no good reason. The Garda's Operation Encounter which was introduced in February of this year continues to focus on all issues of public order in the community. Particular attention is paid to night clubs, fast food outlets and other venues at which large numbers of people congregate and where there is potential for disorder. The target hours of the operation will be determined locally, based on the specific circumstances prevailing at each location. Particular attention is being paid to ensuring that the owners and managers of such premises are fully aware of their responsibilities and of the duty of care they owe to their patrons and other members of the public. The operation has increased the number of gardaí available to target locations where public order and assault offences are likely to be committed. Changes in policing practice, including Operation Encounter, are constantly monitored and reviewed to ensure the most effective outcome is obtained from the deployment of Garda resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">The Government will continue to focus on youth crime by supporting and developing evidence-based preventative measures and interventions aimed at young offenders and those most at risk of offending by implementing the outstanding relevant provisions of the Children Act, 2001; continuing to support and strengthen the network of Garda youth diversion projects which increased in number from 12 in 1997 to 64 currently; and supporting enforcement of the liquor licensing laws, with particular reference to provisions relating to the mandatory temporary closure of pubs and off-licences where convictions for allowing under-age drinking have been obtained.</p>
          <p eId="para_979">The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 October 2002.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_392">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_982">The total number of people on public hospital waiting lists at 31 March 2002, the latest date for which figures have been published, was 25,105. The comparable figure for 31 March 2001 was 26,382. This represents a decrease of 5% on the comparable figure for March 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">In the period March 2001 to March 2002 there has been a reduction of 62% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for cardiac surgery and a reduction of 67% in the number of children waiting more than six months for cardiac surgery. There has been a reduction of 34% in the number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for ENT procedures and a fall of 33% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for ophthalmology procedures in the period March 2001 to March 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">Hospital waiting lists must be viewed against a background of a hospital system which discharged some 920,000 in-patients and day cases in 2001. This represents an overall increase of 42,000 discharges or 5% over the figure for 2000. Day case activity has increased by 10% from 324,000 day case discharges in 2000 to 359,000 day case discharges in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_985">The health strategy contains a commitment that the management and organisation of waiting lists will be reformed. There has been a rapid movement in the last few years towards day case work where a variety of routine and complex treatments, surgery and diagnostic tests can now be performed with the patient being admitted and discharged from hospital on the same day. The settings for day case work vary from traditional theatres to specially constructed day surgery units and treatment rooms. The ability to carry out day case procedures has increased the efficiency of the hospital system to the extent that half of all elective surgery is now done on a day case basis. Increased use of day surgery will improve the efficiency of the hospital system and provide speedier access to services for the patient and reduce waiting times.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">The Department has set out to regularise and standardise the reporting of waiting lists. However, there are a number of defining issues surrounding day case work that need to be addressed to allow consistent and comparative analysis across the hospital system. The Department is continuing to work closely with health agencies with regard to these issues and hopes to be in a position to publish the first complete set of data on day case waiting lists and on waiting times in the near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">The health strategy places a new focus on waiting times. While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, a new dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment by purchasing treatments for public patients in private hospitals. The national treatment purchase fund expects to treat up to 1,900 patients this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in both the acute and non-acute sectors. The review, which has informed the health strategy, has focused primarily on the need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long-terms. This year I have made provision for the commissioning of an additional 709 acute beds in public hospitals at a cost of €65 million. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 258 of these beds have been commissioned under this initiative to date. The latest advice to my Department from the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, and the health boards indicates that in excess of 600 beds will be in place by year end and that the remainder will be commissioned early in the new year.</p>

      the estimated additional revenue which will be raised from his decision announced on 12 July 2002 to increase hospital charges and the threshold for the drugs refund scheme; if his attention has been drawn to the severe hardship created for people suffering from long-term ailments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_393">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_990">The estimated additional revenue that will be raised from the increases in hospital charges and the threshold for the drugs refund scheme is as follows: drugs payment scheme –€7 million via an increase in the monthly threshold to €65; and increased hospital charges –€6 million A&amp;E, in-patient and maintenance charges. The drug payment scheme, DPS, significantly benefits families who, regularly or occasionally, are faced with large drug bills. No individual or family has to pay more than €65 per month for prescribed, approved drugs and medicines. Any costs over €65 are paid by the State. The monthly threshold for the DPS was increased to €65 with effect from 1 August 2002. Although the threshold had not been increased since the scheme's introduction in July 1999, the cost of the scheme had risen by 73%, up from €51.34 million for the last six months of 1999 to €177.6 million for 2001, and approximately 1.15 million people are now using it.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">The statutory charge for an attendance at accident and emergency departments increased from €31.70 to €40 on 1 August 2002. This charge is levied only on persons who attend at accident and emergency departments without a referral note from their doctor and applies only for the first visit of any episode of care. As well as providing hospitals with a source of income, the charge is important as an incentive towards the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments. The statutory inpatient charge increased by €3 to €36 per overnight or day case, subject to a maximum of €360 in any year. The inpatient charge had not increased since 1 January 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">Charges in respect of private and semi-private rooms in public hospitals increased by 10% on 1 August 2002. These private patient charges are additional to the statutory inpatient charge and are a contribution towards overall hospital running costs and represent less than 50% of the real cost in major hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Where people cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants, they may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis. In addition, the long-term illness, LTI, scheme provides drugs and medicines free of charge to persons who suffer from any of a range of conditions, and who do not hold medical cards. Beneficiaries of the LTI and medical card schemes are not affected by the increase in the DPS threshold. I should add that these increased charges were introduced as an alternative to a reduction in the volume of health services provided and, against the background outlined, I do not regard them as unreasonable.</p>

          <p eId="para_998">As the Deputy will be aware, the Office of Consumer Affairs has responsibility for the control of pricing in relation to consumer products. However, the health promotion unit of my Department is implementing an alcohol awareness campaign, entitled Less is More – It's Your Choice, the overall aim of which is to raise awareness of inappropriate alcohol consumption or high risk drinking and related harm. A number of initiatives have been implemented as part of this campaign. These include a radio advertisement and poster campaign which targeted those who buy, supply, and sell alcohol to under-age drinkers, a college campus initiative targeting third level students and the printing of sensible drinking advice on airline ticket wallets targeting holidaymakers. A framework for developing a college alcohol policy was developed by the unit and is designed to assist colleges to develop campus alcohol policies which promote sensible drinking among students.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">I also established a strategic task force on alcohol earlier this year. Part of its remit is to provide specific evidence based measures on reducing alcohol related harm to government. The task force published its interim report in May this year. The health promotion unit is also working with the drinks industry group on a responsible serving of alcohol programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_1001">The Disability Commissioner Bill was initiated as a Private Members' Bill in the Seanad on 3 August 2001. The main provisions of the Bill related to the provision of health and social services for people with disabilities. The Disability Commissioner (No. 2) Bill was subsequently initiated in the Dáil by members of Fine Gael on 3 October 2001. This latter proceeded to Second Stage on 9 October 2001 where it was opposed by the Government having regard to the imminence of its own proposals in relation to disability legislation and because it did not accord with the Government's policy of mainstreaming. The Seanad-initiated Bill, which did not proceed to Second Stage, fell on the dissolution of the Oireachtas earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">As the Deputy will be aware, the Government's disability legislation, the Disability Bill 2001, included provision in relation to health and personal social services, and was published in December 2001.

I understand that the work of the consultation team is progressing as a matter of priority and that the process of bringing forward legislative proposals will be put in train at the earliest opportunity.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_1004">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services in the Eastern Regional Health Authority. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service. Ultimately it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">In 2002, my Department provided additional funding of €0.622 million to the ERHA for orthodontic services of which €0.405 million was for an orthodontic training programme. Four dentists from the authority commenced their training for specialist in orthodontic qualifications in October 2001. Furthermore, my Department expects to fund an additional 11 dentists from various health boards, including the authority, for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions. My Department has also funded the appointment of a director of specialist training for the Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry through the Post-Graduate Medical and Dental Board. The director has taken up duty and is playing a pivotal role in assisting the different agencies involved in dental specialist training programmes. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. Under the initiative, the ERHA was allocated €2.044 million. This enabled the authority to recruit additional staff, including two consultant orthodontists and to develop new treatment facilities at Loughlinstown and at the regional orthodontic unit located at St. James's Hospital. My Department has also funded a six-chair orthodontic suite for the Northern Area Health Board, expected to be operational in spring 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. The ERHA received €1.815 million from this fund, which will enable the authority to make arrangements for the provision of both additional sessions for its staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">The Regional Chief Executive of the ERHA has informed me that at the end of the June 2002 quarter, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 502 patients awaiting treatment in the South-Western Area Health Board, 644 patients awaiting treatment in the East Coast Area Health Board and 113 patients awaiting treatment in the Northern Area Health Board. At the end of the same quarter, there were 4,110 patients in orthodontic treatment. This is an increase of 334 in comparison with the corresponding figure at the end of the December 2001 quarter. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</p>

          <p eId="para_1012">In accordance with the action plan set out in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System For You, this is one of the issues to be pursued in the planning of infrastructure development in the health system.

          <p eId="para_1013">The Eastern Regional Health Authority has dedicated units for the treatment of young chronic sick, YCS, clients in the Royal Hospital Donnybrook and Peamount Hospital.

          <p eId="para_1016">I have initiated a number of measures to estimate the number of doctors and nurses required by our hospital service over the next decade and beyond. In relation to the numbers of hospital doctors the Deputy will be aware that I established a national task force on medical staffing earlier this year. The task force is, among other issues, considering the proposed development of a consultant provided public hospital service and quantifying the resource and cost implications involved. It is also addressing the reduction in working hours for non-consultant hospital doctors arising from the EU directive on working time and the medical education and training requirements of our hospital medical workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">The task force will also address the associated medical staffing needs of the Irish hospital system and consider the medical education and training requirements arising from any changes to the current model of delivering services. With regard to ensuring an adequate supply of nurses and midwives to staff our health service into the future, the Commission on Nursing identified a need to strengthen the workforce planning functions in my Department. In response, my Department set up a study of the nursing and midwifery resource in December 1998. The aim of the project was to analyse the position with regard to the nursing and midwifery workforce, to devise a system for the projection of future needs and to plan how these needs may be met. The final report of the steering group was published in September of this year. The ultimate aim is to have the right number of nurses and midwives in the right place at the right time, with the right skills to ensure that the patient receives the highest standard of care when needed. The report recommends the best possible approach to workforce planning for nursing and midwifery and how this may be kept under review. It should be noted that there has also been a substantial increase in training places in nursing in recent years. In the last five years the number of pre-registration education places for nursing has increased by 69% from 968 in 1998 to 1,640 in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">In relation to other staff, the introduction of integrated workforce planning on a national basis in the health service is a priority under the health strategy. Under action 100 of the strategy my Department will lead the development of an integrated system of workforce planning. We will work closely with the health services skills group established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness to help identify ways of meeting the workforce requirements of the health system. Integrated workforce planning will build on existing initiatives and available data regarding workforce needs and is aimed at anticipating the number and type of staff required to provide a quality health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">It is intended that the process will align workforce planning with strategic objectives and the service planning process undertaken in health boards, promote the use of skill mix, facilitating those in support roles to upgrade their skills and enabling specialists to focus on core functions and involve integration with education, training and professional bodies in order to ensure that numbers of training places match the demand for skills within the health sector.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_1021">The recruitment and retention of nurses in the public health service is a matter of priority for my Department. Over the past four years, a number of highly significant steps have been taken to ensure the continued supply of quality nursing personnel to the health service. Chief among these among these initiatives are establishment of the commission on nursing and ongoing implementation of its recommendations the introduction, this month, of the new nursing degree programme, provision of funding for various recruitment and retention initiatives including payment of fees and other financial supports for nursing degrees and specialist courses, establishment of the National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery and recruitment of nurses from overseas. The overall impact of these measures has enabled the health service to recruit and retain more nurses that ever before. Since 1998, the number of nurses employed in the public health service has risen by 5,788 to a total of 36,089 by end-2001. This represents a 19% increase and is an impressive statistic by any standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">On 1 November 2001, I launched the new four year undergraduate pre-registration nursing degree programme which commenced for the academic year 2002-3. The new nursing degree programme replaces the three year diploma programme, and will put the education of nurses on a par with that of other health care professionals. The nursing profession has long been seeking such parity, and the Government's decision implements a central recommendation of the Commission on Nursing. Educating nurses to degree level will enable them to develop their clinical skills to a greater extent and to respond to future challenges in health care, for the benefit of patients and client groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">The Government has approved a capital building programme totalling €243.2 million for the construction of facilities to accommodate nursing students at 13 higher education institutions throughout the country. This programme is due to be completed by September 2004. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of places for the education of nurses at pre-registration level since 1999. The number of places rose from a little over 1,000 in 1999 to 1,640 this year. This represents an increase of 58% in just three years. In addition to undergraduate courses, there is in excess of 800 places on specialist and post-graduate courses including accident and emergency, coronary care, oncology and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">A major recruitment and retention initiative, costing in excess of €6.35 million, was launched by me on 29 November 2000 to address the present shortage of nurses and midwives. In particular a scheme of flexible working arrangements for nurses and midwives in the public health service came into operation on 1 February 2001. Under the scheme, individual nurses and midwives may apply to work between eight and 39 hours per week on a permanent part-time basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">The National Council for the Professional Development of Nursing and Midwifery was established on 30 November 1999 by statutory instrument made under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act 1961, for the purpose of furthering the development of nursing as a profession with a particular emphasis on post-registration education and training. The promotional structure within nursing, including the introduction of a clinical career pathway, is being significantly improved on foot of the recommendations of the Commission on Nursing and the 1999 nurses pay settlement. The national council has been especially active in this area, and to date almost 1,400 clinical nurse specialist and advanced nurse practitioner posts have been approved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">In line with recommendation 4:55 of the Commission on Nursing a national pilot programme for the formal training of health care assistants commenced in November 2001, and was successfully completed in May 2002. This course is being run in conjunction with the Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">The deployment of health care assistants will reduce the number of non-nursing tasks currently being performed by nurses and midwives, and will allow for the more effective utilisation of the professional skills of nurses and midwives. The ongoing recruitment of nurses from abroad is also impacting positively on the vacancy situation. A total of 3,148 working visas and work authorisations were issued to nurses from non EU countries between June 2000 and April 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">The combined impact of these measures has been to allow the health service to recruit and retain more nurses than ever before. As I said earlier, the number of nurses employed in the public health service has increased by 19% since 1998 and the number of places at undergraduate level has increased by 58% since 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">With regard to the level of nursing vacancies, the quarterly Health Service Employers Agency National Survey shows the following number of vacancies at quarterly intervals since January 2001:</p>

          <p eId="para_1044">This table shows that the number of vacancies has decreased by 267 since January 2001. This represents a 20.3% reduction in vacancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">The national study of turnover in nursing and midwifery found that the rate of turnover in the ERHA area has decreased from 25% in 1999 to 22% in 2000 and 21% in 2001. An analysis of the turnover rate showed that 35% left to pursue other employment in nursing, 21% to travel abroad and a further 12% left to pursue studies in nursing. While high turnover rates would give cause for concern there are positive aspects to it. With 47% moving to other posts or pursuing further study, this indicates the high level of opportunity for nurses to develop their careers and the longer term impact of this can only be for the better. Similarly, many nurses who travel abroad will work in nursing and the Irish health service will benefit from the enhanced experience of those who return.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">I am satisfied that the range of measures outlined above which I have taken in recent years, as evidenced by the figures quoted above, are having the desired effect on recruitment and retention of nurses. I am confident that the continuing application of these measure will provide the health service with quality nurses and midwives going into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1048">Extensive research has and continues to be conducted world-wide in relation to the MMR vaccine. The World Health Organisation has indicated that MMR vaccine does not cause autism and that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published research does not support a causal link between MMR and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. Earlier this year, newspaper articles alleging a link between MMR vaccine and autism referred to a study by Professor John O'Leary into measles virus. In response to these articles Professor O'Leary issued a statement indicating that the research referred to in no way establishes any link between the vaccine and autism. He further indicated that he and his research team have consistently advocated the use of MMR vaccine to protect the nation's children from measles, mumps and rubella.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">There is no universally accepted policy for screening children with autism for a variety of hypothetical disorders. The quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology, approved 9 June 2000, states as regards diagnostic testing: "There is inadequate supporting evidence for hair analysis, coeliac antibodies, allergy testing (particularly food allergies for gluten, casein, candida and other moulds), immunologic or neurochemical abnormalities, micronutrients such as vitamin levels, intestinal permeability studies, stool analysis, urinary peptides, mitochondrial disorders (including lactate and pyruvate), thyroid function tests, or erythrocyte flurathione peroxidase studies."</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">There are diagnostic and treatment services available within the health services generally to assist persons who have health problems which may require to be addressed through dietary interventions. These are available to children with autism through the usual referral channels. Assistance with dietary needs may also be available in certain circumstances through the supplementary welfare scheme which is operated by the health boards on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">My Department has made funding amounting to €190,000 over a three year period available to the Health Research Board to commission research into autism and intestinal dysfunction. This funding has been awarded to a team led by Professor O'Leary. The aim of the research is to characterise the biology of gastrointestinal abnormalities in people with autism and to examine any discrepancies between them and patients with conventional intestinal disorders.</p>

          <p eId="para_1053">The position is that the setting of premium charges is the responsibility of the VHI Board. The legislation requires the board to set premiums at a level sufficient to cover costs and make allowance for reserves. The board is however, obliged to notify me in advance of putting proposed increases into effect. I may prevent the introduction of an increase, but must have good reasons for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">Regarding the board's decision concerning the recent premium increase, the details provided by VHI in support of the need for such an increase were carefully examined. A key piece of information in the consideration process is the trend of likely claims which VHI will have to pay on behalf of members. The forecast figures given by VHI in that regard strongly supported the need for such an increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">On the basis of the information put before me, I formed the view that the board's decision was in accordance with its legal duty in setting premium charges. In that connection, I considered that it would be unrealistic to veto the increase involved, while expecting VHI to meet the needs of its members, in terms of benefits and coverage, together with maintaining the integrity of its finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">With regard to risk equalisation, the position is that draft regulations have been prepared in consultation with the Health Insurance Authority. Under the provisions of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act, 2001, the Health Insurance Authority will have a central role in regard to determining and advising whether or not risk equalisation transfers are warranted between insurers having regard to the best overall interests of health insurance consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">As required by the 2001 Act, I will be presenting the regulations, in draft form for affirmation by both Houses of the Oireachtas. Subject to consultations with EU Commission services, with whom close liaison in the matter has been maintained by my Department, I propose to submit the draft regulations during the current session.</p>

          <p eId="para_1062">The issue of historic liabilities of the mutual defence bodies is one that remains to be resolved. The MDU and the MPS have historically offered cover to their members on an "occurrence" basis. This means that they are liable for the costs of a claim whenever it arises provided the doctor concerned was a member when the event giving rise to the claim occurred. This open-ended cover gives rise to the situation where the defence bodies receive claims relating to events which occurred many years before. Their long experience of the business of providing professional indemnity cover for doctors should enable them to anticipate the pattern and cost of claims against their members. It is then their responsibility to price the level of their subscriptions accordingly. If the defence bodies are unable to fully fund their historic liabilities it is because they have either failed to properly reserve for them or have not charged the appropriate subscription or a combination of both.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">These liabilities remain the responsibility of the defence bodies. It is a matter for them to determine how they will finance them following the introduction of enterprise liability. I am not aware of any suggestion that the burden of financing them will fall on consultants in private practice. The unique feature of the defence bodies is that they exist as mutual organisations formed for the defence of all of their members interests. The suggestion that one relatively small group of members should shoulder a disproportionate share of the liabilities of a large mutual organisation would be entirely at odds with the history and tradition of these bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">I do not see that the introduction of enterprise liability will have any adverse effect on the practice of private medicine in Ireland. In fact it should lead to a reduction in the indemnity costs of many specialities. I acknowledge that complex changes of the nature represented by enterprise liability can have unanticipated indirect consequences. I have repeatedly stated that I will be monitoring the situation closely and that I will liaise with organisations representing the medical profession and the independent hospital sector to ensure that the introduction of enterprise liability does not adversely affect the inter-dependence between the public and private hospital systems.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_404">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_1072">Non-consultant hospital doctors currently work an average of 77 hours per week. The EU Working Time Directive requires that this be reduced to 58 hours per week by August 2004, with maximum average of 48 hours per week to be achieved by August 2009. In order to ensure the health and safety of hospital doctors and to ensure the care and safety of patients, health service employers have taken steps to introduce rosters to reduce the working hours of doctors. These rosters have been drawn up in line with the 2000 agreement, reached with the IMO under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, and in line with the requirements of the European Working Time Directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">The industrial action taken to date and the threat of further such action the Irish Medical Organisation is unjustified, unnecessary and disproportionate. Employers are implementing rosters which are necessary to meet the requirements of the EU Working Time Directive and are based on agreements already reached with the IMO.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">The IMO claims that the new rosters will reduce NCHD training time. This is not in fact the case. Hospitals are as a matter of course inspected by the medical training bodies which set out criteria for approval of training posts. These criteria include specifications in relation to hours to be worked. The most common requirement is that doctors should not be required to work for continuous long periods without break, as tired doctors cannot be expected to assimilate what they learn in training. Health service employers are ensuring, and will continue to ensure, that rosters are being designed to protect training time whilst ensuring patient care and safety as well as the health and safety of the doctors concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">The 3,800 NCHDs currently employed in the health service are among the highest earners in the public sector. The current pay bill for NCHDs is almost €400 million with over €100 million being paid in overtime. On average an NCHD can expect to earn €90,000 per annum. These earnings vary considerably depending on the grade of NCHD, for example, average earnings for an intern are currently €70,000, whereas average earnings for a specialist registrar are currently €147,000. Some 62% of NCHD salary costs arise from overtime payments. NCHDs, under the 2000 agreement, also receive generous training grants and time off for exam and study leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">The basic issue at the heart of this dispute is the IMO's contention that hospital doctors must be paid overtime for every hour worked outside the 9 am to 5 pm timeframe whether or not the doctor has completed a basic 39 hour week. As the health service is provided on a 24 hour basis, health service employers must manage their resources to meet the needs of patients over the 24 hour period. Health service employers must be able to roster doctors and other health service staff to match service requirements. I regret that the IMO withdrew from a Labour Court hearing on the overtime issue, which had been arranged by agreement with both sides. I would, therefore, urge the IMO to re-enter this process as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">During the recent talks at the Labour Relations Commission, health service employers suggested an approach whereby local arrangements aimed at implementing rosters, which would both meet the requirement to reduce hours and meet the concerns of the IMO regarding training issues, could be implemented. Unfortunately the IMO has chosen to reject this proposal, resulting in the breakdown of the talks at the LRC. However the Health Service Employers Agency remains available to re-enter talks at the LRC or Labour Court, if and when required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1078">The resolution of this dispute lies in the acceptance by the IMO that hospitals are run for the purpose of providing a service to patients. Rosters will be implemented which ensure appropriate levels of medical staffing to meet the needs of patient care whilst also meeting the health and safety requirements of the 2000 agreement and the working time directive. I again urge the IMO to enter into meaningful talks aimed at resolving this unnecessary dispute and to support health service employers in improving conditions for both doctors and patients.</p>

The group has conducted an extensive investigation of the clinical and legal issues involved in the handling of those cases. It has also examined existing levels of service provision for those affected by cerebral damage. The group has had a presentation made to it by parents of children affected by cerebral damage on the day-to-day implications of providing care for them at home. Most recently it has examined prevention strategies and the effect of reforms introduced in the United Kingdom on the handling of claims for compensation for injuries resulting from the provision of clinical care. My Department understands that the group expects to be in a position to present its final report in the middle of 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1085">In recent years health has been by far the biggest beneficiary of new resources available for public services. Over the last four years funding on the Irish health service has doubled and indeed the debate on health funding has now moved from resources alone to both resources and reform. I would like to assure the Deputies that the Government is committed to keeping health as a priority area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">The health strategy, Quality and Fairness, outlines the largest expansion in services in the history of the Irish health system. A vision has been set out across the full range of care areas for how the system can develop not just in the short-term but over the next decade to deliver high quality care for all. I am confident that the Government will provide the necessary funding to enable this phased development to take place. In line with the commitment given in quality and fairness, I have established a strategy implementation unit in my Department to drive implementation of the strategy at national level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1087">The strategy implementation team has responsibility for the preparation of an annual report for the Cabinet subcommittee on implementation of the strategy and is currently engaged in compiling the necessary information for preparation of this important report. I expect to report to the Cabinet subcommittee before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1088">I also intend to produce an end of year report showing those areas where progress on the implementation of the health strategy has been made and I will provide a copy of this report to the Deputies as soon as it becomes available.

          <p eId="para_1095">The purpose of the consultancy project is to determine whether the structures in the health system are the most appropriate and responsive to meet current and future service needs, constitute an adequate framework for overall governance of the health system, achieve an effective integration of services across all parts of the system, adequately represent the views of consumers in the planning and delivery of services, focus sufficiently upon the principles of equity, accountability, quality and people-centredness and the national goals of the health strategy and to recommend any changes believed to be necessary as a result of the analysis, including an implementation strategy for any changes proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1096">The audit is critically examining the number and configuration of existing health organisations – there are over 50 agencies in the system – their interaction with one another and the Department of Health and Children, the adequacy of governance arrangements and the scope for rationalisation.

The primary focus of the audit is to establish the organisational improvements needed to strengthen the capacity of the health system to meet the challenges of implementing the programme of development and growth, modernisation and reform set out in the quality and fairness strategy document.</p>

          <p eId="para_1098">The most recent information released by the Central Statistics Office states that 67 deaths from suicide were registered during the first quarter of this year. Some 15 of these registered suicides relate to the Dublin area. My Department does not, however, have information about how many of these 15 registrations relate to the north inner city. Information relating to suicides registered during the second quarter of this year is to be released by the Central Statistics Office shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1099">Considerable progress has been made to date in the implementation of the recommendations of the report of the national task force on suicide. Many of the recommendations of the task force, however, require continuous development particularly in the area of training and in the development of services relating to suicide and suicide prevention. I am fully committed to supporting suicide prevention programmes and the health strategy Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, published last year, includes a commitment to intensify the existing suicide prevention programmes over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1100">In order to further reduce the number of suicides it is essential that people undergoing life crises should get appropriate support. In this regard over €6 million has been provided since the publication of the report of the task force on suicide towards suicide prevention and towards research aimed at improving understanding of this issue. Additional funding has also been made available to further develop child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry and old age psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and to provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. The additional resources required to continue the work in suicide prevention will be considered in the context of the overall determination of expenditure for mental health services for 2003 and subsequent years.</p>

          <p eId="para_1102">The national client eligibility index being implemented by the GMS Payments Board aims to provide a central database of all persons eligible for health services, without duplication. The implementation of the index was piloted in the North-Eastern Health Board during the first quarter of this year. The lessons learned from the pilot were that the implementation of the index will have a significant impact on existing business processes. Over the past number of months, the GMS Payments Board and health boards conducted a review of the scope of the changes necessary. The project is scheduled to be recommenced in the immediate future and the GMS Payments Board plans to roll the project out to all health boards during 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1119">The provision of health services in County Kerry is a matter for the Southern Health Board in the first instance. The cardiovascular health strategy, Building Healthier Hearts, which was launched in July 1999, sets out a blue print for tackling heart disease in Ireland. It addresses the common aspects of prevention of all cardiovascular diseases, as well as the detection, treatment and rehabilitation of patients with coronary heart disease. The overall aims identified by the strategy are to reduce the risk factor profile in the general population, detect those at high risk, deal effectively with those who have clinical disease, and ensure the best survival and quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">When the strategy was launched a number of implementation structures were established at national and regional level. These included the Heart Health Task Force, the Advisory Forum on Cardiovascular Health and regional committees at health authority-board level. A co-ordinated, systematic and sustainable approach to the implementation of the strategy has been adopted through the prioritisation of its recommendations as advised by the Advisory Forum on Cardiovascular Health. In the first three years of the cardiovascular health strategy €45 million has been allocated to its implementation and has advanced the implementation in all sectors including the hospital sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">In this regard during 2001, a working group was set up and chaired by Comhairle na nOspidéal with representatives from the Department of Health and Children and the Advisory Forum on Cardiovascular Health to plan the future consultant cardiologist requirements needed to implement the recommendations of the cardiovascular health strategy. This group submitted in May 2001 an interim report recommending 25 additional consultant cardiology posts. Of these 25 posts, nine are planned for this year. The report acknowledged the requirement for a consultant cardiologist at Tralee General Hospital and this will be a matter for future discussions between officials of my Department and the Southern Health Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">The Southern Health Board, in line with the cardiovascular health strategy, published a five year action plan covering the years 2000 to 2004. It includes key actions in the areas of health promotion, primary care, hospital care and surveillance. This action plan identified the developments necessary to enable Tralee General Hospital to enhance its cardiology services. In excess of €503,000 has been made available to the hospital over the first three years of the strategy. This money provides for the recruitment of an additional 12.5 staff. It has also allowed the hospital to purchase essential cardiac equipment for the cardiology services. This strengthening of infrastructure has enabled Tralee General Hospital to develop a cardiac rehabilitation service, a cardiac non-invasive diagnostic service and to extend its telemetry service and its resuscitation training programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">Last year I gave approval to the Southern Health Board to proceed with the planning and construction of a new €82.5 million cardiac and renal dialysis building at Cork University Hospital. The development will include a coronary care unit and a cardiology department with an expanded role in the provision cardio-thoracic surgery. This project will enable Cork University Hospital to provide a quality, functional tertiary service that will address the clinical needs of the Cork and Kerry region and also the wider Munster region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">The Southern Health Board recently opened a new chest pain clinic at Cork University Hospital. This is an important step in the early diagnosis of patients with a high risk of coronary disease. This clinic will provide a model for the introduction of further chest pain clinics to be developed at other centres in the Southern Health Board region.</p>

          <p eId="para_1126">I am aware that conditions for both patients and staff at the Central Mental Hospital are unsatisfactory at present. Since 1999, over €500,000 has been spent on refurbishment of the old Victorian building. However, there is an acceptance by all parties that a more substantial redevelopment is required at the hospital. In December, 2000, the East Coast Area Health Board, in conjunction with the Eastern Regional Health Authority, the Department Of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and the Department of Health and Children established a group to review the future role of the Central Mental Hospital.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">The group was set up to advise on proposals for the future of the Central Mental Hospital in the context of national and regional services provided by the hospital, linkages with community psychiatric services, linkages with the criminal justice system, legislation, the training role of the Central Mental Hospital for medical, nursing and paramedical staff and future accommodation and resource requirements. The group has now concluded its work and its report was submitted to the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Department of Health and Children earlier this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">The report includes plans to modernise, refurbish and extend the existing building and to provide a new residence on the campus. Overall capacity would increase from 90 to 120. I have accepted, in principle, the main thrust of the report of the review group and my Department is establishing a special project team, representative of all the main stakeholders, including the Irish Prisons Service, to progress the matter as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_1135">The home help scheme was introduced in 1972 under a provision of the 1970 Health Act. At that time, the chief executive officers of the health boards took a collective decision not to engage family members and relatives as paid home helps. This was in recognition of the fact that the initiative was not intended to replace the existing informal arrangements whereby family members and relatives provided assistance in the tasks of daily living to many old people living at home. Legally, family members are not debarred from acting as home helps but the practice has been that they provided support to older relatives, without payment. There have, I understand, been some instances where a distant relative, e.g., a cousin, has been employed as a home help but these have been in exceptional circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">I am happy to say that things have improved for informal family carers in recent years. The carer's allowance is available, from the Department of Social and Family Affairs, to qualified applicants, and the health boards have received specific funding to provide support and assistance to family carers. This funding now amounts to just over €6 million per annum.</p>

          <p eId="para_1153">I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 350 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. Entitlement to secondary care orthodontic treatment is determined by reference to orthodontic guidelines, a set of objective clinical criteria applied by health board orthodontists when assessing children's priority of need for treatment. The orthodontic guidelines were issued by my Department in 1985 and are still in use. The orthodontic guidelines are used to ensure that orthodontic resources are prioritised for and applied equitably to the most severe cases. When a health board orthodontist decides that a child is in clinical need of orthodontic treatment in accordance with the criteria, he or she is then placed on a treatment waiting list.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">The guidelines are intended to enable health boards to identify in a consistent way those in greatest need and to commence timely treatment for them. A child who has been assessed and comes within the guidelines will remain on the waiting list until treatment commences. It is widely recognised that decisions made in the private sector regarding orthodontic treatment are based primarily on subjective need and are not based on any evidence linking the orthodontic condition to any aspect of dental ill health. On the other hand decisions made in health boards are based on prioritised guidelines ensuring that cases are selected for treatment based on the objective severity of the condition.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis. The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service: ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service. This year, my Department expects to fund 11 dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These 11 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">In the short-term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients. Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners. The chief executive officers of the health boards have further informed me that at the end of the June 2002 quarter, there were 19,055 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 1,760 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in December 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</p>

          <p eId="para_1167">This falls considerably short of the national target of 95% which is required to provide population immunity. I am concerned about the unsatisfactory immunisation uptake rates because of the risk of unimmunised children contracting the potentially serious diseases concerned. In 2001, a national immunisation steering committee was established by health board chief executives to address a wide range of issues relating to the childhood and other immunisation programmes, including the identification of issues relating to the achievement of uptake targets. Mr. Seán Hurley, chief executive officer, Southern Health Board, chaired the steering committee and its members included experts from key bodies and professional organisations involved with immunisation both at national and local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">The steering committee was assisted by four working groups which examined the areas of communication, material management, IT systems and planning and organisation in relation to immunisation. In addition, a consultation process was arranged which included the invitation of submissions from key stakeholders including parents. On 22 April 2002, I launched the report of the steering committee. This report is the first step towards improving immunisation uptake and also enhancing and developing the key systems which underpin the immunisation programmes. A national immunisation implementation group was established in July 2002 and is responsible for co-ordinating the planning and implementation of immunisation programmes in order to improve uptake. This group reports to the national steering committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">In order to reassure the public as to the safety of MMR vaccine and to address the negative media coverage on this issue which adds to the confusion of parents in deciding whether or not to vaccinate their children, earlier this year I launched a document entitled "Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine Discussion Pack – an information guide for health professionals and parents". The pack was produced by the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the department of public health, Southern Health Board, and was published by the health boards executive on behalf of the health boards. This document sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The pack addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism, the safety of the vaccine, combined versus single doses and contraindications to the vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">The primary concern of the Department of Health and Children in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. The Irish Medicines Board and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland support the use of MMR on the grounds that it has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective vaccine. There is a sound evidence basis for the use of MMR in the national programme. I would like to take this opportunity to again urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme in order to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with their general practitioner before making a decision about their child's immunisation.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_1172">The use of fluoride technology is known to manifest a positive oral health outcome. Local and national surveys and studies conducted since the introduction of fluoridation in this country attest to the reduced dental decay levels of children and teenagers in fluoridated areas compared to those residing in non-fluoridated areas. The safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation has been endorsed by a number of international and reputable bodies such as the World Health Organisation, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States public health service and the United States surgeon general.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">Despite these endorsements, I decided to establish the Forum on Fluoridation to review the fluoridation of public piped water supplies in Ireland. The forum's report was recently launched and its main conclusion was that the fluoridation of public piped water supplies should continue as a public health measure, subject to the recommendations of the forum. The forum also concluded that water fluoridation has been very effective in improving the oral health of the Irish population, especially of children, but also of adults and the elderly. The best available and most reliable scientific evidence indicates that at the maximum permitted level of fluoride in drinking water at one part per million, human health is not adversely affected. Dental fluorosis – a form of discolouration of the tooth enamel – is a well-recognised condition and an indicator of overall fluoride absorption, whether from natural sources, fluoridated water or from the inappropriate use of fluoride toothpaste at a young age. There is evidence that the prevalence of dental fluorosis is increasing in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">The forum consisted of people with expert knowledge spanning the areas of public health, biochemistry, dental health, bone health, food safety, environmental protection, ethics, water quality, health promotion and representatives from the consumer and environmental areas. This diversity of professional backgrounds and representation was reflected in the comprehensive way the forum conducted its work and research. The forum's report emerged from 14 plenary meetings, several meetings of sub-groups and oral presentations of material from both proponents and opponents of fluoridation. The forum invited the public to forward their views and examined more than 1,000 submissions. The forum took a participatory and evidence based approach striving to ensure balance between participants from both sides of the debate on water fluoridation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">The report made 33 recommendations covering a broad range of topics such as research, public awareness, and policy and technical aspects of fluoridation. The forum's report was launched on 10 September 2002 and was circulated to each Member of this House. It has also been placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas. Following publication of the report, I have asked my Department to establish an expert body as recommended by the forum. This expert body will oversee the implementation of the wide-ranging recommendations of the forum and advise me on all aspects of fluoride going forward. In particular, ongoing research related to fluoride will continue to be evaluated by the expert body and expanded to deal with new emerging issues.</p>

He travelled to the United States and spoke to a number of relevant experts, including the lead counsel in the HIV haemophiliac litigation in the United States. Mr. Gardiner also received legal advice from a major New York law firm in relation to the matters relevant to his investigations. I received Mr. Gardiner's report on 5 March and briefed my Cabinet colleagues on the contents of the report on 7 March. I provided the Irish Haemophilia Society with a copy of the report.

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_1179">The provision of health related support services, including occupational therapy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. Funding is also provided to the health boards to address the waiting lists on a priority basis. The first priority is individual needs. Other needs such as centre-based needs may be addressed as resources permit. Accordingly, the Deputy's question has been referred to the chief executive officer of the South-Eastern Health Board with a request that he examine the matter and reply directly to the Deputy, as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">Furthermore, I wish to advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates. The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the numbers of therapy professionals over the next 15 years including an increase of over 150% in occupational therapists. This will require a significant increase in training places with a recommended annual increase of 75 places for occupational therapy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">To advance this core recommendation of the report, an inter-agency working group, comprising officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places. On 29 May 2002 the former Minister for Education and Science, Dr. Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present and it is expected that the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-2004 academic year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the Expert Group on Various Health Professions – published April 2000.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_1184">The report of the Lindsay tribunal relating to the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia was published on 5 September last. The report is a lengthy and detailed document. The tribunal sat for 196 days and heard evidence from 146 witnesses. In addition, the tribunal heard the personal testimonies of some of those who were infected and the next of kin of some of those members of the haemophilia community who have passed away. I am sure that I speak for everyone in the House in expressing our sorrow at the suffering that all of these people have endured.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">The report finds that 104 people with haemophilia were infected with HIV through blood products. Of these, the tribunal finds that 96 were infected by products imported into the country and eight were infected by products made by the Blood Transfusion Services Board. The records of the Virus Reference Laboratory recorded 217 persons with haemophilia tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies. The tribunal regards this as a minimum figure. It is understood that approximately 70 of those people infected with HIV have died. The report examines the response of various persons and bodies in the State in dealing with the emerging problems of HIV and hepatitis C and criticises a number of bodies. They include the BTSB, the National Haemophilia Treatment Centre, certain treating doctors and the Department of Health and Children. The report makes eight recommendations and I am examining these with a view to their early implementation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">In relation to referral of the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions, I indicated shortly after it was published that I needed time to study the report in order to make an informed decision on the matter. I also wished to discuss the report with representatives of the Irish Haemophilia Society which I did last Wednesday. I will make my final decision on the matter shortly.</p>

In any event, I would point out that additional funding totalling €17.2 million has been made available over the past two years for the development of out of hours co-operatives, of which €2.22 million was allocated to the South-Eastern Health Board. This dedicated funding is exclusive of the fees paid to participating general practitioners. All decisions in relation to the geographical areas to be covered by co-operatives and the order of their commencement are matters for the relevant health board to make, having due regard to the range of financial and other issues involved. My Department will pursue the continuing expansion of co-operatives in 2003 in the context of the Estimates process.</p>

          <p eId="para_1190">The Government decision to extend automatic medical card eligibility to all persons aged 70 years and over with effect from 1 July 2001 was announced on budget day in December 2000. It was originally estimated that 39,000 persons would benefit from this initiative. This was based on the CSO estimate of persons in this age category and the deduction of those already registered as medical card holders. However, it subsequently came to light that the health board-GMS databases of medical cardholders in the over 70s age category were inaccurate. Following a targeted review by health boards of medical card lists for the over 70s, in excess of 15,100 duplicate entries and entries for deceased persons have so far been removed from those lists. My Department has now requested the chief executive officers of the health boards to arrange for an immediate full review of the entire GMS list for their functional areas, to be completed by the end of the year. They have also been requested to put in place an effective pro-active management system so as to ensure that the lists are accurate in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">My Department did not prepare an estimate of the cost of the initiative, but supplied such data as was readily available to it in early December 2000 to the Department of Finance in order to assist that Department in determining the likely cost in 2001. It was recognised at the time that implementation of the initiative would require the agreement of both the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union (IPU). Following difficult and protracted negotiations between my Department and the IMO, a deal estimated to cost €19 million annually was agreed in late June 2001, on the basis that there would be 39,000 newly eligible persons in total. My Department is still engaged in negotiations with the IPU in relation to the implementation of the initiative by community pharmacy contractors. The cost in 2002 of implementing the initiative is currently estimated at €83 million gross, and €55 million net when account is taken of consequential savings on the community drugs schemes estimated at €28 million.</p>

However, there are still some outstanding legal issues to be resolved in relation to the study but I am confident these issues will be resolved shortly and that the study will commence without undue delay. The Deputy may wish to note that, in the British study, the prion protein that causes the disease was detected in what is the equivalent to 120 cases per million of population. Ireland, however, has a much lower rate than Britain, with only one confirmed vCJD case, in comparison with 115 vCJD deaths in Britain.</p>

          <p eId="para_1197">The quarterly national household survey (QNHS) published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO) on the 30 May 2002 produced a set of data on health, including data in relation to waiting lists. Some caution should be exercised in the interpretation of this data as it is not directly comparable with the waiting list information published by my Department. For example, the QNHS survey is based on a person's self-perception of their status, and this may differ from the waiting lists of individual consultants reported to my Department by health agencies; patients waiting less than three months for treatment are excluded from waiting list data published by the Department, but this group is not excluded from the QNHS survey; the figure reported by the CSO includes both public and private waiters and, therefore, is not directly comparable with the Department's published figures for public waiting lists only.</p>

While the waiting list initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, a dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment by purchasing treatments for public patients in private hospitals. The national treatment purchase fund expects to treat up to 1,900 patients this year.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_437">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_1208">I propose to take Questions Nos. 134 and 138 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">I established the Crisis Pregnancy Agency on 2 October 2001, under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961. The task of the agency, as a planning and coordinating body, rather than as a provider of services, is to draw up a national strategy to address crisis pregnancy and to oversee its implementation, in consultation with Government and other non-statutory agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">The prevention of crisis pregnancy in the first instance is a primary task of the agency. Preventative issues concerning the education of young adults, as well as services appropriate to their needs and lifestyles will be addressed. The agency will work to develop strategies to make women more aware of their options, should they have a crisis pregnancy, and to improve the supports and assistance available to women in this situation, so that they will feel that they will have genuine alternatives to abortion. Women who have had an abortion, either recently or some time ago, have particular needs also and this is another area which the agency has been asked to address, so that women are treated with compassion and understanding and that both their emotional and physical health needs are attended to.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">The first priority of the agency was the recruitment of key staff. Initially, I appointed Ms Olive Braiden as chairperson on 3 October 2001. I am advised by the agency that a director and two senior managers, administration and programmes and communications. were recruited in June 2002. A research officer and administrative staff are also in place. A health promotion and education officer is currently being recruited. Furthermore, the statutory instrument under which the agency was created provides for the establishment of a 20 person consultative committee which will have the function of providing expert advice to the board of the agency. Those organisations with an interest in the work of the agency will have a forum to present and share their views. The members of the committee have been appointed from various statutory and non-statutory organisations under the chair of Dr. Linda Hogan. It is expected that the first meeting of the committee will be convened shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">In regard to the development of a strategy to address crisis pregnancy in Ireland, the agency advises that as a first step in this process, submissions were invited from members of the public, and approximately 250 have been received. They are currently being examined, coded and analysed. A wide-ranging consultation process is also taking place which will inform the development of a strategy to address crisis pregnancy in Ireland and it is expected that this process will run into 2003. In addition, it is hoped to incorporate an action plan for the coming years in the strategy. This will provide the agency with a framework to implement its strategy in a planned and structured manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">In June of this year, the agency invited funding proposals from key service providers. The merit of each proposal has been assessed and the agency has stated that up to €1 million will be provided in 2002 to carry out innovative work in the areas of information provision and capacity building. The main public information programme being developed by the agency in 2002 is the development of information on supports in crisis pregnancy. The agency expects to be in a position to begin the roll-out of this project from November 2002. Also, the development of a research programme has commenced. The agency has stated that the main priorities for this area include the development of an initial framework, an audit of existing research and an analysis of research gaps. The agency has advised that the following major developments also commenced in 2002: the commissioning of key research on crisis pregnancy counselling, the development of a communications framework and an audit of services provided nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1214">In conclusion, the establishment of the Crisis Pregnancy Agency is intended to play a major role in the development of co-ordinated, responsive and appropriate services. The Government hopes that, over time, it will be possible to reduce the incidence of unwanted pregnancies among Irish women and ensure that women who find themselves in this situation will have available to them the widest possible range of assistance to help them deal with their situation.</p>

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_438">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_1217">The subject of cloning is one that raises a wide range of very sensitive and complex issues with associated legal, ethical, social and medical implications. While there is no legislation regulating this area, medical practice is governed by guidelines issued by the Medical Council. These provide that the creation of embryos for experimental purposes would be professional misconduct. I am conscious of the degree of concern among the public about the absence of a statutory framework to regulate cloning and a range of other issues associated with the area of assisted human reproduction, including research on embryos.</p>
          <p eId="para_1218">With a view to addressing these concerns in a comprehensive and informed way, a commission on assisted human reproduction was established in March 2000 with the following terms of reference: to prepare a report on the possible approaches to the regulation of all areas of assisted human reproduction and the social, ethical and legal factors to be taken into account in determining public policy in this area. The commission has met on 14 occasions to date. The first meeting was held on 26 July 2000 and the most recent on 12 September 2002. I understand that the commission has adopted an interdisciplinary approach to its work. Initially, each discipline – medical, legal scientific and social – prepared a report outlining the current position within that discipline in relation to assisted human reproduction. Working groups were then formed to examine specific topics and issues that needed to be addressed. The working groups meet on a regular basis to discuss their tasks and to progress the work of the commission. I have been informed that the work group structure facilitates close attention to a relatively limited range of topics by a highly specialised group. It also facilitates the detailed exploration of a range of ethical and social implications that arise from assisted human reproduction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1219">The commission organised a one-day conference for commission members and an invited audience of about thirty, in Dublin Castle in September 2001. The conference dealt with the social, ethical and legal factors inherent in assisted human reproduction. It provided an opportunity for an exchange of views between experts in the various fields from Ireland, the UK, France and Germany. When the commission was set up, I indicated that it would be required to seek submissions from the public and to consult appropriate interests. In order to inform itself on the current state of public opinion in Ireland on assisted human reproduction, the commission placed an advertisement in the newspapers inviting interested members of the public, professional or voluntary organisations and other parties who wished to do so to make written submissions before Wednesday, 31 October 2001. Over 1,600 submissions were received by the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">I understand that the commission has engaged in a number of information gathering exercises that include: (i) survey of assisted human reproduction services provided in specialised clinics – a survey instrument was drafted by the commission with a view to establishing the extent of the provision of assisted human reproduction services in Ireland; (ii) survey of GPs – the commission issued a survey instrument to a random sample of 50% of GPs in all health board areas. I understand that a high proportion of those surveyed responded; (iii) survey of obstetricians and gynaecologists – the commission also issued a survey instrument to obstetricians and gynaecologists to elicit information on their level of involvement in assisted human reproduction services. The various working groups are now nearing the end of their specific tasks and I understand that as part of its ongoing consultation and to assist in shaping its final report, the commission will hold a public conference in February 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_1221">Given the difficult nature of the issues to be examined it is not possible to be definitive about the length of time it will take the commission to complete its work, but I am satisfied that it is making significant progress and will continue to work as expeditiously as is feasible. The publication of the commission's report will provide the basis for informed public debate before the finalisation of any policy proposals.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_439">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_1224">I propose to take Questions Nos. 137 and 301 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1225">I welcome the report on equity of access to acute hospital care by the National Economic and Social Forum which focuses on the promotion of equity in access to hospital care, with particular reference to reducing waiting lists and waiting times for public patients and giving greater priority to tackling inequalities in health status as between different groups in our society. I welcome the recognition in the report that the implementation of the health strategy Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You can achieve greater equity in access to health care for the most vulnerable groups in our society. The health strategy outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services up to 2011. It provides a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system, improved access for public patients and actions to address the issue of waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1226">The total number of people on public hospital waiting lists at 31 March 2002, the latest date for which figures have been published, was 25,105. The comparable figure for 31 March 2001 was 26,382. This represents a decrease of 5% on the comparable figure for March 2001. In the period March 2001 to March 2002, there has been a reduction of 62% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for cardiac surgery and a reduction of 67% in the number of children waiting more than six months for cardiac surgery. There has been a reduction of 34% in the number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for ENT procedures and a fall of 33% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for ophthalmology procedures in the period March 2001 to March 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">A new dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment by purchasing treatments for public patients in private hospitals. The national treatment purchase fund expects to treat up to 1,900 patients this year. As part of the preparatory work for the strategy my Department conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of this review, the Government has decided to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. Earlier this year I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals at a cost of €65 million. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 258 of these beds have been commissioned under this initiative to date. The latest advice to my Department from the Eastern Regional Health Authority – ERHA – and the health boards indicates in excess of 600 beds will be in place by year end and that the remainder will be commissioned early in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">Initiatives at community level, such as further development of GP co-operative cover arrangements on a national basis, will serve to reduce demand. In this regard, it is intended that a number of teams will come together to provide out-of-hours coverage for population groups. The primary care task force to drive these and other initiatives outlined in the primary care strategy has been established and proposals from health boards for the first tranche of implementation projects are currently under consideration. In the wider context, the Government's review of the national anti-poverty strategy – Building an Inclusive Society – includes specific targets for the health sector and these have been included in the health strategy. Measures aimed at improving equity of access to acute care are a key component to support the achievement of these targets.</p>

          <p eId="para_1233">In so far as the most significant bodies under the aegis of my Department are concerned the list is as follows: the National Economic and Social Forum was re-constituted by way of a Government decision in December 1997 with a new mandate to focus on issues of equality and social inclusion. In the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it was agreed by the social partners to establish the National Centre for Partnership and Performance (NCPP), which was appointed in July 2000. The NESDO Bill, 2002, provides for the establishment of the National Economic and Social Development Office, incorporating NESC, NESF and NCPP. The three bodies will continue to work on a non-statutory basis until the Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">The National Statistics Board is established under the Statistics Act, 1993. The Information Society Commission (ISC) is a non-statutory body and there are no proposals to give the Commission a statutory basis. The first commission was established in 1997 and the second commission was established in November 2001. The National Forum on Europe was established in October 2001 by the Taoiseach in agreement with all other bodies. It was set up to foster public debate on the European Union. There are no plans to place it on a statutory basis at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">As the Deputy will appreciate, my Department is involved in a range of cross-departmental activities and initiatives, including many groups or bodies which are under the auspices of other Departments. The SMI implementation group of secretaries general was established in 1997.  Since 1997, the implementation group has established a number of sub groups covering a range of issues relevant to the modernisation of the public service . At present these include groups on human resource management, financial management, quality customer service, the evaluation of the SMI and communications. The High Level Group on Regulation was established following publication of the OECD review on regulatory reform in Ireland in April 2001. There are no plans to establish any of these groups on a statutory basis. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution was established on 16 October 1997. This is an informal committee, the secretariat of which is provided by the IPA.</p>

          <p eId="para_1241">I propose to take Questions Nos. 142, 143 and 149 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">In accordance with the Government's decision in 1999 to restructure community employment, participation levels are gradually being reduced reflecting the significant reduction in the numbers of the long-term unemployed and the shift in emphasis away from work experience programmes to training, from which there is a greater level of progression to employment. CE is a temporary work experience programme and participation is usually limited to a period of one to three years depending on the age and duration of unemployment of the participant when commencing on the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">CE participation levels are expected to finish the year at a level of 25,000 places. There are currently in the region of 26,000 participants on the programme. The reduction in numbers in 2002 is due to the ongoing mainstreaming of schools places, the continued restructuring of the programme as outlined in the PPF and the need to run the programme within the budget available. The average participation rate on CE in 2002 is expected to be 28,000 at a cost of €333 million. People with disabilities, including persons in receipt of the disability allowance, are currently eligible and will remain eligible to participate in CE subject to approval, as appropriate, by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and compliance with the usual programme criteria.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">FÁS is currently undertaking an internal review of CE, which will include an assessment of the role of the programme in regard to the provision of community services. The PPF-mandated review of active labour market programmes is also being progressed under the aegis of the standing committee on the labour market chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group is considering options for the future of CE and the provision of community services. The outcome of these various initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future delivery of certain community services and appropriate levels of CE for 2003 and future years.</p>

          <p eId="para_1254">The company concerned is registered on the records of the Companies Registration Office but despite every effort on the part of the staff of my Department they have been unable to make contact with the company in recent days.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">I propose to list in a general way the payments that the employees may be entitled to from the information supplied in the Deputy's question. In regard to specific problems, the best advice I can give is for the employees to contact their local social welfare office and the information unit of my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">In the case of employer insolvency, in order for employees to claim payment of outstanding wages, holiday pay, minimum notice, etc, under the insolvency payments scheme, their employer, if it is a limited liability company, must be in liquidation or receivership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">In the case of redundancy, when an employer ceases trading the employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy payment if they have at least two years service with the company. If they consider that they may qualify for such a payment they should contact the redundancy payments section of my Department for details of the application forms, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">The Payment of Wages Act, 1991, provides a right of complaint to a rights commissioner for any employee who has had an unlawful deduction made from wages and this includes non-payment of wages. A complaint must be presented to a rights commissioner within six months of the non-payment, which gave rise to the complaint. A decision of the rights commissioner or a determination of the employment appeals tribunal under the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, may specify a date before which the decision or determination must be carried out. If no date is specified, the decision or determination must be carried out within six weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">If a decision of a rights commissioner is not appealed or carried out by the due date by the party concerned, the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, provides that the decision may be enforced as if it were an order of the Circuit Court made in civil proceedings by the judge of the Circuit Court where the person, in whose favour the rights commissioner made the decision, resides. Therefore, employees with favourable decisions should contact their local Circuit Court office regarding the enforcement of their decisions. However, it is worth noting that before employees embark on such a course of action they should be aware as to whether the employer – company or individual – has assets against which a judgment might be enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">Under section 19 of the Organisation of Working Time Act, 1997, an employee is entitled to annual leave calculated as follows: four working weeks in a leave year in which he or she works at least 1,365 hours – unless it is a leave year in which he or she changes employment – or one third of a working week for each month in the leave year in which he or she works 117 hours, or 8% of the hours he or she works in a leave year, but subject to a maximum of four working weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">If an employer refuses to give employees their statutory notice or redundancy entitlements under the Act, payment in lieu of such notice or grant an employee his or her annual leave entitlement the employee may refer a complaint to a rights commissioner for redress. However, it is worth repeating that before employees embark on such a course of action they should be aware as to whether the employer – company or individual – has assets against which a judgment might be enforced though in the case of awards of the employment appeals tribunal under the Redundancy Payments Acts, payment may be sought from the social insurance fund even if the employer has ceased trading and not been formally declared insolvent.</p>

In co-operation with my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, I arranged that the farm assist scheme take account of the situation faced by farmers. I obtained EU Commission approval to bring forward the payment of 50% of arable aid due to cereal farmers to 16 October.

          <p eId="para_1287">I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 173 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">Under the rules for calculation of import duties for cereals following the GATT agreement, an allowance is made for the cost of shipping cereals to the EU. When these rules were first drawn up in 1995, a deduction of €10 was made from import prices from Black Sea and Baltic ports to take account of lower shipping costs from those regions. This effectively put a premium of €10 per tonne on duties for such imports compared to cereals coming from the USA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">Following a review of this premium last year, the European Commission concluded that it was not justified and evidence of comparative shipping costs was produced to prove this point. The premium was dropped in November despite strong opposition from a number of member states, including Ireland which voted against the proposal. The problem of eastern European imports has been discussed on a number of occasions subsequently. The Commission is adamant that the €10 premium was not justified and has ruled out any possibility of it being restored.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">However, the real problem lies in the reference price system which is used to calculate import duties. Under that system, US prices are used as a reference for cereals entering the EU from all sources, including eastern Europe, where prices are considerably lower than US prices. This has the effect of allowing imports from eastern Europe at lower duties than would be warranted if prices for that region were used. Negotiations are currently taking place between the EU and its WTO trading partners aimed at resolving this problem and I am hopeful that a satisfactory solution will be found in the not too distant future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1292">It is my policy and that of the Government to ensure that Irish beef exporters have unrestricted access to markets worldwide and intensive efforts at diplomatic, political and technical levels have been made over the past two years by my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia to bring about this objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">It has been my experience that where restrictions on Irish exports of beef exist because of concerns about BSE, the most effective way of addressing this has been to underpin political and diplomatic pressure by demonstrating in practice to the relevant experts from those countries the controls throughout the sector. This approach was adopted successfully in relation to Russia and Egypt and is being continued with regard to a number of other potentially significant markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">My Department, with the assistance of Bord Bia, last week hosted a conference in Dublin on food safety and consumer protection in the beef sector aimed specifically at important markets in the Gulf region. The conference, which was attended by veterinary and food safety experts from Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, afforded the visiting experts from those Gulf states the opportunity to assess the level and effectiveness of Ireland's BSE controls and I am pleased to say that reaction to the conference has been very positive. We are also in ongoing contact with the South African, Philippine and Indonesian authorities at technical and diplomatic level with a view to having those markets reopened to Irish beef.</p>

          <p eId="para_1296">To protect the public against the threat of rabies Ireland operates a quarantine system for pet dogs and cats imported from countries other than the UK. A common travel arrangement with the UK – also free of rabies – has been in place for some decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">In 2000, the UK introduced a PETS scheme, whereby pet dogs and cats can be imported into the UK from certain countries without quarantine under strict vaccination and identification requirements, on a pilot basis. Ireland's quarantine system was adjusted to take account of this development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">A common position for a new harmonised system for the movement of such animals both between EU member states and from counties outside the EU has now been agreed by the EU Council. Under this system, quarantine will not be a requirement for direct imports into Ireland of pet dogs and cats from specified rabies free countries provided that vaccination, blood test and identification requirements are strictly adhered to. The continued protection of public health against the threat of rabies remains of paramount importance. The proposed new system is now before the European Parliament and is expected to be implemented in 2003. Ireland will make the adjustments necessary to facilitate this system.</p>

However, the European Commission questioned Ireland's original proposal that there would be no minimum stocking density requirement under the area-based compensatory allowance scheme. The Commission wished to ensure that land was being farmed, thus preventing problems of undergrazing. Ireland then proposed a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare, and this was accepted by the Commission. The minimum stocking density will not apply where agri-environment or other recognised environmental measures require a lower stocking density.</p>

Also, the rate of aid for casein production was increased in three steps by 83%. In addition, large quantities of butter and skimmed milk powder have been placed in intervention, thereby removing large volumes of product from the market.

I am satisfied that I have fully discharged these functions and I will continue to do so into the future. In relation to markets, no effort will be spared until Irish beef has full and unrestricted access to all of our traditional export markets and in that context a number of important decisions have been taken in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">I am concerned that the dispute could lead to the build-up of cattle and disrupt supplies to our major markets and that would not be in the interests of producers or processors.

          <p eId="para_2009">The metal composition of euro coins was decided by a Council regulation in 1998. Nickel was already widely used in national coins in Europe, including Irish coins. It is also used in coins in many other countries throughout the world including for example the five cent coin in the United States.</p>
          <p eId="para_2010">There is now far less nickel in coins in circulation than was the case before the euro was introduced. Nickel is used in only two of the euro coins – the €1 and €2 coins. By contrast, nickel was used in the 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p and £1 coins of Irish currency. This pattern is replicated throughout the euro area. As a result 85% of euro coins, in terms of the number of coins in circulation, are nickel-free as opposed to 25% of the national coins that they replaced.</p>
          <p eId="para_2011">I am also informed by the Central Bank that since the introduction of euro coins into circulation, they have received no reports of nickel allergy problems arising from the coins.</p>

          <p eId="para_2013">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that there has been no change in practice in relation to the taxation of awards for damages due for discrimination, sexual harassment and so on in the workplace. While the specific facts of each case must be examined to determine whether a specific award is taxable or not, it has always been the view of the Revenue Commissioners that, in general, these type of awards are liable to income tax. This view is based on the wide-ranging provisions of the legislation governing the taxation of income from offices and employments as set out in section 112 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_2014">In general, the type of awards referred to by the Deputy are payable by employers for breach of employees' rights under the Employment Equality Acts.

          <p eId="para_2016">Ireland's debt strategy for developing countries was launched publicly last July. The debt strategy document, prepared jointly by Ireland Aid and the Department of Finance, was forwarded to Ireland's representatives at the IMF and the World Bank in advance of the recent annual meetings of these institutions. Both executive boards are fully aware of Ireland's policy on developing country debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_2017">May I remind Deputies of the Government position in relation to debt cancellation as stated in the debt strategy document. We have concluded that, in principle, the total cancellation of the debts of the heavily indebted poor countries is a politically acceptable objective and one that we would support. Total cancellation would, however, have to be funded largely through additional donor contributions. In order to mobilise the necessary funds for total debt cancellation, a greater number of donors, particularly the larger economies, would have to increase their ODA more rapidly and take concrete steps to meeting the UN target of 0.7% of GNP on ODA.</p>
          <p eId="para_2018">The total cancellation of HIPC debts should be accompanied by strong monitoring and accountability mechanisms to ensure that the additional funds available to HIPC governments, through debt cancellation, would be directly channelled into increased social expenditure, particularly HIV/AIDS, and not abused through corruption.</p>
          <p eId="para_2019">While we support, in principle, the total cancellation of HIPC country debts we believe that, in practice, the additional donor contributions required to achieve this will be difficult to mobilise. The additional ODA commitments made by major donors, the EU and the US, at the international conference on financing for development would not be sufficient to cover total debt cancellation. In any case, these contributions will be used to fund a number of development activities and not just debt relief.</p>

          <p eId="para_2323">My Department does not have a comprehensive database on pupils in the primary school sector and unfortunately, therefore, the information sought by the Deputy is not readily available. However, the 2002 NESF report on early school leaving estimated that approximately 1,000 children are in this category.</p>
          <p eId="para_2324">As the Deputy will be aware, this is a complex and difficult issue and one not amenable to quick fix or easy solutions. It is only by sustained action across a number of fronts – curricular, legislative and direct support – that progress can be made in relation to increasing the rate of retention at all levels of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_2325">Since 1997 a range of programmes have been enhanced or initiated by my Department to address educational disadvantage at primary level and to improve opportunities for children likely to be at risk of early school leaving. Among these, the home-school-community liaison scheme is a preventative strategy that is targeted at pupils who are at risk of not reaching their potential in the educational system because of background characteristics which tend to affect adversely pupil attainment and school retention.</p>
          <p eId="para_2326">The school completion programme, which subsumed the eight to 15 early school leaver initiative and the Stay in School retention initiative, aims to have a significant positive impact on levels of pupils retention in primary and second level schools and on numbers of pupils who successfully complete the senior cycle. The school completion programme is a key component of the Department's strategy to discriminate positively in favour of children and young people who are at risk of or who are experiencing educational disadvantage. The programme is funded on a multi-annual basis under the National Development Plan, NDP, with assistance from the European Social Fund or ESF.</p>
          <p eId="para_2327">The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, which came into effect on 5 July 2002, provides for the introduction of a comprehensive school attendance service, with responsibility for school attendance being given to a newly established body – the National Educational Welfare Board. An educational welfare officer will be assigned to every school for the purposes of the Act. The Act requires schools to draw up school attendance strategies in order to promote regular attendance and to foster an appreciation of learning among students. The strategy will focus on arrangements for the identification of children who are at risk of dropping out of school at an early stage so that appropriate interventions may be put in place. The board will also assist schools in discharging their responsibilities under the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_2328">The National Educational Psychological Service Agency, or NEPS, which was established on 1 September 1999 and is an executive agency of my Department, has delegated authority to develop and provide an educational psychological service to all students in primary and post-primary schools and in certain other centres supported by the Department. I assure the Deputy of the continued commitment of the Government to address the problem of early school leaving.</p>

          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Mr. N. Dempsey):</from>
          <p eId="para_2349">The pupil-teacher ratio at primary level has improved significantly from 21.7 in the 1997/98 school year to 19.0 in the 2001-02 school year. The Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to continue to reduce the pupil teacher ratio in primary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_2350">The staffing level of a primary school is determined by the enrolment in the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule, which is decided upon for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The only deviation from the agreed staffing schedule is in the case of schools classified as "developing schools".</p>
          <p eId="para_2351">Once the staffing schedule is determined, a circular issues to all primary schools setting out the regulations governing the appointment and retention of teachers for the following school year. The terms for obtaining a post as a "developing school" are also outlined in the circular. The schedule for the current school year was set out in circular letter 9/02 which issued to the board of management of each school in February 2002. I expect that all schools have the staffing levels to which they are entitled in the current school year.</p>
          <p eId="para_2352">The Deputy may also be aware that I recently established an independent appeals board to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board will operate independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision will be final. A circular outlining these new procedures has recently been issued to all primary schools.</p>

An examination of this report is now nearing completion.</p>
          <p eId="para_2374">The Deputy will appreciate that the feasibility study was necessary because of several difficulties associated with the provision of the proposed new gymnasium. Not least of these difficulties is the confined nature of the site. Additional complications arise because of the proximity of the school to the historically important Kilkenny city wall. In this regard, an archaeological report was also necessary to assist with the determination of how provision of the gymnasium might properly be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_2375">The Deputy is probably also aware that my Department has developed a template-designed physical education hall, which will be piloted in four schools nationwide in the very near future. Unfortunately, the site of the Presentation secondary school cannot accommodate the template because of the difficulties mentioned. In the circumstances, alternative solutions must be explored which not only satisfy the requirements of the school, but which are also architecturally sound and take due cognisance of the local historical environment. By the nature of the complexities involved, it is inevitable that the project may not proceed as expeditiously as others.</p>

Later this year when a financial allocation has been made for the primary school building programme in the 2003 Estimates I will frame a further comprehensive programme of works that will proceed to construction and the school concerned will be one of those considered for inclusion in that programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2402">My Department will be in contact with the schools concerned when the programme for 2003 is published.</p>

          <p eId="para_2404">My Department has allocated resource teacher support to 122 primary schools in County Kerry and 106 of these schools have sanction for at least one resource teacher on a full-time or shared basis. The remaining 16 schools have such provision in the form of part-time hours while 22 primary schools in the county do not currently have resource teacher support. However, such support is allocated only where deemed necessary on the basis of the professionally assessed needs of children attending the school. My Department is continuing to allocate additional resource teacher support on an ongoing basis in response to assessed needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2405">In September 1999 the learning support – remedial – teacher service was extended to all primary schools with a pupil teacher ratio of 10:1 or above. Schools with lower pupil teacher ratios were advised that they could seek a remedial service where they could demonstrate a need for such a service. There are currently 50 remedial posts in primary schools in County Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_2406">All 27 post-primary schools in County Kerry have a remedial teaching provision. Of these, eight schools have been allocated one or more full remedial teaching posts. Partial remedial posts have been allocated to the remaining schools. My Department has allocated additional teaching resources to cater for students with special needs to 25 of the post primary schools in County Kerry. Of these, 14 schools have one or more full resource teaching posts and 11 schools have a part time provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_2426">Special education services seek to promote the inclusion of all children with special needs in the education system, regardless of the nature or level of special need involved. The aim is to ensure that all children with special educational needs can avail of as complete an educational experience as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_2427">In support of this objective, children with special needs have access to a range of models of response. These extend from special schools which are dedicated to particular disability groups, through special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, to the support of children with special needs on a fully integrated basis in ordinary schools. All of these models of response involve the allocation of special levels of teaching and other supports which are based on the assessed needs of the individual child.</p>
          <p eId="para_2428">The Education Act, 1998 makes provision for children with special educational needs in respect of admission, access and accommodation, school planning and inspection of programmes. Underlying these provisions is the duty of the Minister to make available to each person resident in the State, including a person with a disability or who has other special educational needs, support services and a level and quality of education appropriate to meeting the needs of that person. In addition, the Equal Status Act, 2000, prohibits discrimination, including discrimination on grounds of disability, by schools in the area of admissions, access, terms and conditions of participation and expulsion.</p>
          <p eId="para_2429">The Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill will provide a statutory framework within which the education of children and people who have special educational needs because of disabilities can be guaranteed. It will ensure provision for people with special educational needs through a dedicated mediation and appeals system and set out a range of services which must be provided.

          <p eId="para_2440">It is the policy of my Department that all teachers working with children with special needs will have relevant training. There has been a major increase in the past number of years in the level of additional teaching resources made available by my Department to schools to assist them in catering for children with special educational needs. This positive intervention has provided very significant additional educational support from highly qualified teachers in schools across the country. In this regard, I would point out that the existing full-time pre-service teacher training in the colleges of education contains appropriate elements to assist the student teachers in recognising and dealing with children with special needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2441">These additional appointments do, however, bring with them the need for additional training in the special needs area and this is being addressed on an ongoing basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_2442">There is a range of programmes in place and additional programmes are being planned. Since 1994, a national programme of training for learning support teachers has been in place. At present, six centres – two universities and four colleges of education – provide postgraduate courses for teachers at primary and post-primary levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_2443">In 2000, guidelines for learning support teachers issued to schools and a major training programme based on the guidelines is well under way. Learning support teachers, resource teachers and whole school staff are included in this training programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2444">In the current academic year 2002-03, diploma courses in special educational needs are being provided for teachers at St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra, St. Angela's College, Sligo, and NUI Belfield. This cohort of programmes will be expanded next year to include Mary Immaculate Training College, Limerick and discussions are ongoing with the Church of Ireland Training College, Rathmines in this regard also.</p>
          <p eId="para_2445">My Department also funds a professional training programme for teachers in the area of autism which is provided on a collaborative basis between the University of Birmingham and St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra. The programme is of one year's duration and commenced in January 2001. A new group is currently on the course in 2002 and the course will run again in 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2446">A comprehensive induction programme for newly appointed resource teachers is also under way in the current school year. This programme of training is delivered by the teacher training colleges and involves the network of education centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_2447">In 2001, my Department established a training team to deliver intensive training programmes for teachers working with children with autism. The team delivered training in the last term of the 2000-01 school year and a programme of training for the 2002-03 school year has been agreed and is currently under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_2448">In addition to the above, my Department provides funding for a wide range of shorter courses for teachers in the special needs area. They are mainly provided through the network of education centres, through teachers' organisations and through the programme of summer courses for primary teachers. In this regard, three e-learning courses were provided for teachers in the areas of autism, dyslexia and ADHD during July and August 2002. The courses were on-line for the months of July and August and 500 teachers availed of the programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_2449">Guidelines for Traveller education have been produced for all primary level teachers and in particular for those working with Traveller pupils. The guidelines will strengthen the role of the resource teacher for Travellers and provide the opportunity to share expertise, develop best practice and promote an intercultural approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_2450">I should add, also, that boards of management of individual schools have some discretion in the area of funding for in-career development courses for staff. My Department will continue to address the training needs of teachers working with pupils with special educational needs. In view of the diverse nature of those needs and in the light of the increase in the number of teachers recently appointed, a review of training needs is continuing in association with course providers to further inform policy in this area.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_2519">As the Deputy is aware, BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in March 2000 with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and North-Eastern Health Board areas. Screening is being offered free of charge to all women in those areas in the target age group 50 to 64 years of age. The target population consists of approximately 136,000 women and it represents about 50% of the national target population. BreastCheck is on target to complete phase one of the programme by December 2002. To end August 2002, 91,906 women had been called for screening and 68,184 women have been screened, representing an uptake of 74%.</p>
          <p eId="para_2520">The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process and it is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. The board of BreastCheck has recently submitted a business plan to my Department for the national expansion of the programme. My Department is currently discussing the business plan with BreastCheck and especially the linkages with the existing symptomatic breast disease services. I have invested substantially in the development of symptomatic services and further development is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_2521">I am also committed to the national extension of BreastCheck and a decision in relation to this will be considered in the context of the overall investment programme for cancer services for 2003. As the Deputy is aware, any woman irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_2523">Significant progress has been achieved in boosting the number of therapy training places in line with the recommendations of the report, Current and Future Supply and Demand Conditions in the Labour Market for Certain Professional Therapists, prepared by Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates and published in June 2001. A detailed assessment of the bids to supply these additional training places was carried out by an interagency group comprising the Higher Education Authority, the Department of Education and Science, the health boards and my Department with regard to such issues as the proposed curricula, the availability of high-quality clinical placements, the speed at which these places could be provided and the recommendation contained in the Bacon report that consideration should be given to the development and validation of courses at different institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2524">Following my joint announcement with the Minister for Education and Science of 175 extra professional therapy training places in May of this year, the Bachelor of Science in Physiotherapy in the University of Limerick commenced in the current academic year with an intake of 28 students. It is envisaged that the masters programmes in speech and language therapy and occupational therapy at the University of Limerick will commence in June 2003 with an intake of 25 into both courses. These courses are accelerated conversion courses, in respect of which the first graduates will be produced in two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_2525">The National University of Ireland, Cork, has made provision for a Central Applications Office entry in October 2003 for both the Bachelor of Science course in occupational therapy – 25 places – and the Bachelor of Science course in speech and language therapy – 25 places. The option of a programme which would allow students with suitable backgrounds to enter into the second year of a degree programme in October 2003 is currently being considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_2526">The National University of Ireland, Galway, plans to commence its intake of students into both programmes – the Bachelor of Science course in occupational therapy – 25 places – and the Bachelor of Science course in speech and language therapy – 25 places – in September 2003. NUIG are also investigating the possibility of accepting suitable students into the second year of the programmes in September 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2527">In addition, the universities which are already offering degree courses in these specialties have increased the number of places being offered in the past number of years. The occupational therapy course in TCD increased its intake from 30 to 35 students in the 2000-01 academic year and further increased its intake in the 2001-02 academic year to 41 students. A provisional number of 40 students were accepted in 2002-03. The speech and language therapy course in TCD enrolled 26 students in 2000-01 and increased this number to 32 in 2001-02. A provisional number of 29 students were accepted in 2002-03. The intake for the physiotherapy degree course at TCD also increased from 30 to 36 in 2000-01 and to 40 in 2001-02 and 2002-03 – provisional.</p>
          <p eId="para_2528">The physiotherapy school in UCD has significantly increased its intake in the past number of years. It increased from 32 to 56 in 2000-01 and was further increased to 60 students in 2001-02. A provisional number of 60 students were also accepted in 2002-03. The Royal College of Surgeons has two physiotherapy courses. The standard four year course saw the number of EU students rise from four to 15 in 2000-01, 12 in 2001-02 and 14 in 2002-03 – provisional. The second course which allows direct entry into year two increased by six in 2000-01 from 11 to 17. A provisional number of 14 EU students were accepted in 2002-03.</p>

This submission is being examined as a priority within my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_2534">In terms of the timescale for the introduction of the programme, I am advised that the Mater Hospital proposes to commence lung transplantation over the coming weeks.

          <p eId="para_2535">Pending the establishment of lung transplantation in this country, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital in the UK for the treatment of Irish patients. To date 24 patients from this country have received a transplant at the Freeman Hospital under the agreement. This contract will continue while the necessary arrangements are being progressed in terms of establishing the programme in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_2536">Finally, it is also important to note that lungs donated in Ireland have been retrieved by the medical team at Newcastle and have helped to facilitate this additional transplant work at Newcastle for the benefit of Irish patients.</p>

          <p eId="para_2538">In June 2000 the Irish Medicines Board was asked to develop proposals for the licensing of "traditional and alternative medicinal products including herbal medicinal products". Under the IMB's proposed interim national licensing scheme, certain non-herbal substances such as fish oils and royal jelly can be considered to have a "traditional use" and these substances fall within the scope of the scheme "when used in medicinal products or where medicinal claims are made or inferred". However, this does not necessarily mean these substances are considered to be medicinal in all circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_2539">The IMB has also advised that Kelp is a marine plant and is therefore considered to be a herbal substance in accordance with the definition proposed in the draft EU Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products and in the IMB's proposed interim national licensing scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2540">Under the IMB's proposed scheme, the consumer will have an assurance that all registered traditional medicinal products are produced to an appropriate quality standard, safe under the proposed conditions of use, can be expected to act in accordance with an established tradition of use and are appropriately labelled. It is intended that these products will remain available for sale in pharmacies, health food stores and supermarkets.</p>

          <p eId="para_2603">I propose to take Questions Nos. 268 and 271 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2604">Extensive research has and continues to be conducted worldwide in relation to the MMR vaccine. The World Health Organisation has indicated that MMR vaccine does not cause autism and that there has been no new scientific evidence that would suggest impaired safety of MMR. The WHO strongly endorses the use of MMR vaccine on the grounds of its convincing record of safety and efficacy. The international consensus from professional bodies and international organisations is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published research does not support a causal link between MMR and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. Earlier this year, newspaper articles alleging a link between MMR vaccine and autism referred to a study by Professor John O'Leary into measles virus. In response to these articles Professor O'Leary issued a statement indicating that the research referred to in no way establishes any link between the vaccine and autism. He further indicated that he and his research team have consistently advocated the use of MMR vaccine to protect the nation's children from measles, mumps and rubella.</p>
          <p eId="para_2605">There is no universally accepted policy for screening children with autism for a variety of hypothetical disorders. The quality standards subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology – approved 9 June 2000 – states as regards diagnostic testing: "There is inadequate supporting evidence for hair analysis, coeliac antibodies, allergy testing (particularly food allergies for gluten, casein, candida and other molds), immunologic or neurochemical abnormalities, micronutrients such as vitamin levels, intestinal permeability studies, stool analysis, urinary peptides, mitochondrial disorders (including lactate and pyruvate), thyroid function tests, or erythrocyte flurathione peroxidase studies." There are diagnostic and treatment services available within the health services generally to assist persons who have health problems which may require to be addressed through dietary interventions. These are available to children with autism through the usual referral channels. Assistance with dietary needs may also be available in certain circumstances through the supplementary welfare scheme which is operated by the health boards on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_2606">My Department has made funding amounting to €190,000 over a three year period available to the Health Research Board to commission research into autism and intestinal dysfunction. This funding has been awarded to a team led by Professor O'Leary. The aim of the research is to characterise the biology of gastrointestinal abnormalities in people with autism and to examine any discrepancies between them and patients with conventional intestinal disorders.</p>

          <p eId="para_2618">As the Deputy will be aware, Comhairle na nOspidéal is the statutory body set up under the Health Act, 1970, to regulate the appointment of consultant medical staff in hospitals, to specify the qualifications for such appointments, and to advise the Minister on the organisation of hospital services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2619">The future provision and extent of paediatric surgery services was reviewed in 1998 by a committee established by Comhairle. The committee was asked to consider this issue in the absence of agreement among the three paediatric hospitals on the nature and structure of a replacement consultant paediatric surgeon post which had arisen at Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin.</p>
          <p eId="para_2620">Comhairle recommended the concentration of a very small number of specialist paediatric and neonatal surgical operations in Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, with all three paediatric hospitals continuing to provide non-specialist paediatric surgery and less complex urology services. I am advised by Comhairle that a very small percentage of the children undergoing paediatric surgical procedures at Temple St. would require access to the specialist surgical services under consideration. However, I am aware that concerns have been raised by Temple St. Hospital in relation to the proposed transfer of this work. In this regard I will be meeting with representatives from the hospital in the near future to discuss these concerns.</p>

The initial timeframe for the group to complete this work is one month, with the first meeting due to take place this week. I also understand that the facilitator, who is assisting with the internal process, is to meet representatives of the parents tonight. I have been assured by the management in St. Vincent's Centre that every effort is being made to fill the nursing vacancies in this service.</p>

          <p eId="para_2634">Under section 2 of the Pharmacy Act, 1962, the dispensing and compounding of medical prescriptions must be under the personal supervision of an "authorised person", as defined under subsection 2(3). EEC Council Directives 85/432/EEC, 85/433/EEC and 85/584/EEC provide for the mutual recognition of pharmacy qualifications for nationals of member states. The European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications in Pharmacy) Regulations, 1987 (S.I. No. 239 of 1987) and European Communities (Recognition of Qualifications in Pharmacy) Regulations, 1991 (S.I. No. 330 of 1991), which implemented the directives, amended the definition of an authorised person, to include the provision that a pharmacy in this State which has been in operation for less than three years shall not be managed or supervised by a pharmacist who qualified in another EC member state. However, the regulations do not preclude such pharmacists from working in a pharmacy which is less than three years old, other than as a supervising pharmacist.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_561">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_2637">Additional funding has been made available annually in recent years to the health boards in respect of the provision of health related support services, including speech and language therapy services, for children with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Some €14.6 million has been invested in these services nationally since 1998. In addition to this ringfenced funding, children with disabilities would also have benefited from the additional therapy posts which have been put in place in services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_2638">However, many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals and specifically speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally. Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_2639">My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or enhancement in line with agreed services developments using the resources allocated to the services. It is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards to decide on the specific approaches which they may consider appropriate in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_2640">In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001. The report recommends an annual increase of 75 course places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve a fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_2641">An inter-agency working group was established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, HEA. The HEA, following a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions, has allocated an additional 175 training places, including 75 for speech and language therapy, to respond to the training needs identified in the study. In addition, the Northern Area Health Board has just undertaken a concerted overseas recruitment drive for speech and language therapists on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the overreaching need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.</p>
          <p eId="para_2642">The report of the expert group on various health professionals recommended the establishment of a therapy assistant grade, where appropriate to provide practical support to speech and language therapists in their work and also to address the issue of skills mix. This recommendation will be progressed in 2002 in the context of the continuing implementation of the expert group report.</p>
          <p eId="para_2643">As the Deputy can see from the measures outlined above, the Government has been and is continuing to work to expand the level of speech and language therapy services available generally, and in particular to children with special needs. Responsibility for the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism in the Dublin region rests with the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department has therefore asked the chief executive officer of the authority to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and reply to him directly.</p>

However, I would alert the Deputy to the fact that the number of applications on the waiting list for each year since 1998 includes deferred applications. The number of deferrals for each health board/agency is included in Table 2, although it is not possible to isolate the deferrals by year of application. Applications can be deferred by the applicants themselves or by the health board, depending on circumstances.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_572">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_2794">The primary childhood immunisation programme provides for the immunisation of children under two years of age against a number of serious infectious diseases including diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio, hib, measles, mumps, rubella and meningococcal C. The present arrangements were introduced in 1995 and involve general practitioners entering into a contract with their local health board for the delivery of the programme. Under the programme, parents may have their children immunised free of charge by the general practitioner of their choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_2795">Prior to the administration of any vaccine, including MMR, the contracting general practitioner should take an appropriate medical history of the child, provide pre-immunisation advice and information to the parent and examine the child. In addition the consent of the parent must also be obtained. General practitioners are aware of the contraindications to the recommended childhood immunisations and parents should discuss any concerns they may have with the GP before making any decision about their child's immunisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_2796">In order to reassure the public as to the safety of MMR vaccine and to address the negative media coverage on this issue which adds to the confusion of parents in deciding whether or not to vaccinate their children, earlier this year I launched a document entitled "Measles, Mumps, Rubella Vaccine Discussion Pack – an information guide for health professionals and parents." The pack was produced by the National Disease Surveillance Centre and the department of public health, Southern Health Board, and was published by the Health Boards Executive on behalf of the health boards. This document sets out the facts in relation to the most common concerns about MMR in a way that will help health professionals and parents to explore these concerns together, review the evidence in relation to MMR and provide the basis for making an informed decision. The pack also contains an information leaflet for parents. The pack addresses such issues as the alleged link between MMR and autism or inflammatory bowel disease, e.g. Crohn's disease, the safety of the vaccine, combined versus single doses, and contraindications to the vaccine.</p>
          <p eId="para_2797">The international consensus is that MMR is a safe and effective vaccine and that the recently published medical evidence does not support a causal link between MMR vaccine and inflammatory bowel disease or autism. The institutions involved include the Medical Research Council Expert Committee UK, the British Committee on Safety of Medicines, the World Health Organisation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, USA, the American Academy of Paediatrics and UK professional organisations, the RCGP, the Royal College of Paediatrics, the Faculty of Public Health Medicine, the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. Most recently, the United States Institute of Medicine also concluded that there was no link between the vaccine and autism or inflammatory bowel disease. This consensus is based on large-scale epidemiological studies and more specific studies done in the laboratory setting.</p>
          <p eId="para_2798">The primary concern of my Department in relation to immunisation is that the vaccines in use are safe and effective. The Irish Medicines Board and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland support the use of MMR on the grounds that it has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective vaccine. There is a sound evidence basis for the use of MMR in the national programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2799">In relation to medical card entitlement, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide. In determining eligibility, the chief executive officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Health boards use income guidelines to assist in determining eligibility; however, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_2800">Non-medical card holders can avail of the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €65 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.</p>

Drugs payment scheme €7 million via an increase in the monthly threshold to €65. Treatment purchase fund €15 million. Non filling of posts €10 million adjustments in planned employment growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_8291">The health boards were informed by my Department that the adjustment in employment growth was to be undertaken in a way so as to have minimum impact on new and existing services. The other measures related to income to be generated without impacting upon services.</p>
          <p eId="para_8292">The position in relation to 2003 is subject to ongoing discussion with the Department of Finance in the context of agreeing my Department's Estimate for 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_8293">The implementation of the health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, remains a priority with the Government and the adjustments in posts advised to the health boards in July will not have a significant impact on the implementation of the health strategy. In that context the Deputy may wish to note that the approved employment ceiling within the health services for 2002 is 92,500.</p>

          <p eId="para_8300">The recently published first annual report of the National Parasuicide Registry provides information on the general characteristics of people who attempt suicide. The analysis of this information is most useful in the development of policies and the putting in place of additional measures aimed at preventing suicide. The National Parasuicide Registry has estimated, on the basis of limited data collected in 2001, that the number of cases of parasuicide presenting in hospital accident and emergency departments nationally is between 9,000 and 10,000 per annum. It has also estimated that in 2001 one in every 40 of these patients left hospital without being seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_8301">The national suicide review group is funding studies in the area of parasuicide and the general hospital setting which will provide information on the response to attempted suicide in Irish hospitals. A survey conducted by the group in late 2001 found that some hospitals have employed a liaison psychiatric nurse or crisis nurse to interact with patients who attend accident and emergency after engaging in an act of deliberate self-harm. It is hoped to develop similar services in other hospitals around the country. Another study funded by the suicide review group will examine accident and emergency nursing practice in relation to deliberate self-harm and will assess the implementation of the recommendations of the task force on suicide in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_8302">To further reduce the number of suicides and parasuicides, it is essential that people undergoing life crises should get appropriate support. In this regard, over €6 million has been provided since the publication of the report of the task force on suicide towards suicide prevention and towards research aimed at improving understanding of this issue. Additional funding has also been made available to further develop child and adolescent psychiatry, adult psychiatry and old age psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and to provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk.</p>

      the number of children under 18 years of age on waiting lists for orthodontic treatment in each health board area.
      [18165/02]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_581">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_8304">The provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance. I am pleased to advise the Deputy that I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_8305">The grade of specialist in orthodontics has been created in the health board orthodontic service. The introduction of this pivotal grade will have a tremendous impact on the future delivery of orthodontics in the public service. Ultimately, it will address the issues of recruitment and retention of qualified clinical personnel in the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_8306">This year, my Department expects to fund eleven dentists from various health boards for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. These eleven trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. This is an aggregate of 18 public service dentists currently in training for specialist in orthodontics qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_8307">The training programmes concerned provide a broad academic background and experience in different clinical treatment methods and are made possible by co-operation between health boards, health board consultant orthodontists and dental teaching institutions. These measures will complement the other structural changes being introduced into the orthodontic service, including the creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist to work in the orthodontic area. The grade of orthodontic therapist will act as a support to the consultant orthodontist, specialists and other dentists working in the orthodontic unit thus enabling a greater volume of treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_8308">In the short term, I have funded an orthodontic initiative to ease current pressures on the system. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. This is enabling health boards to recruit additional staff and engage the services of private specialist orthodontic practitioners to treat patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_8309">Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_8310">The Deputy should note that a child who has been assessed and placed on a treatment waiting list, will remain on the list until treatment commences. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me of the following information on their orthodontic treatment waiting lists as at the end of the June 2002 quarter, the latest date for which figures are available:</p>

Given the urgency of providing the additional training places, all the increased training places were allocated to the Psychological Society of Ireland's, PSI, post-graduate diploma course for a period of three years since the other existing training providers were not in a position at that time to provide the places within the required timeframe.

I have been advised by the South Western Area Health Board that it intends to provide addiction services for people from the Lucan and Clondalkin area from this site. It is envisaged that these services will include GP services, counselling, nursing, psychiatry and psychology services, pharmacy and family therapy services. The board has advised that there is a great need for these services in this area and that consequently the board has a responsibility to provide them. I understand that the site in question is owned by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and that therefore the question of providing funding for its purchase does not arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_8358">I understand that the board wishes to work with all concerned to develop the centre so that it can meet the needs of the people in the area. I understand that the board has already held informal meetings with some residents in the area in relation to the proposed centre. I have also been advised that the board is anxious to establish a monitoring committee comprising local residents, interested groups and the Garda. It is envisaged that this committee will ensure that the centre operates within appropriate guidelines. Moreover it will offer local residents and others an opportunity to raise any concerns which they may have in respect of the centre and to have these concerns addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_8360">The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 was developed in partnership between the statutory, voluntary and community sectors and following comprehensive public consultation. Its overall strategic objective is to significantly reduce the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research.</p>
          <p eId="para_8361">Under the treatment pillar, the strategy envisages a comprehensive, client-centred approach to the treatment of drug misusers. The 100 specific actions set out in the strategy include: immediate access for drug misusers to professional assessment and counselling, followed by commencement of treatment as deemed appropriate, not later than one month after assessment; an increase in the number of treatment places for opiate addiction to 6,500 by end 2002; having in place a range of treatment and rehabilitation options as part of a planned programme of progression for each drug user; plans for the provision of a comprehensive and locally accessible range of treatments for drug misusers.</p>
          <p eId="para_8362">Clearly, these actions require services to be delivered at local level. To this end there are currently some 57 treatment centres within the Eastern Regional Health Authority area. A significant number of these centres serve a limited catchment area which has been agreed with the local community. Many also have a ceiling on the number of clients which they serve which has been agreed with the local community. Finally, it should be noted that the national drugs strategy envisages that all health boards, in considering the location and establishment of treatment and rehabilitation facilities, develop a management plan in consultation with local communities.</p>

          <p eId="para_8367">Responsibility for the manufacture and circulation of Irish coins rests with the Central Bank of Ireland. However, the Central Bank has informed me that as a result of the introduction of the euro, there is now far less nickel in coins in circulation than was the case before the euro entered circulation. Nickel is used in only two of the euro coins – the €1 and €2 coins. By contrast, nickel was used in the 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, and £1 coins of the Irish currency. This pattern is replicated throughout the euro area. As a result, 92% of euro coins, in terms of the number of coins in circulation, are nickel-free as opposed to 25% of the national coins that were in circulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_8368">The nickel used in the €1 and €2 coins is essentially contained inside the alloy and not on the surface of the coin, thus limiting skin contact. The Central Bank has also informed me that since the introduction of euro coins into circulation, it has received no reports of nickel-allergy problems arising from the coins.</p>

Among a range of other initiatives, this investment has enabled the funding of 76 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, symptomatic breast disease, palliative care, histopathology and haematology, together with support staff. This level of funding far exceeds the £25 million which was initially envisaged in 1996 and is a clear indication of this Government's continued commitment to the development of co-ordinated and patient-focussed treatment in line with the national cancer strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_8390">This year a total of €27.3 million was provided for the maintenance and development of cancer services.

          <p eId="para_8398">The provision of dental services to eligible children is the statutory responsibility of the health boards in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_8399">The Dental Council is the body with statutory responsibility for promoting high standards of professional conduct among dentists. The advice of the Dental Council to members on this issue is that a third party must be present in the dental surgery at all times when treatment is being carried out. Equally it recognises the right of a parent to be present while a child is being treated. The Dental Council is mindful that dental surgeries are not always designed to accommodate additional observers and contain hazardous materials and substances potentially dangerous to onlookers. In addition it is widely recognised in clinical dentistry that patient management may be less than ideal when a person other than the clinician is influencing patient behaviour. In these circumstances, unless there is a common understanding and a trusting relationship between the clinician and the parent, difficulties will be encountered in completing treatment satisfactorily.</p>
          <p eId="para_8400">Having regard to these factors health boards have adopted policies that give priority to the rights of parents in these situations but give due regard to other factors that might impinge on the quality of care to children.</p>
          <p eId="para_8401">Children First – National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children are over-arching national guidelines that apply to all individuals and agencies who have contact with children. Statutory and voluntary-community organisations working with children should adapt these national guidelines to make them as meaningful and effective as possible for their staff and volunteers.</p>

          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_8403">There are two forms of meningitis, namely bacterial and acute viral meningitis. The National Disease Surveillance Centre collates and interprets data on infectious diseases in Ireland. Bacterial meningitis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality especially in young children. Meningococcal disease is the most common form of bacterial meningitis in Ireland – accounting for up to 90% of the cases. Group B and group C disease are the two types of meningococcal disease most prevalent in this country. According to the NDSC, 296 cases of bacterial meningitis were notified in Ireland between 1 October 2001 and 30 September 2002. Bacterial meningitis notifications declined by 31% when compared to the same period the previous year, October 2000-September 2001, when 431 cases were notified. This reduction can largely be attributed to the success of the meningococcal group C, Men C, immunisation campaign which I launched in October 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_8404">Group B disease now accounts for 89% of the meningococcal disease notifications in Ireland. However, at present there are no effective group B vaccines suitable for routine immunisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_8405">Acute viral meningitis tends to be a milder disease than bacterial meningitis. Between 1 October 2001 and 30 September 2002, 53 cases of acute viral meningitis were notified compared to 165 cases over the same period the previous year, October 2000-September 2001. This represents a 68% reduction in the number of acute viral meningitis cases notified. In the 18-month period, June 2000-December 2001 the level of activity due to acute viral meningitis cases was higher than usual both in Ireland and the UK. This increase coincided with an increase in reports of laboratory confirmed cases of particular strains of enteroviruses. The incidence in the disease has declined to normal baseline in 2002.</p>

          <p eId="para_8408">Some concerns have been expressed about certain aspects of the traditional herbal medicinal products directive, and my officials are currently seeking to ascertain the degree of support among other member states to address such concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_8409">With regard to food supplements, on 10 June 2002, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on food supplements setting out harmonised rules for the sale of vitamins and minerals as dietary supplements. This directive requires that maximum levels in the EU for vitamins and minerals will be set out based on scientific risk assessment and data on vitamin and mineral intake from other foods.</p>
          <p eId="para_8410">The directive was adopted in response to an increase in the use of pills and capsules as diet supplements and to varying national rules on, and attitudes to, the proliferation of these products. The objective of the directive is two fold. First it sets out the general framework and safety rules for food supplements. Second it provides that the consumer will be given detailed information on the label in order to ensure that the consumer can make an informed purchasing choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_8411">The directive will be transposed into Irish law by 31 July 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_8417">However, I wish to advise the Deputy that since 1997, additional revenue and capital of more than €500 million has been provided for the maintenance and development of health related services, including respite care for people with disabilities. More than 490 additional respite places have been provided between 1997 and 2001 and funding has been provided for an additional 75 places for people with an intellectual disability in 2002.

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_607">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_8423">Progress has been made on the need for custodial or care places for children. The Department of Health and Children and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science are currently involved in a multi-agency approach to developing responses, including the provision of custodial or care place provision where necessary, for troubled and troublesome young people. This work is taking place in the context of the ongoing implementation of the Children Act, 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_8424">As the Deputy is aware, the Cabinet committee on children decided that the National Children's Office should take the lead role in co-ordinating the implementation of the Children Act, 2001. The working group established by the National Children's Office for this purpose comprises high level representation from this Department and the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science and their respective local level agencies. The working group meets regularly to review progress in implementing the Act and to bring forward further proposals for implementation. To date, the Cabinet committee on children has approved proposals prepared by the working group relating to the provisions of the Act to be commenced in 2002 and 2003. The first commencement order under the Act was signed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for, <i>inter alia</i>: the establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and the introduction of a “diversion conference” based on restorative justice principles as pioneered in New Zealand; the establishment of the Children Court; the introduction of a fines structure for children found guilty of offences and the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children; the introduction of a curfew for children found guilty of offences; court orders to parents to exercise proper control over their children; the updating of the law on cruelty to children and persons who cause or encourage a sexual offence on a child; reversing the burden of proof on parents whose children are found begging; a limited “clean slate” in respect of most offences committed by children; provisions relating to the safety of children at entertainments.</p>
          <p eId="para_8425">Other significant provisions to be commenced in 2002 include: health boards to be given additional powers which will allow them to seek special care orders in the District Court for children in need of special care and protection; the introduction of family welfare conferencing by health boards; the replacement of reformatory and industrial schools with children detention schools; the establishment of the special residential services board on a statutory basis, the board is currently operating on an administrative basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_8426">While there is a significant emphasis in the legislation on residential and custodial care being a last resort, the provision of appropriate residential facilities and services to assist these children and facilitate their reintegration into their communities will continue to be a priority. In this regard, the National Children's Office, through the working group, continues to monitor the plans for the delivery of the new and refurbished residential services, including the new detention centres already approved by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_8427">With regard to the provision of care and custodial places for children, I would like to point out that capital investment of approximately €40 million is being made available by the Government through the health boards to put in place additional high support and special care places, to provide for a small group of children who need more intensive intervention than mainstream residential or fostercare services. Facilities with more than 120 places have been put in place. These include Crannóg Nua high support unit in Portrane and Rath Na Óg high support unit in Castleblayney which have recently commenced operation and will be brought on stream on a phased basis. In addition to these, Coovagh House, a five place special care unit in Limerick has been completed and is due to open before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_8428">Working with children with challenging behaviour is a difficult and challenging task. While health boards have experienced some difficulty in recruiting and retaining suitably trained staff, progress has been made in this area through recruitment abroad and the expansion of training courses. A new career and pay structure for child care workers was introduced last year. This aims to ensure that more people are attracted into child care and to ensure that child care workers are trained to an appropriate level.</p>
          <p eId="para_8429">The Minister for Education and Science has statutory responsibility for the provision of residential places for children up to the age of 16 years who are referred by the courts. The five special schools for young offenders under the aegis of the Department of Education and Science can provide residential accommodation for up to 162 children, including 31 remand places. The current operational capacity is 123 places. The operational capacity of these special schools fluctuates from time to time to facilitate refurbishment and new developments. In addition, capacity is also reduced where a special school is required to make special arrangements in order to cater for a particularly difficult child.</p>
          <p eId="para_8430">The Department of Education and Science is currently implementing a major capital development plan in the special schools for young offenders to ensure that the schools meet obligations that will arise under the Children Act, 2001, in addition to ensuring that they meet modern child care standards. This will result in a total of 181 places for young offenders. The Department has also commissioned an independent review of the residential requirements for young offenders and this report will be available shortly. This review will inform future development plans in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_8431">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has responsibility for the provision of accommodation for young offenders aged between 16 and 21 years. St. Patrick's Institution and Shanganagh Castle are specifically designated to cater for this age group and currently have a combined capacity of 299. The majority of offenders under 18 years of age are detained in these two institutions as well as in Fort Mitchel and Wheatfield Prison. On average, there are 90-100 offenders aged 16 and 17 detained in the various prisons and places of detention under the administration of the Irish Prison Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_8432">Under the Children Act, 2001, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. A 38 bed unit for young males in this age group with full support facilities will be provided on a dedicated site adjacent to Cork Prison. Preliminary site works have already been completed. A facility will also be provided in the Dublin area for 110 offenders aged 16 and 17 years. The Irish Prison Service is actively seeking to secure a greenfield site in the Greater Dublin area on which it would be hoped to provide a facility for up to 90 boys and 20 girls in the age group mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_8433">As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in co-operation with the Minister for Education and Science has agreed to make available up to 20 places in St. Patrick's Institution for young people aged 14 and 15 years. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform sees this development as a short-term measure, pending the availability of additional places in the Department of Education and Science facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_8434">Upon completion of the capital developments outlined above it is considered that there will be sufficient numbers of places available in the welfare and juvenile justice systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_8435">I alert the Deputy to the crucial role to be played by the Special Residential Services Board in ensuring the effective use of detention places for young offenders and special care places for non-offending children. It should be noted that under the Children Act: it will be no longer be possible to "mix" these two groups of children in the same residential centre; courts will not be able to impose a period of detention on a child under sixteen years of age unless a place is available in a special detention school; no court shall pass a sentence of imprisonment on a child or commit a child to prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_8436">The SRSB will advise the courts on the availability of places in both types of residential units and finding a suitable residential placement for individual children. The SRSB has responsibility for monitoring and regularly reviewing the level of detention and special care places available and for recommending any necessary changes to the relevant Ministers. The SRSB is operating on an administrative basis at present. The aim is to have the board operating on a statutory basis by the end of the year.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_608">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin):</from>
          <p eId="para_8438">A detailed review of all aspects of the health services was conducted by my Department last year, in consultation with relevant interests and the general public, as part of the lead in to the preparation of a new Health Strategy Quality and Fairness – A Health System for you.</p>
          <p eId="para_8439">The strategy outlines the largest expansion in services in the history of the Irish health system. A vision has been set out across the full range of care areas for how the system will be developed not just in the short term but over the next decade to deliver high quality care for all. The health strategy outlines a programme of investment and reform of the health services up to 2011. It provides a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system, improved access for public patients and actions to address the issue of waiting lists. The total number of people on public hospital waiting lists at 31 March 2002, the latest date for which figures have been published, was 25,105. The comparable figure for 31 March 2001 was 26,382. This represents a decrease of 5% on the comparable figure for March 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_8440">In the period March 2001 to March 2002 there has been a reduction of 62% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for cardiac surgery and a reduction of 67% in the number of children waiting more than six months for cardiac surgery. There has been a reduction of 34% in the number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for ENT procedures and a fall of 33% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for ophthalmology procedures in the period March 2001 to March 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_8441">A new dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment by purchasing treatments for public patients in private hospitals. The national treatment purchase fund expects to treat up to 1,900 patients this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_8442">As part of the preparatory work for the strategy my Department conducted a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs. On foot of this review, the Government decided to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_8443">Earlier this year I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals at a cost of €65 million. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 258 of these beds have been commissioned under this initiative to date. The latest advice to my Department from the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards indicates in excess of 600 beds will be in place by year end and that the remainder will be commissioned early in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_8444">The health strategy also provides for the formulation of a plan for the future development of the maternity services. The objective of this development will be to ensure that maternity care is woman-centred, equitable across the country, safe and accountable.</p>
          <p eId="para_8445">I have taken a number of measures to improve orthodontic services on a national basis, including the creation of a grade of specialist in orthodontics in the health board orthodontic service. Additional funding of €6.729 million was approved for orthodontic services last year of which €4.698 million was to fund an initiative on orthodontic waiting lists. Last June, my Department provided additional funding of €5 million from the national treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_8446">The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that at the end of the June 2002 quarter, there were 19,055 patients in orthodontic treatment in the health boards. This is an increase of 3,528 patients in orthodontic treatment when compared with the number of patients in treatment in June 2001. I expect that the number of patients in orthodontic treatment will continue to increase as the measures that I have taken to improve orthodontic services take effect.</p>

          <p eId="para_8449">I propose to take Questions Nos. 339 and 343 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_8450">The number of people on public hospital waiting lists for ophthalmology, cardiac and orthopaedic surgery for the quarter ended March 2002, the latest date for which figures are available, is being provided separately to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_8451">Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting times for public patients. In the period March 2001 to March 2002 the total number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for cardiac surgery has decreased by 62% and the number of children waiting more than 6 months for cardiac surgery has decreased by 67%. There has been a reduction of 13% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for orthopaedic procedures in the period March 2001 to March 2002. Adults waiting more than 12 months for ophthalmology procedures has been reduced by 33%.</p>
          <p eId="para_8452">The health strategy places a new focus on waiting times. While the Waiting List Initiative will continue to fund additional elective activity, a new dedicated national treatment purchase fund is being used to target those waiting longest for treatment by purchasing treatments for public patients in private hospitals. The national treatment purchase fund is expected to fund treatment for up to 1,900 patients this year.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley):</from>
          <p eId="para_8455">The provision of health related services, including speech and language therapy, is a matter for the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards in the first instance. However, I understand all health boards are experiencing difficulties in the recruitment of therapy posts and particularly in filling senior vacancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_8456">Furthermore, I advise the Deputy that my Department commissioned a report on current and future supply and demand in the labour market for certain professional therapists from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates.</p>
          <p eId="para_8457">The Bacon report, which was published in July 2001, concluded that a major expansion is essential in the number of speech and language therapists requiring a very significant increase in training places to meet the long-term needs of the health service. The report therefore advocated an annual increase of 75 training places for speech and language therapy in order to achieve the fourfold increase in the number of speech and language therapists over the next decade recommended in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_8458">To advance this core recommendation of the report, an Inter-Agency Working Group, comprising officials from the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority, was established to seek proposals from third level institutions to ensure the rapid provision of the additional therapy training places. On 29 May 2002 the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, announced the provision of 175 extra professional therapy training places for students to tackle the acute shortage of physiotherapists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists in the health service. This initiative almost doubles the number of therapy places available at present and it is expected that the first intake to the extra places for speech and language therapy will commence in the 2003-04 academic year.</p>
          <p eId="para_8459">Other key recommendations of the report include: provision of sufficient clinical placements within the health service through the establishment of a national network of clinical placement co-ordinators; need for fast-track qualification and review of the existing training system; concerted recruitment from overseas; establishment of the planned system of statutory registration consistent with the requirement for a patient-centred health service; career structure, workload, working practices and skills-mix issues encompassed in the context of the report of the expert group on various health professions, published April 2000.</p>

          <p eId="para_8471">The provision of school medical services, as an integral component of child health services, is the statutory responsibility of the health boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_8472">The 1999 Best Health for Children report commissioned by the chief executive officers of the health boards comprises a review of child health services, including the school health service. The aims of the core programme for child health surveillance set out in the report are to ensure that all children have the opportunity to realise their full potential in terms of good health, well being and development; to identify remedial disorders at the earliest possible date; and to treat them in a timely fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_8473">In so far as school medical services are concerned, the report makes a number of recommendations, including a core programme for child health surveillance for all primary schools in close co-operation with parents and teachers and with selective medical examinations of children with problems. In addition, it emphasises the need for adequate training of key professionals, provision and maintenance of appropriate referral and timely and effective treatment services as essential components of the school health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_8474">Additional funding in the region of €1.015 million in 2001, and a further €1.052 million in 2002, has been allocated to the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations set out in the Best Health for Children report. This funding has facilitated the appointment of key individuals at local level to drive the implementation process and also the establishment of a number of demonstration projects, including the piloting of a school health services model in the North-Western Health Board, in line with the recommendations of the Best Health for Children report. The project commenced this year and will run until 2004, when it is due to be evaluated.</p>
          <p eId="para_8475">A national conjoint child health committee, established by the chief executive officers of the health boards, is currently overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the recommendations.</p>

          <p eId="para_8477">The Health Service Employers Agency, HSEA, undertook a survey of nursing vacancies at 30 April 2002. A copy of this survey will be forwarded directly to the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_8478">The following are the main points of the survey: there were 2,280 extra nurses employed in the health service in the year ending 30 April 2002; 1,722 nurses were recruited abroad in the year ending 30 April 2002; in addition, 384 nurses work every day in the hospitals as agency nurses; and health boards have increased their nurse staffing by 1,408 in the year, voluntary hospitals have recruited 664 additional nurses and the learning disability sector has boosted its staffing by 208 in the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_8479">While all sectors reported recruitment was well ahead of resignations and retirements, employers reported that 1,047 vacancies existed at 30 April 2002. These circumstances arise where the volume of additional nursing posts being created outstrips capacity to recruit. The combination of utilising agency nurses and overtime working provides the equivalent of around 1,200 full-time nurses to the service to compensate for shortages while employers continue the recruitment process to fill vacancies.</p>
          <p eId="para_8480">The ongoing recruitment of nurses from abroad is also impacting positively on the vacancy situation. A total of 3,148 working visas/work authorisations were issued to nurses from non-EU countries between June 2000 and April 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_8481">Overall, an additional 5,800 nurses have been recruited to the public health service since 1998. This represents a 19% increase. The latest available figures show that the total number of nurses employed in the public health service is 36,089.</p>
          <p eId="para_8482">The Health Service Employers Agency is currently undertaking a national survey of nursing vacancies at 30 September 2002. A copy of this survey will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</p>

          <p eId="para_8505">Arrangements for the mutual recognition of driving licences within the EU are governed by the provisions of EU Directive 91/439 which provides for the mutual recognition of full EU driving licences but not provisional licences. Moreover, in order to obtain a full driving licence a person must be normally resident in a member state and must undergo both the theoretical and practical driving tests applicable in that member state. Accordingly, there are currently no arrangements between Ireland and the UK for the mutual recognition of provisional driving licences or to enable persons who have passed the theoretical test in one State to obtain a provisional licence elsewhere.</p>

          <p eId="para_8507">I am very much aware of the problem of crowding on commuter routes at peak periods, including on the Dublin-Dundalk route, and am conscious of the discomfort and inconvenience this causes to passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_8508">Iarnród Éireann has a statutory responsibility for ensuring the safety of its passengers. It is therefore a matter for the company to satisfy itself that the number of passengers being carried in any particular train or carriage does not compromise overall passenger safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_8509">Data provided by Iarnród Éireann show that over the period from 1994 to 2001, passenger numbers on suburban services increased from 18.8 million to an estimated 22.7 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_8510">In order to address this, significant funding has been, and continues to be, made available to Iarnród Éireann for investment to improve the safety of the network, increase the passenger capacity of the system and improve the quality, reliability and speed of services. Iarnród Éireann has ordered 80 diesel rail cars for use on suburban routes and delivery of these is expected to commence shortly. The ongoing delivery of this new rolling stock will increase the available capacity, including the capacity on the Dundalk to Dublin route, to deal with peak periods and should help to alleviate the present crowding difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_8511">In the meantime, the railway inspectorate of my Department continues to monitor developments in regard to crowding on trains. It has been in contact with Iarnród Éireann on a number of occasions drawing its attention to the importance of keeping the issue of crowding under review and has also raised particular aspects of the crowding problem with Iarnród Éireann. Iarnród Éireann has advised the inspectorate that the recommendations made by its consultants in 2001 for alleviating crowding on services in the Dublin area are being implemented by the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_8512">My predecessor advised the House on several previous occasions that there are no national or EU quantitative safety standards in existence at present in regard to the maximum number of passengers permitted on trains and this is still the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_8513">The Railway Safety Bill, 2001, which was published in December last and will commence Second Stage in the House tomorrow, will require all railway undertakings, including Iarnród Éireann, to implement a formal safety management system and to describe that system in a document called a "safety case". The Bill will require a railway undertaking to identify in its safety case all issues impacting on the safety of its operations. Such issues would include its strategy for managing crowding of trains. The railway safety commission, to be established under the Bill, will need to be satisfied that the proposed strategy is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers.</p>

Ownership of the vehicle is not a criterion in determining the test due dates. Where an NCT inspection does not occur on the test due date, the NCT certificate is valid from the date of the test to the next test due date.

          <p eId="para_8528">My Department is fully supportive of efforts made by all State agencies to promote Ireland as a destination for English language students, subject to the requirement to maintain the integrity of the immigration system. Consequently, my Department will issue the appropriate visas in such circumstances provided the documentation supplied in support of such visa applications is in order.</p>
          <p eId="para_8529">In recent years there has been an unprecedented growth in visa applications at the Irish embassy in Beijing, largely as a result of the successful marketing efforts of the Irish education industry. The number of visa applications made there has increased from 603 in 1996, to 3,972 in 1999 and 13, 598 in 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_8530">In June of this year my Department took the unprecedented step of seconding four specialised visa officers to the embassy in Beijing. A primary objective of this initiative was to enable the provision of a better and more timely customer service by making decisions locally rather than having large numbers of visa applications sent back to Dublin for decision. The officers in question were also tasked with developing an intelligence base in relation to fraud, etc., and with liaising with other embassies in an attempt to combat abuses of the visa system.</p>
          <p eId="para_8531">Since their appointment, the officers in Beijing have been engaged in this task. Unfortunately, the experience to date has been that there is evidence of widespread abuse in relation to the submission of misleading documentation in support of visa applications. This is a factor which cannot be ignored if the integrity of the immigration system is to be upheld. In that context, it should be borne in mind that the vast majority of student visa applications in China are made by agents acting on behalf of the persons and colleges in question. A danger is that if Ireland maintains an approach which is seen to be less rigorous than the approach adopted by other embassies or consulates, our visa system will be a target for abuse by unscrupulous applicants and agents.</p>
          <p eId="para_8532">With regard to the student visa guidelines, these are intended to be of general application only. In the light of experience in Beijing it will be possible to develop more specific guidelines in relation to the situation in China as regards student visa applications. This issue is being kept under review. In the interim, the visa officers in Beijing must be in a position to react quickly to information which becomes available locally.</p>
          <p eId="para_8533">While this initiative is still in its infancy, it should eventually improve dramatically processing time for Chinese visa applications, and thereby go a long way towards addressing the concerns expressed by the industry regarding the service it receives.</p>

That Department has also confirmed that records are not kept in a way that would indicate how many of those persons were the great-grandchildren of Irish nationals. The provisions governing the foreign births registration process, as well as the other methods for acquiring Irish citizenship, are set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956-2001. In my response to Question No. 1352 of 9 October 2002, I informed the Deputy how these provisions apply to the great-grandchildren of Irish nationals. I also informed the Deputy that the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act, 2001, which was enacted on 6 June 2001, made extensive changes to Irish citizenship law as enunciated in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Acts, 1956-1994, and that it was not intended to revisit the issue of foreign births registration in the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p eId="para_8580">I refer the Deputy to my predecessor's response to Question No. 499 of 7 March 2002 in relation to the installation of a Garda CCTV system in Mullingar. Correspondence was subsequently received asking that the decision be reviewed. This correspondence was forwarded to the advisory committee whose views in this regard are currently awaited. I will consider the matter further upon receipt of these views. The Deputy may wish to note that, subject to the availability of funds, the 17 locations set to receive new Garda CCTV systems over the next two years have already been decided upon and publicly announced. The locations are, in alphabetical order, Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Kilkenny, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford.</p>
          <p eId="para_8581">Some applications for CCTV systems received by the advisory committee relate to relatively small schemes which, while of importance to the local community, cannot be regarded as a national Garda priority. A grant scheme has been launched to facilitate community based groups who wish to install their own local CCTV system. Grant assistance of up to €100,000 will, subject to the availability of funds, be obtainable from my Department towards the cost of such schemes. It will be up to the community groups, in conjunction with the relevant local authority, to install, maintain and monitor the community-based CCTV schemes. To qualify for grant aid, certain minimum standards will have to be met and the gardaí will have to be allowed access to grant-aided systems as and when they require it. A prospectus has been prepared by my Department which provides information on how to apply for grant aid funding, outlines the application process and identifies the main issues that applicants will need to consider. Copies of this are available upon request from the Garda administration division of my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_8622">I am aware of the difficulties being encountered by companies and organisations involved in the collection of glass for recycling arising from the recent announcement by the company named – which is the sole glass recycling plant on the island of Ireland on foot of the closure of the Irish Glass Bottle plant in Ringsend earlier this year – to reduce the price paid for crushed and uncrushed glass cullet sourced here. Glass recycling is a function of the waste market and does not receive direct Government subsidy either here or in the UK. However, it is subsidised by the operation of compliance schemes in both jurisdictions. I understand that one of the reasons given for the price reduction affecting Irish glass recycling relates to the different pricing structure of UK packaging waste recovery schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_8623">My Department has been in contact with Repak – the company established by industry to meet Ireland's packaging waste recycling targets and which subsidises the collection of packaging waste for recycling in this country – to discuss potential solutions to the current difficulties and possible alternative markets for collected glass. I am also meeting Rehab Recycling Partnership, the largest organisation collecting glass from bring banks and commercial premises, to discuss the issue. The Government's policy statement, Preventing and Recycling Waste: Delivering Change, published last March, also provides for the establishment of a market development group to drive a new market development programme to develop further outlets for glass and other materials. This programme will build on the comprehensive study by the Clean Technology Centre, Cork, on a strategy for developing recycling markets in Ireland, which has identified a number of potential outlets for glass.</p>

While the income limit applying to the scheme is set nationally, the application of the maximum price limit to the scheme and the maximum mortgage loan in each case is determined by the relevant local authority.

          <p eId="para_8647">My Department does not specifically grant aid the construction of houses which use renewable energy. However, grants are available to developers and builders from Sustainable Energy Ireland, under the House of Tomorrow programme, for clusters of demonstration houses that comprise a range of superior energy technologies and practices. These grants are not available to individuals or for individual houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_8648">The National Climate Change Strategy, adopted by the Government and published in October 2000, in line with the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy, also identifies the possibility of restructuring the existing new house grant, so that larger grants would be available for more energy efficient houses. The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2002 contains a provision allowing the Minister to make regulations to provide greater flexibility for the payment of new house grants in the future, including differential rates of grants to encourage more efficient use of energy and/or the use of renewable forms of energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_8649">In order to encourage greater energy efficiency in housing regulations amending part L of the building regulations on the conservation of fuel and energy were made in June of this year. The new regulations will require higher standards of insulation in new dwellings with effect from 1 January 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_8650">The introduction of differential rates of new house grants for more energy efficient houses would require the formulation of verifiable voluntary standards of improved energy efficiency in excess of those in the recently revised part L of the building regulations and further consideration is being given to formulating such standards.</p>

My Department issued a letter to him on 15 August 2002, advising that his claim in respect of his son was deemed to have been withdrawn on the basis he had not provided the information requested. My Department has since been in contact with the person concerned and he has again been requested to forward the details required.

          <p eId="para_8706">The bereavement grant is a payment based on PRSI contributions, designed to assist families in dealing with death and funeral expenses. The grant is payable on the death of an insured person or a family member, including a child under age 18, or under age 22 if in full-time education. The grant is not payable on the death of a child over the age unless they are qualified on the basis of their own PRSI contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_8707">The only alternative source of payment for people who have insufficient PRSI contributions is the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. Under this scheme, a health board may make a single payment to help meet once-off exceptional expenditure, e.g. for funeral expenses, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of his-her weekly income.</p>

At the same time the annual average contribution rate required for a minimum old age contributory pension was reduced from 20 contributions to ten. The requirement to have 260 paid contributions for pension applies to all persons who reach retirement age 65 on or after 6 April 2002.

          <p eId="para_8715">As announced last week, the Christmas bonus for 2002 will again be paid at a rate equivalent to 100% of the person's normal weekly payment, but with an increased minimum payment of €30. The cost of this measure is estimated to be €109.9 million. Payment will be made in early December and it is estimated that it will benefit some 1.2 million persons comprising some 800,000 recipients and an estimated 400,000 dependants. The bonus will be paid to recipients of long-term payments including: disablement pension, death benefit by way of pension, old age contributory and non-contributory pensions, retirement pension, invalidity pension, widow's and widower's non-contributory ension, widow's and widower's contributory pension, orphan's contributory and non-contributory pensions, pre-retirement allowance, blind pension, carer's allowance, one-parent family payment, payments to people formerly in receipt of deserted wife's benefit and allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance, unemployment assistance at the long-term rate, farm assist and disability allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_8716">Recipients of short-term payments will not receive the Christmas bonus. The payments involved are: carer's benefit, maternity benefit, health and safety benefit, adoptive benefit, injury benefit, disability benefit, unemployment benefit, short-term unemployment assistance, family income supplement, supplementary welfare allowance.</p>
          <p eId="para_8717">An estimated 190,000 people receive these weekly payments. The focus of the Christmas bonus has always been on long-term welfare payment recipients who rely on this system for financial support over the long-term. There are no plans to extend the bonus payment to the short-term schemes this year.</p>
