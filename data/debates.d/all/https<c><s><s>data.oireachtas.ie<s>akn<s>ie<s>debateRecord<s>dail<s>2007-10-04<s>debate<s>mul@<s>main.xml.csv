I hope the matters can be debated and resolved.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12720	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following urgent matter of public interest: the serious economic and employment implications for the Cork East constituency and Cork in general following the announcement that the Amgen project which was to deliver more than 1,000 jobs is not to proceed, the need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to outline the background to the decision and the steps he intends to take to ensure the project proceeds or is replaced as a matter of urgency.

Enactment of the Bill is necessary to implement the scheme.  When does the Tánaiste expect enactment to take place?Does the Government plan to act on the report of the Competition Authority on restrictions on competition in dental services?  The report has just been published.I am not sure how to raise the following matter.  On the front page of the  Irish Examiner today, I see the fighting face of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Willie O’Dea, who was allegedly in the company of the Tánaiste last Saturday night.

The Minister should also set out what public moneys have been spent to provide infrastructure for a project which appears not to be going ahead.

The decision to postpone is based purely on developments pertaining to Amgen's global business and, contrary to Opposition claims, is not due to costs or lack of competitiveness in Ireland.  It is a commercial decision by Amgen in the context of the present situation.

I would have thought that the loss of 1,100 jobs in east County Cork would be important enough to discuss yesterday, but I was ruled out of order.  What criteria are used in these matters and how many jobs must be lost — 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000?  When something as important as this happens in an area, we cannot discuss it here and the Minister cannot be called into the House.  It affects not only east County Cork but all Munster and the entire country, yet we are not allowed to discuss it in this House.  It is ridiculous.

He indicated then that the pre-budget outlook would be published in October.  Is he in a position to advise when in October it will be published?  Will he accommodate a full address of the outlook in this House at the earliest opportunity and has he a date or dates in mind for that process?  Very importantly, will it address the issue of multi-annual budgeting, which we have addressed over the past five years during the Tánaiste's tenure as Minister for Finance and my time as a member of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service?  We have agreement that that is the correct way to proceed.  Does he not agree it is now even more important to take a multi-annual budgeting approach, particularly to our health services?  It is my view and the view of many people that many of the difficulties currently being experienced in the health services can be attributed——

The date will be set when the Cabinet decides on the existing level of service provision in the first instance, which is being considered.  As the Deputy noted, the tax and expenditure proposals will be addressed in a unified way on budget day as part of a process of budgetary reform which I have instigated since becoming Minister for Finance.  The issue of when, how and if we should move to multi-annual budgets is one for the ensuing process of budgetary reform.  It is not envisaged for this year but could be considered in the future.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	69	With regard to the budget arrangements for 5 December, Estimates will not now be published.  Will the Tánaiste indicate whether the Opposition will be facilitated in terms of receiving advance information on the contents of the Estimates part of the budget?  The Opposition's job will be made extraordinarily difficult if the budget and Estimates are presented in the same package without even a half hour's notice of their contents.  Will the Tánaiste meet the Opposition to discuss the contents of the outlook statement, given that we will not know the levels of service provision for key Departments unless we have at least some advice about the shape of the process, particularly in regard to areas such as health and education?  I do not know if it is appropriate for the Whips to raise the matter.  A committee has not yet been formed to deal with finance issues so we have been unable to hold discussions with the Tánaiste.The Government may have an absolute media strike because it will hold all the aces in terms of the Estimates and the tax and social welfare provisions, while the Opposition will have no prior information other than the copy we receive on the floor of the House of what presumably will be part of a much larger document.  Previously, copies were distributed approximately ten days before the budget so that we could have an opportunity to examine the provisions.  It is important for the media but it potentially puts complete control over Estimates and budget in the hands of the Government.  That would represent quite a change.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	77	For you.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	78	——for everybody, in terms of presentation of accounts and being able to discuss expenditure and tax proposals.  Developing a unified position is the best way to proceed.  When the pre-budget outlook is published, the House will have an opportunity to debate it and Members will be able to present their ideas regarding the shape of the budget based on the pre-budget documentation, of which the existing level of service provision will form part.  I do not accept this is not a progressive step.  Some spokespersons took up an earlier offer by me of a briefing and talks with Department officials on our plans for improving output statements.  That briefing is still available to those who have not thus far taken that opportunity.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	79	That is not a satisfactory answer because I am not asking about existing levels of service provision.  I know the existing levels already from the final Estimates.  I want to know the planned level of service provision particularly as the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, is facing a changed economic scenario with a €1 billion reduction in finances compared to the figures planned last year.  What indications will the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance give in the pre-budget outlook on proposed levels of service provision for next year?The Department of Finance offered meaningless discussions but we want to know the plans for Government spending in line Departments next year.  We have always had such information by the middle of November and this is how we knew of proposals for social welfare cuts and expansions in previous years.  There is no other mechanism available to us and this represents a loss of an important source of information.I see people such as the Minister of State, Deputy Jimmy Devins, smiling.  Perhaps he is presiding over some of the black holes planned for service provision next year.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	84	In view of the shambles that is the policy of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the importation of genetically modified foods and the reluctance of the Government to establish a committee to deal with science and technology matters I ask the Tánaiste to arrange for a debate in this House on GM foods in Government time.  This matter is causing serious difficulties for the agriculture sector, especially the pig and poultry areas where several thousand people are employed and many jobs are threatened.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	85	I suggest that this is a matter that should be raised at the Whips' meetings.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	91	A report on the status of the Gaeltacht has been on the desk of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, for six months.  When will there be a debate on the report in this House?  This is a very important issue and time must be made available for it because the people of the Gaeltacht want to know the contents of the report, although the media already knows.  A debate should be held as soon as possible.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I am sure such a debate could be arranged but it should be discussed at Whips' meetings.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	93	It is well recognised that one of the major problems facing third level students entitled to maintenance grants is receiving the grant on time.  Some 15 months ago, as part of a brave new world before the election, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, proposed a new Bill to effectively give control of the timely distribution of grants to Vocational Educational Committees, VECs.  When are we likely to see the student support Bill, promised legislation, and will it be enacted before Christmas given that these reforms must be in place by next summer?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	94	This Bill seeks to place all student support on a statutory footing, to designate VECs as awarding authorities, to provide for a system of appeals, to create penalties for fraudulent grant applications and to repeal the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts of 1968 to 1992.  The heads of the Bill were approved by Government on 19 July 2006 and we expect it to be published during this session.  Whether the Bill is taken this session is a matter for the Whips.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	95	We were promised a Supplementary Estimate to ensure that the grant scheme for renewable energy products for householders would recommence because it was stopped by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  I raised this matter yesterday and there seemed to be some confusion on the issue.  I raised it last Thursday and the Tánaiste fudged his answer.  Can the Tánaiste clarify today that there will be no Supplementary Estimate to pay for this scheme?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I have noted that the question of Supplementary Estimates is raised on a regular basis on the Order of Business and I want to make the matter of understanding orders clear to Members to assist them.  A question may be asked on the Order of Business regarding when an Estimate is to be taken but only when the Estimate appears on the Order Paper.  It is not in order to raise a matter introducing a Supplementary Estimate or as promised legislation under the Appropriation Bill.  If this were allowed then any matter under the sun would be in order and Standing Orders would be null and void.  A Deputy may ask when an Estimate is to be brought forward but we cannot have people embarking on speeches and raising extraneous issues at this stage of the morning.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	99	The custom and practice in this House, for as long as I have been here, is that when a Minister makes a statement to the media and the public that a Supplementary Estimate process will be introduced to ensure a scheme proceeds it is perfectly in order to raise the matter on the Order of Business.  The Minister answered the question last week but gave no information.  I only want to know that this will not go ahead and I think the Tánaiste can answer the question.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	100	I only want to say that long-standing rulings of the Chair do not allow a question seeking to have a Supplementary Estimate introduced in respect of an issue.  To do so would allow any question under the sun to be raised.  I am allowing the Tánaiste to answer the Deputy's question.

Far from there being any fudge on this issue I pointed out that the Minister had taken charge of dealing with this matter within his Department's budget allocation.  He has been in discussion with me regarding progressing matters next year and in the following years and that is what the record will show.  He has clarified the situation.

I am looking forward to working with the newly appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Jimmy Devins.  Under the Disability Act and the sectoral plans we hope to see introduced this year, what is to happen regarding the qualifying criteria for the disabled drivers' grant?  Is a review to occur under this legislation because the area needs to be reformed?  The grant was introduced in the 1960s when people with disabilities did not have cars and were hardly seen in public although this has changed dramatically for the better.  When is the review to take place?

No. 15 on the list of proposed legislation, the prevention of corruption (amendment) Bill, is different legislation altogether.  It seriously limits the scope of the UN convention — it is confined to the bribery of public officials abroad — particularly in view of the fact that the alliance of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, is launching a new campaign to have the United Nations Convention against Corruption ratified.

The White Paper is not the possession of any single Minister; it is published by the Government and it is a Government commitment to ratify the UN convention.  I simply want to know whether the UN convention is to be ratified.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	119	Will the Minister clarify which Department and Minister will be responsible for the fisheries consolidation Bill, which is No. 32 on the legislative programme?  It is the only fisheries legislation on it, yet it comes under the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  The Government in its wisdom decided to split marine and fisheries and assign responsibility for fisheries with responsibility for agriculture.  Yet if one checks the website of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, one will note that all the fisheries experts still remain in that Department.  Who is dealing with fisheries policy?  There seems to be great confusion within the industry as to who is doing so.  Is it the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Coughlan, or the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Bill to consolidate and update the 17 existing inland fisheries Acts into a single statute to provide for the establishment of a new national inland fisheries authority is not due to be published until next year.  Discussions between the various Ministers on the allocation of responsibilities have taken place and they have agreed on those.  The Minister who will deal with this will probably be the Minister of State, Deputy Browne.

The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, made a comment during the week about one of them in particular, the  HSE.  Is amending legislation envisaged to improve the accountability structures for organisations such as the HSE, the National Roads Authority or many others to hold them to account to this House?

I thank the Minister for bringing forward legislation on the sub-prime market.  People will probably be aware that within the sub-prime lending market there is no regulation of any description.  The sub-prime market accounts for more than €1 billion of loans while currently the market it not subject to any regulation.  It is important that it is subject to the consumer protection code, the CPC.  Furthermore, some prudential measures should be examined with a view to introducing controls over this area.I welcome the fact the Minister for Finance is reviewing increasing the levels in terms of a deposit protection scheme.  The levels are too low.  He should examine the possibility of ensuring there is consistency and a standard consumer deposit protection scheme throughout the European Union.I wish to comment on two further measures.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Cowen, mentioned earlier that he was looking forward to the budget.  It is extremely important that he considers a number of measures in that context.  When stamp duty legislation was going through this House on 26 June I stated that it did not go far enough, that the Bill was a sham and that it was not fair.  I said it should be examined in particular to make it fairer for home owners who wished to move home.  The Minister chose to disregard that proposed amendment to the legislation, but I have been proven right.  The market is in a major slump.  In rural areas, areas outside Dublin, and the area of Limerick East which I represent the housing market is stagnant.  I call on the Minister in the forthcoming budget to amend the stamp duty legislation to make it fairer, to reform it to provide for people who wish to move from their first home to a second home to ensure they will not be liable to penal tax rates.  A major point is that while the Minister talks about not interfering in the market, he has a role to instill confidence in the market.  The Minister has shirked his responsibility in this area and, therefore, I call for reform.We have been told that in the next six months there will be a further two increases in mortgage interest rates, probably of 0.5%.  That would put people under immense pressure.  Ironically, there probably would have been EU mortgage interest rises but for the turbulence in the market.  It is important that the Minister makes such reforms in the next budget, particularly in the area of stamp duty and mortgage interest relief.  It is all about confidence.  The Minister should take steps to build confidence in this regard for the building industry, house buyers and the market.I wish to make one further comment.  The issue of employee pension schemes has arisen.  A report on this area was issued on Tuesday.  It stated that the number of defined benefit schemes provided by companies has fallen from 67% to 37% of the companies involved in a five-year period.  That is worrying.  People will be aware that with a defined benefit scheme employees are guaranteed a certain pension whereas with a defined contribution scheme the risk is put back on the employee depending on how the markets perform.  The Minister must examine, in the forthcoming budget, reforming employee pension schemes to make them more flexible.  Virtually 100% of new employees commencing work in companies will opt for defined contribution schemes rather than defined benefit schemes.  We will not see the end result of that until 20 years' time when these people claim their pensions and suddenly discover there is nothing there.  In terms of reform, it is important this Minister examines this area.While I examine a Bill such as this in the context of financial markets, ultimately the Government should consider it in terms of consumer protection; that is what it is all about.  There are worrying features to the Bill, primarily to do with the advent of the Internet, which has made regulation more difficult.  Effectively, this Bill concerns the introduction of EU-wide regulation of financial instruments.  This is good in terms of the principle of the Single Market.  However, there are concerns.The regulation is to be introduced by 1 November, but nine EU countries have yet to implement the directive, namely, Spain, Italy, Holland, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Estonia, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.  The question must be asked as to whether these countries will be able to operate in the Irish market from 1 November.  Furthermore, we are unsure whether each country will transpose the directive in the same way or whether we will have different standards.  Our Financial Regulator is being asked to rely on regulators in other countries in the matter of activities based in those countries, which is a concern.A survey conducted by KPMG in 2004 is interesting with regard to the risk that transposition will not be carried out correctly throughout the European Union.  Some 49% of companies surveyed stated the regulations would be enforced differently throughout the Union, 29% said regulators would still interpret and apply requirements differently and only 22% of respondents had confidence that the markets in financial instruments directive, MIFID, would work.  This is a worrying feature.In practical terms, as we stand currently with our Financial Regulator, if an investment house based in another country operates through the Internet, with no branch in Ireland, it is subject to our consumer code of conduct and to our money laundering legislation.  However, under the new MIFID regulation, the Irish regulator will have no input and must rely on the other country providing security.  The Financial Regulator informed me of this when I made contact with it.When it comes to making amendments to the legislation, we need to incorporate a requirement to retain a consumer code of conduct and money laundering powers over companies providing services into Ireland via the Internet.  We have those powers where there are branch offices and subsidiaries, but there is a weakness in the MIFID that does not give us these powers over companies operating purely over the Internet.  It is critical we cover this area.The Financial Regulator can investigate any wrongdoing it discovers in all financial investment houses operating in Ireland, whether they operate across borders or have branches here.  However, it must be informed of those wrongdoings because it has no review function.  This is a function that should be enshrined in the legislation on Committee Stage.There are positive elements to the directive.  Investment houses must now look after investors by finding a product to suit them.  Regulations 74 and 75 of the statutory instrument deal with conflicts of interest.  The issue of contracts for differences have received media attention recently.  Where investment houses have a conflict of interest, for example, where they receive commission in contracts for difference from whoever is providing funding, the legislation will provide that they declare this to the investor and seek the best price for him or her.  The investment advisers must look at a number of markets, whether the stock exchange or other regulated markets and find the best price for the investor and go with that.There has been a perception that certain institutions have a vested interest in the Stock Exchange and route all transactions through it.  This will no longer be the case.  Customer trades will be better executed and investment companies must provide more comprehensive documentation for investors and a full audit trail.On balance, MIFID is good, but we must protect the good regulations we already have which have been built up over many years.  My greatest concern is that we will be fully reliant on other financial regulators throughout the European Union, of which there are over 20.  They may have different levels and interpretations of the regulations.  It is critical that the European Commission gives direction to all financial regulators on a code of conduct for cross-border exchange of information.  The regulators of all member states must be provided with defined ways of exchanging information.Statutory instrument 60, which is the primary instrument, was published last February, but the follow-up, SI 1663, was only published in the past week.  This probably contains the most important element for the industry here and mentions for the first time that a code of conduct should be drawn up by the Financial Regulator.  I know from speaking to people in the industry that their main concern is that the regulations are currently a grey area and they do not understand exactly how they will affect them.  As a matter of urgency they would like a specific code of practice for the regulations.  I call on the Financial Regulator to draw up such a code.  It is difficult for people operating in the market to abide by the regulations when they do not understand fully how they should implement them.I would like to see more resources being made available to the Financial Regulator to allow it to regulate this complex market.  Over the past number of years we have had regulated markets like the Stock Exchange.  However, we have also had an increase in highly sophisticated unregulated markets, particularly with the advent of the Internet.  We need to strike a balance between regulating the markets and allowing for the introduction of innovative products.  If we do not have a regulator with sufficient resources to regulate the situation, people will not have confidence in the market.  We should allow for the development of innovative products while at the same time putting in place a regulatory mechanism which allows them to operate and gives confidence to the market.I wish to raise an issue that arose in the Northern Rock situation in the United Kingdom.  Our regulatory system is similar to that in the UK.  We have a Central Bank that, effectively, provides policy and a Financial Regulator that enforces regulations.  However, there is a difference between us.  In Ireland, the Central Bank also regulates liquidity in terms of institutions, whereas the Financial Regulator deals purely with regulation.  In the UK, the financial regulator deals with both liquidity and regulation.  What happened in the Northern Rock situation is that the lines of communication between the Financial Regulator and the Bank of England were slow.  If those lines had been more accessible then, once the liquidity problem hit Northern Rock, the Bank of England could immediately have contacted the Financial Regulator.  However, it was slow to act and had it provided money more quickly it may have given some stability in the market.  It is important that we review the lines of communication connecting the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator and the Government so they can operate in an efficient and speedy manner to ensure a situation like that involving Northern Rock can never happen.Northern Rock took a hit as a direct result of the sub-prime market.  People are of the opinion that the sub-prime market is small, worth €1 billion but growing.  However, in the past two weeks Bank of Ireland has raised its mortgage interest rates for first-time buyers as a direct result of the sub-prime market because the interbank market had tightened up, meaning it costs Bank of Ireland more to borrow money.  That affected ordinary people who borrowed money so we should not think the sub-prime market is divorced from the normal mortgage market — that is far from the case.  I call on the Minister, as a matter of urgency, not only to bring in a consumer protection code, which he promised, but to put in place prudential measures in respect of the sub-prime market.There is considerable nervousness in the market.  Finance Ireland divested its stake in Nua Homeloans last Tuesday and its CEO said it was because of the uncertainty in the sub-prime market, which is worrying.  The market is unregulated currently and it hits the vulnerable.  We all know of people who get into financial difficulty and are sold products in the sub-prime market on which they are charged the exorbitant rate of almost 9.5%, well over twice the normal rate.  I will push the Minister on the sub-prime market and its regulation.I welcome the Bill but it is extremely important we, as regulator, retain control over all investment houses operating in the country.  The interbank market is very much a cross-border market and I ask the Minister to amend the legislation to make certain we keep control over the operation of our consumer code of practiceand matters relating to money laundering forall financial institutions which operate inIreland.I welcome the fact the limits for the deposit protection scheme will be increased.  An EU-wide standard should be considered.  It is extremely important the Financial Regulator introduces a code of practice immediately to ensure companies know what they have to do.  I call on the Minister, as I did on 26 June when the Finance (No. 2) Act 2007 was going through the House, to introduce real reform of stamp duty in the budget, to make the system fairer for homeowners moving house and to return confidence to the market.  It is all very well to say the construction industry needs a soft landing but going from 90,000 houses to 40,000 is not a soft landing — it is a hard, bumpy landing which we may not come out of.  It is incumbent on the Minister to bring stability to the market.  He must bring in measures in the budget on mortgage interest relief and, as mentioned earlier, he must look after the vulnerable, particularly those with disabilities, the old and infirm.  He has a personal interest in the area and I call on him to provide funding.  People have been encouraged to get into the housing market so they can trade up at a later stage.  The problem is they are being sucked in without having to pay stamp duty but the minute they get in, if they want to move on, they are being screwed for stamp duty and that is diabolical.  The Minister must instigate reforms in the budget to bring stability to the market.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak in support of the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007.  It is not the most exciting of titles or Bills but it is a very important Bill.  While I do not have a technical background in financial services I am speaking on the Bill because I recognise the importance of the financial services industry in Ireland and the benefit that European legislation has brought in terms of stability and competitiveness in the market.Recent events, referred to by the previous speaker, such as the run on Northern Rock and the faltering of the US sub-prime market, have reminded us all of the importance of good regulation.  It is important we do not have regulation for the sake of it but regulation which benefits the consumer and the economy on the whole.  The previous speaker mentioned vigilance and the Markets in Financial Instruments and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2007 is about continuing vigilance.  As markets change it is important that legislation changes to meet the various challenges.This Bill has not come out of a puff of air but is part of a much broader picture.  In 1999 the financial services action plan was created at European level and I am glad to say Irish representatives played a very active role in its creation.  The action plan aims to create a single market for financial services.  The prospectus directive and market abuse directives, which came into force in July 2005, have already brought great benefit to the Irish financial services industry.  The transparency directive was introduced earlier this year and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) 2004/39/EC is due to come into force across the EU on 1 November.What sounds like jargon dreamt up by bureaucrats and legislators will actually serve to make our economy more robust and competitive, less vulnerable to fraud and more attractive to foreign investors.  The final step in the process is to introduce the primary legislation to ensure the MiFID can function effectively within the Irish system.  I am happy to say that Ireland was one of the first member states to transpose the directive, in February this year.  I am also happy that we are preparing for the deadline of 1 November by applying the requisite provisions.The Bill stipulates that a person guilty of an offence under section 5 will be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding €10 million, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or both.  These measures have involved consultation with the relevant stakeholders and aim to ensure the directive will be implemented in the most effective way possible.A further provision affecting Irish law is the repeal of the Stock Exchange Act 1995.  I congratulate the Minister for streamlining and, where appropriate, retiring legislation to enable the legal system to run more smoothly and cost-effectively.  The financial services industry is a large employer in Dublin South-East and I very much welcome this Bill, which will serve to keep the cogs of the financial machine turning.  It will bring transparency and accountability where it is needed.
#DarraghOBrien	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-party	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-dob	unknown-#DarraghOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I welcome this very important legislation.  Malahide in my constituency has the highest proportion of individuals in the State working in the financial services sector.  My background, before I had the honour of being elected to this House, involved 13 or 14 years in financial services so I am very familiar with the importance of regulation in the market.  I do not believe any party in this House does not recognise the importance of the financial services industry, namely, banking, insurance and stockbroking, to the economy.  Some thousands of people in Ireland have well paid jobs within the industry.  Many companies have expanded and set up their European and global bases in Ireland not only because of the positive corporation tax policy pursued by Government and, in particular, Fianna Fáil, but because of our well educated workforce.I was quite surprised to hear Deputy Burton state on Tuesday that very few people understand investment or insurance products.  Thousands of professionals in the industry are engaged on a day-to-day basis in ensuring the best deal is secured for consumers.  The Bill, with which I will deal in a few moments, contains important provisions which further protect the consumer and should assist in driving down charges for those transacting financial business across the EU.As I mentioned earlier, Ireland is a centre for world financial markets.  An example of this is the Irish Financial Services Centre which provides high end jobs for our workforce.  Many people with whom I have had the pleasure to work are making a good living from the insurance industry.  We must ensure we protect companies and consumers in the investment market.  Deputy Burton also stated on Tuesday that regulation in Ireland was "regulation with a very light hand under the financial regulator".  Those involved in this market would disagree with that statement.  The insurance and investment sectors have welcomed with open arms the introduction of strenuous, independent regulation which permits the financial regulator to conduct on-the-spot audits and ensures companies make annual returns and, in many instances, biannual returns, to the financial regulator.  These returns are then subject to independent review.  The financial regulator also has the power to impose heavy penalties, such as the withdrawal of a licence to trade within Ireland, in this regard.  The financial regulator has, unfortunately, had to use this power from time to time.  I disagree with Deputy Burton's statement that regulation in Ireland is regulation with a light hand.Concern has been expressed in respect of sub-prime lending with its higher rates of approximately 9% to 9.5%.  We must get to grips with the issue.  Comments by Labour Party Members last Tuesday such as that clients are encouraged to lie or are misled when being sold mortgages will come as a great surprise to the Irish Brokers' Association and Professional Insurance Brokers' Association, both of which have long-standing records within the market and are consumer driven in terms of what is best for their customers.  Comments like this do not help the industry or the public's view of it.The regulations and enactment of this legislation will ensure people can safely trade across Europe.  The penalties being transposed through MiFID will ensure the Irish regulator has strong powers, namely, ten years' imprisonment or a €10 million fine, as mentioned by Deputy Chris Andrews.  Irish consumers are increasingly seeking more sophisticated means of investment through diversified investment policies.  Many Irish companies now meet these needs.  However, MiFID will provide clients with more access to other investment services in EU countries.  This has to be good in terms of competition and driving down prices and costs to the consumer.  With greater access comes the need for greater protection.  As I mentioned earlier, I am delighted that MiFID will harmonise investor protection across the EU and makes provision for the imposition of new maximum penalties.I welcome section 13 which will enable the financial regulator to disclose confidential information to the National Consumer Agency in terms of that agency's performance of its functions.  It is important the financial regulator can deal directly with the National Consumer Agency in ensuring the customer is king.  The advantages of this legislation must be clearly visible to the customer on the ground.The Bill also allows the National Treasury Management Agency to provide foreign exchange services to Departments and State bodies, resulting in sizeable savings to the Exchequer.  I am glad this provision is being introduced.  Savings to the Department of Foreign Affairs alone could be of the order of €700,000 per annum, a sizeable saving.  I look forward to the passing of this Bill which shows Ireland is to the forefront in introducing legislation which protects the consumer in the financial services area.  We will be well ahead of the posse in having this legislation enacted by 1 November.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I wish to take the opportunity, in dealing with this Bill which relates to protection of the consumer in the financial services sector, to speak about the economy.  Members will be aware that the economy is now at tipping point and, that in a sense, nobody is quite sure in what direction it will go next.  While we are all hoping for the soft landing, there is another scenario about which we do not wish to speak.What the Government does now is crucial.  We cannot influence world economic trends but we can mitigate the impact of what is happening elsewhere.  Ireland has actually managed to buck the trend in western Europe during the past 12 to 14 years.  However, we are all conscious of how worryingly dependent we have become on the construction industry.  This makes us vulnerable to even the smallest fall in output.  There are almost 280,000 people in the construction industry which comprises a massive 25% of GDP.  While it is our major economic driver, it is also our Achilles heel.We have witnessed a dramatic change in housing output from a high last year of almost 90,000 units to 70,000 units this year.  While Government and industry estimates in respect of output vary, I understand 50,000 units is the expected output for next year, decreasing each year after that.  Housing construction accounts for approximately 12% to 14% of GDP.  A one third fall-off in housing output would result in a 3% to 4% reduction in GDP.  If this happened, an almost unattainable growth rate would be required in other sectors to make up for it.  If we are to maintain current spending in terms of the type of services we would like to have, we need to ensure the growth rates do not fall to that extent.What we do now is vital in determining how we weather the storm ahead.  I do not believe any of us are in any doubt that there is a storm ahead.  With stamp duty take-out down 14% on what was predicted and the tax take increase a full 12 percentage points behind current spending increases, it is clear that something has to give.  This is simply not sustainable.  Indiscriminate, untargeted current spending that does not give value for money or produce clear quantifiable outputs cannot be permitted or even contemplated.  However, spending measures which do sustain employment and contribute to future saving and growth must be prioritised.  The danger is that reaction to the less buoyant tax take could result in Government spending being reined in to the extent that it further decelerates an already decelerating economy.We now have an opportunity to accelerate badly needed infrastructural projects which can take up the slack provided by the loss of housing construction and so sustain output and employment.Many of the infrastructural projects planned in the good times have fallen behind.  A number of the major transport projects in Transport 21 are far behind schedule.  The joining of the two existing Luas lines, which was imminent, has been postponed, I suspect forever, but certainly until after Metro north is completed.  Other projects have been postponed and are falling behind.  We now have the opportunity to bring forward planned projects which may be at the other end of the timescale.  Forgive me for being parochial, but the Luas line to Rathfarnham, for example, is planned and could be brought forward to replace other projects.  It is important to sustain investment in such projects as these.  If we do not do this the impact on the economy will not be confined to the decline in house building.  We must build up this infrastructure.  The Government must plan to proceed with capital spending and take advantage of the emerging labour availability, which has not existed until now, to add to projects which are already planned.  Rather than fall behind, we must accelerate investment.Several significant infrastructural projects in the area of the arts could make a difference to sustaining employment.  The new national theatre, the national conference centre, the National Concert Hall extension and the Abbotstown campus projects have a big employment potential but have been painfully slow in coming to the construction stage.  A new momentum must be given to projects such as these to substitute for the decline in other areas of building.  Otherwise the drop in housing output could become a catastrophe, not merely for the construction industry but for the entire economy.  That is a real concern.The capital grants available to householders to switch to alternative fuels were a welcome initiative.  It is worrying that this scheme appears to have stalled.  It would be very short-sighted not to maintain a scheme such as this in the construction area.  With construction workers becoming available, value for money could be obtained by householders.  Employment could be sustained and, in the long term, energy saved and carbon output reduced.  A scheme such as this must be continued.  The improved housing insulation standards are welcome but will have little impact in the short to medium term as very few new houses will be built in the coming years.  The housing stock has been increased in recent years and, unfortunately, new houses have been built to a very poor standard, which would not be acceptable elsewhere.  Something can now be done to retrofit insulation in the existing housing stock.  The existing low level of home insulation will increase householders' fuel bills and add to the cost of the country's carbon credits for many years.  A carefully devised targeted capital grants scheme to bring insulation in the existing housing stock up to a standard which would reduce imported fuels and carbon emissions would be of great advantage to householders and the economy.The Minister must be conscious of the dangers of reducing capital expenditure at a time when the economy is decelerating.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	154	At first glance this seems a technical and complicated Bill.  However, it deals with a number of issues that would have huge effect on ordinary people in the future.  I can well imagine why it was decided that primary legislation should be enacted to copperfasten penalties as high as €10 million or ten years in jail.  Those are large penalties and I can understand why secondary legislation would not be sufficient.  When one considers that we are talking about markets across the European Union it is easy to see that penalties of this kind are necessary.  There are always opportunists who are able to manipulate markets to their own advantage and have done so in the past.  In my years in the Dáil I have heard on many occasions of crime gangs and opportunists of one sort or another who are involved in financial crime on this scale.  While it behoves every parliament and the European Union to ensure that legislation is enacted to stop this sort of crime, there is always a new twist somewhere.  Despite our best efforts and those of the European Union on this occasion, someone will get around these regulations at some time or another.Given that we have a financial regulator, will all other financial regulators, irrespective of their guise in other countries, now be singing from the same hymn sheet?  It is my understanding that the directives contained in the Bill have this effect.  Does the European Union now write the script for the regulators?  That is my understanding of the Bill and I ask the Minister to clarify the matter.I understand that Statutory Instrument 60/2007 is 259 pages long and I assume it contains every conceivable reference to financial markets in the European Union.  The core issue being addressed in the Bill is the requirement to introduce penalties at national level for breaches of the provisions involved.  Like most legislation, it will ensure that the financial regulator will be able to levy fees on the financial services sector.  I assume this will not involve a cost to the Exchequer and that the financial regulator will be able to levy fees on the users of the service.  The same system operates for other regulatory provisions.I note that the Bill repeals the Stock Exchange Act of 1995.  Does this mean the Stock Exchange will be marginalised or has the measure more to do with the world of computers and electronics than with the workings of the Stock Exchange?  I recently heard an item on the radio indicating that it will soon be possible to do some of the work of the Stock Exchange without having any connection to the Stock Exchange.  Is this what is intended in this legislation?  I assume it is on the way.The relevance of the legislation to every person will be in the regulation of investment firms and credit institutions when providing investment services.  This is why I say that no matter how one regulates a system someone will get around it somehow.  The directive aims to create a pan-European market in investment products by replacing the various national rules with a harmonised European legislative system.  I hope this will mean greater regulation of lending institutions.We have been lucky in Ireland in having a strong banking system.  I have been long enough in the House to remember a time when our banking system was not strong.  That was not good for the economy at the time.  There is great trust in our present system, although the excessive profits of the banks is another story.  It is important that banks are financially sound and the people can put their trust in them.The banks in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries have so much money they are in a position to lend to themselves.  This is called inter-bank lending.  With the new culture of taking every opportunity to make more money, bankers have engaged in the new in-thing of sub-prime lending.  I think sub-prime lending is a new form of hire purchase, HP.  The younger Deputies may not know much about the time when people used to buy household items and cars on the HP.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, knows what I am referring to——
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	155	Yes, indeed.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	156	That was based on the understanding that it was easy to get money provided that one entered into an agreement to pay a very high interest rate on it.  There is not much difference between it and sub-prime lending, because the banks advanced the money on the understanding that it might not be that easy to get it back and therefore charged a significantly higher interest rate.  It would be nothing short of disaster if sub-prime lending took hold in Ireland.  We are told it is minimal, but I do not know if that is correct.  I know that when billions are circulating in the banking system, the banks will take the opportunity to make more money.  I hope this legislation will guarantee that young people are protected from sub-prime mortgages.  In effect we are protecting people from themselves.  It is the dream of every couple to own their home and if there was a possibility of getting a mortgage, even if it was more expensive than normal, they would be likely to go for it.  It is important to prevent that.  The people with the grubby fingers in the banking fraternity will make money and do not care too much about the anxieties impossible repayment rates create.The National Treasury Management Agency, which handles our national debt, has performed extraordinary well and I have great time for it.  We are quick to knock organisations when they do not do things right, but in fairness the National Treasury Management Agency has done well in funding the local authorities, the courts section, the universities, the Railway Procurement Agency and Housing Finance Agency.  I often wonder why the National Treasury Management Agency did not have a great involvement with the National Roads Authority.  I cannot understand why that agency, rather than the public private partnerships, cannot get involved, given the significant resources at its disposal.  A greater part of the national road network would be completed if this had been the case.  I think I speak for the Minister of State and most of my parliamentary colleagues when I say that whatever happens, I do not want the Government or the European Union to lay a hand on the basic principles that have made the credit union movement so powerful and important to ordinary people.

We have moved away from saving.  The credit union is an organisation for the people run by the people and, whatever happens, I want a hands-off approach to any measures that might hold up the progress of the credit union movement.  I hope the legislation liberalises the credit union movement so that it can take its place on the high street or in the smallest community with any banking institution.

A Cheann Comhairle, they have had the opportunity of seeing  a national personality and I am sure they are very happy about that.  If the Ceann Comhairle wants me to stray off I can talk about Tallaght for the next 20 minutes.  I am very glad that the Dáil has returned to normal business.  People want us to deal with the issues that are of concern to them.  During the past few days we have had major statements on crime and health issues.  That is what people want us to address.As the previous speaker said there are issues which are of concern to our communities.  I take the opportunity to acknowledge the presence of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy John McGuinness, because I have not been in the House with him since his appointment, which I warmly welcome.  I think he will do a tremendous job and I hope he will not spend all his time wondering about the prospects of the Kilkenny-Carlow region.  Tallaght is the third largest population centre in the country and we appreciate the attention of Ministers.  I know the Minister of State was in Russia last week and did some very positive work, however, members may be surprised to learn that I am the chairman of the Ukraine parliamentary friendship group.  Therefore, I take the opportunity to mention the significant market in Ukraine.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I am surprised the Chair did not remind me that Tallaght was not in the legislation either, because I could talk about it.  However, I take the point.  I am a relatively new Deputy, as this is my second term, I have watched other Members and some of my more experienced colleagues talk about everything.  If I stray, I apologise.  I am sorry the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Cowen, is not here because I wanted to pay tribute to him as well.The Bill complements the EC regulations made last February transposing the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MiFID.  It harmonises and modernises the EU-wide legislative framework for investment firms, promoting greater cross-border competition.  It takes in the whole EU financial sector.  The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive should make it easier and cheaper for customers, including retail customers, to buy and sell shares across a Single Market.I have been warned by the Ceann Comhairle to keep to the subject and not to talk about Tallaght, Ukraine or anything else.  I do not know whether the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be as strict.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I did.  I am glad the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is here.  I am happy to make a brief contribution on this Bill.  I repeat what I said earlier, that irrespective of the importance of the subject under discussion and the public response to it, people want us to get on with the business as we have been doing over the past couple of days and it is important that we do that.  What we are discussing this morning is very much part of that.While we transposed this directive by way of EC regulations, the scale of the maximum penalties proposed for serious breaches of certain of the new MiFID regulations is such that primary legislation is needed.  That is the main reason for this Bill.  The proposed maximum penalties are fines of up to €10 million and-or ten years imprisonment on foot of conviction on indictment.  The level of the proposed penalties is in line with the maximum penalty provisions set out in other financial services legislation such as the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005.  I note that minor offences will, as a matter of course, continue to be dealt with through the administrative sanctions system and-or as summary offences.This Bill also empowers the Financial Regulator to levy fees on the financial services sector towards the cost of implementing its new MiFID functions.  I also note that the Stock Exchange Act 1995 is being repealed in this Bill as its provisions are being superseded by the MiFID regulations.  This Bill is being taken at this time as the new MiFID regime comes into effect for the industry across the EU member states on 1 November.The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive is a significant directive for the financial services sector.  Ireland was one of the first member states to transpose this directive through detailed comprehensive regulations earlier this year.  This has created an important competitive advantage for the financial services sector in Ireland as it provides legal certainty about what is required and plenty of time to plan.  This adds to Ireland's strong record in the transposition of EU financial services directives.Deputy Connaughton spoke about credit unions.  It is important we should support our local credit unions.  That applies in Cork, Kilkenny and Wexford as well as in the Dublin region.  I am particularly supportive of my local credit unions in Tallaght, Firhouse, Templeogue and Greenhills.  It is interesting that credit union organisations, which do so much great work in our communities, often come to public representatives to discuss issues of concern to them.  As a public representative, but also as a customer, I am able to make representations about the issues brought to me by credit unions and their members and, like the last speaker, I am pleased to do that.As Deputy Chris Andrews said, this is a very technical Bill.  It is difficult to get simple sound bites from it.  The legislation is clearly important and, at a time when politics in this House has become so competitive, it is good to hear colleagues agree that it is good legislation.  I am sure the Ministers of State are happy to hear that.  It will be interesting to see whether there will be a vote on it later.Section 9 of the Bill will ensure that appropriate sanctions can be provided for a conviction on indictment for specified offences in the reinsurance regulations which were introduced in July 2006 as part of the transposition of the EU reinsurance directive.  The proposed maximum penalties for serious offences are fines of up to €10 million and-or ten years imprisonment on foot of conviction on indictment.  The indictable offences include the offence of carrying on reinsurance business without authorisation.  Minor offences will, as a matter of course, continue to be dealt with through the administrative sanctions system and-or as summary offences.Section 10 deals with the Netting of Financial Contracts Act which provides protection for netting or set-off arrangements between parties to financial contracts in the event of insolvency.  Given the rapid pace of change in financial services, this Bill now widens the definition of financial contracts in response to market developments.Section 11 deals with client moneys.  The Bill amends section 52 of the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995 to confirm certain limitations of receiver-liquidator access to client money following the winding up of an authorised investment business firm as recommended in the report of the Morrogh Review Group.Section 12 provides for a simplification for the State ownership of Icarom plc, formerly the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, which, I understand, is under administration, by authorising the removal of the holding company from the current ownership structure.The question of the Financial Regulator is dealt with in section 13.  Section 13(a) and (b) enable the Financial Regulator to disclose confidential information to the National Consumer Agency for the performance of the agency’s functions as provided for in the Consumer Protection Act 2007, subject to any EU confidentiality constraints.  Section 13(c) extends the deadline for submission of its annual budget by the Financial Regulator from end September to end October each year.  Given the complexity of the process for establishing the Financial Regulator’s budget, it is felt that the Financial Regulator should be given a more extensive period for preparation.  Section 13(f) will reduce the number of required compulsory retirements from the board of the Financial Regulator by the number, if any, of voluntary resignations which may have occurred between the relevant anniversary dates to ensure continuity of membership and to minimise any potential disruption to the efficient working of the Financial Regulator.Section 13(d) and (e), on the Financial Services Ombudsman, relieves the Ombudsman of the requirement to provide the Financial Regulator with certain details where he decides not to investigate or to discontinue an investigation.  The Bill also provides that members of the Ombudsman Council shall not be liable for costs arising from the discharge, in good faith, of their statutory duties.I am sure the students in the Gallery are delighted to be here, although perhaps they are a little upset by being out of school.  It is good that they had the opportunity to see national personalities in the person of the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who is also an easily recognisable personality.  I have no doubt the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, has fans all over the country.

This may not be the sort of issue that is talked about on the doorsteps or in the shopping centres in Wexford and Cork but people want us to deal with these issues.  I rambled around my village in Tallaght early this morning — people would be surprised if they followed me around and saw what members of the public are saying to me.  Interestingly, people do talk about financial matters and the economy.  They raise crime and health issues but this morning people also mentioned stamp duty and property.  These are of concern to people and they want us to represent them on these issues and I am happy, as ever, to do so.Having heard positive noises from the Opposition benches about this Bill, I look forward to finding out if our Opposition colleagues are ready to support it.  I hope so because Deputy Connaughton said this morning that this is good legislation.I appreciate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's latitude and thank him for letting me stray a little.  It is Thursday, which is a different sort of day.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister of State on his new appointment.  I wish him well in the role for many years ahead.  I also welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which is part of an EU-wide regulation of financial services.Undoubtedly, the International Financial Services Centre is one of the great success stories of the Irish economy in the past 20 years.  Its success has benefitted the economy and the many people who work there.  The financial services industry is built on confidence, trust and a good reputation and it is important that it is sufficiently regulated.  Its good reputation is the guarantee of future expansion and growth.The reputation of the British banking industry has been severely dented, with the Northern Rock case highlighting the threats we might face if we are unlucky.  We must learn from that experience to ensure such an event does not occur here.  We must enhance the protection scheme for savers and depositors in Irish financial institutions.  Our scheme is currently limited to 10% of deposits, with an upper limit of €20,000, which is completely out of sync with other European countries.  We must protect depositors and ensure that banks do not take inappropriate risks.  I welcome the fact that the EU is examining the Irish deposit protection scheme.As with previous speakers, I have major concerns about sub-prime lending in Ireland.  Lenders sell on a door-to-door basis, attempting to persuade people to roll up their loans and remortgage their homes.  Such practices take place in my constituency of Dublin North-East.  The lenders talk about easy borrowing while making huge commission by pressurising vulnerable people into taking out loans.  There are applicants who lie on the application forms about their capacity to make repayments so they can secure loans.  Irish regulation is too lax.  It is estimated that sub-prime lending in Ireland amounts to over €1 billion.  The Financial Regulator must have greater control of this market to ensure operations by these companies are robust and that they apply proper selling practices.The regulation of complex securities and their rating agencies must also be reviewed.  This process currently lacks transparency, particularly the uncertain valuation of securities which lies at the heart of the present credit crunch.  In recent years many Irish people have been enticed to buy second properties abroad by freeing up equity in their homes.  It is questionable if those selling properties are providing buyers with the necessary consumer information.  These properties are being marketed as having rents guaranteed for many years to come but it is obvious that wages in those countries cannot support those rent guarantees.  This area must be thoroughly examined by the Department.The economic challenges we face are more serious than the Government would have us believe.  We now face a much larger budget deficit, around €1 billion, as the Minister for Finance advised recently.  Important lessons must be learned from recent developments in global financial markets.  The Irish economy is beginning to slow and we clearly face more economic challenges.  Our economy is vulnerable to a slow down because of our over-reliance on property lending.  The property market is over-valued and confidence is falling as a result.  We are one of the most indebted countries in Europe, with private debt two and a half times greater than our GNP.  The warning signs have appeared in the newspapers and in announcements by the Central Bank in recent years but they have been ignored by the Government.  With the budget on the way, the ordinary people of the country face difficult times.  I call on the Minister of Finance to think of the neediest in society, the homeless, when framing the budget.I welcome this Bill, which aims to increase the transparency of quotations for financial instruments by standardising them.  This will help to reduce costs for users of financial instruments such as equities and shares, bonds and derivatives.  It is to be welcomed that the new financial instruments, such as derivatives, are being brought within the scope of this legislation.  I welcome section 14 of the Bill, which will extend the National Treasury Management Agency deposit and borrowing facilities to non-commercial bodies such as the Courts Service, universities, the RPA and the Housing Finance Agency.  The extension of treasury services to the HFA will allow the National Treasury Management Agency to provide it more efficiently with short-term funds needed to manage its cashflow requirements.I hope that the House's endorsement of the Bill will yield significant benefits to both Irish investors and investment firms.  I look forward to debating the Bill on Committee Stage.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  One of the most interesting things I read recently was the interview with the Minister for Finance in the  Sunday Independent, where he suggested that Ireland’s economy was the strongest it had been for ten years.  That is a phrase to remember, like Michael Fish’s famous prediction that there would not be a hurricane or Margaret Thatcher saying there would never be a woman Prime Minister in her lifetime.  Most of us are starting to realise that, although many of the basic factors in the economy remain strong, the economic position in which the country finds itself is certainly more vulnerable than it has been for at least a decade.  Like our finance spokesperson, Deputy Bruton, I agree we are well beyond the time for talking about wake-up calls because the warning clouds have been gathering for quite a while.We have seen phenomenal credit growth in the economy.  We often congratulate ourselves on the fact that over the past 15 years we have managed to reduce our public debt as a percentage of GDP from well over 100% to 20% or 30%.  Yet what we have really seen is a transfer from public to private debt, whereby private debt is 2.5 times our GNP.  In many ways, therefore, we are just as much in debt as in the early 1980s, but we are indebted in a different way.  We have also witnessed an appalling over-dependence on the property market.  We had a real Celtic tiger up to 2000 or 2001, but since then we have had a false boom based largely on the property market coupled with low interest rates and cheap credit.  The effects of that will come home to roost.  In addition, inflation is 50% higher than the rest of the eurozone and it is obvious to anyone that it is beginning to impact on people's pockets through price increases.  Inflation is outstripping wage increases, which leads to further pressure to increase salaries.Our export market share is falling and we all know how much our competitiveness is going down.  I look forward to reading the NESC report next month.  Meanwhile, spending is increasing at roughly twice the rate of tax increases, which is not sustainable in the longer term.  The programme for Government is committed to 7% increases in current spending year-on-year which will be impossible to deliver without significant tax increases, given that the economy will only grow by 3% to 5% per annum and tax receipts will grow by a similar percentage.As in 2002, fiscal policy is largely determined by the electoral cycle rather than the economic cycle, with major spending increases and tax reductions in the run up to elections, followed by clawbacks thereafter.  The Government got away with it the last time but will not do so again.Ireland needs a comprehensive strategy for economic renewal.  We need to hang onto the old formula of low taxes, a good education system and balanced budgets in a pro-enterprise environment, but we must do much more.  We need to upskill most of our labour force.  Some 500,000 people are working in jobs that require little or no skills.  Most of those jobs will disappear over the next ten to 15 years and, if not, they will largely go to transient immigrant labour.  People in that situation need the opportunity to develop new skills.  We must also consider introducing welfare reform, possibly along the Danish model, identifying the approximately 120,000 long-term unemployed people who can work, thus enabling or requiring them to develop skills to enter the work force.We need to restore competitiveness and deliver on infrastructure.  In many ways, it is unfortunate the economy has grown so fast to the extent that it has not allowed us to deliver the required infrastructure.  There is a crying need for public sector reform, which could have been done relatively easily over the past ten years while there was plenty of money in the economy.  It will be hard to do that now but it must be done — particularly deregulation of sheltered sectors and protected quarters in the economy.  Indigenous industry should be promoted by focusing on industries that have grown up from small businesses run by self-employed operators.  Sustainability is needed through the development of a green economy in preparation for the realities of climate change and increased fossil fuel costs.A fundamental reform of the planning system is also required, particularly in constituencies such as my own.  Large-scale urban areas can be developed in such a way that infrastructure and amenities, including schools and other facilities, are delivered in due time.I broadly welcome the Bill, which is largely technical in nature.  It aims to give effect in primary legislation to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.  We do not dispute the need for such legislation.  I welcome section 9, which provides for stronger penalties, including prison sentences in some cases for people breaching the reinsurance regulations.  I am somewhat confused about the changes concerning the NTMA, which seems to be taking on the form of a bank.  I am not sure what the purpose of that change is, but I will advance my views on the matter on Committee Stage.Section 16 deals with ministerial pensions and most of the proposed reforms therein are acceptable.  An opportunity now arises within the context of the Bill to table amendments with a view to removing the ministerial component of pensions for former Ministers who have been convicted of tax fraud, other financial offences, corruption or non-co-operation with tribunals.  Such an amendment should be considered by the Minister on Committee Stage.Although it may not require legislative change, I echo Deputy Terence Flanagan's call to address the issue of protection for depositors.  In Ireland this amounts to only €20,000 or 90% of the deposit, whichever is the lower figure.  However, this is vastly inferior to what is being proposed in the United Kingdom where they are talking about a level of £100,000.  I am not suggesting that taxpayers should indemnify all the banks in the country to 100%, but we should strengthen that protection for depositors.  We also need new measures to restrict the practice of sub-prime lending here, which thankfully is nowhere near the situation in the United States or elsewhere.I broadly welcome the Bill and look forward to dealing with it on Committee Stage when we will have a more detailed discussion and can table amendments.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I welcome the Bill and am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  As previous speakers have said, there are serious concerns that the economy is possibly not as strong as it was.  There will clearly be a reduction in stamp duty intake and VAT returns, so we will have to look long and hard at how we address the shortfall.If responsibility and credibility are not evident at the top they cannot percolate down to Ministers, the Civil Service and our public services generally.  Where will the management leadership come from?  How many public servants have lost their jobs because of incompetence or a refusal to do particular work?  A case in point is PPARS, which cost €180 million at least — we think it cost that figure but we cannot get absolute clarity on the matter.  That was the level of expenditure, yet it turned out to be a financial disaster.  Was anybody held to be responsible or culpable, and did anyone lose their job as a result?  If that level of taxpayers' money can be wasted and not a single person is found to be accountable or responsible we have a serious problem.  Why did the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, refuse to take any responsibility for the scandal involving €2 billion in nursing home charges?  When nobody takes responsibility at the top, the effects percolate down through the system.Worries have now arisen about sub-prime lending practices.  Meanwhile, banks are repackaging high-risks mixed with good risks and selling them on to other banks, which sell them in turn to other banks.  Therefore, nobody is quite sure what they are buying, what they are getting or what the ultimate liability will be.  Clearly, this area must be regulated.My attention has been drawn to the issue of the Financial Regulator.  In France, 12,000 public servants are working in the field of financial services regulation, compared to 1,800 in the United Kingdom where they seem to manage their business.  Who is in charge and who will take control and be responsible for the various financial scandals in our public service?  I do not wish to point a finger in any direction but there is a significant haemorrhage of funds.  When we had plenty of money people could shrug this off but in the climate of cutbacks this is no longer acceptable.Credit unions have been a strong source of support to communities, helping people manage their money and save for relatively small items such as a holiday or a car yet they are prevented from entering the mortgage market.  This Bill should be amended to allow for regulations to be put in place to enable the credit unions enter this area of activity.  They have the interest of the consumer at heart, being not-for-profit organisations.People remain concerned about how financial institutions offer life assurance with mortgages making customers feel that if they do not accept this assurance the mortgage may not come through, or that problems will arise that they might not otherwise have anticipated.  This area needs to be more closely regulated.Inflation has risen excessively in all the areas that the Government controls, at a rate of 5%.  This affects ESB and gas rates which makes business uncompetitive.  Prices in areas over which the Government has no control, such as imports, are competitive and the inflation rate is much lower.This morning on the Order of Business, the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance said in response to the decision not to open a plant in Cork with 1,100 jobs, that it was made for commercial reasons and had nothing to do with competitiveness.  Is this more gobbledygook?  Has the Government become infected with this line?  One can make a commercial decision only on the basis of competition and competitiveness, wages and costs.  People vote with their feet.  Business men are hard-nosed and know where they can make greater profit, where costs are higher or lower.  It beggars belief that the Minister for Finance could tell this House that a commercial decision was made without regard to competitiveness.People in Government agencies seem to be losing a sense of responsibility and nobody wants to take control.  The Health Service Executive is a case in point.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	176	I thank all the Deputies who attended for this debate.  I particularly thank the Whips for agreeing to give priority to this Bill, in recognition of the requirement to activate some of its provisions from 1 November next.Deputies raised many interesting points, some of which were of a general nature rather than specific to the provisions of this Bill.  I shall try, nevertheless, to respond to the significant points.  Deputy Burton made many references to so-called "light" financial regulation in Ireland indicating that our regulatory system is somehow inadequate or ineffective.  This characterisation of the quality of Ireland's financial regulatory regime is wide of the mark and does not stand up to scrutiny.The reputation of Ireland as a suitable base for international financial services activity is a key element within our overall competitiveness and something we have a common interest in maintaining.  The IMF, a reputable international authority competent to assess the standing of our system of financial regulation, conducted a comprehensive on-site assessment of IFSRA and declared that our Financial Regulator was well up to international norms.  The Comptroller and Auditor General also carried out a recent value-for-money assessment of the Financial Regulator.  Overall, the report presents a positive picture of the financial services regulatory environment in Ireland and it is evident that the Financial Regulator is operating to a high standard.The chairman and the chief executive officer of the Financial Regulator recently set out in detail the regulatory approach that guides the conduct of its activities.  I refer Deputies to these speeches and the Financial Regulator's strategic plan for a very clear explanation of its regulatory principles.  It is essential that public comment and discussion is accurate and properly informed by the factual position in an area of strong interest to consumers which is also an important strategic and highly competitive sector of our economy internationally.Some Deputies said that the Minister for Finance should be playing a more prominent role in managing the response to the current turmoil affecting the global financial services sector.  This is based on a misconception of the role of the Irish Minister for Finance in the area of financial regulation.  His role is to bring forward proposals to the Oireachtas for the regulation of the financial services sector.  Once that legislation has been enacted, the task of implementing it on a day-to-day basis rests with the Financial Regulator.  Neither the Minister nor the Department exercises legal powers or responsibilities in the area of financial regulation and the Financial Regulator is independent of the Minister in the exercise of its statutory functions.  Various accountability mechanisms are in place for the Financial Regulator, including obligations on specified officers, including the chief executive, to appear before an Oireachtas committee on request.Several Deputies commented on contracts for difference and the need to regulate them.  Spread betting has become popular of late in virtually any activity, from sports results to weather predictions, and even election results.  Financial contracts for difference, or FCDs, are used in spread betting and involve taking a position on the future movement of a price, either up or down, of a share, a commodity or an index such as a stock market index.As from 1 November next, FCDs will be regulated under the markets in financial instruments directive regime as they are classified as "financial instruments" under Part 3 of Schedule 1 to SI 60 of 2007.  Therefore, from that date, financial spread contracts, for instance, on specific shares, bonds or indices of shares, will become a regulated activity, and firms providing this service will have to be authorised.  As part of their authorisation, firms will have to comply with all the requirements, including the rigorous client protection requirements, set down in SI 60 of 2007.  Spread betting on matters other than financial instruments, such as sporting events, is not covered by the directive or the transposing regulations.Deputies were interested too in whether credit unions were precluded from investing in non-capital-guaranteed products or savings for client moneys they have on deposit.  The Registrar of Credit Unions took steps to limit the exposure of credit unions in the investment market by issuing a guidance note on investments in October 2006.  This guidance note sets out the framework within which credit unions should maintain their investments.  The guidance note is subject to regular review by the registrar in consultation with the sector.  The board of directors of each individual credit union is responsible for managing the funds and setting the investment policy of that credit union.  However, the registrar expects credit unions to comply with this guidance to avoid undue risk to members' savings and will monitor credit unions' investments against this guidance.The legislation and the guidance in place at present do not prohibit explicitly credit unions from investing in financial derivative products.  However, the guidance note sets out a list of authorised investments for credit unions and within this list there are limits for each class of investment instrument in which credit unions can invest.  Credit unions are not precluded from investing in non-capital guaranteed products under current legislation or guidance.  For instance, while they can invest in equities, under the terms of the investment framework, investment in equities is not to exceed 5% of the total of a credit union's investment portfolio.Deputy Burton referred to the need for legislation to regulate the sub-prime lending sector that will enable borrowers to be protected.  The measures the Minister proposes to bring forward as outlined in the consultation paper will provide for a robust legislative framework to address this concern and other regulatory issues in respect of the non-deposit lending sector in general.Under these proposals, all non-deposit-taking lenders engaged in retail lending will be brought within the Financial Regulator's authorisation and ongoing supervision regime.  In this context, retail lending means lending to all natural persons and to companies with a turnover not exceeding €3 million or, in other words, lending to all those who would benefit from the consumer protection code and the Financial Services Ombudsman scheme in their dealings with any other regulated provider.It is important to note that notwithstanding the growth of what is described as sub-prime lending in Ireland in recent years, it still comprises a very small share, namely, approximately 2% of overall lending.  A significant proportion of this lending is for borrowers who, owing to the atypical nature of their employment or income, would not have access to loan finance otherwise.  It allows such people build up a credit record which, in time, will enable them to access mainstream finance.While Ireland was one of the earlier movers in transposing this directive, there was some interest among Deputies as to the number of member states that have yet to transpose the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, MiFID, and what might be the implications of their delay. The latest information I have to hand is that ten member states have yet to notify the European Commission that they have transposed the MiFID.  While a number of them are expected to meet the deadline, it is likely that some will not.As for the firms established in member states that fail to meet the 1 November deadline, it is likely they will be allowed to continue to operate on the basis of their existing authorisation.  However, they would not be allowed to provide the new MiFID activities such as the provision of investment advice until such time as the directive was fully transposed in their home state.Once again, I thank Members for their contributions to this debate and express appreciation for their input

In a modern global economic environment committed to the principles of trade liberalisation, export controls are an anachronism.  As one of the most open economies in the world, with exports of goods and services equal to 86% of gross domestic product, GDP, Ireland has a vested interest in promoting a global trading environment unhampered by bureaucratic obstacles.  As a strong supporter of trade liberalisation, Ireland continues to work with its EU partners and other like-minded countries within the World Trade Organisation to eliminate trade barriers and to promote the free movement of trade and services.Why then does the Government seek to impose controls on the export of certain goods and services?  Its adherence to the principle of free trade is tempered by its equally strong commitment to arms control and global disarmament.  The global community has a shared need for a stable, secure, inclusive and co-operative international environment.  To this end, Ireland and other like-minded countries have undertaken to regulate trade in military products and in goods that have civil and military applications.The challenge for any administration seeking to introduce an effective export control system is to strike a balance between the two competing policy demands.  On one hand the Government has an economic imperative to facilitate trade and ease administrative burdens while on the other, it desires to implement fully its foreign and security policy objectives with regard, for example, to the promotion of non-proliferation and universal human rights.In striving to reach this balance, the Government's starting point is the external environment.  Ireland's existing legislation pertaining to export controls dates from 1983.  While a mere 23 years have elapsed, much has changed on the planet.  In 1983, Europe and the world languished in the depths of the Cold War.  After the fall of the Iron Curtain and the democratisation of central and eastern Europe, one had every reason to anticipate a period of sustained global peace and stability.  Sadly however, the tragedy of the attacks on 9 September 2001 and subsequent events have brought the realisation that new threats to international peace and security have emerged.  It has become apparent to all that the enemy is no longer confined to massed armies without.  Increasingly, one must guard against wanton acts of terrorism within that affect people going about their daily lives.  Thanks to the wonders of modern communications, one cannot deny knowledge of atrocities perpetrated on innocent civilians in Darfur and other conflict zones.  Last week, Ireland's television screens were filled with haunting images from Burma.  Closer to home, the horrors of the recent Balkan conflict, including the massacre at Srebrenica, have dispelled any assumptions that Europe had advanced to a state that made it immune to the inhumanities inflicted on the inhabitants of other continents.Another challenge to be faced has been the blurring of the distinction between military and civilian goods.  States and non-state parties that have been denied the possibility to import weapons directly have sought to develop their own weapons programmes by acquiring items not designed or developed exclusively for military purposes but that nonetheless can have military applications.  Twenty years ago, the Government had a clear understanding of what it wished to control, be it guns, bullets, tanks or bombers.  However, Ireland has been shaken out of its complacency.  Rather than being a missile launched from a B2 bomber, the weapon that struck the Twin Towers was a civilian passenger jet.  The London underground explosives in July 2005 were encased in nylon backpacks rather than weapons grade steel.  It is now understood that we live in an era when anything and everything can be used as a force for evil.  In the right hands a hurley or a cricket bat can be wielded with sublime grace while in the wrong hands, up a dark alley, either can become a lethal weapon.In the light of these developments and out of concern at whether the existing 1983 legislation was adequate for the needs of a 21st century export control system, in 2003 my Department commissioned Forfás to undertake a review of Ireland's licensing system for military and dual use.  The overall objective of this exercise was to prepare a recommendation for the Government as to how best Ireland could modernise and strengthen its export licensing controls so as to ensure full compliance with our international obligations.Forfás contracted Fitzpatrick Associates, Economic Consultants, in conjunction with the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, SIPRI, a highly respected authority on issues such as conflict and security, to prepare a report with four specific objectives: first, to consult with Departments, end users, international organisations and specialised institutes, both national and international, involved in the licensing of military and dual-use goods, and with interested parties, to determine the most appropriate export licensing system to be put in place in Ireland; second, to prepare background material for a public consultation process in order to allow members of the public to make submissions or contributions on the optimal method of licensing military and dual-use goods; third, to study international best practice in export licensing control systems in other countries; and, fourth, to submit a report outlining the results of both sets of consultations and the review of international best practice in export licensing systems for military and dual-use goods.The work of the consultants was guided by an interdepartmental group comprising officials from my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Defence, and Justice Equality and Law Reform, and the Revenue Commissioners.  The group provided assistance and support to the consultants.  However, I must emphasise that they had complete editorial independence and the report's conclusions and recommendations were those of the consultants.As part of this review process, roughly 40 public consultations were held with individual organisations in Ireland.  These included exporters, representative bodies, State agencies and others.  In addition, some 14 organisations responded to an invitation to members of the public to make submissions.In the case of industry, the key lessons learned were as follows.  Only a small number of companies had any involvement with the licensing system.  Those companies who used the system were generally happy with it, while having some suggestions as to how it could be improved.  Specific topics identified in this regard included more advance information on developments in the system, greater clarity as to what was controlled and on end users of concern and the need for an electronic application system.  Companies in general also emphasised the need to minimise bureaucratic requirements and pointed out the need to balance new restrictions against the possibility of making Ireland an unattractive location for certain highly mobile ICT activities.As with industry, interest on the non-governmental side was limited to a small number of NGOs.  In general, they were critical of what they perceived to be a lack of transparency in the decision-making process and outcomes in terms of detailed information on actual exports.  They also criticised gaps in the system on such issues as brokering, licensed production overseas and service exports, as well as the absence of end-use monitoring and checking.As part of the benchmarking exercise, a review of literature and information on export licensing systems in a range of countries was studied.  A more detailed examination was conducted on the licensing systems in place in the United Kingdom, Austria, Sweden and the United States.  It emerged that many of the problems that were challenging to Ireland were also a cause for concern in other countries.  These included controlling exports of intangible technology, putting into practice the EU's catch-all clause which controls non-listed items if they could be used in a weapons of mass destruction programme, enforcement of licence controls on non-compliant companies and promoting greater co-operation between licensing and customs authorities.The final report of the Forfás review was published in May 2004.  A key finding was that there was no "one size fits all" solution for implementing export controls, rather it is vital to factor in unique national circumstances such as the legal systems and size and scope of the production activities affected when designing an effective system.The report identified a number of strengths and weaknesses of the Irish system.  On the plus side, we have a relatively accessible straightforward system staffed by knowledgeable personnel and the turnaround time for licensing applications stands up well to international comparison.  Against that, however, the review recommended action to address a number of weaknesses, in particular the need for new legislation to address the needs of a modern complex export control system.While the Control of Exports Bill provides the foundation for such a system, my Department has also acted on other non-legislative recommendations of the Forfás review.  In line with the review, responsibility for the export licensing function has remained with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  However, much has been done to improve co-ordination with the other Departments and State agencies, in particular the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is consulted on all licence applications with foreign policy considerations, and the customs authorities of the Revenue Commissioners.  The interdepartmental group established to oversee production of the report has remained in existence with a brief to promote and monitor implementation of all the review's recommendations.  As this process nears completion, it is my intention to transform this group into a standing interdepartmental committee which will take forward responsibility for co-ordinating the work of the Departments and agencies in the area of export control.  A priority of the interdepartmental group is the establishment of a technical advisory panel to act as a specialist resource for my Department on technical questions related to the licensing process.Acting on the recommendation of the Forfás review, a project to develop an on-line export licensing system has been under way for the past year and I am pleased to announce that this system, on-line export licence application system, OELAS, will be released to exporters in the next few weeks.  We have worked hard to improve the flow of information to the exporting companies and in this regard my Department organised the first ever export control seminar in June 2006 in Farmleigh and launched a users guide and customers charter to export licensing.I also want to inform the House of recent developments at European level.  As the House will be aware, the export of dual-use goods from Ireland and other EU member states is governed by a Council Regulation, EC 1334/2000, adopted under the EU's Common Trade Policy in June 2000.  The Commission, working with the member states, has drafted an amended or recast version of the dual-use regulation, which was transmitted to the Council in December 2006 and which is currently under consideration by the member states.  I welcome the opportunity offered to Ireland and to our partners to revise and update our dual-use controls in response to the lessons learned from the implementation of the regulation and to enable us to respond collectively to emerging threats.  I am confident that the new dual-use regulation will help to cement the EU's position at the forefront of the worldwide efforts to promote the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.Turning back now to the Control of Exports Bill, in January 2005 the Government approved in principle the drafting of new legislation in line with the recommendations of the Forfás review.  As the House will be aware, all Government proposals for primary legislation are now subject to regulatory impact analysis, RIA, to determine whether the new regulation will have the desired effect.  RIA helps identify any possible side effects or hidden costs associated with regulation and quantify the likely costs of compliance for individuals or companies.  It also helps to clarify the costs of enforcement for the State.Prior to the general roll-out of RIA across all Departments and offices in June 2005, my Department participated in the pilot phase by offering the proposed Control of Exports Bill as a suitable test case.  A RIA was undertaken which looked at three options for regulating export control: first, maintain the status quo, that is, to continue to rely on the 1983 Act; second, introduce new legislation which would update penalties, broaden the definition of exportation to include intangible transfers and introduce audit and inspection powers; and third, introduce new legislation along the line of option two but with added controls on arms brokering and technical assistance.It was quickly concluded that option three was the only one which would ensure that Ireland's export control system was in line with best international practice and would enable us to meet our international obligations.  The absence of any evidence to suggest that Irish-based firms were engaging in brokering or technical assistance activities led us to determine that the economic impact of these new controls would be negligible.  Two key steps of a RIA are a public consultation process and an examination of enforcement and compliance issues.  We were fortunate that these had been examined in some detail as part of the Forfás review.Working on the basis of the Forfás review recommendations and the findings of the RIA, the general scheme of the Control of Exports Bill was prepared in my Department and was approved by the Government on 19 July 2007.  The text of the Bill was approved by the Government in February this year and passed all Stages in the Seanad by 1 March.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to schedule time in this House for the Bill before the general election.  However, I am pleased to lay this Bill before the House so early in the new term.  It is my sincere hope the Bill will complete all remaining Stages as quickly as possible so that we can get it onto the Statute Book at the earliest opportunity.  I look forward to working closely with Deputies to achieve this objective.I wish to explain the provisions of each section of the Bill.  Section 1 sets out the definitions of certain terms.  Where possible, we have aligned definitions with those in use in EU legislation.  Of most interest here is the definition of exportation, which has now been broadened to allow controls to be imposed on both intangible transfers of technology, for example, transmission of software over the Internet, and for goods in transit.  This latter provision will enable Ireland to comply with a recommendation of UN Security Council Resolution 1540.Section 2 sets out the general procedures for the making of regulations and orders and enables regulations and orders to be made for the purpose of giving effect to EU legislation.  The European Communities Act is habitually used by my Department for the making of statutory instruments to give effect to trade sanctions and arms embargoes that are the subject of Council regulations.  It has also been used to provide for penalties for breach of Council Regulation 1334/2000, the dual-use regulation.The disadvantage of relying on the European Communities Act is that, until recently, it only allowed for the creation of summary offences.  This concern has now been addressed with the adoption earlier this year of the European Communities Act 2007, which provides for the creation of indictable offences and which enables Ministers to make a statutory instrument under relevant domestic legislation to give effect to a European Act.  It is no longer necessary, therefore, to include a specific provision to this effect in the Control of Exports Bill and the Government will introduce an amendment on Committee Stage to delete the relevant part of this section.Section 3 enables the Minister to make orders or regulations to control brokering activities in accordance with EU Common Position 2003/468/Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, of 23 June 2003.  It provides for controls to be imposed on brokering activities undertaken in the State and outside the State if undertaken by an Irish citizen or company.  The issue of extra-territoriality was a key consideration when framing this section.  A person, normally resident here, could, for example, arrange for an arms transfer while temporarily outside the State of goods that at no point transit through Ireland.  In the absence of appropriate legislation, on his or her return to Ireland, no prosecution could follow, notwithstanding that an arms embargo might have been breached or that Irish export control laws might have been evaded.There are, of course, certain challenges with regard to the enforcement of extra-territorial controls.  However, on balance, I considered it preferable to have such controls in place so that if documentary evidence concerning illicit arms brokering does become available, for example, as a result of the sharing of intelligence between law enforcement agencies, then the State has the capacity to mount a successful prosecution.Section 4 enables the making of orders or regulations to prohibit or to control the export of specified goods and technology.  Generally such orders will take the form of a list of goods to be controlled.  However, it will also be possible to have, for example, a “catch-all” clause, similar to that contained in the dual-use regulation, where export controls can be imposed on non-listed goods and technology where there is reason to believe they may be used in a weapons of mass destruction programme.The list of goods to be controlled, and their categorisation and description, derives in the first instance from the relevant international export control regimes in which Ireland participates.  The relevant regime for conventional arms and dual-use goods, for example, is the Wassenaar Arrangement founded in 1996 and comprising 40 participating states, including almost all EU member states, together with the United States, Russia and other highly developed countries such as Canada, Australia and Japan.  Other regimes include the Nuclear Suppliers Group, the Missile Technology Control Regime and the Australia Group for chemical and biological weapons.  Ireland participates actively in all these regimes and this year is chairing the expert group of the Wassenaar Arrangement, which has specific responsibility for reviewing and amending its control lists to take account of new technologies and related developments.Section 5 provides for orders or regulations to be made to control technical assistance, such as repairs, maintenance, development, manufacture, assembly, testing, training and instruction and consultancy services in accordance with EU Joint Action 401/2000 Common Foreign and Security Policy, CFSP, of 22 June 2000.  The joint action commits member states to imposing controls on technical assistance in connection with certain military end uses.  Subject to a detailed scrutiny of the implications for exporters and my Department, I am willing to look at the possibility of broadening this control.  In this regard I will take account of proposals currently under consideration at EU level, in the context of a revision to the EU dual-use regime, to impose controls on technical assistance with regard to dual-use goods.Section 6 makes general provisions with regard to the issue or refusal of licences.  It will also enable regulations to be made governing licence application procedures.  These may include, but are not confined to, the form and manner of a licence application, provision for on-line applications, supporting documentation required, processing times, duration of a licence, revocation of a licence, record keeping requirements and provision for an appeals procedure.  The imposition of licence fees is also provided for, although I do not envisage their introduction at present.  I am committed to the introduction of published regulations on licensing procedures as a means of increasing transparency in the operation of the licensing system.Section 7 deals with the appointment of officers authorised to enforce the Act and grants them necessary powers such as the right to enter premises, including vehicles, to inspect goods and technology and to require the production of documents and records.  This section also allows for joint inspections with members of the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise officers.Section 8 creates summary and indictable offences and significantly increases the financial penalties from a maximum of £12,700 under the 1983 Act to up to €10 million and-or five years imprisonment for breaches of the Act.Section 9 introduces a provision for an annual report on the operation of the Act to be prepared and to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  This is in line with a key recommendation of the Forfás review and responds to calls for greater transparency in the area of export controls.  I welcome the opportunity which will be provided by the publication of the annual report to provide accurate information on the export of military and dual-use goods from Ireland and to counter some of the misapprehensions which result from sensationalist media coverage of this issue.Section 10 is the standard provision for expenses.  Section 11 provides for the repeal of the Control of Exports Act 1983 but confirms the validity of the Control of Exports Order 2005, SI 884 of 2005, which contains the current list of controlled military goods.  Section 12 provides for the citation of the Bill when enacted as the Control of Exports Act 2007 and for its entry into force, in all or in part, to be made by ministerial order.I have outlined the contents of the Control of Exports Bill.  I am satisfied that it will be comprehensive legislation which will equip Ireland with the tools required to manage an efficient, effective export control system.  Nevertheless, some commentators may take issue with the omission of certain topics which they consider should also have been included and I wish to address some of these concerns.A number of non-governmental organisations have called for the imposition of controls on what they refer to as "licensed production overseas".  This is the practice whereby a company based in one jurisdiction permits a second company located elsewhere to manufacture its products under licence.  The issue was considered in the context of the Forfás review and ultimately the consultants concluded that "while provision to govern licensed production abroad is legally feasible, this is not a priority concern in the circumstances of the Irish industrial base".In deciding not to specifically provide for the inclusion of controls on licensed production overseas, my Department also took into account that controls already apply to the export of goods and technology required for the development, production or use of military equipment and other equipment subject to export controls.  Such controls would apply to exports of goods and-or technology for use in connection with overseas production.  Furthermore, these controls will be enhanced with the imposition of controls under section 5 of the Bill in accordance with the EU's joint action on technical assistance.The NGO sector frequently seeks information on actual exports by named companies.  Let me be clear that I do not consider it appropriate to provide such data.  Information submitted by companies in connection with export licence applications is provided in confidence.  It is almost always commercially sensitive and security and international relations issues may arise.  I am also concerned that the disclosure of such detailed information could prejudice or impair enforcement of and compliance with applicable Irish and European legislation.  I am, however, committed to providing information in the annual report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on the aggregate value of actual exports of goods under licence, sorted by category and country of destination.  I am firmly of the opinion this will present a far more accurate picture than reliance on licensed values, which by their nature tend to be considerable over-estimations.There have also been calls for increased end-use monitoring.  Responsibility for this task is a burden shared by my Department and other State agencies, and by the exporting companies themselves.  I assure the House that my Department takes very seriously its obligation to ensure strategic goods exported from Ireland do not fall into the wrong hands.  The sharing of information on potential end-users of concern is a strong component of preventative action by the EU and the international export control regimes.  Where there is reason to doubt the bona fides of the end-users, we simply deny an export licence.  We will also deny a licence where we have reason to believe there is a risk of diversion of the goods in question to an end-use or end-user other than that stated on the licence application.  This accords with Criterion Seven of the European Union Code of Conduct on Arms Exports.  This code also binds us to take into account such criteria as the existence of internal conflicts, regional peace and security and respect for human rights when considering whether to permit the export of controlled goods.We encourage exporting companies to adopt responsible practices to ensure their products are not being used for nefarious purposes.  In line with best international practice, we promote the implementation of effective internal compliance programmes by Irish exporters and advocate enhanced pre-shipment controls and the use of risk analysis programmes.  I welcome the opportunity offered by the Bill to enshrine in regulations current administrative practices requiring the submission of regular reports from companies and the production on demand of supporting documentation, which can only enhance our effectiveness in the area of end-use monitoring.In a perfect world, there would be no need for controls and we could go about our daily business untrammelled by wars, conflicts or random acts of violence.  Sadly, we do not live in a perfect world and Ireland and other like-minded countries have found it necessary to impose some constraints on our economic activities to meet these threats to peace and security.  As I stated at the outset, the particular challenge we face is to put in place an effective export control system that reconciles our commitment to arms control and disarmament with our natural desire to advance our economic interests.  However, our policies must not only be effective, they must also be proportionate.Let us not forget we are a small neutral country, with a low level of armed forces and military spending in general, and we are not involved in purely defence-related industry.  Against this, we have very successfully established ourselves as a location for ICT, pharmaceuticals and other high-tech enterprises, and we are committed to promoting research and innovation.  We are ranked as one of the top countries in the world in which to do business and we do not wish to impose a burden of control that would diminish Ireland's attractiveness in this regard.  Neither do we wish to acquire a reputation as a country with lax controls on the export of strategic goods.Ireland has always been a voice on the international stage for disarmament and arms control.  We recognise our interests are best served by a stable, secure, inclusive and co-operative environment and we continue to work with our fellow EU member states and other countries to address the challenges to global security posed by the threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their possible use.  Last December, Ireland co-sponsored a resolution at the UN General Assembly setting out the next steps towards the goal of an international arms trade treaty.  We have long been one of the strongest supporters of such a legally binding instrument, negotiated on a non-discriminatory, transparent and multilateral basis, to establish standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional weapons.  The European Union is fully committed to this process.  Together we are working for a treaty that will contribute significantly to tackling the undesirable and irresponsible proliferation of conventional arms, which undermines peace, security, development and full respect for human rights.The Bill is our tangible commitment to having in place a robust export control system that can best meet the challenges we face at a time of rapid geopolitical and technological developments.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	180	Fine Gael welcomes the Bill but reserves the right to strengthen it through amendments on Committee Stage.  In assessing the Bill we must take account of two factors.  The first is our economic and trade interest in minimising administrative costs, reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens on legitimate exporters and ensuring Ireland does not unnecessarily reduce its attractiveness to international mobile investment, particularly in the area of high-tech knowledge age dual use goods and services.  The second factor concerns our interest in controls to minimise the danger that military or dual use goods produced in Ireland would be used in an undesirable way internationally, and our interest in meeting international, legally binding political commitments and generally protecting and enhancing Ireland's good name and reputation.The Bill has many worthy aims.  It regulates arms brokering in Ireland and by Irish citizens abroad.  It will introduce controls on the sale of technical help software and other technologies that could be used for military purposes.  It will also give Government officials the power to inspect and audit companies involved in exporting military goods or dual use technologies, including chemicals, high performance computer components and telecommunications software, all of which may have civil and military uses.  The penalties for breaching the export laws are to be increased from a fine of just over €12,000 to a two-year jail sentence.The arms industry itself is not purely evil or unpleasant and in many cases it can be a legitimate industry providing important defensive components for countries to defend their borders and their citizens.  It is important to note that many neutral countries, for example, Sweden, have extensive arms industries, and in many ways it is part of their neutrality to be capable of producing arms to defend their borders without have to rely on other countries to do so.  It is also important to recognise the connection between research and development and advanced technology in expanding economies.  It is important any Bill we introduce does not go too far in restricting industry or the development of Irish trade in this regard.  That said, as a country with an ethical foreign policy, it is important we honour our responsibilities.In researching this issue, I discovered an interesting comment from the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, who stated that Ireland does not have an arms trade.  Of course, that is untrue and is disingenuous, as we know from the reports of Amnesty International and Forfás.  Admittedly, some reports may go a little too far, with one even suggesting that the production of Ray-Ban sunglasses in Waterford is somehow part of the arms trade as they are worn by US Air Force pilots.  While I do not accept this, the Forfás and Amnesty reports have demonstrated there are extensive operations in Ireland related to the production of equipment for military use.As outlined in the Minister's statement, the Bill omits some key requirements for an effective exporting and licensing control system.  One important area not addressed is a monitoring system for end-users of these exports.  Unclear also is the degree to which the legislation will exercise control over Irish citizens simply relocating outside Europe and thereby bypassing European checks.  Fine Gael shares the view that we must recognise Ireland's existing export control for arms trading is inadequate and lacks transparency.  This has created a situation whereby there is an absence of democratic overview by the Oireachtas and members of the public, who cannot discover what has been exported from Ireland and the uses to which it has been put.In 2004 Forfás published a report entitled Export Licensing of Military and Dual Use Goods in Ireland.  It clearly stated that the estimated value of actual exports of controlled military products and components is in the region of €10 million to €20 million annually.  The report also states that areas of the system are in need of improvement and notes specifically the absence of dedicated primary national legislation governing the military licensing system, a number of recognised gaps in terms of what is controlled under the legislation, scope for a more proactive approach, especially in the provision of advance information and advice, scope for greater involvement on an advisory and consultative basis to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in the range of relevant State resources outside the Department, and strengthening of the relationship between the Department and Customs and Excise to ensure the most effective controls possible are being applied.Other areas to be considered include more proactive and wider enforcement, especially regarding possible exporters who are not applying for licences, rotation of staff between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment for the purpose of developing corporate memory and expertise, increased and more structured access in the process to appropriate specialist technical and other expertise, and increased transparency in the decision-making process.  I am not convinced that these weaknesses are addressed in the provisions of the Bill.The legislation has a series of shortcomings.  For example, it provides for only basic legal enforcement by means of ministerial orders, none of which has been published or circulated in draft form to Members.  It does not appear to provide for ongoing parliamentary scrutiny of the formulation of these orders, the categories, equipment, services, activities to be regulated or the exemptions to certain regulations.  The Minister alone will have the power to define export controls with little oversight from the Oireachtas.It is also noteworthy that the Bill covers only physical exports and the supply of technical assistance but does not introduce control over mechanisms specifically covering the supply of military services and personnel.  It introduces for the first time a statutory requirement that the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment actively report to the Oireachtas on its export controls but does not specify the details to be included in such reports.  In the past, the Department has released information on export licences which did not require sufficient protection for human rights or military security.The Minister of State will be aware that a code of conduct on arms exports has been drafted at EU level but not yet adopted as a Common Position by the Council.  In 2006, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling for the code of conduct to be made into a Common Position.  I encourage the Ministers for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Foreign Affairs to work towards this objective.We must accept that, as a small country, the value of the Irish arms trade is a drop in the ocean in terms of the global value of arms exports.  Progress is only possible at the European and international level.  I endorse the European Parliament's call for an international arms trade treaty.  It is clear that international treaties are the only effective means of addressing these types of issues.  For example, the adoption in 1997 of the Ottawa Convention on landmines has resulted in a noticeable and documented reduction in the number of people killed and injured by landmines.  The Department of Foreign Affairs would achieve better results if it were to prioritise achieving international agreement on arms control.  It should use Ireland's role and position in the European Union to advocate making the existing code of conduct in the EU a Common Position and to champion the introduction of an international arms trade treaty which would be binding not only on small, neutral, ethical countries such as Ireland but on all countries.I welcome the Bill as it is necessary to amend current legislation in this area.  The Fine Gael Party intends to table a number of significant amendments on Committee Stage aimed at strengthening the Bill by giving more power and oversight to the Oireachtas and ensuring the Minister does not have free reign.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment and look forward to engaging positively with him in the years ahead.  The Labour Party broadly welcomes the introduction of the Control of Exports Bill 2007.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins, the president of my party and its spokesperson on foreign affairs, and our colleague, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, have been long-term advocates of imposing export controls on military goods and have expressed disappointment at the Government's tardy response on this vital issue.  Deputy Michael D. Higgins will discuss in detail the ethical considerations arising from this legislation. However, export controls reflect an important aspect of the philosophy and ethical approach of the Labour Party.  Ethical and moral considerations must be brought to bear in determining how exports are evaluated, particularly in the context of their end use and destination.  It is important, therefore, that products are tracked.  This requires rigid investigation, control and monitoring, areas in which the legislation is clearly weak.While the Labour Party welcomes the broad thrust of the Bill as a step in the right direction, we reserve the right to table appropriate amendments.  We will seek specifically to amend section 3(2)(b) to clarify the term “citizenship” in light of differences in the meaning of terms such as “residency”, “domicile” and “citizenship”.  These nuances may appear whimsical to outside observers but they are vital in ensuring the legislation is effective and rigorously implemented.As the Minister of State noted, we are in the midst of rapid geopolitical and technological developments across the world.  Many of the old shibboleths have been excised.  The weapons trade is seriously undermining development across the world and there is some evidence that traffickers in this trade considered Ireland to be a base they could use with impunity.  It is, therefore, long past time that positive action was taken in this regard.  The Bill has been several years in gestation and has been introduced not before time.  My colleagues have been to the fore in applying pressure to have it introduced.The purpose of the legislation is to provide for the control of the exportation of goods and technology and the provision of brokering activities and technical assistance.  As the Minister of State outlined, this is to be achieved by means of regulations.  The Bill also provides for the control of technical assistance related to certain military end-users and arms brokering as provided for by the Council of the European Union in a Common Position set out on 23 June 2003.The competitive global economy affords us opportunities to gain access to markets across the world on an equal footing.  This has arisen as a result of the dismantling of trade barriers to permit the free movement of capital, goods and services and people to the extent that they are not subject to certain exemptions, regulations, controls and limitations, most of which are tied to national security interests, health factors and other grounds permitted under the articles of the European treaties.  However, we cannot allow untrammelled or uncontrolled free trade in every area of activity as to do so would render as nought Ireland's status as a neutral country.  We must be extremely careful and while we must promote economy activity and the generation of employment, this must not be done at the expense of moral and ethical considerations.  Unregulated trade in military goods, hardware and other such products, particularly in light of the implications of the advent of e-technology, would create a moral dilemma regarding products with both civil and military applications.For many years, the Labour Party has held to its fundamental commitment to the control of arms and global disarmament, which is essential in the context of world peace and stability and reflects our strong neutral ethos.  Neutrality must mean something and not just be a word thrown out to suit particular times.Until the advent of the Bill, Ireland's arms control systems lagged behind those of major arms exporters.  The Government, which promised legislation, was warned by my colleagues Deputy Higgins and Proinsias De Rossa, MEP about the incentive for arms brokers elsewhere to move here in the absence of legislation.  The Government may not believe such moves occurred.  Judging by the Seanad debate, to which Deputy Varadkar referred, there is no arms trade in Ireland.  The factual position is different.  The Government-commissioned 2004 Forfás report on arms control systems identified several gaps in our laws, in particular those addressing arms brokers.  Successive Amnesty International reports have reached the same conclusions.The need for a new legislative framework for the monitoring and control of military and dual-use exports was apparent.  There must be clear guidelines on the identification of all materials and components and Irish manufacturing equipment must not fall into the hands of undemocratic or oppressive regimes to be used against their people.Worldwide spending on arms is estimated to have surpassed €850 billion in 2006, approximately 15 times the amount spent on overseas aid.  This figure, spent at a time when the arms industry was increasingly able to avoid export controls, is greater than the amount spent at the height of the Cold War.  Each year, 500,000 men, women and children die through the use of small arms and light weapons.In October 2006, the United Nations passed a resolution to commence work on establishing an international arms trade treaty.  While Ireland has played an honourable, historical and pivotal role in the world, which has been recognised at UN level, all EU member states are obliged to work flat-out to implement the resolution and to establish an effective, legally binding international arms trade treaty that lays down minimum global standards for arms transfers.  I welcome that the Government is in the process of doing so, as it means progress has been made since this Bill was debated in and passed by the Seanad in February and March, respectively.  On behalf of my party, I want to ensure that every effort is being made to establish a legally binding arms trade treaty.  In his summation, will the Minister of State elucidate on the progress made so far and how we can promote an important and central tenet of our policy?Deputy Higgins has been to the forefront in pointing out how Ireland has been involved in the international arms trade despite the Government's frequent denials.  The assertion made during the Seanad debate that Ireland is not an arms provider in the normal international sense does not square with the fact that Irish-based companies exported military equipment with a value of €30 million in 2005.  The figure did not fall in 2006, although my colleague may have up-to-date figures.What efforts has Ireland, an important member of the EU, made to object to or restrain the Union, one of the world's largest sources of armaments?  We must use the influence we have gained during the past 80 or 90 years to try to restrain the EU's armaments and munitions industry.Under this legislation, the strongest expert checks must be in place if we are to ensure that military and dual-use goods reach their declared end users instead of brutal and oppressive regimes.  This is a significant challenge, but monitoring is of importance to the Labour Party, which will seek stronger legislation.  The Minister of State might reply in that respect.  The current legislation is outdated.  Since its origins in 1983, there has been a considerable increase in terrorism and atrocities perpetrated on innocent civilians.  Recent examples include the Balkan conflict, atrocities committed against millions in Darfur and events in Burma.  We must be cognisant of all relevant world activities.I must be honest in that I read the summary of the Forfás report, but it made a number of recommendations of a non-legislative nature, including the establishment of a technical advisory panel in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in respect of the licensing process.  The aptly titled OELAS has been established and will soon be up and running.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Department's adoption of the report's recommendations and the establishment of a standing committee.The Minister of State addressed section 8 on penalties, which provides for an increase from €12,700 under the 1983 Act to €10 million and five years imprisonment for breaches of the Act.  At one point, the European Communities Act only permitted summary matters to be addressed, but this Bill will expand the provisions to indictable offences.  I welcome the imposition of these penalties because one can introduce all of the legislation in the world.  While my party is in favour of this element of the Bill and supports the overall legislation, we will reserve the right to table amendments if we deem it so desirable to ensure the strengthening of the legislation and that its avowed objective is comprehensively achieved.In a time of great uncertainty amid terrorist threats and numerous conflict areas, those involved in the arms industry are becoming rich.  It is an obscenity.  We cannot turn our backs or behave like ostriches by failing to recognise that the rapid face of capitalism is at work in conflict areas.  Somebody is accumulating significant riches as a result of atrocities and human suffering.I wonder whether we or the Government live in the real world, as Ministers' replies to the effect that Ireland does not have an arms trade offends reality.  Like my colleague, Deputy Higgins, Jim Loughran of Amnesty International wrote an excellent article on this issue in January 2005 in which he exposed the myth perpetrated by many, including Ministers.  We should acknowledge our indebtedness to Amnesty International for doing invaluable work.  In Mr. Loughran's article, he stated the arms trade is out of control and that each week sees the production of yet another report documenting how the international arms trade fuels conflict, undermines development and creates poverty.  He stated:Arms kill more than half a million men, women and children on average each year.  Many thousands more are maimed, or tortured, or forced to flee their homes.He indicated that world leaders should act now and supplied extracts from a number of Amnesty International reports on European arms exports in 2004.The EU code of conduct failed to prevent Austria from transferring rifle production to Malaysia and the production of French helicopters under licence in India which were subsequently transferred to Nepal.  EU arms embargoes failed to prevent the incorporation of German engines in military vehicles available in Burma, China and Croatia.  Amnesty Ireland produced a report, Undermining Global Security, which pointed out many loopholes in the export controls in place across Europe which are intended to ensure that exports and dual-use goods do not contribute to the abuse of human rights.  The report stated that Ireland was part of the problem.  Deputy Michael Higgins wrote about the problem at the time of the report's publication.  We must accept that we have these problems.The Labour Party has a number of concerns on certain aspects of the Bill.  Where in the Bill is there an effective export licensing and control system and comprehensive system to monitor end users of arms exports?  How will we exercise control over Irish citizens who circumvent checks put in place within the EU by relocating themselves outside the Union?  We appreciate that these are technical questions and the Minister of State's comments in that context, but we feel they should be addressed.  Effective legislation on controls and monitoring depends on the adoption of similar legislation throughout the EU.  The House must ask if all other member states intend to bring similar laws onto their statute books.  Given our tardiness in responding, other member states should be putting legislation in place by now.  The Bill's effectiveness depends on this all-Europe approach and it will be interesting to see what happens given the significant involvement of some member states in the manufacture and trade of arms.I am also concerned about technological components which, while they appear relatively harmless and may be exported for normal use, are capable of being transformed into something sinister when integrated as components of armaments or other devices.  Such technology can have devastating and horrific if unintended consequences.  We must ask how we can prevent these scenarios from emerging.  The Labour Party holds that Ireland should clearly oppose any involvement in the production or sale of any product the main function of which is military.  It would be a positive moral standpoint to adopt and underpin our independence when we engage in our positive role as mediators to achieve the peaceful resolution of disputes across the globe.  We should send a clear message from the House in this regard.An appeal was made to the Minister of State's predecessor in the Seanad to broaden the remit of the Bill and to avoid focusing on narrow issues of arms brokering.  We should also focus on the control of activity relating to the production and sale of military equipment.  I would appreciate it if the Minister of State would address that appeal in his reply on this Stage or on Committee Stage.  Section 3(2)(b) of the Bill refers to activities carried on outside the State by individuals who are Irish citizens or companies registered in the State.  What provision is made to cover circumstances in which a person engages in brokering activities outside the State where the person is resident in but not a citizen of Ireland?  It appears there is a lacuna in the Bill in this context and it is important to ensure it is addressed on Committee Stage.As I said at the outset, the Labour Party believes that a strong monitoring system must be implemented to oversee the end use of products.  I am interested to know how the European Union code of conduct on arms exports gels with the contents of the Bill.  There may be aspects of the code we should ensure are enshrined in our legislation.  These could be introduced in Government or other amendments on Committee Stage.  On the corollary point, if the European code is inadequate, we should raise the matter at EU level.  Our goal must be to tighten control of end-use and dual-purpose products.It is timely to bring forward this legislation, which the Labour Party will support.  While admittedly there are some technical issues which arise, we welcome the Bill.  We anticipate a constructive Committee Stage debate on which we hope some of the points that have been made by my colleague and I will be incorporated in the Bill.  Our focus is on strengthening the legislation to achieve what is a worthwhile objective.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, on his recent appointment.  He is a constituency colleague of mine in Carlow-Kilkenny and I wish him well.  I welcome the bringing forward to the House of a Bill the Green Party believes is long overdue, especially in the unsettling geopolitical world in which we currently find ourselves.  I think especially of Burma.There are many useful elements of the Bill.  The Green Party welcomes especially the proposed production for the first time of an annual report.  We are especially pleased to note that the annual report will be laid before the Dáil and that there will be ample opportunity to debate and scrutinise the arms industry in Ireland.  The Green Party welcomes also the proposal to submit the annual report for discussion by the joint committee covering enterprise matters.  The provision will introduce a new level of political and public scrutiny of an industry which has long avoided investigation.  The joint committee will be empowered to receive experts on the industry and their input will shed further light on the workings and ramifications of the industry as a whole.  While the departmental report and committee scrutiny will result in greater transparency and accountability, the Green Party will continue to insist on annual debates and further increases in parliamentary scrutiny of this industry.  I welcome the openness and transparency in the conducting of the legislation through the Oireachtas.There is further scope within the ministerial orders provided for in the Bill to regulate and control the exportation and brokering of specific goods.  Hopefully, such orders will address many of the fears voiced by civil society on the illegitimate end use of certain goods and the trade in the tools of torture.  It is especially important for the Green Party to ensure that nothing in the Bill compromises or negatively affects human rights.  The Bill contains scope for the Oireachtas and Government to tighten the leash on the export of dual-use goods which can be used to repress human rights in places like Burma, of which we have been reading every day for the past couple of weeks.As someone who has spent time on the Thai border, I have looked across the blue mountains in the Burmese countryside and thought of the freedom fighter Aung San Suu Kyi.  This month sees the passing of the 11th year of her house arrest.  As a recently-elected woman Deputy in a free, open, functioning democracy, I send my support to the Burmese people and their opposition leader.  I hope desperately that the Bill ensures nothing is exported from Ireland that has an end use which is prejudicial in places of strife like Burma.  I speak from the heart as a woman democrat.I anticipate further progress on Committee Stage when I am sure we will have time for the further teasing out of the implications of the Bill by all of us who are concerned about the international arms trade and exports from Ireland of dual-use products.  We will have time for greater scrutiny still in the joint committee.  As my party's spokesman on enterprise and employment, I hope to have an input at the joint committee.  The Green Party wishes to ensure that human rights are not compromised by the Bill.  The Minister of State will do everything in his power to ensure we have comprehensive legislation.  I look forward to tracking the Bill as it progresses through the Oireachtas.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I wish the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, well in his new portfolio.  This is my first opportunity to congratulate him on taking up the mantle.On 10 August 2006, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, stated that Ireland does not have an arms trade nor does it want to promote one.  In reply, Amnesty International said the Minister of State's claim was deeply unfortunate and that Ireland remains the only EU country with no controls on arms brokering.  His statement unfortunately echoes the head-in-the-sand approach to governance that we have seen over the past ten years, although the Bill is hopefully an indication that the Minister of State and the Government have moved a step closer to joined-up thinking.  Only by acknowledging that Ireland has an arms trade can such a trade be controlled.I am concerned about the question of how much the Minister of State's misconstruction of the true state of affairs has influenced certain inadequacies in the Bill, which makes no provision for issues such as a monitoring system for end-users of potential exports.  The degree to which the legislation will exercise control over Irish citizens relocating out of Europe, thereby bypassing European checks, is unclear.  There is also no provision to inform the public on what is being exported from Ireland or about the end-uses of such exports.  The need for this Bill also arises from the fact that the EU does not yet have a common peace and defence policy.  National governments decide on these issues, with a variety of approaches being taken throughout the EU as a result.  Ireland must take a full and active role in the development of any common defence policy.The Control of Exports Bill presented to Seanad Éireann on 22 February 2007 represented a necessary update on the previous legislation, the Control of Exports Act 1983.  In contrast to the dual-use area, where under the European Communities (Control of Exports of Dual-Use Items) Regulations 2000, licensing officials have extensive inspection powers, there is no statutory right under this Act for licensing officials to carry out an audit of companies that export military items.  New legislation was recommended in the report of a 2004 interdepartmental review chaired by Forfás on export licensing of military and dual-use goods in Ireland.  The review of Ireland's export controls system for military and dual-use goods was undertaken with a view to recommending how best we can modernise and strengthen the controls and ensure full compliance with Ireland's international obligations.Amnesty International's Irish section welcomed the Bill but outlined a number of issues in its August 2007 report, Controlling a Deadly Trade.  The Amnesty report made several recommendations on effective legislation to control the trade in military, security and police goods in Ireland.  While broadly welcoming the Bill, Amnesty was critical of its failure to provide several definitions which are to be made by ministerial order and was concerned that the as yet unpublished definitions would not be adequate to control some of the military and security goods and services in which Irish companies are involved.  It also pointed out that details provided by ministerial orders will not be subject to the same level of scrutiny as those provided for in the Bill.The arms industry is a massive global business which manufactures and sells weapons and military technology and equipment.  It is estimated that over $1 trillion is spent on military expenditures and arms worldwide each year.  The control of arms campaign founded by Amnesty International, Oxfam and the International Action Network on Small Arms estimates that over 6,000 million small arms are in circulation and that more than 1,135 companies based in at least 98 different countries manufacture small arms.  An estimated 500,000 individuals die in small arms conflicts each year, or approximately one death per minute.This is the nub of the matter for Ireland.  Thankfully, we do not feature on the list of the world's largest arms exporters nor could we be considered as manufacturers of large amounts of arms.  However, there are companies in operation in this country whose products come under the provisions of this Bill.  The economic impact of the proposed legislation on the approximately six Irish companies which export military items is expected to be negligible.  These companies are already obliged to comply with existing exporting rules so there should be no increased administrative or financial burden.In light of our professed neutrality and to copperfasten our licensing activities and export policy, I strongly support the establishment of a dedicated committee to bring together all relevant Departments to monitor such policies, modelled on a similar committee which has already been successfully established in the UK.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this topic.  The first point I want to make concerns the structure of the debate but before I proceed, I congratulate the Minister of State and wish him every success in his appointment.It has always intrigued me that international arms are discussed within the ambit of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  The issues that arise fundamentally concern human rights, but as I listened to the Minister of State's speech, the question arose for me of whether he is applying the human rights test or the impediments to exports test.  Depending on the test used, one arrives at different positions.In terms of the human rights test, significant progress has been made on international conflicts in a number of areas.  The most successful international instrument is without doubt the Ottawa Convention, which is important with regard to the prohibition on landmines because it mentions their production, sale and distribution.  Effectively, it contains a knowledge of distribution clause which makes it very different from other conventions in that it is more implementable.  If, for example, an aircraft carrying landmines passed through any Irish airport, a particular kind of offence is committed.  It is one of the strongest conventions and has been proven successful.Applying the test in the limited time available to me, why do I say the convention stands apart in terms of its strength?  It is because the others are weaker.  I will immediately make a statement regarding the European Union.  There is a deficit regarding information pertaining to the common foreign and security policy but no information is less shared than that relating to arms exports.  As a previous speaker said, this is a major, highly competitive industry and I do not have time to go into minute detail but I will explain the context of what I refer to as the double deficit in accountability.Many matters in the European Union are handled intergovernmentally and a huge deficit therefore arises between member governments and their parliamentary assemblies.  Regarding common foreign and security policy, there is the additional deficit created by the fact that many decisions are delegated.  For example, permanent representatives in Brussels take decisions on some matters and further sub-groups take decisions relating to some security matters.  Not all members of the sub-group are given information relating to arms sales and distribution.The behaviour of the European Union regarding the disciplines and the common good is scandalous.  The issue of Burma was raised by previous speakers and people should ask how German components find their way into military equipment used by the junta there.  One of the great scandals of our time, and a tragedy of which I am all too aware due to briefings I receive, is what is happening regarding Africa.  One fifth of global debt is arms related and the greatest shows and sales conferences are aimed at the poorest countries.  The previous speaker correctly referred to the €1 trillion spent on arms that, as I said, constitutes one fifth of world debt.  The 200 wars that have taken place since the end of the Second World War are increasingly ethnic conflicts within states that are inundated with arms, many of which are sourced in the European Union.  The European Union does not share information relating to arms exports nor do Germany, France and Britain.  In the text of the speech a balance is attempted that does not begin with tests of human rights or international law but instead seeks to test what can be done that will least impede an export activity.  The export of arms is an immoral activity and one from which we should dissociate ourselves.I welcome this Bill but it is important that we scrutinise ministerial orders.  There are suggestions one must be satisfied with the judgment reached on the bona fides of an applicant for a licence, but I reject this.  If one goes down that road one will find oneself unable to inspect planes at Shannon Airport because it would be deemed insulting to a friendly nation.  Governments must be entitled to seek, publish and share information, and I do not believe a sensitive export criterion should take precedence over a human rights criterion or a criterion relating to international law.  These are the tests of the legislation that we will apply in scrutiny of the ministerial instruments.There are colourful passages in the Minister's speech on the fall of the Iron Curtain and the democratisation of central and eastern Europe.  These may be accurate and I welcome the democratisation of all parts of Europe, but the area of arms production, distribution and sales is the least accountable area of the European Union through the mechanisms of the European Parliament, the common foreign and security policy and from member states back to their parliaments.We must hold firm on the principle of knowing the end-use of arms and components because it is only through knowing the end-use that one can answer questions relating to the circumstances and conditions under which the product was sold.  If one decides it is not necessary to inquire as to the end-use of products sold one leaves oneself open.  People will find it strange that I say this but there may be technologies that developed for military use but can be adapted to peaceful civilian use.  It is important that we allow for such possibilities but they are not relevant here as we are discussing whether we should take shelter in an inadequate European Union system or be satisfied in, by and large, asking the right questions without monitoring the end result, which leaves us open to criticism.The explanatory memorandum relating to sections 3 and 5 of this Bill refers to the European Union common position 2003/468/cfsp, common foreign and security policy, of 23 June 2003.  The House knows that this is an example of the absence of accountability through the intergovernmental conference process.  Regarding the joint action referred to in section 5, 401/2000 of 22 June 2000, parliaments in Europe cannot point to where such matters are discussed.  For example, the common foreign and security policy is completely veiled regarding accountability.  To my knowledge, no action of the Commission is discoverable or transparent, according to the interpretation and implementation mentioned in sections 3 and 5.  This means that, in practice, some of the  largest, formerly imperial, exporters of arms, Britain, France, Germany and Italy, never share information relating to arms exports with any Irish representative, departmental official, parliamentary official or European official.  This stands as a contradiction to the position taken by Ireland.I reject phrases that creep into speeches referring to Ireland as a small country and suggesting we remember how small we are.  If Ireland took the position it took on the non-proliferation treaty at the United Nations in the great days of Irish foreign affairs or the position it took on the Ottawa Convention it would become clear that small countries have the greatest interest in peace because they do not make their cases through the threat of force and the disgraceful arms industry.  We should eschew such languages in speeches.Regarding the reputation of Ireland, references were made in the speech to the threatening environment in which we live.  We will be called upon to take a position soon on the nuclear agreement between the United States, US and India.  This is a decision that will be taken by the Nuclear Suppliers Group, of which Ireland is a member, and a single negative vote will veto the agreement.  The Nuclear Suppliers Group will be asked to make an exception to permit the development of 14 nuclear reactors that will not be open to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  The Government has escaped scrutiny so far by going from one meeting to another without having to declare its position on this matter.  The choice facing the Government is to stand with the non-proliferation agreement or with new mechanisms that will undermine that famous agreement with which Ireland is associated.  There are good aspects to this Bill and I generally welcome it, but we must work further on it on Committee Stage.Most of the NGOs and critics who have written on this area have mentioned that it is not direct breaches with which we are dealing but issues of brokerage, which raise the matters of incorporation, residency and citizenship.  The Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Foreign Affairs and Enterprise, Trade and Employment should co-operate to make sure that all capacity is removed from any such individuals in order to make it impossible for an individual to live here, own shares and indirectly be contributing to the scandalous and disgraceful activities which we, in the mainstream, want to prevent.  I will now hand over to Deputy Ó Snodaigh.

Thankfully, through the peace process, we have relative peace in Ireland, yet it has taken a long time for the introduction of this legislation, which hopefully will bring peace to other countries which have suffered the effects of weapons, produced under licence here, that have been used to torture individuals.  I will not take lectures or snide comments from Government Deputies or Ministers, when one reads about an Irish registered company brokering deals during the civil war in Liberia or notes that Irish companies make parts for Apache attack helicopters used to attack populations in the Gaza Strip and the like.The introduction of this legislation is to be welcomed.  I commend Amnesty International and AFrI, in particular, two groups I know were to the fore in highlighting the contradictions that existed in Government's approach where, on the one hand, it was said there was no arms trade here and, on the other, the Government was saying it attached priority to human rights in terms of Ireland's foreign policy.  At least that is behind us and there is a considerable job of work facing us.The legislation needs to be tightened up and to have teeth for it to be effective.  It is not good enough for most of the teeth in the Bill to be provided for by way of  ministerial order or statutory instruments.  As the Bill goes through the House, whether on Committee or Report Stage, we need further explanation of the extent of such orders or, if possible, their detail in the full text of the Bill to ensure the system of licensing and control of exports of equipment is as transparent as possible.  Such equipment has dual use purposes and has been shown in the past to be used in human rights abuses abroad.  Also, such equipment has been used for military security and policy, the MPS equipment.  There is also the direct military equipment, the production of which has created jobs in Ireland which is welcome.  However, with the production of such equipment there is a responsibility not only on the Government which licenses it but on the companies that produce it to ensure that its end use is right and proper.The real potential of this Bill remains to be seen because much of its impact will be determined by the quality and content of the regulations that follow, and that is dependent on the Minister responsible.  I urge the Minister, if he is intends to stick to the passing of ministerial orders or statutory instruments to give full effect to this legislation, to pay heed to a document produced in the previous Dáil by the Department of the Taoiseach, namely, Regulating Better, a Government White Paper setting out six principles on better regulations.  One of its actions on statutory instruments states that the Government will "give consideration to the more effective scrutiny of Statutory Instruments by the Houses of the Oireachtas".  We do not have that mechanism in place other than in the form of the Sub-Committee on European Scrutiny.  We have a  duty to better scrutinise the statutory instruments and the ministerial orders, which are the teeth of much legislation that is passed in this House.  I hope the Minister takes cognisance of that and puts in place some mechanism whereby the House can scrutinise whatever orders or instruments will be passed in future.The legislation is welcome and hopefully the points raised by Amnesty International and others who studied this legislation will be taken on board.  In that way, we would end up with legislation that will be an example to other countries that have grappled with such legislation and had difficulties because of the nature of dual use goods, but who have taken on board that it is the end use rather than the dual use that is the key consideration.The Stockholm institute has produced a best practice guide for such equipment.  I hope some of its guidelines will be better reflected in the legislation when we come to deal with it on Report Stage.Tá súil agam go dtarlóidh an athrú sin agus go mbeimid in ann teacht ar ais anseo ag deireadh an próiséas seo le Bille gur féidir linn bheith sásta leis agus bródúil as.  Ba cheart don reachtaíocht seo a bheith mar sampla don chuid eile don domhain.  Impím ar an Aire an méid sin a thogaint ar bórd agus déanamh cinnte go mbeidh leasuithe dá réir déanta ar Chéim an Choiste agus ar an dTuarascáil.

However, I was surprised by elements of the last contribution.  Only Dáil Éireann has the right to declare war, therefore, there was no war over the past 30 years.  It is all very well to moralise about other people exporting arms, but are we certain that the IRA did not export expertise in bomb-making and other guerrilla warfare-terrorist tactics and techniques?  Many questions are unanswered about places such as Colombia where three members of, let us call it, the republican movement — although I do not believe there was very much republican about these activities — were found in Colombia in FARC-held territory where the human rights abuses are absolutely appalling.  During the summer, 11 locally elected politicians were taken out and shot by FARC and other politicians have been held hostage for a period, as in the case of Ingrid Betancourt.  I wish spokespersons for Sinn Féin would not moralise from a height without adopting a self-critical attitude to some of the activities they have defended and stood over in the past.I welcome the Minister's comprehensive speech on the Bill which sets the legislation in context.  It is a matter about which public opinion is concerned.  As a country with a strong neutral tradition, we do not wish to be in the arms export business beyond what is required for police-style activities, whether carried out by our army or police.  Nor do we want firms, be they of multinational or domestic origin, to be involved in the manufacture of weapons or in any aspect of the arms trade.  At the same time we must be realistic.  Many components have a multiplicity of uses and I accept and support the Minister's statement that a degree of pragmatism must be employed in this regard.  Obviously, we would not support or finance any activity dedicated to arms production.We have some control over what happens in our jurisdiction.  However, we have relatively little influence in this sphere over what happens in Europe.  There is a massive contradiction between the arms sales needed by important arms industries in several member states and the foreign policy objectives of the European Union.  There is little doubt, judging from the past, that arms produced in Europe are used in conflicts where there are high casualties and by thoroughly unpleasant regimes.  I do not detect any serious intent by some of our partners with important arms industries to do much about the issue.  Economic interest trumps all others.A few years ago, a British Foreign Secretary came into office announcing an ethical foreign policy, but that did not last long and became more of a joke than reality.  It is a pity that even states that come across in the European context as genuinely peace loving nonetheless get into situations where they export arms to countries and situations where, speaking from an ethical viewpoint, we should not be involved.The prospect of persuading other countries to our point of view on this is minimal.  Any change depends on public opinion in the countries concerned.  Often public opinion is relatively passive and does not take much interest, despite the best efforts of NGOs like Amnesty International and others.  All we can do is try to keep our own house in order as well as we can, inevitably employing a degree of pragmatism which will dismay the purists.  However, beyond a certain point it is neither sensible nor possible for us to go.

I look forward to the challenge and to working with spokespersons and will do what I can to make our engagement more informative and to meet and discuss any issues of concern.Some issues raised will be dealt with in the form of amendments on Committee Stage and I am willing to consider amendments in order to achieve what we can through the Bill.  Irish citizens will be subject to controls, even if located abroad and this is covered in section 3(2)(b) of the Bill.  Ministerial orders will be put in place to provide for consultation and will come before the Houses for debate.On transparency, the first annual report will be placed in the Oireachtas Library for comment by Oireachtas Members.  That debate will inform further annual reports in terms of direction and content, which will improve transparency.  The report will be debated in the Dáil or Seanad and the regulations in the report can be debated by Oireachtas committees at any stage.  Members with an interest in the area may bring appropriate professionals to committees for an exchange of view.  Issues can be raised, therefore, in various ways and thereby improve transparency.Ireland abides fully by the EU code of conduct on arms exports.  One Deputy raised the issue of end-use monitoring, to which I referred in my opening remarks on this debate.  As stated, we will bring in regulations and controls on the industry in terms of its responsibility in this regard.  Section 7 refers to audit and inspection and broadens the scope of control to include military goods.I assure Deputy White, my constituency colleague, that we do not contemplate the export by licence to Burma of goods which could be used for internal repression or violation of human rights.  I agree with what she said about Burma.  She also raised the issues of transparency and the annual report.  We must always be open, in the context of this debate, to changes in the legislation, to changes in the annual report and to keeping in line with best practice, as is the intention of the Department.The European approach was mentioned.  All European member states are committed to abiding by the EU code of conduct on arms exports and to controlling military goods on a common EU list.  Ireland abides fully by the code of conduct in a way that is completely compatible with all EU regulations.Deputy Penrose raised the issue of brokering and Irish companies abroad, which I addressed earlier in the context of Irish citizens.  I understand the point he was making and we can explore it in greater depth on Committee Stage.  The issue of Irish companies abroad was raised in the Seanad and the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, gave a commitment to examine it at the time.  My Department is currently examining the issue, as is the Attorney General.  It is a complex issue but we will use the opportunity Committee Stage will offer to go into more detail on it.Support for the arms trade treaty is a central plank of Ireland's foreign policy, and is driven forward by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  The backdrop to the Bill is regulation in the European Union so we will have to reflect on the issues in that context.  Mention was made of military exports and in 2006 military exports amounted to €14.7 million.I am grateful to Members who contributed to the debate.  It is my first Bill before the House and I am pleased it went so well.  I hope Committee Stage, which is just as important, will go equally well.

At the outset, I want to put on record, and pay tribute to, the significant contribution made to the process of statute law reform in this country by my predecessor in office, Michael McDowell.  This Bill is but one of many initiatives he took during his period as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to update and modernise our laws in order to bring them more into line with modern conditions and meet the needs of the 21st century.I am pleased to say the Bill received broad support from all sides on its way through Seanad Éireann and I look forward to a continuation of that broad support in this House.  Also, the very detailed explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill has been updated to take account of the various amendments agreed in the Seanad.This Bill is major reforming legislation and it is the outcome of an innovative joint law reform project, launched in 2003, between my Department and the Law Reform Commission.  Indeed, I had the pleasure in November 2004 of addressing a conference in the O'Reilly Hall at UCD on modernising Irish land and conveyancing law.  The conference had been organised as part of the extensive consultation process which followed completion of the first phase of the joint project.The Bill is undoubtedly a technical and complex piece of draft legislation but the comprehensive reforms contained in it will bring many benefits for private individuals and businesses alike in the years ahead.  It is important to appreciate that, in all modern economies, an efficient system of title registration and transfer is essential for economic growth and is one of the key factors identified as essential in the development of prosperous economies in the modern world.Much of our current land and conveyancing law dates from the 19th century, while certain parts of it have their roots in far distant feudal times.  This Bill is poised to bring it into the 21st century.  I want briefly to explain the context of the preparation and publication of this Bill.  The main purpose of the Bill is to engage in a comprehensive reform and modernisation of all our land and conveyancing laws.  It does so by repealing, in whole or in part, the numerous pre-1922 statutes which make up our land and conveyancing code and replacing them, where necessary, with updated provisions more suited to modern conditions.This Bill is part of a larger reform programme which includes the reforms already enacted in the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006.  That Act established the Property Registration Authority with a mandate to promote and extend registration of title to land and it has also updated land registration procedures and processes.  The ultimate goal of the reforms contained in last year's Act and this Bill is to pave the way for the introduction of a comprehensive system of electronic conveyancing of land, i.e. eConveyancing.  Given the scale and ambition of this Bill, a strategic and research-intensive approach has been adopted by my Department and the Law Reform Commission from the outset of the project.  The first phase involved the screening of the numerous pre-1922 statutes with a view to identifying those which could be repealed without replacement and, secondly, those which needed to be updated or replaced with provisions more suited to modern conditions.  The results of this exercise were published in the Law Reform Commission's consultation paper, Reform and Modernisation of Land Law and Conveyancing Law, in 2004.Publication of the consultation paper was followed by an extensive consultative process, including the conference to which I referred earlier at which distinguished experts in land and conveyancing law from this country and abroad discussed future reform options in light of experiences gained from reform initiatives in comparable common law jurisdictions.  Valuable submissions were also received from representative bodies involved in the conveyancing system and from other relevant stakeholders.The third phase of the project involved preparation of draft legislation to give effect to the Commission's definitive reform proposals following completion of the consultation process.  The report entitled Reform and Modernisation of Land Law and Conveyancing Law, published in July 2005, contained the text of a draft land and conveyancing Bill.  With the agreement of the then Attorney General, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, subsequently wrote to the President of the Law Reform Commission suggesting that, given the unique collaboration and expertise involved in the project, finalisation of the text of a Bill for publication could best be achieved through the good offices of the commission and the continued involvement of those already closely associated with the project.  The commission readily agreed and the Bill before us has been prepared by a drafting group which has continued to meet under the aegis of the Law Reform Commission.Before proceeding, I want to place on the record of the House my sincere thanks, and that of Government, to the President of the Law Reform Commission, Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness, her predecessor in office, Mr. Justice Declan Budd, and the other commissioners for their enthusiastic commitment to, and support for, the joint project.  I want also to thank Professor John Wylie, the foremost expert in land and conveyancing laws of these islands, for his input and sustained interest in the project and Mr. Marcus Bourke, former Parliamentary Counsel, who assisted in the drafting process.  Finally, I acknowledge the input of the Law Reform Commission's substantive law working group which brings together many of the stakeholders and experts in the land and conveyancing law area.I want to say a little now about the general subject matter of the Bill and to explain its scope and structure.  Land is a finite and scarce resource and, prior to the development of a money-based economy, it was by far the most important source of wealth.  Not only that, land ownership was a key determinant of social standing and political influence and power.  It is not surprising, therefore, that those fortunate enough to own land often sought to ensure that it remained within the family from one generation to the next.  Nevertheless, a new class of wealth emerged with the onset of the Industrial Revolution and barriers to the operation of a free market in land, which had already been weakened by the common law courts from the late feudal period onwards, were gradually dismantled.  By the end of the 19th century, land was no longer regarded as a pre-eminent source of wealth and prestige.The development of land law and conveyancing practices over the centuries reflects the tensions arising from this gradual transition from feudalism to a market-oriented economy based on industry and trade and the related processes of social change.  In Ireland's case, there has been an added dimension.  Much of our land law can only be understood in the context of our historical experience of confiscations and repossessions.  Arrival of the Normans in the 12th century led to gradual introduction of the feudal system of land ownership and, at the beginning of the 17th century, to displacement of the old Brehon laws.From the 16th century onwards, confiscation of land from the native owners was accompanied by successive plantations of English and Scottish settlers.  The second half of the 19th century witnessed improvements in the rights of tenants and restoration of much of the country's agricultural land to tenant farmers under various land purchase schemes.  While the Bill does not deal with the various land purchase Acts, a positive feature of that legislation is worth noting.  Land purchase schemes provided loans for tenant farmers to purchase their holdings from landlords subject to annual repayments in the form of land purchase annuities.  As these schemes involved the advancing of large amounts of public funds, it was considered that title to the lands in question, which formed security for the loans and which might have to be sold in the event of default, should be secured by means of registration of the title.  That was the context in which the imperial parliament enacted the Local Registration of Title (Ireland) Act 1891, establishing the Land Registry and making the registration of title compulsory in all cases where land was purchased under the land purchase schemes.  All of this land has remained within the registration of title system.  The ongoing significance of the 1891 Act is that approximately 85% of land in the State, including almost all farmland, is now registered in the Land Registry.  This is a sound foundation on which to complete the process of registering titles.  I will return to registration issues later.As the Title indicates, the Bill deals with land and conveyancing law.  However, it is difficult in practice to draw a clear and rigid distinction between them.  In general terms, land law deals with different types of ownership of land and the rights relating to each type of land while conveyancing law is more concerned with the transfer and disposal of land and rights relating to it whether by way of sale, lease, mortgage or other dealing.  They are essentially two sides of the same coin and it makes good sense to deal with them in a single Bill rather than in separate sets of proposals.Our current system of land and conveyancing law is a complex mixture of statutory provisions drawn from the historical influences of common law and equity.  Successive layers of Statute law, the earliest of which dates back to the 13th century, include common law, namely, judicial rules developed over centuries in what were known before 1877 as common law courts, and equitable rights and remedies developed by what were known before 1877 as courts of chancery in response to shortcomings in the common law, have resulted in an unnecessarily complex code, much of which is difficult to apply to modern conditions.  There is a pressing need to update and streamline this law in order to meet the needs of a vibrant market economy in the 21st century.I want to stress that the Bill does not set out to codify into statutory form all our land and conveyancing laws.  This would have involved attempting to distil and convert all relevant principles, judicial or legislative, into a common legislative code.  Apart from the effort involved — such a project would have taken a considerable number of years — such a codification would inevitably increase the rigidity of the law and remove the flexibility and adaptability which is such a positive feature of our system.  The ability of our courts to exercise their equitable jurisdiction in response to changing needs and circumstances is a valuable aspect of our system and needs to be preserved.  Moreover, while every effort must be made to simplify the law and update its language, many words and terms of the law in this area have acquired a specific technical meaning and are used accordingly.Consequently, the drafters of this Bill have had to bear in mind that changes in language could easily lead to confusion or, more seriously, have an unforeseen and unintended impact on substantive rights in land.  It could also result in the abandonment of relevant case law and have other unintended consequences.  Whereas we are making a fresh statutory departure, some old friends known to those of us who had to study them in law school will remain with us.  This is essential for the accurate drafting of a measure of this type.As the Law Reform Commission emphasised in its report, Statutory Drafting and Interpretation: Plain Language and the Law, while the use of plain language is desirable, this end should not be achieved at the expense of legal certainty, especially where certain words and grammatical constructions, though not in common use, have acquired a fixed and clear legal meaning.  The Bill has five clear objectives: to update the law to accommodate modern conditions, to simplify the law to make it more easily understood and accessible to citizens, to simplify the conveyancing process particularly the procedures involved in order to reduce delays and associated costs, to promote extension of the registration of title system in the Land Registry and to facilitate the introduction of e-conveyancing of land as soon as possible.  The Bill represents a substantial contribution to the process of regulatory reform including the repeal of obsolete and outdated statute law as set out in the White Paper, Regulating Better.I do not propose to enter into great detail today in respect of the contents of the Bill, not least because it is accompanied by a comprehensive Explanatory Memorandum.  Part 1 contains definitions of various terms used in the Bill and general provisions which are common in legislation of this nature.  Section 8 repeals, in whole or in part, approximately 150 pre-1922 statutes listed in Schedule 2 and which stretch back over the centuries to feudal times.  Part 2, comprising sections 9 to 14, deals with the fundamental provisions relating to the ownership of land.  It contains important provisions which reform and modernise the ownership of land.  In particular, it removes the remaining vestiges of the feudal system of landholding introduced by the Normans in the 12th century.  For example, in so far as it survives, the concept of tenure, whereby all land was held from the Crown, is abolished.  Also abolished are methods of landholding developed over the centuries to meet the needs of earlier times but which are no longer of relevance to modern conditions or will cease to have significance as a result of other provisions of the Bill.  Examples include fee tails, where an estate was entailed to particular members of a family; fee farm grants, which were popular in this jurisdiction but not in others where one had, in effect, a perpetual leasehold; and leases for lives, an analogous Irish device where land was leased for a number of lives.On the other hand, the Bill retains the concept of an estate in land which was also part of the feudal system but which remains a central and useful feature of the modern system of land ownership.  The idea of dividing ownership according to different periods of time is what makes land ownership under a common law system so flexible.  It is based on the fundamental principle that what is owned is not the physical land but rather an estate, giving substantial rights in respect of the land, such as the right to occupy and use it, or an interest, giving less substantial rights in it, for example, a right of way over a road on the land or a right to cut and take away turf or gather seaweed on a foreshore.  The full ownership of any particular piece of land comprises these various estates and interests, including equitable interests such as those existing under a trust which has among its assets land.  It is worth noting that Article 10.1 of the Constitution refers expressly to estates and interests in the context of natural resources.How many of these various estates and interests will exist in respect of a particular area of land will vary from case to case.  As I mentioned earlier, as part of its objective of simplifying the law, the Bill substantially reduces the number of estates which may be created in future.  For example, it provides that the only legal estates which may be created or disposed of are the freehold estate, meaning a fee simple in possession, and the leasehold estate, meaning a tenancy in the modern sense of a relationship between landlord and tenant.  It may surprise Members to learn that there is a great number of estates still recognised in Irish law, encountered infrequently but encountered all the same, which will be terminated on the enactment of this legislation.Part 3 introduces a substantial simplification of the law concerning future interests in land and, in some cases, such interests in other property.  Future interests are interests that do not vest in, that is do not come into the possession of, the persons entitled to them until a fixed or determinable future date, usually because the land or other property is vested in someone else in the meantime.  The law in this area must strike a balance between the wishes of those who want to fetter the ownership of land for a period of time and the requirement of the law that land should be marketable and that interest should be realisable.Part 4 provides for a radical simplification of the law relating to settlements and trusts of land.  Currently, many settlements do not involve the use of a trust.  Instead, the land is given by a deed or will to different persons in succession.  Sometimes a trust is used instead and the land is given to trustees to be held by them on trust for the beneficiaries.  The type of trust used may vary from one case to another.  In some cases, the trustees may be required to retain the land.  In others, the trust may require the trustees to sell the land at the earliest opportunity, invest the proceeds and hold those investments instead for the beneficiaries.The law governing settlements and trusts has become very complicated.  One reason is that while the Settled Land Acts 1882 to 1890 apply to settlements without any trust, usually referred to as a strict settlement, and trusts to retain land, they do not apply in the same way to trusts for sale.  Part 4 clears up this confusion by replacing the Settled Land Acts with a single and much more straightforward trust of land scheme.  An important feature of the scheme is that the legal title to the land will always be vested in trustees and they will have full powers of dealing with it and using it for the benefit of the beneficiaries.Part 5 deals with powers relating to property, both land and personal property, especially powers of appointment.  These powers are commonly used in family settlements and trusts where, instead of allocating property directly to named beneficiaries, the owner gives another person, called the donee of the power, a power to appoint, that is select from a group of potential beneficiaries, called the objects of the power, which of them are to be beneficiaries and in what shares.Part 6 deals with the law relating to co-ownership of land, that is cases where the legal title to the land is vested in two or more persons concurrently.  Two types of co-ownership remain common nowadays: the joint tenancy and the tenancy in common.The distinguishing feature of a joint tenancy is the so-called right of survivorship whereby on the death of a joint tenant, that owner's interest ceases and the land becomes vested in the surviving joint tenants.  This process continues until the land becomes vested in the last surviving joint tenant as sole owner and the co-ownership ends.  That type of joint tenancy is convenient in the case of a married couple who have bought a house and who wish the house to be left to the surviving spouse in the event of the death of one spouse.  It ensures that the surviving spouse owns the property.  In the case of a tenancy in common, on the other hand, each tenant has a distinct but undivided share which can be inherited on that tenant's death by persons named in his or her will.One of the important aspects of the law of co-ownership is the right of severance of a joint tenancy.  Where a joint tenancy is converted into a tenancy in common one has severance.  Unilateral severance by a single joint tenant is permitted under current law and it has significant consequences because it means the other joint tenants lose the expectation that one of them will, as the last surviving joint tenant, end up as the sole owner of all the land.  In order to remedy this, the Bill prohibits unilateral severance of a joint tenancy without the written consent of the other joint tenants.  This Part also updates the law relating to the partition of land by co-owners.  When the co-owners of land disagree about the management of the property it is necessary to have a procedure for the resolution of their differences.Part 7 provides for a substantial overhaul of the law relating to appurtenant rights.  These are rights which are extremely common with respect to land and usually involve neighbouring landowners.  They either permit one landowner to do something on a neighbour's land or entitle that landowner to prevent the neighbour from doing something on it.  The most common categories of such rights are easements and profits à prendre and these are dealt with in Chapter 1.  An easement is a right such as a right of way over neighbouring land or a right to light.Although the categories of easement are generally regarded as settled, courts have made it clear that the existing list is not necessarily closed and new rights with similar characteristics may be recognised as changes in society require, for example a right to park a vehicle.A profit à prendre is the right to go onto someone else’s land and to take from it something which exists on it naturally, such as the right to mine or quarry, cut timber or turf, graze animals on grass or fish and hunt wild game.  Such profits are frequently enjoyed by a neighbouring landowner and are therefore appurtenant, but they can also be owned in gross, that is by a person who is not a neighbour and who may own no land other than the profit exercisable over someone else’s land.  These rights have been the happy hunting ground of lawyers for centuries.Chapter 2 prohibits the creation of rentcharges which is another type of right which may be owned in respect of someone else's land.  It is a rent charged on land to provide an income or regular payments to the owner of the rentcharge.  These used to be created in family settlements in bygone days in order to provide an income for members who were given no other substantial interest in the land, for example siblings of the family member, usually the eldest son, who was given a life interest in the land.  Rentcharges are no longer common.Chapter 3 provides for a new statutory system to deal with problems which frequently arise in relation to party structures, such as party walls and fences, separating neighbours.  This is designed to regulate the rights of such owners, especially where a dispute occurs over repairs or works which one owner wishes to carry out.  These provisions will also extend to situations where, strictly speaking, there may not be a party structure but the buildings are so close to the boundary line that work such as repairs cannot be carried out effectively without access from the neighbouring property.  These provisions will enable one landowner to obtain a District Court works order permitting such access under certain conditions.Chapter 4 remedies a long-standing defect in existing law.  This is the limited enforceability of freehold covenants affecting land.  Such covenants are frequently entered into when a landowner sells part of the land to someone else.  The purchaser will often covenant to restrict the use of the land purchased and to undertake various positive obligations relating to building and repairs.  Unlike leasehold covenants, which generally bind successors in title, freehold covenants are enforceable against successors in title to a limited extent only.  In effect, only the burden of negative or restrictive freehold covenants passes to successors.  In the 19th century many of the great estates in Dublin had their planning organised through the device of the restrictive covenant.  It is not so common in our modern planning system.  Those covenants are enforceable, but traditionally, positive covenants were not enforceable against freehold owners and will become so under this legislation.  Chapter 4 changes the law substantially so as to bring the enforceability of freehold covenants, whether positive or negative, into line with that of leasehold covenants.Part 8 deals with contracts and conveyances relating to land and replaces the conveyancing Acts 1881 to 1911, and various other pre-1922 statutes, with updated provisions more suited to modern conditions.  It is designed to prepare the ground for eventual eConveyancing.  This part also contains provisions for the interim period before a fully electronic and paperless system becomes operative.  Until then, written documents and deeds in the traditional form will continue to be used.Chapter 1 contains detailed provisions concerning contracts relating to land, such as contracts for sale.  Chapter 2 deals with title matters, in particular deduction of title by a vendor and investigation of title by a purchaser.  Chapter 3 deals with deeds and their operation, including the formalities for proper execution of deeds and the effect of particular provisions in deeds.  Chapter 4 deals with the contents of deeds, in particular statutory provisions that can be read into them, while chapter 5 contains some general provisions concerning conveyancing.Part 9 deals with mortgages.  It contains a substantial simplification and modernisation of the law of mortgages.  In particular, it assimilates the law relating to unregistered land with registered land, by making a charge the sole method of creating a legal mortgage.  It also introduces provisions to ensure that lenders' remedies to enforce security are exercised only when appropriate.  Part 10 deals with judgment mortgages and replaces with substantial modification the provisions of the Judgment Mortgage (Ireland) Acts 1850 and 1858.Part 11 contains amendments to the Registration of Title Act 1964, while Part 12 contains miscellaneous provisions.  The First Schedule contains consequential amendments to various statutes, while the Second Schedule contains repeals of numerous pre-1922 statutes.  The Third Schedule sets out the different classes of covenants for title implied in conveyances under sections 77 and 78.At this stage, I want to return to the issue of registration of title and say a few words about eConveyancing.  The reforms to the substantive law set out in this Bill will, together with those already enacted in the Registration of Deeds and Title Act 2006, provide a sound foundation for future eConveyancing.  However, the Law Reform Commission has concluded, and I agree wholeheartedly with it, that an efficient and comprehensive eConveyancing system can operate only in respect of registered land.  For this reason, one of the key tasks given to the Property Registration Authority under the 2006 Act is to promote and extend the compulsory registration of title.Compulsory registration of title applies at present in only six counties: Carlow, Laois and Meath since 1970, and Longford, Roscommon and Westmeath since 1 April 2006.  Clearly, someone with a sense of humour  made that order on 1 April 2006.  Much remains to be done therefore and I expect the Property Registration Authority to address this key challenge with urgency and vigour.Increased registration of title will in turn mean less need for, and eventual closure of the Registry of Deeds.  It has served a useful purpose for 300 years but eConveyancing requires conclusive registration of ownership and that need cannot be met through the registration of deeds and the associated searches which must take place there every time a land transaction takes place.  The Registry of Deeds is a valuable source of historical material and existing documentation must be preserved, and access to it ensured, for future generations.  The archive of material that is available in the Registry of Deeds is very valuable.Issues concerning multi-unit developments were raised in the discussions in the Seanad and are a major issue of property law in the public mind.  It is important to recognise the important distinction between property management agents and property management companies.  Agents provide property-related services under contract.  Because they provide property services, management agents will, together with auctioneers and estate agents, be covered by the licensing system to be operated by the National Property Services Regulatory Authority.  That legislation is currently being drafted in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  Property management companies, on the other hand, are established under company law and comprise the owners of units within multi-unit developments.Issues relating to such developments and, in particular, the operation of property management companies were discussed at a conference organised by my Department and the Law Reform Commission earlier this year.  The conference provided an opportunity for a discussion of the wide range of issues identified in the commission's consultation paper on multi-unit developments.  The consultation paper makes it clear that solutions to the difficulties arising in relation to property management companies will require action across a broad range of areas, including company law and consumer protection law.  These companies are subject to the provisions of company law and its enforcement mechanisms, including the Companies Registration Office, CRO, and the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, ODCE, and the National Consumer Agency, NCA.  I look forward to the final report of the Law Reform Commission because it will provide a foundation on which we can develop the necessary amendments to the legislation that regulates these corporate entities.In recognition of the complex nature of the difficulties, and the cross-cutting nature of many of them, the Government has established a high-level interdepartmental committee to assist in the development of a coherent and comprehensive legislative response.  The legislation relating to the auctioneers and the providers of services to those in multi-unit developments is already being drafted.  I await the report of the Law Reform Commission.  The key task of the committee is to identify the legislative and administrative actions to be taken on receipt of the Law Reform Commission's definitive recommendations for legislative reforms in its forthcoming report on multi-unit developments.  The commission will publish this report later this year following completion of a consultation process.I intend to bring forward certain amendments on Committee Stage to respond to issues raised and suggestions made during earlier Seanad discussions.  In the meantime, I commend the Bill to the House.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	196	I thank the Minister for his comprehensive overview of this technical, nevertheless, important legislation, a measure that represents the greatest upheaval in conveyancing law in more than a century, perhaps with the exception of the Registration of Title Act 1964.This Bill is much more than technical reforms of practice and procedure.  In essence we are witnessing the end of the feudal system.  Originally a vassal could not move abode, marry, work or die without some charter of approval and acknowledgement from a superior.  The feudal system relied heavily on the concept of separate estates in the same land with the crown holding the ultimate superior interest.  Land registration as it has evolved, results in a simple title sheet being the land certificate, as we know it.  The title sheet held in the registry can be accessed manually and comprises one sheet of paper or it can be accessed electronically, which is the objective of the legislation.  Moreover the title sheet should be able to record burdens and charges as well as changes in ownership by way of electronic transaction.  The ultimate objective must be that deeds could be digitally created and signed and day to day conveyancing will become no more than a mere mechanical exercise.  That is not to say that one can move from the Registry of Deeds to an electronic keyboard without acknowledging the remarkable course of land ownership in our history.The Fine Gael Party welcomes the introduction of this Bill and there can be no doubt that if any area needs reforms it is the law on conveyancing and property.  We have long been campaigning for legislation such as this and we support it.  We will examine the detail of the Bill and table amendments on Committee Stage.I am aware that the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell was the driving force for this legislation since 2002 when he was the Attorney General.  I pay tribute to him for taking on this very difficult but important undertaking.  I acknowledge also the major contribution of Professor John Wylie, perhaps the leading expert on property law in Ireland.  I can see his hand in the drafting of the Bill and I know from inquiries that he has been the leading hand in this legislation along with an expert team of lawyers and researchers that form the land law working group in the Law Reform Commission.  It is a complex area of law.  Even the report of the Law Reform Commission does not make easy reading.  There remains very much a job in conveyancing for the "plain English" brigade.  While much progress is being made with this legislation, it is still heavy, complex and extremely difficult to peruse in any way that can be clearly understood.  We have a duty as legislators to ensure that wherever possible our legislation is straightforward, understandable and comprehensible to the ordinary citizen so that nobody is excluded from the process of legislation produced by the Oireachtas.Everybody will welcome the end of terms such as "fee tail", "fee farm grant", "estate pour autre vie”, “the rule in Bain and Fothergill”, terms that mean nothing to lay people.  None of us will miss the 150 statutes that will be repealed with the passing of this Bill into law, for example, the Maintenance and Embracery Act 1634 or the Clandestine Mortgages Act 1697.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	198	It is indicative that land registration is complex, reflecting the various changes in our history.  In my constituency until recently land registry legislation and the bulk of the deeds that still form the day to day practice of conveyancing describe lands as being situate in the heart of County King's if it is on the Offaly side or in the heart of County Queen's if on the Laois side.  Approximately two years ago the Land Registry, by way of practice direction, decided not to issue any new deeds or folios in the former royal names of the counties.  Nevertheless, many bank vaults and safes throughout the constituency still hold original deeds with Queen's County and King's County, even though numerous transactions may have taken place up to the mid-1990s.The Registration of Title Act, to which the Minister referred, dealt with compulsory registration.  From early 1970 Counties Laois, Carlow and Meath were counties where, if Land Registry land was the subject matter of a conveyance, registration in the Land Registry was compulsory.  I do not know why this was never extended in the manner in which I am sure was intended in the Registration of Title Act.  Had compulsory registration been extended from 1970 onwards, the Minister's task in introducing electronic conveyancing would have been far simpler because with the various transactions and changes in ownership over that time significant easing of the system might have taken place.  However, it was not.  It is really only in the compulsory registration counties that the registration of title is incorporated in the issue of a single land certificate and this has made significant changes and has very much eased the burdensome nature of conveyancing by having just title incorporated in the Land Registry.A reading of the Second Schedule to the Bill, which lists the repealed statutes, shows us just how archaic the law in Ireland in this area has been.  When we have to abolish statutes that were previously in effect since the time of Edward I, we know that it is long overdue.  The Statute De Donis Conditionalibus is finally leaving us for good.  The Statute Quia Emptores 1290, and the Illusory Appointments Act 1830 will go, in the same way, into the bin of history.  It never ceases to amaze me that we continue to rely on archaic laws and statutes that not only predate the State, but date back to the 12th and even the 11th centuries.  The sooner we, as legislators, deal with that, the better for clarity and expediency.I pay particular tribute to the Law Reform Commission for all the work it has carried out on this issue.  I have immense regard for the commission as it is a body from which I believe many of our State agencies and State-sponsored bodies could learn a valuable lesson.  Under the Honourable Mrs. Justice Catherine McGuinness of the Supreme Court, as President of the commission, and her only full-time colleague, Ms Patricia T. Rickard-Clarke, the Law Reform Commission has successfully implemented a programme of research and investigation into the law that is second to none.  Its rate of delivery of sound, considered and detailed reports on areas of important law reform is admirable.  Equally, it is infinitely valuable to us as Members of the Oireachtas.  It is important that we place on the record our thanks to it for its great work.The objective of legislators and conveyancers is similar notwithstanding the technical and complex nature of the conveyancing practice.  It is to make the process simpler and more straightforward that it might be clearly understood by the consumer.  To achieve this goal much of the archaic terminology must be replaced by concepts that are more easily understood.  Making the process more consumer friendly will also incorporate the most welcome feature of cutting costs and delivering a better service for better value.I pay tribute to the staff of the Land Registry.  I am pleased to see examiners of title consulted in the process.  Some of what passes across the desks of examiners of title is extremely complex and difficult.  It conjures images of examiners of title with wet towels around the backs of their necks and the door locked to the outside world as they go through the various statutes dating back to the 13th century.The explanatory memorandum must be one of the most complex and detailed this House has ever seen.  I am not sure to what extent the House will debate this archaic treatise.  I am not sure whether I have the stomach for it.  Thank God for Professor Wylie and friends who are guiding us in this legislation and upon whose advice, expertise and guidance we are very much reliant.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	200	In essence the Bill reduces the number of estates or varying degrees of ownership to two.  This will provide a more definite and certain concept of land ownership.  The two basic types of ownership will remain freehold or fee simple interest and estate with absolute freehold interest with or without encumbrances, and leasehold, a type of tenancy with covenants and conditions restricting absolute freedom to enjoy the benefit of ownership.  There will be no more fee farm rents or fee farm grants, no more lease for lives renewable forever and other lesser known but very complex degrees of ownership.The process of change and simplification will reduce some of the mystique attaching to title and ownership.  This will make matters clearer for the consumer and save money as the time involved in the conveyancing transaction will be considerably less.  Only a few years ago we were told that three solicitors were necessary to complete an independent house transaction, one for the vendor, one for the purchaser and one for the financial institution.  We were told, similarly to what we were told in regard to bus conductors, that the system would not work without the three lawyers and the three sets of fees.  Some years later we record very few difficulties, with the purchaser's lawyer certifying title to the financial institution and undertaking to register the bank's interest on a marketable and unencumbered title.  The problems have been far fewer than was envisaged by Members of this House to some extent but more particularly by members of the legal profession.The Bill deals with so many different areas of land law that it represents a comprehensive review of the law concerning property in Ireland.  I welcome particularly the proposed changes in the area of ownership in Part 2 of the Bill.  Extraordinarily, until the passing of this Bill, at least in theory, Irish people will not own their own property in absolute terms.  Despite the fact that we now hand over remarkable prices for houses and lands, when we buy a house we technically still owe fealty to the Crown for the ownership of that property.  Essentially there currently exists no such thing as absolute ownership of land or property in this State.  This Bill will finally redress that situation.  The State will finally now be enshrined as the alternative to the British Crown in such matters.Section 9 of the Bill, which will abolish feudal tenure, is long overdue and of some significance.  There is perhaps room in the aftermath of the commencement of this Act for a further review of the terminology used in legal matters in general but specifically, as far as property is concerned, even now in this reforming legislation, Part 7 deals with appurtenant rights and profits à prendre, terms that are a far cry from the language we would like to see in this area with a view to demystifying land law for lay people.  Similarly it is fair to say that a non-lawyer reading section 63 on escrows by corporate bodies might become a little confused.The question of co-ownership was addressed by the Minister and the chapters dealing with it are interesting.  They bring about some welcome changes that will have a positive, practical effect.  At present, the distinction between joint tenancy and tenancy in common gives rise to confusion on the part of property owners.  The right of survivorship, which is fundamental to the joint tenancy, while the next of kin and the relatives of tenants in common have inherent rights vested in them——

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	202	We mentioned the changes in the law relating to co-ownership.  Section 28 of the Bill will give the right to sever the joint tenancy in favour of a tenancy in common, with the result that right of survivorship may no longer operate on the demise of the joint tenant, provided that all the persons entitled to the joint tenancy down the line would be adequately notified.  Notice and knowledge would be essential.The amendment and repeal of aspects of the Partition Acts of 1868 and 1872 are welcome because the uncertainty and confusion that surrounds the current interpretation of these Acts can cause difficulties.  There will now be a wider discretion vested in the courts to interpret the law and apply modern conditions and everyday eventualities to the concept of ownership.Part 7 deals with easements and profits, in the main the right to light and support, rights of way, profits à prendre and the right to extract sand or stone, or cut turf.  This can be extremely complex, as can be seen in the Midlands Circuit Court, where legal battles arguing the right to cut turf were taking place long before special areas of conservation or national heritage areas led to disputes over the turbary rights having less significance than heretofore.  The extinguishment of such rights after 12 years of non-use is welcome as it will relieve the Circuit Court of the difficult task of interpreting rights between vexed and unloving neighbours, most of whom are members of the farming community.  This will introduce an element of certainty.The area dealing with party walls, boundary fences and, specifically, the enforceability of freehold covenants is important.  There was great confusion given that negative covenants were only enforceable under law.  The change, which is long overdue, going back to the Tulk v. Moxhay decision, will be enshrined in law at last so the positive and negative covenants will now both operate to the benefit or detriment of the land or the piece of paper governing it.During the debate on the Registration of Deeds and Title Bill, we raised the issue of land registration and introduced amendments on Committee Stage to encourage movement towards the eventual registration of all lands in this country.  This is the most important goal of all and with the enactment of this Bill, the Minister might consider focusing his attention on it.  He mentioned that the system has now been extended to three more counties but there is a long way to go to ensure this long overdue measure of ownership can be taken into consideration in a consumer-friendly way.I welcome the abolition of the creation of rent charges.  The Bill clearly states that extant rent charges will now have the status of simple contract debts only.  Section 47 of the Bill represents an important change.  Similarly, in light of recent examples of fraud and questionable practices, the new protections for purchasers as laid down in section 57 are significant.The Minister explained adverse possession and squatters' rights in another forum and they have been left out of the Bill pending a challenge in the European court.  Notwithstanding this, the Minister should undertake a reform of the area now we have gone so far.  The contractual position relating to the conduct of public auctions awaits new legislation and a regulatory framework to cover auctioneers.  Will the Minister update us on the steps being taken towards regulating estate agents?

Broughan — the need to establish a ministerial task force to carry out a traceability audit of all building sites allegedly supplied with defective stone infill by a quarry group; (5) Deputies Seán Sherlock and David Stanton — the implications for the Cork area of the announcement that a company is not now to proceed with its development; (6) Deputy Catherine Byrne — the need for the Minister for Health and Children to intervene to ensure that patients continue to receive methadone treatment from pharmacists in line with present arrangements; (7) Deputy Alan Shatter — the need to refuse to grant a visa to a member of Hizbollah; (8) Deputy Pat Breen — the need to ascertain if the HSE and the Department of Health and Children are happy with the current level of emergency "on-call" ambulance service available to the people of County Clare after 6 p.m.; if they are happy that the current level of service is sufficient to deal with the activation of the region's major emergency plan, including an emergency at Shannon international airport; (9) Deputy David Stanton — the need to make a statement on the announcement made by Amgen, one of the world's top biotechnology companies, that it has indefinitely shelved plans to build a major plant in Carrigtwohill costing €1 billion; the action that State agencies are going to take as a result; and if he will assure that the road works etc., that have commenced will be completed; and if he will make a statement on the matter; (10) Deputy Brian O'Shea — the need to provide funding in his Department's capital works programme 2007 towards the Tallow fire station project; (11) Deputy Chris Andrews — given the chronic shortage of step-down facilities in the Dublin south east area, the need for the Minister to give assurance to the House that St. Luke's Hospital in Rathgar will eventually become a step-down health care facility; and (12) Deputy Tony Gregory — the application by the Ward Union stag hunt for a licence to hunt deer.The matters raised by Deputies Thomas McEllistrim, Seán Sherlock and David Stanton, Alan Shatter and Thomas P. Broughan have been selected for discussion.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I congratulate Deputies Brian O'Shea and Jimmy Deenihan on their new positions.  I wish them the very best for the future.There is an acknowledged shortage of medical officers in the medical corps.  Indeed, developing the capacity of the medical corps forms part of the programme for Government.  Whereas the establishment for doctors provided for in the new organisation of the Defence Forces, introduced on foot of the White Paper on Defence, is 47, the current strength of medical officers serving in the Defence Forces is 23, one of whom is on leave of absence without pay.  There has been recruitment of medical officers each year, but the number attracted to work in the Defence Forces has just served to address natural wastage.The military medical services and their facilities exist primarily to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and to support them in operational and overseas activities.  The focus of the military medical service is on primary care, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training.The problems with recruitment of medical officers into the Defence Forces have endured for some time despite the concerted efforts of my Department and the Defence Forces themselves to address the root causes.  The pay and allowances of doctors and dentists were increased substantially recently, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  This increase linked their pay to public health doctors and dentists.  In addition, the Defence Forces have recently undertaken an intensive recruitment campaign.  The results of both of these initiatives have been disappointing, unfortunately.My Department has also been engaged in an ongoing process with the representative associations on the issue of the health requirements of members of the Defence Forces.  A medical services charter was agreed under Sustaining Progress.  This collaborative work has been carried forward into the modernisation agenda under Towards 2016, which foresees work on developing a revised structure for the delivery of medical services for the Defence Forces.The services of civilian medical practitioners are regularly engaged to ensure that the immediate primary health care requirements arising in barracks are met.  However, it is accepted that the shortage of dedicated doctors needs to be addressed in the longer term.All the stakeholders are committed to meeting the medical needs of the Defence Forces efficiently and effectively.  We are working in partnership with those stakeholders to develop strategies to attract additional medical officers.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I thank the Minister for welcoming Deputy O'Shea and myself here today.  Yesterday, Deputy Charles Flanagan gave a commitment to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and I will certainly be as constructive and positive as I can concerning defence issues over the lifetime of this Dáil.I welcome the Minister's reply, but how many Irish nationals joined the Army medical corps in the past five years?  How many non-nationals are serving as doctors in the Army at the moment?  Whereas non-nationals are serving in medical services across the country, does the Minister agree that there are communication difficulties in the Army, especially when it comes to foreign missions?  Difficulties can arise concerning physical, psychological and emotional health when native doctors are not present.  Will the Minister refer to that point, as well as providing a breakdown between male and female doctors?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I do not have all the information the Deputy requires.  I can tell him, however, that in 2003 one doctor was appointed, another was appointed in 2004, and four were appointed in 2005.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Were they Irish?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I do not have the breakdown between Irish nationals and non-nationals, but I will get it for the Deputy.  We have very few female doctors.  Of the 23 doctors, I think only three or four are female.  However, I will obtain the precise figures for the Deputy.As regards the Deputy's second point, no particular medical problems concerning troops serving overseas have been brought to my attention.  As I said, we employ civilian doctors and sometimes there is a link between Ireland and whatever other groups make up a mission.  For example, on the recent mission to Lebanon, medical services were delivered by a combination of Irish and Finnish personnel, because we linked up with the Finns.  In view of the failure of the recent recruitment campaign, including an attempt to attract personnel by substantially increasing salaries, we need to re-examine the situation to see if we can find another way to proceed.  However, major problems concerning overseas service have not been brought to my attention.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	210	We are relying on the goodwill of other countries to provide us with a medical service, as happened in Liberia.  Is the Minister aware that three doctors have resigned from the Army medical corps over the past year, one of whom was the director of the medical corps?  It is time for positive action to attract people into the Army medical corps.  I acknowledge that the Minister accepts there is a problem.  Apart from increasing salaries, is it possible to provide other incentives for people to join the Army medical corps?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	211	As regards relying on the goodwill of foreign armies, it works both ways.  If one examines the delivery of medical services in Liberia, the Irish have medics there, too, who are delivering services to non-Irish personnel.As regards the Deputy's other point, I suppose it is a question of providing further incentives.  I have discussed this matter with the Chief of Staff and those directly responsible in the Defence Forces who have agreed to take a fresh look at the situation to see if we can recruit more doctors.  I acknowledge that there is a problem because the medical corps is only at half its established strength.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The ministerial air transport service is primarily provided by the Gulfstream IV and Learjet 45 aircraft, which were specifically acquired for that purpose.  The Beech Super Kingair 200 turboprop aircraft, which is now used primarily in a training role, is made available for ministerial air transport use from time to time, mainly for internal flights and a limited number of European destinations.On 21 September 2007, the Gulfstream IV aircraft flew from Dublin to Paris carrying the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and ten officials from the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs.  Neither the Learjet 45 nor the Beech Super Kingair 200 was used by Ministers on that day.Requests for the use of the service are made by Ministers' private secretaries to the Taoiseach's office where they are examined with regard to the need and purpose of travel.  Once approved, all operational matters are settled directly between the Minister in question and my Department.  My Department does not hold details concerning the purpose of ministerial air transport trips, which is a matter for individual Ministers.

Other Ministers were present in Paris, but I understand they did not use Government transport.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Yes.

In that case, reports that the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, used the jet or, indeed, that there was a late flight for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan are incorrect.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	216	As I understand it, the Minister of State, Deputy Dick Roche, was elsewhere.  He did not travel to Paris on that day on the Gulfstream jet.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, went the previous day on the Lear Jet 45.  The only people on the Government jet, as it is known, on that day, were the Taoiseach, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and ten officials from their Departments.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	217	Does the Minister think it was a coincidence that so many Ministers converged on Paris that day, bearing in mind that there was a World Cup rugby match that night?  They may not all have used the transport on that day but it seems that people were anxious to get there.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	218	It may have been a coincidence but I am sure that if the Deputy tabled questions to the Taoiseach and each of those Ministers they would be well able to handle them.  I am sure they all had important business in Paris.  We do not inquire about that.  Once the criteria are met we make the jet available.  That is the function of the Department of Defence.It is true that there was a rugby match that weekend and Ireland was fighting for her life.  It was no hardship to the players, who were trying to win under difficult circumstances in a foreign country against a home team, to have support in the stands from the Government.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	221	On 25 September 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 establishing a multidimensional UN mission in Chad and the Central African Republic that will help strengthen security in the region.  Resolution 1778 (2007) establishes the mission, to be known as MINURCAT, for a period of one year, with a mandate focusing on the security and protection of civilians, particularly refugees, internally displaced persons, IDPs, and civilians in danger, and on human rights and the rule of law in eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic.Since 2004, eastern Chad has hosted some 240,000 Sudanese refugees in 12 camps who have fled the fighting in Darfur.  In addition, Chad is facing a surge in the number of IDPs, now totalling more than 170,000.  MINURCAT will have three components: a UN multidimensional presence, composed of UN police, rule of law, human rights and other civilian officers; a special Chadian police or gendarmes unit, some 850 strong, dedicated exclusively to maintaining law and order in refugee camps, sites with concentrations of IDPs and key towns, and assisting in securing humanitarian activities in eastern Chad; and an EU military deployment, under Chapter VII.The Government at its meeting on Tuesday approved the nomination of an Irish officer to the position of operation commander for the proposed EU military operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic.  The European Council will shortly decide on this appointment as part of the joint action to launch the ESDP mission.A fact-finding mission is to visit the region and report back on mission requirements.  The Government will take a final decision on the extent of the Defence Forces' participation in this mission once this report is to hand.  Any decision to participate will be subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann in accordance with the Defence Acts.As part of the background planning for potential participation in the EU mission in Chad the Defence Forces are examining a range of strategic lift options for deployment of Defence Forces personnel and their sustainment in this region.  The Defence Forces have stand-by arrangements in place in this regard, mainly involving commercial suppliers.  Discussions are ongoing with our EU partners.  There are no plans to acquire large long-range transport aircraft for the Defence Forces.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The camp in Chad will be approximately 1,500 km inland and we have no air carrying capacity to support our own mission there.  Will the Minister consider procuring a special airforce transport plane with a carrying capacity of approximately 50 to give the capability to the Air Corps to support that mission?  We rely on others to provide back-up, such as the medical back-up service and to transport our troops in and out of their locations usually for four month stretches.  In between if emergencies arise we must rely on others and their availability to service the Irish mission.  There is a case for the Air Corps to procure such a transport plane with capacity for at least 50 which could also carry goods and supplies.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	223	Deputy Deenihan is right about the isolation of this mission.  I understand the terrain is barren and that the deployment and sustainment of the troops must be done mainly by air.  That will involve putting in airstrips and so on, which we are discussing with the French, pending the final decision on the mission.Without wishing to be flippant, I would procure anything if the Department of Finance gave me the money to do it.  We work within our budget.  The military advise me that our need for this sort of facility is so rare that it does not justify the cost.  We have arrangements in place with commercial suppliers.  Sometimes we link up with other people on the mission, in this case, the French, who provide the appropriate air transport.  In the context of expenditure on defence and our weapon modernisation programme I am advised that a purchase of this sort, which would be expensive and difficult to maintain, would not be used enough to be cost-efficient.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	224	It could also be used for humanitarian purposes, and rapid reaction.  It would overcome the problem to which Deputy O'Shea referred of transporting the whole Cabinet to Paris when necessary.In advance of the next White Paper will the Minister consider the possibility of acquiring such an aircraft to enable the Air Corps to provide this service, whether for a mission abroad, for humanitarian reasons or rapid reaction missions?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	225	The Army has participated in humanitarian missions and has arrived at the destinations quite effectively.  I will consider the Deputy's comments.  A new White Paper is to be prepared which will cover the period after 2010.  The first White Paper runs up to 2009-10.  This will cover better equipment, more modernisation and this aircraft may well be included.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	226	The independent monitoring group in its report Response to the Challenge of a Workplace stated that a professional review of progress within the Defence Forces should take place in 2007 and that it should be published.  The report also suggested that a group representative of military management, PDFORRA, RACO, the Department of Defence and external expertise should conduct such a review.I agree there should be a review of progress.  I can confirm that my Department is concentrating on the terms of reference for such a review.  The next phase, involving the key players, will be launched shortly.The ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the Doyle report has been one of the highest priorities for the Defence Forces and the Department since its publication.  Policies on equality, dignity and bullying are constantly communicated to all ranks.  I am satisfied the military authorities are alert to and vigilant on this issue and are committed to addressing the matter in a continuing and proactive manner through educational modules on interpersonal relationships which are now embedded in career courses for all ranks.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	227	A commitment was given in the action plan under the pay agreement and modernisation agenda for the Defence Forces last June that this review group would be established by the end of September.  Why has it not been established?  It was expected to report by the end of 2007.  As far as I am aware, the only outstanding requirement is for the Minister to appoint an external expert to chair the review group, as its other elements are ready and waiting.  Why has it not yet been appointed?  Realistically, does the Minister believe such a review can be carried out by the end of the year and will the group report before then?  I have read some of his replies to questions tabled in the House, in which he gave commitments to that effect, as were made in the 2004 review of the White Paper.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The Doyle report was presented in 2002 and a review carried out in 2004.  The Deputy is correct to state the next review was scheduled for 2007.  However, the Department has encountered a couple of internal staff difficulties that have delayed matters.  It is untrue to state it is simply waiting for the appointment of an external person.  It is engaged in drawing up the terms of reference.  I understand it has drawn up certain terms of reference and is examining them in the light of certain developments in society, some experiences that came to its intention on foot of the appointment of the newly established ombudsman, as well as the Health and Safety Authority's recently produced bullying charter.  It is fine-tuning the terms of reference.  I understand this will be completed within the next couple of weeks and we can move forward thereafter.  It probably would be unrealistic to expect the review to be completed by the end of the year; it will probably be done by early next year.  However, this does not represent any diminution in the commitment of either the Department or the Army to tackling bullying and harassment in the ranks of the latter.  If the Deputy wishes, I can provide him with a lengthy list outlining what has been done and is being done and what is proposed to do in this regard.  Some dramatic changes have been made recently.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I appeal to the Minister to put in place the review group because, as he stated, considerable progress has been made.  Other countries are examining the Irish model in an effort to deal with their own problems of bullying and harassment.  However, the momentum must continue and there can be no let-up in implementing all the recommendations fully at all levels.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	230	There will not be any let-up in implementing the specific recommendations, many of which are in place.  As the Deputy correctly identified, the review's purpose is to ascertain how well they are working.  My information is they are working very well.  However, I look forward to the review which I am sure will bear that out.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	231	The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army.  The White Paper also provided that the Chief of Staff could maintain an additional 250 in training at any one time.  The latter provision was withdrawn in 2003.The agreed programme for Government now proposes an additional provision for up to 350 troops to be in training at any given time.  The military authorities and my Department are undertaking the planning necessary to address this proposal.It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces.  Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper as required to meet military needs.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	232	Is the Minister confident there are the training personnel and resources to train the promised 350 troops?  When will recruitment begin?  Although the commitment is for 2008, surely the recruitment process should have begun to ensure 350 personnel will be in training by the end of that year.  Is it the Minister's objective to have 350 troops in training at the end of 2008?  I seek clarity on the issue, as well as on whether the Minister is satisfied the training arrangements are in place to accommodate this increase in numbers.  Some within the Army are suspicious because of the withdrawal of the commitment made in the White Paper.  At that time a compromise was reached with the military authorities in respect of the force reduction from 11,500 to 10,500, to the effect there would be 250 personnel in training at any one time.  As this commitment was reneged on by the Government, it is feared the new commitment will also be reneged on, or not fully fulfilled.  I seek clarification in this regard.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I am certain and satisfied the system is in place to train personnel to maintain the Army at its present level.  However, to avoid misunderstandings arising regarding the figure of 350, recruitment to the Army is ongoing.  For example, the number who applied to be enlisted in 2004 was just short of 2,000.  The corresponding figures for 2005, 2006 and 2007 were 1,125, nearly 2,500 and approximately 2,200, respectively.  Obviously, only approximately 20% of such applications are successful.I will clarify the figure of 350.  We have permission to have an army of 8,426 personnel.  The figure of 350 constitutes a kind of overdraft facility that allows for up to 350 in training, which enables us to exceed the overall number, if deemed necessary.  For example, one could anticipate a number of retirements.  This constitutes an additional facility to maintain the Army at the strength as set out in the White Paper and I will ensure it takes effect from 1 January 2008.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	234	As for the applications for 2008, if the Minister has the figures available, he should provide the House with a breakdown of the number of male and female applicants.  How fares his initiative to recruit more women to the Army?  Is there now more interest from women to join?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I do not have the figures for 2008 as yet.  However, I will find out what I can and forward the information to the Deputy.  Last year, female membership numbered approximately 570.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Does that figure pertain to the Permanent Defence Force?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	237	Yes.  This represents an extremely small percentage of the total.  I understand the number of female cadets in the military is approximately double the number of female enlisted personnel.  The Deputy is aware I have reduced the height requirements in a measure that has just taken effect.  The Department has conducted some research etc. that it is analysing to put in place its recommendations.  While it might be too early to test the initiative, I will see what emerges.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 14 together.The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, Ms Paulynn Marrinan Quinn SC, launched her first annual report on 15 May last.  The report covers the period from December 2005 to December 2006, inclusive.The creation of the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces which became operational on 1 December 2005 represented a major historical milestone in the modernisation of the military redress of wrongs process.  The publication of the first annual report is a further milestone in this development.The Act provides that the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is independent in the performance of her duties and I do not consider it appropriate for me to report on her behalf or to give details in respect of her reports on individual cases.  However, I welcome the first report and the work done by Ms Marrinan Quinn in establishing this important new office.  The ombudsman has achieved her objective of creating a reputation for impartiality, professionalism and fairness for her office despite the brevity of her time there.  I also welcome strongly the response of the Defence Forces to this new office.  In this regard, the ombudsman commented that she had found the Defence Forces were open and receptive to the establishment of the office and were willing to recognise the benefits of having an ombudsman.I welcome the fact that the ombudsman has begun to have a positive impact on military human resources management.  In response to recommendations made by the ombudsman, new interim selection procedures for the selection of enlisted personnel for career courses and overseas service were introduced in July 2006.  These procedures were introduced in interim form to allow for their evaluation in an operational environment.  The Defence Forces are reviewing these procedures with a view to producing a final version in the near future.  Furthermore, the procedures for the promotion of non-commissioned officers within the Defence Forces are under review as part of the modernisation agenda.  Formal discussions on the proposed system commenced in April 2006 within the conciliation and arbitration forum.  The ombudsman has made recommendations on foot of some cases she has investigated which are included as inputs to this review.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I thank the Minister for that reply.  Would he consider it strange that none of the cases in the 2006 report of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces related to bullying, harassment or sexual harassment, and that 21 of the 26 cases related to the issues the Minister mentioned already? It should be noted that these procedures were brought in based on the previous report of the ombudsman.  Is it hard to accept that there were no complaints about bullying, harassment or sexual harassment?  If so, why are the complaints not coming through at this level?  I understand they come through at a different informal level in the Army.  Is this a health situation vis-à-vis the ombudsman service?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	240	Obviously I have no control over what sort of cases go to the ombudsman.  Deputy O'Shea is correct that only one case out of the 26 cases considered last year related to bullying or sexual harassment.  I understand that the ombudsman could not consider that case because it was outside her remit for procedural reasons.I would look at it the other way.  The internal procedures now are so good that matters do not have to go as far as the ombudsman because one only goes to the ombudsman when one has exhausted all internal procedures.  There is a raft of internal procedures in place now.  There are the direct contact persons, 240 of whom are in place.  There is the confidential telephone line.  The procedures have been reviewed by the Labour Court.  There is a human rights officer in the Army.  I would like to think that the reason so many bullying and harassment cases are not reaching the ombudsman is because they are being so effectively dealt with internally.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	241	Have there not been reports that Army personnel prefer going through the informal procedures with complaints of this nature and, for that reason, there are no official accounts of the bullying, harassment and sexual harassment complaints that come through at the informal level?  It is difficult for the military authorities or the Department to gain an accurate measure of what comes through the informal system in the Army.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	242	Deputy O'Shea has a point, but there are handbooks, guidelines and strategy statements, there is the A7 personnel directive, and anti-bullying measures are imbedded in all education courses in the Army.  The ombudsman is a final, statutorily independent court of appeal if people are not satisfied with how they get on internally.  They can make the complaint in a number of ways internally but those who are not satisfied can appeal to the ombudsman.  The fact that people are not appealing to the ombudsman so far — it could change — is an indication that they are happy with whatever redress they got internally.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The Minister can interpret it that way.  However, it could also be the case that people who go through the formal structures of the Army and then proceed to the ombudsman, which is also a formal structure, have concerns that it can affect their careers or have other negative repercussions.  How do we get around that issue?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	244	The terms under which people make informal complaints make specific provision that no one is victimised or intimidated, that his or her career will not suffer, etc.  These provisions are written down as part of the regulations that officers investigating complaints must take into account.  They must also be taken into account when people are being considered for future promotions.  I counted 14 specific anti-bullying measures which are now in place.  The ombudsman is now in place.In response to Deputy Deenihan's earlier question, the Department is undertaking a further comprehensive review.  In the context of that comprehensive review, I will ask the group to look specifically at the Deputy's point to see whether there is any evidence and whether we can get figures on the number of informal complaints.  Some of the complaints might be about trivial matters which would explain the lack of a record in some cases.  I will ask the review group to look at that issue to see whether there is anything further we can do to tighten up on that situation.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Have any complaints been made to the ombudsman in the context of equality legislation, particularly on the matter of gender equality in promotions?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	246	As Deputy Deenihan will be aware, the vast majority of complaints to the ombudsman relate to selecting people for career courses, for overseas service and for promotion.  I do not know whether the latter category contained accusations that people were not promoted simply because of their gender.  I do not have the details about the complaints.  I stated that the ombudsman is statutorily independent and I do not want to come in here and speak in detail about the cases with which she has dealt.  I should imagine the ombudsman's report may provide further information in that regard.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Only a small number of cases went to the ombudsman, and the number of cases where terminations were made was smaller still.  However, in the latter cases the complaints were upheld.  Would that ring any alarm bells with the Minister at this stage?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I possess general figures on the total number of complaints being made but I do not know whether they include informal complaints.  For example, 96 complaints of harassment and bullying were made in 2006 and the figure will be higher in 2007.  However, the number of complaints getting as far as the ombudsman is still quite small.  From that point of view, in the context of the overall situation it does not cause me any undue worry.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 11 together.The Defence Forces and the Department have taken a wide variety of initiatives and have devoted extensive resources to this issue since Dr. Eileen Doyle and the external advisory committee presented their original report, The Challenge of a Workplace, in March 2002.  This independent report addressed the entire range of interpersonal issues within the Defence Forces.  Its contents and recommendations were accepted in full.An independent monitoring group was established in May 2002 to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the original Doyle report.  The independent monitoring group's own progress report, Response to the Challenge of a Workplace, which was launched by my predecessor, former Deputy Michael Smith, on 24 September 2004, is available on the Defence Forces website and describes in great detail the very significant progress achieved since the publication of the original Doyle report in 2002.An internal military steering group, chaired by the Assistant Chief of Staff and comprising the director of administration, director of human resources management and director of Defence Forces training, oversees the implementation of all the recommendations of Response to the Challenge of a Workplace.The ongoing implementation of the recommendations of the Doyle report has been one of the highest priorities for the Defence Forces and the Department since its publication.  Policies on equality, dignity and bullying are being constantly communicated to all ranks.  I am satisfied that the military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing the matter in a continuing and proactive manner through educational modules on interpersonal relationships which, as I stated earlier, are now embedded in career courses for all ranks.The independent monitoring group recommended that a professional review of progress within the Defence Forces should take place in 2007 and that it should be published.  The report also suggested that a group representative of military management, PDFORRA, RACO, the Department of Defence and external expertise should conduct such a review.I agree there should be a review of progress.  I can confirm that my Department is currently concentrating on the terms of reference for such a review.  The next phase, involving the key players, will be launched shortly.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I understand it is the target of the Minister and the Chief of Staff to increase the percentage of females in the Army from 5% to 10%.  Has the new minimum height regulation that was introduced in September 2006 had any effect on the number of females seeking to join the Army?  In general terms, what timeframe does the Minister believe is realistic to achieve his target of 10% female participation in the Army?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I do not wish to mention timeframes which I will subsequently be asked about in the House.  There are some indications the change in the height requirements is having a beneficial effect.  As a result of this change, slightly more than 90% of the female population is now eligible to join the Army.  That is an increase from the previous level of 65%.  Based on research carried out, we will be putting in place a number of other measures.  An advertising campaign will be involved, as will visits to schools etc.  It is my objective to reach the 10% target I have set as quickly as possible.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	252	As I pointed out previously on Priority Questions, the Minister has already missed the deadline set in the first timeframe to set up the review group.  I hope that will not still be the case at the end of October.Do regular meetings take place between the instructors in all the training centres to help to develop the skills and professionalism of instructors?  Who is instructing the instructors?  Can the Minister indicate how many instructors are currently in place and whether it is intended to increase their number to ensure people are available at all times in the workplace to implement the recommendations?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	253	The deadline has been missed by a couple of months.  I am sorry but this is not a major crisis.  What is important is that the recommendations of the Dáil committee are being put in place and are being implemented.  I am sure the report will show that.I am satisfied the Army will inform me if difficulties arise on the training side in terms of the number of instructors or in regard to other issues.  I have had no such complaints.  I do not know how many instructors are currently in place but I will find out for Deputy Deenihan.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	254	In the Minister's view, is there any substance to the allegations made by the president of PDFORRA in terms of soldiers who put their heads above the parapet by becoming officials of PDFORRA, being denied career opportunities, including overseas service, and frequently having charges brought against them that are subsequently dropped?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I wish PDFORRA would bring these allegations to my attention.  I read about this in the newspaper but even though I frequently meet individual members of PDFORRA — I will meet them at the national conference next week — nobody has brought this matter directly to my attention.  I say that as a matter of certainty.  I see no evidence of it.  If something like that is happening, there are plenty of redress mechanisms within the Army, up to and including a statutorily independent ombudsman.If people want to make a complaint there is a whole raft of internal mechanisms available rather than for them to complain in the manner outlined by the Deputy.  I will meet PDFORRA next week in a formal capacity and if anybody wishes to bring any matter to my attention, he or she may do so in either a formal or informal way at a meeting.  They are more than welcome to do this.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	256	An allegation is contained in this article that the disciplinary system is used against members of PDFORRA.  The implication appears to be that it is difficult to pursue that kind of complaint.  I take it from what the Minister said that no formal complaints have reached him and that, equally, he is not aware of any evidence that would sustain or substantiate these allegations.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	257	That is absolutely correct.  This has never been brought directly to my attention.  I would remember if it had been.  I have no evidence to sustain this allegation.  The only way one could possibly test it, as it were, would be to go through the list of people against whom disciplinary action was taken and see whether an undue proportion of them are actively involved with PDFORRA.As far as I know, there are many people in the Army who want to be involved in the Army trade union, PDFORRA.  There is no shortage of people willing to join it or become actively involved in it.  There is robust competition for places every year when the AGM comes around.  I have no evidence they are being singled out in any way.We have now allocated approximately 235 people within the Army to act as direct contact persons, DCPs, to whom people can go if they have a complaint.  That is another form of representation.  We set out to have that many DCPs.  The Army high command informed me there was no difficulty in recruiting personnel who were able, willing and ready to serve in that capacity.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	258	During the lifetime of the 29th Dáil, an all-party Oireachtas consultation group was established for the official preparations for the re-instatement of the traditional military parade at Easter and the commemorative programme to be put in place in coming years for the centenary of the Easter Rising.  The group met in November 2006 and March 2007.I expect invitations will issue soon to all party leaders to once again nominate spokespersons to serve on a successor group during this Dáil.  In addition to their consideration of the commemorative initiatives in 2006 and 2007, members of the previous consultation group were invited to consider making nominations to an expert working group that would provide specialist and academic advice on the historic events and the commemorative proposals.  This matter was left in abeyance with the dissolution of the Dáil but it is hoped to resume this discussion following the formation of a new Oireachtas group.Officials of my Department and officers of the Defence Forces are members of an interdepartmental committee, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach.  This committee was originally tasked with the commemorative programme for the 90th anniversary of the Rising and the annual commemorations appropriate for the years until the centenary.  The committee has not met since the completion of the commemoration and parade in April 2007.  I envisage that the committee will soon commence the preparation and planning in respect of Easter 2008.A number of long-term projects are currently being pursued as part of the centenary commemorations.  The initiative to bring into the public domain the remaining military history archives of the Defence Forces is being progressed.  My Department will shortly be placing an advertisement in the national press with regard to the recruitment of archival assistants for this project.The conservation work on the Asgard is continuing at the National Museum Collins Barracks with a view to completion in 2009.  I was particularly satisfied to note earlier this year the generous donation to the National Museum of the letter written to General Maxwell by Pádraig MacPiarais prior to his execution.I thank the members of the Oireachtas consultation group for the work done to date on the commemorations and their consideration of the centenary programme.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I very much welcome the opening to the public of the military archive.  If the commemoration in 2016 is focused mainly on military parades and so on, would that be the best monument to the men and women of 1916 and what they stood for?  I put it to the Minister that to have social objectives achieved before 2016 would be a much more fitting monument to the people of 1916.  They took a military road because they wanted to achieve something — like the founder of my party, they want to change what is to what ought to be.As an example, the Government has a target in Towards 2016 to reduce the rate of illiteracy to one in six.  How much of a monument is that to the people of 1916?  Would it not be preferable if a programme were embarked upon, in conjunction with the other matters, to tackle issues such as the 30% rate of illiteracy in some schools, as well as problems with numeracy and homelessness?  It would be best if these social problems were tackled in a focused and effective way so we would have an achievement that would really be a great tribute to those who made that huge sacrifice almost a century ago.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I agree it should not be an exclusively or even predominantly military occasion.  That was the case for the 90th anniversary but we were reviving the celebration after it had lapsed for a number of years due to events in Northern Ireland and so on.  I am strongly of that view, as was the previous Oireachtas consultation group, and I am sure the same view will be reflected by the new group.We are appointing an expert committee to come up with ideas.  It will be specifically tasked to develop ideas on how we should commemorate our social, economic and cultural progress.  It will be a wide-ranging commemoration and while a military parade will be a part of it, it will not be central or predominant.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The Minister will agree that the 90th anniversary commemoration was very successful and that the people were very impressed with what they saw.  It was the first time many people actually saw our military in action in a major way and it gave out a very positive message, despite the military nature of the commemoration.In so far as is possible, our military should be seen and we should be proud of their good discipline and organisation.  Whenever an occasion arises to which the military can contribute, it should be encouraged to do so.  Óglaigh na hÉireann is the legitimate Irish Army as defined by the Constitution.  It is important it should be part of commemorating the Easter Rising, rather than any other so-called armies in this country.  I would be well disposed to having the Army and the military more involved in commemorating events and more in public view than they have been.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I agree that the 90th anniversary commemoration was extremely successful.  I appreciate the Deputy's kind remarks about the military, which I will communicate to the Chief of Staff.It is not that we are ashamed of our military; we are very proud of them.  My point to Deputy O'Shea is that it will be a wide-ranging commemoration, which will commemorate far more than the fact we have an established, well respected standing Army which has done tremendous work abroad.  However, as well as commemorating matters such as our cultural, economic and social progress, we will also take the opportunity to showcase our military.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	263	Does the Minister agree that if the all-party consultation group is to suggest social objectives that would be put in place to honour the men and women of 1916, this needs to be done quickly?  Whatever additional resources or personnel are needed to achieve those objectives, the process must start now because to overcome social problems takes time.  We have a reasonable timescale but there is no time to waste.  Does the Minister agree it is important to establish the new all-party consultation group quickly and impose a time limit for the group to return with recommendations so the work can begin?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I agree the consultation group should be established shortly.  I will arrange for invitations to be issued to the various party leaders.  My view, for what it is worth, is that we should not confine the group to members of established parties and that we should get the widest range of opinion and perhaps invite one or two non-party members.  I am in the hands of the committee.  Whatever it collectively wants to do, I will make sure is carried into effect.With regard to setting timetables, the Deputy is correct that while we have plenty of time, it is just one or two Dáil terms so we might as well get down to it as soon as possible.  Invitations will issue to the various party leaders shortly.  I would encourage future members of the Oireachtas consultation group to do what their predecessors did not do despite repeated requests, namely, to nominate academic and other specialists and experts to the group, who will then come up with concrete recommendations.  I found it difficult — not through any lack of effort on my part — to get personnel nominated to serve on that group.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 48 together.The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements.  In the 2000 White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that the Naval Service would be based on an eight-ship flotilla and committed to a modernisation and replacement strategy to maximise the operational capacity of those eight vessels consistent with the roles assigned to the Naval Service.The White Paper specifically provides that "new vessels will be brought on stream to replace older ones as these fall due for replacement".  Naval Service vessels are replaced when they have come to the end of their useful life, which is normally approximately 30 years.  Three ships will fall due for replacement over the next three to five years, namely, LE Emer, commissioned in 1978, LE Aoife, commissioned in 1979 and LE Aisling, commissioned in 1980.Following a detailed examination of the needs of the Naval Service, a vessel replacement strategy has been put in place to cover the period up to 2012.  The vessel replacement strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a very high level.Following Government approval in July 2007 to go to tender, notice of a competition for the purchase of replacement vessels for the Naval Service was placed in the Official Journal of the European Union on 24 August 2007.  The competition is for the purchase of two offshore patrol vessels, with an option on a third, and one extended patrol vessel, with an option on a second.  The options provide an effective value-for-money opportunity, at locked in prices, to provide replacements for Naval Service vessels which will reach the end of their service life in the years immediately following the current replacement programme.  The competition uses a restricted procedure which comprises two stages — stage one, a request for proposals, and stage two, an invitation to tender.The closing date for stage one is 26 October next.  Following evaluation of proposals a detailed specification will issue to those invited to participate in stage two.  The evaluation of stage one proposals and the preparation of the detailed specification for stage two will be carried out between November 2007 and April 2008.  Depending on the quality of the proposals received, a maximum of seven companies will be invited to tender.  This invitation to tender is expected to issue in May 2008, with tenders due in July or August.  Following detailed tender evaluation, it is intended to award a contract in late 2008.The decision to proceed with the final award of contract to purchase the vessels will be subject to Government approval and agreement on funding, the full requirement for which will not be known until the tender competition has concluded.  However, it is expected that the cost of the three new ships will be of the order of €180 million.  The funding arrangements for this will be a matter for further consideration, in consultation with my colleague. the Minister for Finance, in the context of the Estimates process.It is expected that the vessels will be delivered on a phased basis between 2010 and 2012.  The Government is committed to continuous investment in the equipment needs of the Naval Service to enable it to carry out the roles assigned to it.  The most recent ships purchased for the Naval Service were the LE  Róisín commissioned in 1999 and the LE Niamh commissioned in 2001.  The total cost of the two ships was approximately €50 million.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	266	Is it intended to procure a vessel that will be 120 m in length, will be able to provide humanitarian relief and troop support in any part of the world and will be designed for fishery protection purposes?  In the event that the Department proceeds to procure three ships, is it correct that the other two vessels will be approximately 80 m in length?Unfortunately, the Naval Service will need to assume a much greater role in intercepting drugs being smuggled into Ireland.  Have factors such as speed and the type of search equipment required to perform this function been taken into consideration in determining the type of naval vessel to be procured?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	267	The two or possibly three offshore patrol vessels will be 80m to 90min length.  The extended patrol vessel — wemay exercise an option to procure two such vessels — will be between 130m and 140m.These vessels will be able to perform the tasks to which the Deputy referred, including the provision of humanitarian relief.  However, we must work out precisely what functions they will perform.Drug interdiction, one of the functions of the Naval Service, has been taken into account.  The prospect of increasingly adverse weather conditions was also considered.  Reports from the Meteorological Office and projections for the future indicate that at least one extended vessel would be required to enable the Naval Service to properly perform its functions.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Will the 2008 Estimates make provision for three new vessels?  Is the Minister satisfied that the Naval Service is capable of properly policing the coastline with its current complement of ships, especially in terms of drug interception tasks?  I understand the Naval Service will only intercept a vessel if directed to do so as part of a security operation and does not actively seek to intercept ships.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The replacement vessels will be considered as part of the 2008 Estimates.  In July this year, the Government authorised me to issue an invitation to tender.  This decision is indicative of the Government's adherence to its promise in the White Paper to maintain an eight-ship flotilla.Policing the coastline is a difficult job and I wish we had three or four times more ships to perform this task.  Unfortunately, large amounts of drugs enter Europe from the Caribbean and further afield, some of which are landed in Ireland, with the bulk being landed in Portugal and Spain.  The naval protection systems in the Iberian countries and the United States have not proved effective in halting the flow of drugs.  I do not know of a country with a coastline which has sufficient security to guarantee that drugs will not enter the jurisdiction.  The Government is committed to maintaining a flotilla of at least eight ships and carrying out a substantial programme of refurbishment to ensure that ships are operational during their lifetime.  We are examining the possibility of acquiring larger ships and better arming new ships to ensure they can do their job in this regard.As the Naval Service intercepts vessels as part of a joint operation with the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise, it must receive direction.  I understand the customs authorities are examining how this approach works in practice.  It is possible that a revision of procedures will take place in the near future.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	270	I am aware of the issues raised by the Ombudsman for Children relating to the optional protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts.  The optional protocol was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in May 2000.  Ireland signed the optional protocol on 7 September 2000 and ratified the instrument on 18 November 2002.  In doing this, Ireland agreed to take all feasible measures to ensure that members of the armed forces who have not attained 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities.  Ireland is fully compliant with the optional protocol.All military personnel who are under 18 years of age are specifically precluded from any service abroad under the terms of the policy of the Defence Forces, as enunciated in Defence Forces administrative instructions.  The existing measures are fully effective.  The position is that members of the Defence Forces must be over 18 years of age before they are deployed abroad on peace support operations.The only theoretical circumstance in which a person who has not attained the age of 18 years could be exposed to hostilities would be where hostilities had broken out and were occurring within the State.  In practical terms, the only foreseeable circumstances where such an eventuality could possibly occur would be an actual armed attack on a military barracks or during the course of the military providing aid to the civil power.  An example of the latter would be the provision of armed military back up by the Army to the Garda where the police are escorting cash en route to banks or escorting certain categories of prisoner from prison to court, etc.  However, as general service enlistment is immediately followed by a basic training period of several months before the recruit is passed out as an active member of the Permanent Defence Force, there is no real possibility that a person who has not attained the age of 18 years could be exposed to any hostile incident.As regards the Reserve Defence Force, there are about 350 or so serving members of the Reserve Defence Force aged 17 years.  Members of the Reserve are not accepted as being trained to the minimum standard required for Reserve operations until they have completed their three star private course which is conducted in the second year of service.  Therefore, as 17 years is the minimum age for Reserve Defence Force entry, Reserve entrants are not eligible for Reserve operations until they are at least of age 18 years.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I understand that a Government position paper states that the possibility of a member of the Defence Forces aged under 18 years being involved in a hostile incident is virtually negligible.  The word "virtually" does not completely preclude this possibility.  The Minister appears to be completely satisfied that no member of the Defence Forces aged under 18 years will be involved in pursuing the types of duties he described.  Will he provide an absolute guarantee in that regard?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I do so gladly.  As I indicated, the regulations prohibit members of the Defence Forces being sent abroad until after their 18th birthday.  There is a low theoretical possibility that a person aged under 18 years could be involved in hostilities here.  I assure the House that, having discussed this matter with the Chief of Staff when the question was submitted, I have been assured that there is no question of any member of the Defence Forces aged under 18 years ever being exposed to hostile action.  The reason recruitment commences at 17 years is to enable the Army to explain the benefits of joining the Defence Forces to those completing the leaving certificate examination.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I thank the Minister for his categorical assurance, which puts the issue to rest.Question No. 11 answered with QuestionNo. 7.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 27 together.The White Paper on Defence 2000 and the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan of 2002 set out the blueprint for the RDF with an implementation plan extending to 2009.  The implementation plan is being rolled out on a phased basis and there has been significant progress in implementing its detailed recommendations, such as a new organisational structure implemented with effect from October 2005 and major improvements in clothing, equipment, training and resourcing.  The RDF is now structured along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force, namely, three brigades and the RDF training centre.The introduction of the integrated element of the reserve is being addressed in the current year as a pilot exercise across all three brigades.  The director of Defence Forces training has issued a comprehensive range of syllabi providing for training of the integrated reserve.  The outputs from the pilot exercises are currently being reviewed by the military.  This will provide the necessary information to plan for the future development of the integration process.The numbers participating in the pilot integration training schemes are set out in the form of the following tabular statement.  A total of 180 personnel have completed the training to date.  While the numbers participating in the integrated reserve have been less than anticipated, I am satisfied that the pilot project marks a significant step forward in implementing the plan.  The integration project will be reviewed in the light of experience this year with a view to improved participation in subsequent years.The breakdown by rank of the establishment for the non-integrated reserve and the number of reservists in each rank who attended annual camp up to 30 September 2007 are presented in the following tabular statements.  A total of 4,731 reservists attended camp representing approximately 74,743 man days.  I am pleased to inform the House that I have approved a publicity and awareness campaign to promote recruitment to the RDF in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government.  This will commence early in 2008.  I am pleased that the implementation plan is progressing well.  My Department will continue to monitor progress in the remaining period of the plan.FormationNumbers Completed training2 E Bde2 Officers, 21 NCOs, 18 Ptes = 411 S Bde5 Officers, 39 NCOs, 23 Ptes = 674 W Bde7 Officers, 38 NCOs, 27 Ptes = 72Total14 Officers, 98 NCOs, 68 Ptes = 180RankMan DaysNumbersSgt Major37317B.Q.M.S.47922Coy.

How successful is integration and can the difficulties be resolved?  Should more people be volunteering for integration from the first line reserve rather than the second line because the first line, comprising former members of the PDF, has been trained and would be more ready for integration than the second line?  What target has the Minister set for numbers in the integrated reserve?  Does he hope to see many of its members serving abroad, for example?  Have any served abroad to date or are there plans for them to serve in future missions?

#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	277	Regarding the 4,000 people going to camp this year and the expenditure incurred by the RDF, has the Minister plans for the RDF's functions?  Given the drugs floating in the sea off west Cork and Kerry, would he take on board the idea that the RDF could act as a coastal watch?  Does the Minister agree that members of the RDF are anxious to serve and perform roles other than parading and training?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The Deputies raised a number of issues.  As recommended in the White Paper, much work has been done to substantially reorganise the reserve, which now mirrors the structure of the PDF.  Extra money has been spent on clothing, training, updating equipment, etc.  Now that those changes have been made, the process of integration will begin.The take-up in the pilot programme is disappointing and a long way short of the target, but I hope matters will improve next year.  I agree that there are difficulties, but the military assures me that they can be resolved.  It is evaluating the experience of the people who took part in the pilot project and working out ways around the difficulties.  Integration is voluntary and reservists cannot be forced into becoming part of the integrated reserve.  The Army will develop a number of ideas to improve the situation next year.We are working towards giving the reserve, in particular the integrated reserve, new functions.  Deputy Stanton's idea is a good one and I will discuss it with the appropriate authorities.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.
#TomMcEllistrimFF	unknown-#TomMcEllistrimFF-party	unknown-#TomMcEllistrimFF-dob	unknown-#TomMcEllistrimFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I call on the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to ensure that the funding application for a community enterprise centre in Farranfore be given priority in the interests of balanced regional development.Farranfore is unique in that it is the only location in the country with access to an airport, national roads and a railway.  Kerry County Council has designated it as being crucial to the development of the Tralee-Killarney hub under the national spatial strategy, but it is a CLÁR area due to its depopulation since the foundation of the State.  Recently, a group of active stakeholders, including local community groups and the local development partnership with the support of the council, Kerry County Enterprise Board, Leader and many other actors, submitted an application for funding under the 2007 community enterprise scheme to Enterprise Ireland.  It is imperative that the funding be secured during this round, as the window of opportunity is open for development.  If the initiative gets support, it will be a catalyst for excellent enterprise development in County Kerry and the mid-Kerry area in particular.  At full capacity, the centre will generate more than 60 jobs on site.The initiative has the support of many local stakeholders, including the management of the airport, which has gone from strength to strength in recent years.  As part of a local twinning project that has received local government and EU support, business development associations in Brittany have been consulted with to develop international trade links.  Discussions to date have been positive in that regard.Many areas of Kerry have good histories in terms of enterprise development, but Farranfore and mid-Kerry do not.  Developing the facility in question would be timely.  If funding is secured from Enterprise Ireland, it will ensure the development of employment opportunities in that strategic location.The department of regional and urban planning at University College, Dublin, produced a comprehensive study on the period 2002 to 2022.  Consultants developed and recommended the concept of an economic and development triangle between Tralee, Killarney and Castleisland centred on Farranfore and mid-Kerry.  Quoting the economic spatial development perspective, the study claims that such a development centred on the Farranfore transportation hub would facilitate a more balanced system of urban-rural relationships utilising links between international, national, regional and local transport networks while promoting the role of gateway and hub towns.  The study's summary recommendations outlined the objective of developing Farranfore as an industrial hub for the region by capitalising on road, air, rail and telecommunications infrastructure.  The study recommended that the location and consequent advantages should be marketed as providing distinct advantages for businesses and industry.  Current enterprise space in Tralee and Killarney is at full occupancy.  While there is an adequate supply of large industrial units, especially in Tralee, there is a gap in facilities provision for companies seeking flexible space and the option of light industrial and, or, distribution centres.I was a member of the Kerry County Enterprise Board for five years from 1999 to 2004 while a member of Kerry County Council.  I am aware therefore of an obvious latent demand for space in the mid-Kerry area generally.  Given the number of inquiries to existing centres and the continued growth in requests for support from the enterprise board and other development agencies, there is a clear need to ensure the enterprise centre initiative receives as much support as possible at this stage.If and when new businesses locate in a facility, they will be given ongoing, positive support to help them grow and develop.  Already, a number of new and growing enterprises have expressed great interest in Farranfore as a location.  A great opportunity exists for all involved to demonstrate support for employment in the regions from Government and State agencies down to local level.  I urge the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to ensure in the interests of balanced regional development that the application for a community enterprise centre at Farranfore, County Kerry, is given due priority and consideration.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I thank Deputy McEllistrim for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I am well aware of his determination, commitment and support for the community enterprise centre at Farranfore, County Kerry.Enterprise Ireland is administering, under section 7 of the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998, a community-led enterprise support programme called the community enterprise centre scheme 2007.  I authorised the scheme some time ago.  Enterprise Ireland will work in close co-operation with FÁS, local authorities, county and city enterprise boards and county and city development boards, where relevant, to implement the initiative.  An additional CEC scheme is desirable on foot of the success of the previous schemes and the anticipated demand to establish new centres and expand existing ones.  I concur with much of what Deputy McEllistrim said in this context.  The availability of business space is a fundamental infrastructural requirement for businesses to establish and grow in any location.  Community enterprise centres provide space in a supportive environment for budding entrepreneurs and serve to help the development of entrepreneurship locally in urban and rural locations.Since 1989, Enterprise Ireland and its predecessors have administered four schemes supporting community enterprise centres.  A total of €44 million has been approved for 147 such projects nationally.  The last approvals were made in June 2006.  To date, 105 centres have been built and 32 are either under construction or have been recently approved.  In 2005, Enterprise Ireland carried out a survey of the 95 community enterprise centres then operating.  The top line results of the survey show a very positive use of the investment as reflected in occupancy rates, numbers employed and the number of manufacturing and traded service enterprises.  The survey revealed that the centres have been successful in achieving an average occupancy rate of 86% with over 840 businesses employing more than 3,800 people in the centres.  The survey also found that 15% of the tenants who responded were involved in export markets to some degree.Funding of €21 million will be provided over three years for the community enterprise scheme.  There will be a minimum of three calls for applications in the period 2007 to 2009.  Due to the limited funding available, applications will be competitive and it may not be possible to award aid to all eligible projects.  The selection of successful projects will be based solely on the ranking of the projects as set out in the community enterprise centre scheme outline.  The inclusion of a number of tranches in the scheme gives communities the opportunity to put together a strong plan or application.  Therefore, Enterprise Ireland strongly recommends that the fund be serialised into a number of calls for proposals and we scheduled three.Achieving balanced regional development is a key aim of the enterprise development agencies under the remit of my Department.  The scheme forms part of the regional strategy.  I appeal to the Deputy to work with his local community to ensure their submission is a good one.  It would be useful to examine previous successful community enterprise applications nationally in that context.  Partnership with local authorities is vital.  New job gains associated with Enterprise Ireland clients have been very strong in the regions.  In 1998, 62% of employment gains were in client companies located in all regions outside Dublin with this proportion climbing by 2006 to 68%.  Many of Ireland's high potential start-up companies and those involving research and development investment have originated at enterprise incubation facilities at enterprise centres.I appreciate the Deputy's concerns.  The closing date in respect of the last call for proposals was August 2007.  The assessment process is under way and the Farranfore application is being considered with all others.  A decision is expected shortly.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12720	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter.  The announcement by Amgen has come as a body-blow to the east Cork region.  The economic loss to Carrigtwohill and surrounding areas is unquantifiable.  I empathise with those people who have lost their jobs in the company.  While global corporate entities like Amgen are subject to the vagaries of international markets, the people of the region accepted in good faith statements made by the company in April that a delay of two years in the project would not amount to a complete cessation of it.  I put it to the Minister that a second announcement yesterday to the effect that the project is indefinitely postponed is nothing more than spin and a deliberate attempt to play down the decision not to proceed.  Anyone with common sense must conclude that two postponements in six months is tantamount to a cessation.The Government has serious questions to answer.  Questions arise as to whether Amgen or IDA Ireland is the beneficial owner of the site at which the project was to proceed.  We must also ask what will happen to the site in the event of a further postponement or acknowledgement of cessation.  The project was to be the mainstay of the region and Middleton, Youghal and other centres of population had placed their bets on it.  Many young people invested in housing in the region on foot of the promise of foreign direct investment by Amgen.  I put it to the Minister that we have been dealt a hammer blow and that people are extremely disappointed.  Expectation in this context has not been managed well by the Government, which now has a serious case to answer.  The Minister has a responsibility to deliver to the people of the region.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to speak on this matter.  An €800 million investment has been lost to Cork in particular and Munster and Ireland in general.  One of the largest factories ever to be established in Ireland seems now to be gone.  It is a disgrace, therefore, that we can only spend two and a half minutes talking about it in the House.  It is no wonder the House is being lampooned across the country when we are not allowed to talk about something as important as this for more than two and a half minutes.Deputy Ned O'Keeffe is suggesting the Government knew or should have known that this announcement would be made.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.  I would also like to know what will happen to the infrastructure.  The situation in the vicinity of the site is a mess with a 60 km/h speed limit on a main, arterial dual carriageway route.  It is dangerous and it should never have been permitted.  I want the Minister to indicate that the Government will ensure the necessary roadworks, which should have been completed years ago, will be carried out at the site.Will the Minister tell the House what will happen at the site now?  Will it be left to become a weed-grown eyesore at the side of the road?  What discussions will he enter into with Amgen?  Will the Government make available time to allow a proper debate on this most urgent, serious issue?  Does the Minister not agree that it is a disgrace to provide Opposition Deputies with only two and a half minutes each to speak?  After ten years as a Member, I am given two and a half minutes in which to raise the matter and I cannot even question the Minister on it.  It is no wonder the House is lampooned and laughed at across the country.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I welcome the opportunity to discuss this issue and to put on record the situation regarding Amgen, which involves no mystery or secrecy whatsoever.  In fact, I contacted Deputies yesterday to inform them in advance that Amgen would make a public announcement to the workforce at 2 p.m.  We all share the fundamental objective of wanting to bring investment into the country and we work through IDA Ireland to attract that investment.  We do not control the boardrooms of the companies concerned or how events play out among regulatory authorities in the United States.  We do everything we can to advance employment in the interest of the people of this country.  That reality must be taken on board.I am deeply disappointed by the announcement by Amgen that it is postponing its planned investment in the plant at Carrigtwohill, County Cork, because my Department and the IDA put a lot of work into the matter.  Ireland won this project from the largest biotechnology company in the world in the face of strong competition from Singapore and Switzerland.  Amgen received planning permission from Cork County Council in September 2006 for site development and ancillary road works on a significant and expensive application.  These activities commenced in November 2006.The company has already invested over $100 million in site acquisition, conceptual design and site clearance and preparation.  The decision by Amgen does not reflect in any way on the business environment here.  Amgen has been laudatory of the responsiveness of all the public authorities in Ireland, including county councils, IDA Ireland and the Government.  The decision has been made as a result of a review of its own operations and is based purely on developments related to the company's global business.  It is in no way related to the economic or competitive environment in Ireland.This decision follows from a substantial drop in its share price.  The company commenced a global production capacity review in August 2007 which resulted in the announcement of job cuts and the closure of some facilities including manufacturing.  Following a further assessment of manufacturing capacity by the company, IDA Ireland and I learned only yesterday that Amgen has decided to indefinitely postpone its planned design and build of its bulk manufacturing facility in County Cork.  The decision was communicated directly to us by Amgen through a conference call.  We had already arranged to meet Amgen within the next fortnight but there was no anticipation of the decision.  With the IDA, we go on various trade missions and meet a range of companies.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	286	We will be making a week-long trip to the west coast, where we will meet a number of companies.  This decision is disappointing for the region and the country, and particularly for the 79 staff directly affected.  I am conscious that many of the employees left good jobs to work with Amgen because the company was seen as a significant opportunity for career advancement.Amgen has informed us that it wants to maintain ownership of the site.  We were not disappointed the company articulated that position because this is a volatile sector with a cyclical nature.  In terms of the site issues raised by Deputy Stanton, consultations are ongoing between the county council and the company.  We will tease out that issue further in our forthcoming meetings with Amgen.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	294	People have asked about the medium and long term.  I was trying to respond to the issues raised by Deputy Stanton and others and I am conscious that a significant investment has been made in infrastructure.  The east County Cork region has been identified as an area of significant growth and the site has significant utilities attached to it, so it clearly has the potential to house a similar type of enterprise.Ireland continues to win substantial pharmaceutical and bio-pharmaceutical investments.  There are currently 133 IDA supported enterprises in Cork city and county.  Since 2002, five IDA assisted life sciences companies have invested in Carrigtwohill and have increased their employment there from 943 to 1726.  This net increase of 783 jobs in Carrigtwohill is very significant and underlines the potential of the area for further job creation.Recent announcements in Cork include IBM, GSK, Allen Vanguard, VMware, Eli Lilly and PepsiCo, Blizzard Entertainment, Apex Funds and SolarWinds.  Direct employment in IDA supported companies in Cork city and county has grown from 12,449 in 1997 to 19,977 in 2006.  That is the positive backdrop to the situation in terms of inward investment.  We have more work to do and I am aware people want increased investment.  Clearly, people are disappointed as a result of the Amgen decision.  I appreciate the articulation of that concern by the Deputies representing the people of the area.  We will do everything we can to win further investment.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	295	The Minister might provide Government time next week for a debate on the issue.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	296	The self-styled Irish Anti-War Movement, which is involved in the troops out of Shannon campaign, is scheduled to hold what it describes as an international anti-war conference in Dublin on Saturday, 13 October.  According to the pamphlet published to advertise the conference, one of the objectives of the organisations is:how we can build the movement of resistance to war and occupation over the coming months, including the threat of attack on Iran.  Unity of the anti war movement across organisational and territorial boundaries and solidarity with those who fight the illegal occupation of their country is what we seek.For a group which calls itself an anti-war movement, it has invited some curious people to its conference.  It is worth noting one particular individual, Ibrahim Mussawi, who is associated with the Hizbollah run Al-Manar television station in Beirut.  The other interesting person among the invitees is a member of the Al-Sadr group, which is directly involved in much of the murder, bombing and mayhem taking place in Baghdad and other parts of Iraq.I raise this issue because it is important that well intentioned members of the public and the Members of this House are not misled into believing the agenda of this movement is worth following.  This is not a peace organisation.  The persons invited to the conference starkly illustrate its distorted perspective on international politics.  It is not so much an anti-war movement as a strident anti-American one.  Rather than an organisation which wishes to see the peaceful resolution of conflicts around the world through discussion and compromise, it is a collection of misty-eyed old Soviet Union sympathisers who have now befriended Islamic fundamentalists.Al-Manar is basically a Hizbollah propaganda television station, spouting anti-American and anti-Semitic diatribes on a regular basis.  The type of broadcast for which it has been responsible resulted in 2005 in a call by the European Parliament for Hizbollah to be labelled a terrorist organisation.  France closed down Al-Manar channel following a decision by the country's highest administrative court, the Council of State.  The court ruled the station had violated France's laws against incitement and was endangering public order.  The United States has long labelled Hizbollah as a terrorist organisation and has since taken the unique step of labelling a television station as a terrorist organisation.Hizbollah has been opposed to every reasonable attempt to resolve the Middle East conflicts between Israel and Arab states and Israelis and Palestinians through peace processes.  It has opposed every reasonable attempt to put in place an effective and workable peace process and has been involved in kidnappings, bombings, murder and mayhem.  It is essentially an Iranian and Syrian proxy group intent on sabotaging all attempts to bring about a peaceful resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict which fall short of the total destruction of the Israeli State.In violation of an existing United Nations resolution, a very significant amount of armaments are being shipped back into southern Lebanon, paid for by the Iranians with Syrian assistance, for the benefit of Hizbollah.  Essentially, a Syrian proxy has done everything possible to destabilise the integrity and political democracy of Lebanon.It is extraordinary that a member of a group such as Hizbollah should address a meeting designed to oppose occupations, as the raison d’être of that group is to support the Syrian occupation of Lebanon.  Most of the violence Hizbollah has been responsible for since the Syrians left Lebanon has been designed to encourage them to re-occupy the country.  I ask the Minister not to grant a visa to this individual to address a meeting in this State and put down a marker that it is unacceptable for people representing terrorist organisations to have a platform here.I think it is a disgrace that some Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including a member of a party that is in Government, will, according to the leaflet published by the Irish Anti-War Movement, share a platform with a member of Hizbollah at this meeting.  If we have no other duty, Members of this House must uphold democracy and oppose terrorism.  In the context of the tragedies that have befallen the state of Lebanon we have a duty to ensure that we do not give succour to groups or individuals intent on destabilising Lebanese democracy and which are committed to having Syria occupy the country again.I welcome the establishment of the conflict resolution section within the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It should help us examine how we approach conflicts and our treatment of those who wish to be guests in our country but are resolutely opposed to reasonable initiatives seeking to solve a major problem in the Middle East.  The Israeli-Palestinian conflict must be addressed in a constructive way.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I am, of course, very conscious that the matter raised by Deputy Shatter gives rise to serious issues.  On the one hand we all have the responsibility to ensure that those freedoms which we cherish so dearly, such as the right to peaceful assembly and the right to voice one's opinions, are upheld.  These rights must undoubtedly be accompanied by a corresponding obligation to respect the rights of others who hold a contrary view.  I would add, and I say this without in any way wanting to prejudge consideration of any application, that in circumstances where the State uses its discretion to allow an individual to enter the State there should be no abuse of this privilege.In addition to the rights and obligations I have already mentioned I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, have additional obligations, not least the obligation to protect the citizens of this State.  Therefore, in deciding on any application for a visa to enter the State I will take into account various factors, such as concerns about national security or danger to individuals, before making a final decision.  Naturally I will also consult with the Garda Síochána before arriving at a final determination in any such case.The Deputy will appreciate that it would not be consistent with the legal duties I have with regard to deciding on visa applications made by individuals to debate the merits or otherwise of particular cases across the floor of this House.  I am not in any way diminishing any of the concerns expressed by Deputy Shatter and I assure him any decision I reach will be based on my discharging my responsibilities in line with legal requirements and taking into account all the factors to which I must have regard.I can also say that, while on one hand I have no desire to stifle public debate on the war on Iraq or any other matter, I must also have due regard to the requirements of public order in its widest sense.  Inevitably conflicting considerations can arise in dealing with issues such as these.  I again assure the Deputy I will balance them in accordance with the law and in the overall public interest.The fundamental purpose of immigration laws generally, of which the visa system is a part, is to regulate and control the entry of non-nationals to the jurisdiction.  There is international recognition that regulation, in accordance with law, is necessary to achieve a number of important objectives in the interests of the common good.  These include, for example, ensuring that the economy is not undermined by unsustainable migration flows, ensuring that persons who are permitted to enter the State with stated objectives actually pursue those objectives, and the prevention of abuse by criminal or terrorist elements.The purpose of the visa system is to authenticate potential travellers prior to their departure for the State with a view to obviating difficulties that arise when a person arrives in the State whose entry has to be refused on legal grounds.  Credibility is central to the visa determination process.  In assessing visa applications, the visa officer will consider a number of factors including the following: whether the applicant's stated purpose for the visit is the real purpose of the visit; whether the applicant is likely to overstay the length of time applied for; whether the applicant is likely to breach the conditions of the visa; whether the applicant is likely to breach the common travel area without an appropriate UK entry visa; whether the applicant is in a position to fully support himself or herself without any recourse to public funds or resources; and whether the person is likely to present a threat to the public order or security of the State.  Any previous immigration history, either positive or negative, of the applicant will have a bearing on the decision.I am informed that the person in question was invited to come to Ireland by the Irish Anti-War Movement to participate in a debate organised by that movement.  The visa application is currently under consideration and no decision has been made.

Residents in Drynam Hall in Kinsealy were informed by Menolly Homes that many households would have to be rehoused for up to ten or 12 weeks while the ground floor of homes with a high content of pyrite infill were excavated and removed down to a depth of 3 m.A few weeks later my new constituents in Menolly Homes developments at The Coast estate in Baldoyle and in Beauparc, Clongriffin were devastated to learn that their homes would also have to be tested to discover if a similar problem was emerging from flooring infill also used at those locations.  Since then I have had a steady stream of telephone calls and e-mails from other areas of north Dublin and Meath from householders who are intensely anxious to know if a defective underfloor infill was also used in their estates.Media reports indicate that at least eight builders other than Menolly Homes have reported the problem to Homebond and that houses at the vast Castlecurragh Estate in Dublin 15 built by Shannon Homes have also tested positive for a high pyrite infill content.  At a recent meeting of the North Fringe Forum, a consultative group on the huge urban region being built from Baldoyle to Dublin Airport, the unfolding construction problem was described as a catastrophe.  Young householders and mortgage payers are dismayed at this incredible development and there is extreme anxiety at the reconstruction and insurance implications of the news from Menollys.Pyrite or iron pyrite was formerly known as "fool's gold" because of its appearance and is an iron sulphide which expands if it is exposed to air or water.  It reacts with oxygen and water to form sulphuric acid.  I was informed in July that the quarry which supplied the defective infill is located near Ballycoolin in Dublin 15 and is owned by the Irish Asphalt division of the Lagan Group.I have learned that between early 2003 and February 2007, approximately 2 million tonnes of infill stone was produced by this suspect quarry with a high pyrite content of 1% to 3%.  Yet due to the total inaction of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his Department, only 100,000 tonnes, or 5%, has so far been traced, to the Menolly sites.  It has been put to me that the other defective infill was used in perhaps thousands of new homes in north and west Dublin, Meath and Leinster.  It is alleged that this infill was also used in many key infrastructural projects and it is known, for example, that the Lagan Construction Group was involved in the construction of projects like the Dublin Port tunnel.  I am also informed that at least three other quarries in the Leinster region have a high pyrite content.I reported to the 29th Dáil that the Dublin-Fingal north fringe is facing many key infrastructural deficiencies including a lack of public transport, schools, health centres, child care and youth facilities and Garda stations due to terrible developer-led planning aided and abetted by successive Fianna Fáil-PD Governments.  The last thing that the area needed was this appalling news about pyrite infill.  In the many contacts I have had with the Department, with city manager, John Tierney, and county manager, David O'Connor, on this matter, I am repeatedly told that the implementation of the building regulations is "largely self-regulatory."  Likewise the invigilation of planning permissions, often for vast new urban projects, is paltry or non-existent.I now call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Fingal and Dublin county managers to address their responsibilities which they have shamefully shirked in the past.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, must immediately establish a ministerial task force with the Fingal County and Dublin city managers to, first, carry out a full traceability audit of all building sites supplied by the Irish Asphalt quarry near Blanchardstown; second, investigate the location of any other quarries with a high pyrite content and arrange a traceability audit of each of them; third, in conjunction with the National Standards Authority for Ireland set up a national pyrite investigation and monitoring agency to guarantee the handback of fully repaired and rebuilt homes to householders; and, fourth, liaise closely with the governments of Quebec and Ontario in Canada which have faced a similar pyrite disaster and have developed protocols for compulsory chemical analysis of all construction infill and overseen appropriate compensation mechanisms for affected householders and public bodies.  On the last request I refer the Minister to the valuable publication, Pyrite and Your Home by the Association Des Consommateurs Pour La Qualite Dans La Construction in Quebec.   Hundreds of my constituents and perhaps thousands of others living in newly built estates and people who have built large infrastructural projects want the Minister to restore the status quo, to ensure houses and infrastructural projects are rebuilt if necessary and to ensure people are fully compensated, not just for the damage done to properties for which they are paying through the nose, but for the significant inconvenience and stress caused to them.  I urge the Minister to take immediate action on the matter.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this matter and assure him no discourtesy was intended.Pyrite is a mineral found in broken stone that oxidizes upon contact with moisture and oxygen to produce sulphuric acid.  The sulphuric acid causes the broken stone to swell, which in turn causes the floor slabs in buildings to lift and crack.  Laboratory tests have found that pyrite exists in the infill stone material used beneath the houses in a number of housing estates in the Dublin-North fringe.  This mineral has the effect of making the infill stone defective.I understand from Fingal County Council that the builders or developers of the houses in question have undertaken tests and other investigations to establish the extent of the houses affected.  I further understand that HomeBond, the national house building guarantee company, a private company which provides a ten year structural guarantee for new houses, of which the builders concerned are members, have also carried out investigations.The national building regulations set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings, including houses, and extensions to and material alterations of existing buildings.  The related technical guidance documents, TGDs, provide technical guidance on how to comply with the regulations.For example, Part C and TGD-C set the legal requirements and technical guidance for site preparation and resistance to moisture.  Regulation C3 stipulates:The floors, walls and roof of a building shall be so designed and constructed as to prevent the passage of moisture to the inside of the building or damage to the fabric of the building.TGD-C also requires:The hardcore bed should be at least 150 mm thick and should be of broken stones, broken brick or similar suitable material well compacted and clean and free from matter liable to cause damage to the concrete.Under the provisions of the Building Control Act 1990, responsibility for compliance with the building regulations rests with the builder and the owner of a building.Enforcement is a matter for the local building control authorities which are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, when considered necessary.  In this regard, I understand that the local building control authority, Fingal County Council, has been in direct contact with the builders and the quarry concerned to ascertain the full extent of the problem and to ensure there is no further use of this material for house building.Having consulted the statutory building regulations advisory body on the matter, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, on 16 August 2007, issued a circular letter, BC 6/2007, to each county manager and local building control authority with a view to bringing the issue to their notice and requesting their co-operation in the enforcement of the relevant requirements.  This circular letter also brings to their attention a notice issued by Fingal County Council on 26 July 2007 on the matter.I also understand that the National Standards Authority of Ireland is giving urgent consideration to publication of additional guidance on the issue of pyrite.  This will, by way of a new national standard, amend an existing standard or a standard recommendation, whichever is considered most appropriate.  It is my intention to adopt any recommendation of the NSAI in this regard, when available, in the relevant technical guidance document to the building regulations.The Deputy suggested that a ministerial task force be set up to carry out a full traceability audit and establish a national pyrite investigation and monitoring agency.  The actions I have outlined are designed to avoid any recurrence of the problem which has arisen in Fingal.  Compensation is a matter between a homeowner, the relevant developer and the builder's insurer, whether that is HomeBond or another insurer.  Consequently, the Minister has no function in this regard.

Among those rights is the right to raise a matter on the Adjournment and to have a Minister or his or her representative present.  It is incumbent on the Minister to ensure that he or a representative is present.  I must request that this be adhered to across all Departments.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	308	Significant progress has been made recently in implementing schemes to enable more commissioning from the ranks.The revised cadetship competition is now seen as the primary means of commissioning from the ranks.  The cadetship competition has been revised to increase the maximum entry age to 28 and to award bonus marks to candidates with previous experience in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) or Reserve Defence Force (RDF).Results for the 2006 and 2007 cadetship competitions were encouraging with a total of 23 applicants with military service in the Defence Forces being successful in the 2006 cadetship competition and a further 18 applicants with military service being successful in the 2007 cadetship competition.In addition, in the past two years, 3 members of the Defence Forces were commissioned as officers from Direct Entry Competitions for appointments as Engineer Officers in the Corps of Engineers and Conductors in the Army School of Music.  A further two Enlisted Personnel have been successful in the recent Direct Entry Competition to fill Aeronautical Engineer Officers vacancies in the Air Corps.An internal Commissioning From the Ranks competition was held in June 2007.  This competition provided an opportunity for enlisted personnel who have passed the cadet entry age to compete for entry on a potential Officers Course and ultimately, a commission.  As a result of the competition a total of 24 applicants (23 males and 1 female) have been selected from the ranks of Junior and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers and have been in training in the Cadet School in the Curragh since 30 July 2007.On successfully completing the course these enlisted personnel will be commissioned as officers of the Permanent Defence Force.The Policy on the running of similar future competitions, to provide Non-Commissioned Officers with the opportunity of obtaining commissioned rank, will be formalised under the Defence Force Modernisation Agenda.  I have also asked the Chief of Staff for his views on the prospect of facilitating suitably qualified enlisted personnel to compete internally for technical/ professional posts in the officer ranks in the future.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	309	The current White Paper on Defence, which was published in February 2000, was the first-ever White Paper on Defence and set out the policy framework and development strategy for the period 2000-2010.  The overall Government objective was to achieve affordable and sustainable Defence Forces capable of fulfilling the roles laid down by Government.A detailed review of White Paper implementation has been conducted and a report was published in April 2007 outlining the findings.  The report found that substantial progress has been made.  The many detailed recommendations for change that were laid out in the White Paper have been implemented or are being implemented according to agreed timetables.  The report also concludes that all the detailed targets should be met within the time-frame of the White Paper i.e up to 2010.The Deputy will be aware of the requirement under the Public Service Management Act, 1997, that a revised Strategy Statement be prepared following the appointment of new Ministers.  My Department is currently working on this and I expect to receive a draft Strategy Statement from the Secretary General very soon.The preparation of a new White Paper on Defence for the period 2011 to 2020 is a long-term project.  The Review of implementation of the existing White Paper and the work currently under way in preparing the revised Strategy Statement will contribute to its development.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 42 together.The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces continues to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence. Significant investment has taken place in recent years across all facets and elements of the Defence Forces. This investment has been assisted by pay savings arising from the reduction in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force in the context of the White Paper of 2000, which have been fully re-invested in the provision of equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.  The level of investment has ensured that Defence Force's personnel have the most modern and effective range of equipment to carry our their day-to-day roles both at home and overseas and for training purposes and I will ensure that this investment will continue into the future.From the Army's perspective the major investment has been in the contracts for Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers. In the period from 2001 to 2004 the Defence Forces acquired a total of sixty-five Mowag APCs at a cost of €84m. In December 2005, a further contract was signed with Mowag for the supply of fifteen additional Piranha Armoured Vehicles for delivery in 2007. The contract value was €36.5m. Nine of the vehicles are fitted with a Kongsberg Remote Weapon Station with a 12.7mm machine gun, and six are fitted with an Oto Melara turret armed with a 30mm cannon. The fifteen vehicles, twelve of which have now been delivered, will be used mainly in Surveillance and Reconnaissance roles on overseas missions. The final three vehicles are due for delivery this week.In recent years, significant work has been carried out on the acquisition of an Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System for individual soldiers. This system includes Body Armour, Helmets, Back Packs (Rucksacks) and Battle Vests. The position with regard to the acquisition of these items is as follows:8000 units of body armour for the individual soldier on operational duties have been delivered. The new body armour provides significantly greater protection, comfort and coverage than the old model as well as a doubling of the range of sizes available. The total value of the order was in the region of €8m.12,000 helmets have been delivered. The value of the order was circa. €2.5m.12,000 rucksacks have been delivered at a total cost of €3m.To complete the modern integrated protection and load carrying system, one other competition is currently in train for the acquisition of Battle Vests used for the carriage by the individual soldier of essential items such as ammunition, personal radio, water and ancillary equipment. This tender competition is ongoing.Other equipment acquisitions for the Army in recent times, includes 400 General Purpose Machine guns acquired from FN Herstal in Belgium at a cost of €4.4m, 1,400 pistols purchased from Heckler and Koch to replace the FN 9mm Browning Automatic at a cost of €800,000 and 6 Field Deployable Command Post Containers acquired at a cost of €4.4m. There has also been a substantive programmme for the acquisition of modern transport vehicles. Acquisitions in recent years include Nissan patrols, minibuses, Ford transits, heavy load carrying vehicles (Drops) and specialist EOD vehicles.The personal equipment which the individual soldier in the Defence Forces has for operational use, both at home and overseas, compares very favourably with the equipment in use by our European Partners.Significant investment in the Air Corps has also taken place with the acquisition of effectively an all new fleet. The Naval Service has also seen the recent launch of a fleet replacement programme.On the issue of training, I am very satisfied that military training techniques are up to date in all respects. Defence Forces training plans are structured to provide the capabilities needed to execute the roles assigned to them under the White Paper on Defence of February 2000. The challenges of preparing military units for participation in international peace support operations constitute the major dimension of Defence Forces collective training. The primary focus of this training is the attainment of a capability for military interoperability in order to conduct peace support operations to international standards.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	311	I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 21, 28, 40, 108 and 113 together.The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 31 August 2007, the latest date for which detailed figures are available, as advised by the military authorities was 10,382. This comprises 8,497 in the Army, 846 in the Air Corps and 1,039 in the Naval Service. A detailed breakdown of the numbers in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by rank and gender are in the form of a Tabular Statement set out below.The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force.  It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing and proactive recruitment to the Defence Forces. Currently, the Permanent Defence Force successfully manages recruit intakes to keep its annualised monthly average strength at or around 10,500.As indicated in the Deputies' questions, the Agreed Programme for Government proposes an additional provision for up to 350 troops to be in training, at any given time, from 2008 onwards. The military authorities, and my Department are undertaking the planning necessary to meet this provision.The White Paper on Defence provides for an allocation of up to 850 Permanent Defence Force personnel to be deployed overseas at any one time through the United Nations Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS). While this may be exceeded for short periods, deployments above this level are not sustainable on an ongoing basis within existing resources.  Any commitments to EU or UN missions will be met within this context. The number of Defence Forces personnel remaining in Ireland at any time is therefore not below approximately 9,650.I am satisfied that the current strength is adequate to meet all needs arising at home and overseas.The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit.  Nevertheless, I remain anxious to explore all avenues for increasing the numbers of women joining the Defence Forces.In 2006, I reduced the minimum height requirement from 5' 4" to 5' 2". This increases the potential recruitment pool of females from 60% to 90% of female population.Earlier this year, I commissioned a TNS/MRBI study, titled "Retention and Recruitment of Women in The Defence Forces". This research was commissioned with a view to identifying areas where action can be taken to maximise the number of women applicants to the Defence Forces, hence increasing the number joining.  The question of retention was also studied.The results of the research were, on balance, positive. Three-quarters of serving females agreed that the Defence Forces are a good place to work.  In addition there was a very high level of satisfaction (70%-80%) expressed as regards the issues of job security, pay and benefits and the variety of work on offer.The report has been received from the consultants and is currently under consideration within my Department. It is too early at this point to indicate a position on shorter tours of duty, and/or optional overseas service. However, it should be borne in mind that equal opportunity for both genders is a key element of Defence Forces Personnel policy at this point.31 August, 2007Lt GenMaj GenBrig GenColLt ColComdtCaptLtTotal OffrsSMBQMsCsCQMsSGTsCPLsTotal NCOsPtesCadetsTotalArmy1284012630622225796233361322421038135328264225298042Air Corps00121431503713574491213416837428618813Naval Service0012114734461416775152131754913289969Total1210441513843063401,23846472562691,3851,6963,6914,839569,824Rank titles are for Army ranks — Naval Service and Air Corps equivalent rank titles apply in the Naval Service and Air Corps respectively.31 August, 2007Lt GenMaj GenBrig GenColLt ColComdtCaptLtTotal OffrsSMBQMsCsCQMsSGTsCPLsTotal NCOsPtesCadetsTotalArmy115474010331201041282177455Air Corps32511111314133Naval Service109197738670Total1156051127412112214826914558Rank titles are for Army ranks — Naval Service and Air Corps equivalent rank titles apply in the Naval Service and Air Corps respectively.31 August, 2007Lt GenMaj GenBrig GenColLt ColComdtCaptLtTotal OffrsSMBQMsCsCQMsSGTsCPLsTotal NCOsPtesCadetsTotalArmy12840127321269297106533361272431,0581,4572,9544,442368,497Air Corps121431533914074501213517938730019846Naval Service1211474455160677515213182498366151,039Total1210441523993663911,36546472522701,4061,8183,8395,1087010,382Rank titles are for Army ranks — Naval Service and Air Corps equivalent rank titles apply in the Naval Service and Air Corps respectively
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	312	A total of 16,791 claims have been received from current and former members of the Defence Forces in respect of loss of hearing allegedly caused during their military service.  15,887 claims have been disposed of to date.€284.8 million has been paid in respect of hearing loss claims including €97.7 million in plaintiffs' legal costs. The plaintiffs' legal costs include the fees of the solicitors' firms as well as other costs such as Counsel fees, medical reports etc.The management of new and outstanding hearing loss claims was delegated to the State Claims Agency with effect from 1st September 2005. The State Claims Agency has disposed of 345 hearing loss claims and is currently managing a total of 272 active cases of the remaining 904 hearing loss claims. My Department has paid €0.6m in Plaintiff costs and €0.9m in agency legal and related costs to the State Claims Agency in respect of hearing loss claims.  The State Claims Agency estimates the cost of dealing with the remaining currently active army hearing loss cases will be approximately €5m.In general, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor pays the costs of the State's legal team in relation to claims not delegated to the State Claims Agency. This includes Counsel Fees, Medical Fees, Fees for Expert witnesses, State solicitors, Stenographers etc.  These costs are charged to the Vote of the Chief State Solicitor's Office.The most recent information available from the Office of the Chief State Solicitor is that in the period 1998 to mid 2006, by which time the vast majority of Army Hearing Loss cases had been finalised, it has paid a total of €17.8m in such fees. This included €11.4m for Counsel Fees. During this period, the Department of Defence also directly paid €2.0m in other costs associated with the processing of hearing loss claims.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I am very pleased with the performance of my Department and the Defence Forces, the achievements of which are outlined in detail in the 2006 Annual Report.Among the significant developments that took place in 2006 and which are detailed in the Report were:All ATCP (Aid to the Civil Power) and ACA (Aid to the Civil Authority) requests were met.We continued to meet Ireland's international commitments with a total of 828 Defence Forces personnel serving overseas at 31 December 2006.Major equipment purchased during 2006 included the first two medium-lift AW139 helicopters for the Air Corps (a further two are due for delivery this year).  In December, an option in the contract to purchase an additional two AW139's (bringing the total to 6) was exercised.A major inter-agency emergency response exercise was conducted in the Curragh in November.Work on the National Emergency Coordination Centre was practically completed and a contract was placed for a robust communications system.Work commenced in preparing for an Information and Public Awareness Campaign on Emergency Planning.As part of the commemoration of the 90th Anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising, the traditional Easter Military Parade recommenced.  Both the parade and other associated commemorative events generated great public approval and support.  Later in the year, a ceremony was held to mark the 90th anniversary of the Battle of the Somme.The legislative changes necessary to enable participation by the Defence Forces in EU Battlegroups were enacted.A Bill to amend the Defence Act (Part V) was published in December.  This part of the Act provides for disciplinary procedures under military law and needed to be brought in line with the European Convention on Human Rights.The Office of the Defence Forces Ombudsman was established during the year.The reorganisation of the Reserve Defence Force continued during the year in accordance with the Implementation Plan approved by me in late 2005.  Training has been greatly enhanced and preparations made for piloting the Integrated Reserve in 2007 across all three Brigades.During 2006, I took two significant initiatives towards improving female participation in the Defence Forces.  I reduced the minimum height requirement and I initiated research in the area of attracting more women to enlist in the Defence Forces.   The report of this research was published in April 2007.  This will contribute to the formulation of policy and practice in this area for the future.

In accordance with normal procedures the Association's claim is being dealt with under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme (C&A scheme) for members of the Permanent Defence Force and has been the subject of correspondence between my Department and the Representative Association.  The Deputy will appreciate that as discussions under the C&A scheme are confidential to the parties involved it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	317	The annual leave entitlements for members of the Defence Forces are as follows:a.Senior Officers days43b.Junior Officers days31c.Enlisted Personnel days29These annual leave entitlements are reduced by a set amount while the member of the Defence Forces is on an overseas tour of duty.  The reduction is 3.5 days per month for senior officers, 2.5 days per month for junior officers and 1 day per month for enlisted personnel.It should be noted that special leave with pay and allowances is normally granted to all ranks on return from service outside the State with an International United Nations Force.  This is granted on the basis of 6 days in respect of each calendar month of external service from the first day of the month in which the period of external service commenced to the first day of the month on which the period of external service ceased.  This is subject to a maximum of 30 days in respect of the period of external service involved.In addition, Defence Forces personnel serving overseas may avail of annual leave during their deployment overseas subject to the operational requirements of the mission.A claim has been received from the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers (RACO) that no officer should be at a loss of annual leave as a result of overseas service.  This claim will be processed through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the Permanent Defence Force.  By agreement with the Association, discussions under the Scheme are confidential to the parties involved.  Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this issue at this time.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue region, for pollution and salvage response in the marine environment, and for marine safety awareness.  In accordance with the roles assigned to them by Government in the White Paper on Defence, the Defence Forces are committed to providing support to the civil authorities including in relation to Search and Rescue.  In this regard, the Naval Service and Air Corps provide support to the Irish Coast Guard as the need arises and within their available capability.A Service Level Agreement is currently being finalised between my Department and the Department of Transport for the provision of services to the Irish Coast Guard by the Defence Forces.  The overall operation and implementation of the Service Level Agreement will be monitored by a Steering Group comprising representatives of my Department, the Defence Forces, the Department of Transport and the Irish Coast Guard.  At an operational level, the parties to the Agreement are committed to the achievement of its objectives through co-operation and partnership between the main service providers namely, the Naval Service, the Air Corps, the Army, and the Irish Coast Guard.Officials from my Department and the Defence Forces are represented on the Irish Marine Search and Rescue Committee, which is chaired by the Irish Coast Guard.  The IMSAR Committee meets twice yearly and its functions are to keep under review the general arrangements for marine search and rescue in Ireland, to consider the implications of any intended changes in equipment, deployment or organization in any arm of the search and rescue organisation in advance of such changes, and to consider as necessary liaison with neighbouring search and rescue organisations and any regional search and rescue agreements in which Ireland is a participant.  The Defence Forces also participate in regular search and rescue exercises with the Irish Coast Guard.Officials from my Department and the Defence Forces are also represented on the National Maritime Security Committee, as is the Irish Coast Guard.  The function of the National Maritime Security Committee, which is chaired by the Department of Transport, is to provide advice in relation to maritime security policy and to provide for the co-ordination of the various agencies involved.  This provides another useful forum for the exchange of experience and information between the Defence Forces and the Irish Coast Guard.I am satisfied that these mechanisms serve to facilitate greater co-operation and knowledge sharing between the Irish Coast Guard and the Defence Forces with regard to maritime safety.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	319	In reply to Parliamentary Question No. 562 of 6 February 2007, I stated that it was intended to commence promotion competitions [from the rank of Captain (Army Reserve)/Lieutenant (Naval Service Reserve) to Commandant (Army Reserve)/Lieutenant Commander (Naval Service Reserve)] no later than April 2007.The promotion boards were convened in April, 2007 and their deliberations concluded in August, 2007.  Under this competition 22 officers were promoted to the rank of Commandant.  A competition for promotion from Lieutenant to Captain will commence in December, 2007.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The Government decided in December 2003 that my Department's Dublin-based staff are to be decentralised to Newbridge, Co. Kildare with Defence Forces Headquarters decentralising to the Curragh.The Office of Public Works published the planning notification for the new Defence Forces' Headquarters in the national press on 13 July 2007.  No observations were received in relation to this building project.  Tender documents are currently being prepared by OPW in consultation with the Defence Forces.  When completed, this building will accommodate 355 members of the Defence Forces.The number of Departmental staff to be relocated to Newbridge is just over 200.  There are currently 128 Newbridge-bound staff serving in the Department, which amounts to 70% of the total administrative and clerical staff requirement.  In addition to the civil servants, 43 military personnel will be located in Newbridge also.  Kildare County Council has approved the sale of a site at Station Road in Newbridge to the Office of Public Works for the construction of the Department's new headquarters.  A preferred tenderer for the design and construction of the building has been chosen and the planning process is under way with a decision by OPW expected shortly.  Depending on planning and the commencement of building work, OPW has indicated that construction and fit-out will take 18 months to complete.  No staff have relocated to either location to date.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The Civil Defence Board was established in 2003 and is charged with the development and management of the organisation at National level.  The Board is obliged to submit its Strategic Plan to me for approval every three years.I recently launched the 2nd Strategic Plan of the Civil Defence Board which covers the period 2007-2010 and which has been laid before the House.  I was very encouraged by the strategies identified by the Board for the management and development of Civil Defence to 2010 and beyond.As the Minister with responsibility for the co-ordination of National Emergency Planning arrangements, I was very encouraged to note that the Board places such a high priority on involvement in the Major Emergency Management Framework, which identifies a wider role for Civil Defence in emergency response.  Civil Defence volunteers are an important support to the front-line emergency services.In approving the Plan, I have asked the Board to prioritise the development of the enhanced electronic Register of Volunteers for the purpose of planning and allocation of resources.I propose to maintain the level of funding which has been made available to the Civil Defence Board in recent years.  In 2007 the Board received a grant from my Department of €6.099 million.  In addition to that, I have asked the Board for their proposals with regard to development of a new Training Range at their headquarters in Roscrea, and the refurbishment of the existing Training Range at Ratra House, Phoenix Park.  Furthermore, I understand from the Board that a proposal for a programme of improvements to accommodation and training facilities at local authority level for volunteers is under development.The funding that I have provided to the Civil Defence Board has enabled the organisation to equip volunteers to a high standard.  In this regard, in late 2006, I launched the new Civil Defence workwear which meets European safety standards in terms of visibility while modernising the image of the organisation.  In order to attract and retain members, it is essential that the organisation meets the highest standards of professionalism.Since 2000, considerable expenditure on equipment such as vehicles, boats, training, medical, rescue and communications equipment, has helped to transform Civil Defence into a modern multi-functional emergency response organisation.  Marketing of this capability is an important strategy in meeting the target of increasing membership by 10% by 2010 as identified by the Board.  In terms of professional training, I fully support the Board's strategy in seeking external accreditation of Civil Defence training courses.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	322	The level of medical cover for spouses of Defence Forces personnel who accompany them on accompanied overseas missions is currently the subject of a claim from the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers.  The claim is being dealt with through the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  As discussions under the scheme are confidential to the parties involved the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the issue.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	323	The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Fishery Limits.  The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and seven.  The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.In relation to drug trafficking, responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking and other such illegal activities rests primarily with the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners.  However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for both the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work.  Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, (including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving the Garda, the Customs Service and the Naval Service), have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service in this important area and I am satisfied that the extent of Naval Service reconnaissance, in conjunction with the Garda and the Customs Service, has had a major and beneficial impact in deterring drug trafficking and other such illegal activities.Last year the Naval Service achieved a total of 1,658 patrol days, of which over 90% related to fishery protection.  In the course of these patrols, a total of 1,897 vessels were boarded, 19 were detained and 148 warnings were issued.  These outputs reveal a focused and committed Naval Service that is continuing to produce high levels of performance.A key element of the Naval Service Value for Money Implementation Plan, an outcome from the White Paper on Defence, was the requirement to produce a plan to deliver 1,680 patrol days annually with the establishment provided over the period 2000 to 2005.  A system was introduced to operate patrol plans for 1,680 days per annum on an ongoing basis.  Under the system a ship might be required to complete between 200 and 220 days at sea to achieve the 1,680 days required.  However, relief personnel are provided to ensure that personnel on seagoing rotation should normally expect to undertake an average of approximately 160 days on patrol away from the Naval Base in a calendar year.  For a wide variety of reasons some will do more and others less than this.I am very much aware of the report A Voyage of Discovery, which I received in June 2006, and, following which, I held discussions with a PDFORRA delegation and representatives of the Naval Service regarding the effects of patrol duties on personnel of the Naval Service.  I am pleased to say that our meeting reached agreement on a process to examine this issue and find potential solutions.  A further series of meetings have taken place between the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) and PDFORRA.  The purpose of the meetings was to examine the complex issues raised by PDFORRA with a view to exploring a possible resolution.  A Naval Service/PDFORRA working group was set up and has made a number of recommendations which are being considered with a view to implementing them.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	324	A Military Police Investigation was conducted into a video clip involving Defence Forces personnel in Liberia, which was uploaded onto the YouTube website in late May this year.Following this, three soldiers were charged under section 168 of the Defence Act, of conduct to the prejudice of good order and discipline of the forces.  At the time of the incident, October 2006, the soldiers were serving with the 95 Infantry Battalion, UN Mission in Liberia (UNMIL).The charges were heard by the Officer Commanding the 3 Infantry Battalion on 30 August, 2007.  One soldier had a charge proven of uploading this video onto the internet contrary to Defence Forces instructions and was fined €250.  A second soldier had two charges proven of pointing his loaded weapon — in the video — at members of the public and at members of the Defence Forces, respectively, and was fined €200.  The third had a similar charge of pointing his loaded weapon at members of the Defence Forces and was fined €150.  All soldiers accepted the findings.This incident was very disappointing, especially in light of the Defence Forces' reputation gained over many years from overseas service on peacekeeping duties, and in particular that earned by the seven battalions which served with UNMIL from November 2003 to May 2007.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The question of the recruitment of foreign nationals to the Defence Forces is not a new one and Defence Force Regulations have always allowed for the recruitment of foreign nationals to the Defence Forces.Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the Cadetship Competition, Apprenticeship Competition, General Service Enlistment or Direct Entry Competitions which are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments.  All applicants for each of these entry streams are required to meet qualifying criteria.The Cadet Competition is the entry level for recruitment as an Officer of the Defence Forces.  As you are aware, I have made changes to the 2006 Cadet competition to broaden the entry criteria thereby making it easier for qualifying foreign nationals to apply for cadetships.In addition the Defence Forces Equality Policy underpins equality legislation and states that;The Defence Forces are committed to the principles of equal opportunities in all employment policies, procedures and regulations.The Defence Forces will operate in an environment without discrimination in areas as provided by the Equality Acts.The Defence Forces will ensure that the principles of employment equality are employed in recruitment, promotion, training and work experience.All regulations and Administrative Instructions concerning service in the Defence Forces shall be set out in a manner consistent with this policy of equal opportunity.This policy will be reviewed along with the Defence Forces regulations on an ongoing basis by the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) to ensure compliance with best practice and to maintain a working environment that treats all members of the Defence Forces in a manner consistent with equal opportunities.I know that people from diverse backgrounds have already been employed in the Defence Forces, but this has mainly been in certain specialised areas.  This has worked well — albeit on a limited scale.  I have asked the Chief of Staff to review recruitment into the Defence Forces at all levels and to implement changes that would facilitate recruitment from among cultural and ethnic minorities.  I believe that this can only enhance our Defence Forces.The Military Authorities share my commitment to increasing the participation of people from ethnic and cultural communities in the Defence Forces.  To achieve this the Defence Forces are:Developing a strategy for Cultural Diversity Management.  A new Defence Forces advertising campaign will be launched to reflect its strategy for cultural diversity.Establishing links with all ethical and cultural community groups based in Ireland, in order to brief the groups on the Defence Forces and its current entry requirements.  The groups will be invited to forward submissions to the Defence Forces on their views of service in the Defence Forces and to highlight any barriers they deem unfavourable to recruitment that may exist.However, the primary focus in recruitment is to attract people with the core competencies required by the Defence Forces.  My Department and the Defence Forces are fully committed to ensuring that all suitably qualified candidates who wish to do so are given the opportunity to join the Defence Forces.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	326	In recent years recruitment to the Reserve Defence Forces (RDF) has been satisfactory.  In 2006 there were 1,124 recruits and in 2007 to date, there have been 847.The RDF is going through a process of change with the implementation of the recommendations of the White Paper on Defence and the RDF Implementation Board Report.  The Implementation Plan is being rolled-out on a phased basis up to 2009.  There has been significant progress to date in implementing the detailed recommendations of the Plan e.g. a new organisation structure implemented with effect from October 2005, major improvements in clothing, equipment, training and resourcing.  In addition, the RDF is now structured along similar lines to the PDF (3 Brigades and the RDF Training Centre).  The integrated reserve is being piloted across the 3 Brigades this year.Now that the new organization structures, training syllabus etc. are in place it is appropriate that more focus be placed on recruitment.  I am pleased to be able to inform the House that I have approved a publicity and awareness campaign to promote recruitment to the RDF in line with the commitment in ‘An Agreed Programme for Government'.  This will commence early in 2008.  Concurrent with the national campaign, units will conduct local campaigns in their own areas to capture the benefits of the national campaign.  I am pleased that the Implementation Plan is progressing well.  My Department will continue to monitor progress in the remaining period of the Plan.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I propose to take Questions Nos. 36, 114 and 115 together.Ireland receives requests from time to time in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.  Consideration is currently being given to possible Defence Forces participation in UN mandated military operations that may arise in Africa.  At present, the proposed ESDP mission to Chad appears to offer the most suitable opportunity for participating in the region.  I am currently in the process of authorising a fact-finding mission to the region.  Subject to a satisfactory assessment, it is proposed that the Defence Forces would participate in the mission with a substantive contribution in the region of 300 to 350 personnel.  This is within the capacity of the Defence Forces on the basis of our withdrawal from Lebanon.Planning is progressing at the EU for the proposed EU military operation in the Republic of Chad and the Central African Republic.  The proposed EU force will possibly comprise up to approximately 4,000 personnel.  It is expected that the Council of the European Union will adopt a "Joint Action" to launch the mission next week.  The authorities of Chad and the Central African Republic have welcomed a possible EU military presence in their respective countries.On 25 September, 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 establishing a multi-dimensional UN mission in Chad and Central African Republic that will help strengthen security in the region.  Resolution 1778 (2007) establishes the mission, to be known as MINURCAT, for a period of one year, with a mandate focusing on the security and protection of civilians — particularly refugees, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and civilians in danger — and on human rights and the rule of law in eastern Chad and north-eastern Central African Republic.  At this point in time, a decision to deploy troops to the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur (UNAMID), which is primarily an African mission and will become operational later this year, looks unsuitable and could not be recommended.The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) completes its current deployment at the end of October 2007.  The commitment to UNIFIL was for one year and the Defence Forces will withdraw with their Finnish partners on completion of their tour of duty.  Approximately seven Defence Forces personnel will continue to serve in the mission headquarters.Currently, a total of 556 Defence Forces personnel is serving overseas.  This number changes on a monthly basis subject to mission rotations and has averaged 622 over the past five years.  Full details are listed in the following statements.The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force.  There are no plans to increase this number.  However, the Agreed Programme for Government proposes to facilitate this target of 10,500 by putting in place, from 2008 onwards, an additional provision for up to 350 troops to be in training, at any given time.  The military authorities, and my Department are undertaking the planning necessary to meet this provision.Number

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	328	The White Paper on Defence 2000 and the Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan (2002) set out the blueprint for the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) together with an Implementation Plan extending to 2009.  The Reserve Defence Force (RDF) now has a clearly defined role, an enhanced relationship with the Permanent Defence Force (PDF), better equipment and improved training.The Implementation Plan is being rolled-out on a phased basis up to 2009.  There has been significant progress to date in implementing the detailed recommendations of the Plan e.g. a new organisation structure implemented with effect from October 2005 and major improvements in clothing, equipment, training and resourcing.  In addition, the RDF is now structured along similar lines to the PDF (3 Brigade structure, Brigade Training Centres, RDF Training Authority).  The introduction of the integrated element of the Reserve is being addressed in the current year as a pilot exercise across all 3 Brigades.  The integration project will be reviewed in the light of this exercise.A publicity and recruitment campaign for the Reserve is planned over a 2/3 year period, commencing early in 2008.I am pleased that the Implementation Plan is progressing well.  My Department will continue to monitor progress in the remaining period of the Plan.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	329	The Organisation of National Ex-Servicemen and Women, or Óglaigh Náisiúnta na hÉireann Teoranta (ONET) has enjoyed the long-standing official recognition of the Department and the Defence Forces.  ONET is dedicated to looking after the welfare of all ex-service personnel of the Irish Defence Forces.  A main objective of ONET is to ensure the welfare of ex-servicemen and women by way of providing accommodation to homeless members in need of such domestic accommodation and providing other assistance that may be required by way of advising referrals to the relevant agencies.The Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA) was formed in 1990.  Membership is available to those who have successfully completed a tour of duty with a UN Force or Organisation.  The Association is financed by membership fees, voluntary contributions and fundraising.I can advise the Deputy that, in October 2006, in recognition of the valuable work of ONET and IUNVA and to mark almost 50 years of Defence Forces involvement in international peacekeeping with the United Nations, I was pleased to support the work of both organisations in the form of a once-off grant of €50,000 to each from my Department. The provision of annual funding to both ONET and IUNVA is part of An Agreed Programme for Government 2007.  My Department is currently developing proposals to implement this from 2008.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	330	An order for two (2) man portable mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly referred to as UAVs, was placed with Aeronautics Defence Systems Limited from Israel, in May 2007.  The value of the order is in the region of €780,000, inclusive of VAT.  The award of the contract followed on from a two stage tender competition in which eight proposals were initially received and three tenders subsequently evaluated by a Military Board in the first quarter of 2007.  Delivery of the UAV systems is expected by the end of 2007.The UAV systems are required to enhance the capability of the Defence Forces to carry out surveillance and target acquisition for overseas Peace Support Operations and provide low cost, low risk means to increase capabilities and enhance force protection by performing missions which do not demand the use of manned aircraft.  The UAVs, will, in effect, be an information-gathering asset.  It should be stressed that the UAVs which the Defence Forces are acquiring are unarmed.The UAVs will also be able to carry out suitable tasks at home in an Aid to the Civil Power or Aid to the Civil Authority environment such as environmental inspections and the undertaking of reconnaissance missions, which may avoid unnecessary exposure of Defence Force personnel to risk.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	331	On 25 September, 2007, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted Resolution 1778 establishing a multi-dimensional UN mission in Chad and Central African Republic that will help strengthen security in the region.  Resolution 1778 (2007) establishes the mission, to be known as MINURCAT, for a period of one year. MINURCAT will consist of three components:a UN multidimensional presence, composed of UN police, rule of law, human rights and other civilian officers;a special Chadian police/gendarmes unit (some 850) dedicated exclusively to maintaining law and order in refugee camps, sites with concentrations of IDPs and key towns, and assisting in securing humanitarian activities in eastern Chad;an EU military deployment (under Chapter VII).The EU element of the operation will have a mandate to contribute to the protection of civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons; to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel by helping to improve security in the area of operation; and to contribute to protecting UN personnel, facilities, installations and equipment and to ensuring the security and freedom of movement of its staff and UN and associated personnel.The UN element of this operation is targeted primarily at supporting the civil administration in Chad and the Central African Republic to protect refugees and camps with the support of a UN police element and liaison officers.The EU will launch a fact-finding mission in the next week or so.  It is proposed that the Defence Forces will send five officers to participate in this fact-finding mission so as to provide me with the best information possible regarding the situation on the ground so as to inform a future decision by government on our participation.  The issue of risk assessment and force protection is vitally important and this will have to be factored into the equation.  In addition, given the location of the mission area, the operational environment, together with considerations regarding resupply, sustainability and reinforcement will also require rigorous assessment.The decision to launch an ESDP mission is a matter for the Council of the European Union and it is expected that it will take this decision in the next week.In the event that the Defence Forces can make a meaningful contribution to the mission and if it meets all the other criteria including the risk assessment, force protection test and environmental assessment, I would intend to bring forward detailed proposals to Government in the next few weeks.  Subject to Government approval, I will then seek the approval of Dáil Éireann for the despatch of the contingent in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Acts.  The scale of our potential contribution to the EU mission is in the order of 300 to 350 personnel.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	332	The mission of the Army Equitation School, as assigned to it on its establishment in 1926, is to advertise the Irish horse abroad through participation in international competitions.  The school has discharged this task with considerable distinction down through the years, and through its participation and numerous successes in equitation events at home and abroad it has successfully promoted the qualities of the Irish horse.In 2005, my Department purchased 3 horses for the Army Equitation School at a total cost of €243,000 and in 2006, 4 horses were purchased at a cost of €245,500.  To date in 2007, I have approved the purchase of a further 3 horses for the School at a cost of €146,520.Presently, there are three horses leased to the Army Equitation School by their owners.  The owners are paid an annual lease fee for the competition life of the horse, and in addition to the lease fee there are in-built performance bonuses in the lease agreements.  Horses are also acquired by the Army Equitation School through donation by patrons, and presently the School has possession of three donated horses.There are ten Officers (including seven Riding Officers) assigned to the Army Equitation School at present.  There are also eight Non-Commissioned Officers and seventeen Privates currently assigned.In 2004 the Army Equitation School had 14 International wins at competitions throughout Europe, with 13 International wins in 2005 and a further 10 in 2006, including wins at Barcelona, Athens, Copenhagen and Zagreb.  The Army Equitation School has had considerable success in 2007, notably Commandant Gerry Flynn's wins on Mo Chroí in the Dublin Grand Prix, the Lisbon Grand Prix, the Drammen Grand Prix and the Vimeiro Grand Prix.There are presently no plans for the further expansion or development of the Army Equitation School.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	333	The military medical services and their facilities exist primarily to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and to support them in operational and overseas activities.  The focus of the military medical service is on primary care, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training.The development of the capacity of the Medical Corps forms part of the agreed programme for Government.  This includes the expansion of the capacity of the Medical Corps to deliver a range of medical facilities on UN mandated missions.The key issue at this time is the acknowledged shortage of medical officers (Doctors) in the Medical Corps.  Whereas the establishment for doctors provided for in the new organisation of the Defence Forces introduced on foot of the White Paper on Defence is forty seven (47), the current strength of Medical Officers serving in the Defence Forces is twenty three (23), one of whom is on leave of absence without pay.  There has been recruitment of Medical Officers each year but the number attracted to work in the Defence Forces has just served to address natural wastage.The problems with recruitment of medical officers into the Defence Forces have endured for some time despite the concerted efforts of my Department and the Defence Forces to address the root causes.  The pay and allowances of doctors and dentists were increased substantially recently, in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  This linked their pay to public health doctors and dentists.  In addition, the Defence Forces have recently undertaken an intensive recruitment campaign.  The results of both of these initiatives have been disappointing.My Department has also been engaged in an ongoing process with the Representative Associations on the issue of the health requirements of members of the Defence Forces.  A medical services charter was agreed under Sustaining Progress.  This collaborative work has been carried forward into the modernisation agenda under Towards 2016 which foresees work on developing a revised structure for the delivery of medical services for the Defence Forces.Ensuring that the medical needs of Irish troops are fully catered for is an important element of the planning in all overseas missions.  This planning is typically done in conjunction with other participating contingents with a view to ensuring access to the appropriate treatment.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	334	The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity and equal treatment for men and women in the Defence Forces (Army, Air Corps, Naval Service) including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.In effect, this means that women are eligible, on the same basis as men, for participation in operational and ceremonial activities, for assignment to all military appointments and educational and training courses and for promotion. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.   All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit.The Defence Force Equality and Equal Status Policies underpin equality legislation and state that:Men and Women have equal opportunities for employment and for advancement on the basis on merit and ability and that differences between women and men are not used unjustly or unfairly to favour a man over a woman or a woman over a man.  It is not an option to promote someone simply because they are a woman or a man.This policy and the relevant procedures are reviewed along with Defence Forces regulations on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with best practice and to maintain a working environment that treats all members of the Defence Forces in a manner consistent with equal opportunities.Work-life balance initiatives of term time and career breaks in addition to the statutory entitlements such as Parental Leave, Carer's Leave and Force Majeure Leave are available to all members of the Defence Forces.Promotion arrangements for enlisted personnel are currently the subject of discussion between my Department and the Representative Associations. I have made it clear that the policy of the Department is to produce a merit-based system of promotion that is gender neutral. That should provide the best person for the job.I recognise that requirements such as overseas service and service at sea places high demands on both men and women.  However the requirements to serve overseas and at sea are a basic and necessary part of the job of the soldier and sailor.    My Department and the Defence Forces continually seek to improve the work environment.  For example a new patrol duty rota has recently been introduced in the Naval Service, this should have a positive impact on personnel without compromising the service provided.Other developments that emerge in the areas of family friendly policies generally will be reviewed positively to determine if they can be accommodated to the operational requirements of the Defence Forces.On the TNS MRBI report on recruitment and retention of women, it should be remembered that, on balance, the results of the research are very positive. The report reveals that women serving in the Defence Forces have a positive attitude to their job with over 75% of respondents thinking that the Defence Forces is a good place to work and over 73% reporting that they enjoyed their job.There are challenges identified in the report that we are continuing to address. I am committed to ensuring that the Defence Forces provides members with a challenging and rewarding career and a supportive working environment.

It is the intention of the Government that the records will be made available in good time for the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising in 2016.An Interdepartmental Working Group chaired by the Department of An Taoiseach was established last year to progress this matter.    My Department and the Defence Forces are represented on this Committee along with representatives of Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, the OPW and the National Archives.This is a major project and considerable preparatory work has already been completed.  In addition, my Department will shortly be placing advertisements in the national press seeking to recruit professional archivists who will be dedicated to this project under the guidance of the inter-departmental Committee.

The figures in the Tabular Statement represent the amounts paid in settlement of actions against the Minister for Defence. They include payments to serving and non-serving members of the Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces in respect of personal injuries and material damage. They also include amounts paid to Civilian Employees, and members of the public. I am concerned, of course, to ensure that such claims are kept to a minimum and that when they do arise they are dealt with expeditiously and efficiently.The State Claims Agency has been working with the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence to examine incidents giving rise to claims and trends emerging in order to identify and obviate, if possible, the underlying causes of injury to civilian and Defence Forces personnel.In 2004, the Defence Forces established a Risk Management Steering Group and a Risk Management Implementation Group to implement the overall Defence Forces Risk Management Policy. An Instruction on Health and Safety Risk Management was promulgated throughout the Defence Forces in 2006.During 2006, external auditors from the State Claims Agency carried out a comprehensive audit of the Defence Forces Health and Safety Management systems. This audit examined systems in Defence Forces HQ, in each Formation and in 14 different Units selected by the auditors. All areas audited met with OHSAS 18001 standards.

That said, the Defence Forces have facilitated An Garda Síochána down the years, providing them with significant access to military firing ranges nationwide on an ongoing basis. These arrangements do not encompass the use of indoor firing ranges as the type of ranges available to the Defence Forces are not appropriate for the type of equipment in use by An Gardí.Obviously, for security reasons, it would not be appropriate for me to disclose the extent of usage by the Gardaí of the Defence Forces firing ranges.

OMSP is defined in Section 133 of the Finance Act 1992; and is the price, inclusive of all taxes and duties, which a vehicle may reasonably be expected to fetch on a first arm's length sale in the open market in the State by retail.  The OMSP of new vehicles is declared to the Revenue Commissioners by a wholesale distributor, while the OMSP of imported second hand vehicles is determined by the Revenue Commissioners based on factors such as age, mileage and vehicle condition.When a vehicle is brought into Ireland from abroad, it must be registered and the VRT paid by the end of the next working day following its arrival in the State.  Where a vehicle remains unregistered for a period in excess of one week of its arrival in the State, Section 140 of the Finance Act 2001 provides for the vehicle to be detained by Revenue mobile units for such period as is required to carry out their enquiries regarding the VRT status of the vehicle.  Generally one of the following options will be available to the owner of the vehicle in such circumstances:(a)The Vehicle should be presented for registration at a Vehicle Registration Office where VRT is payable on the open market selling price of the vehicle in the State.(b)Where applicable, an application for an exemption from the payment of VRT should be made.(c)The Vehicle may be exported out of the State.Section 139 of the Finance Act 1992 provides for offences and penalties under VRT law.  A person guilty of an offence under this section will be liable to a penalty of €1,265, in addition to the VRT payable on registration.  Under certain circumstances, a person may be exempted from having to pay VRT. Sections 134 and 135 of the Finance Act 1992 provide for permanent and temporary exemptions from the payment of VRT on registration of vehicles in the State.  Such exemptions include transfers of residence, vehicles acquired on inheritance, vehicles transferred into the State under diplomatic arrangements and vehicles used in the State by visitors and tourists.Section 134(1)(a) of the Finance Act 1992 provides for the granting of a permanent exemption from the payment of VRT on registration where a vehicle is the personal property of a private individual and is being brought permanently into the State on the transfer of their normal residence from a place outside the State to a place in the State.  Statutory Instrument No. 59 of 1993 sets out the conditions governing the registration of vehicles under that section.  An application for exemption under transfer of residence provisions should be made within one week of the arrival of the vehicle in the State.  The Deputy may wish to note that guidelines relating to eligibility for exemption are contained in information leaflet VRT 3 in the VRT section of the Revenue website www.revenue.ie and also at any Vehicle Registration Office.

This provided that deeds presented by first-time buyers to the Revenue Commissioners on or after 30 April 2007 will be exempt from stamp duty.  As a deed must be presented to the Revenue Commissioners within 30 days of execution, the Act was drafted to provide for exemption for deeds executed on or after 31 March 2007.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Relief from stamp duty on the conveyance of farm land is currently available under section 81AA of the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.  The main conditions for granting this relief are that on the date of transfer, the young trained farmer must be (a) under 35 years of age, and (b) the holder of a specified qualification.  In addition, the young trained farmer must declare that he/she will retain and farm the land for a period of 5 years from this date.  The third level courses that qualify under this scheme are listed in Schedule 2B to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999.In broad terms, the present system is that where a farmer undertakes third level education that is not agriculture related, he/she must undertake Teagasc approved training in agriculture and farm management in order to qualify under the relief.  Where the individual has successfully completed two years of a full-time third-level qualification, he/she can claim the relief where he/she has undertaken Teagasc approved training courses in agriculture and horticulture for 100 hours and in farm management for 80 hours.  However, from 31 March 2008 the FETAC Level 6 Advanced Certificate in Agriculture will become the new minimum education requirement.  The Advanced Certificate is of two years duration.  However, in recognition of prior learning, persons with other third-level education may complete the programme in a shorter period.  This change was announced in last year's Budget following consultation with the Minister for Agriculture and Food as well as Teagasc, it was agreed as part of the Partnership talks with the farming organisations in order to regularise the agricultural and farm management education of young farmers.  Where a farmer completes the 80/180 hours Teagasc training before that date he/she can qualify for the relief under the old arrangements.  In addition to the changes made to the education criteria of the relief in last year's Budget, the refunds procedure was greatly simplified, so that, among other changes, the former requirement for a specific minimum education attainment at the date of transfer is now abolished.  This means that where a farmer has not completed his/her agricultural training before any land is transferred to him/her, he/she can claim a refund of any stamp duty paid at a later date, after they have completed the relevant training.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	347	Approved Retirement Funds (ARFs) and Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs) are part of the flexible options introduced in the 1999 Finance Act which allow certain categories of individual considerable flexibility and freedom in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans.  Previously, such individuals would have been required to purchase an annuity with the pension fund moneys remaining after the drawdown of the appropriate tax-free lump sum.  The option to have all or part of an individual's accumulated pension fund placed in an ARF is open to a qualified person (generally a proprietary director, self-employed individual and certain employees or directors in non-pensionable employment) who is either over 75 years of age or who has a guaranteed pension income actually in payment for life of at least €12,700 per annum.  Where the guaranteed income requirement is not met, then an AMRF must be chosen into which the first €63,500 of the pension fund, or the whole of the fund if less than this amount, must be invested (alternatively an annuity can be purchased with the first €63,500 of the pension fund and the balance placed in an ARF).  The capital in an AMRF is not available to an individual until he or she reaches 75 years though any income generated by the fund can be drawn down subject to tax.  The purpose of an AMRF is to ensure a capital or income "safety net" for the relevant individuals throughout the period of their retirement.  I have no plans to amend the AMRF rules in a manner that would undermine the rationale for the requirement, generally.

This was a major disappointment and a setback for the thousands of undocumented Irish people in the United States, and also for their families in Ireland. It is now widely considered that this important issue is unlikely to be back before Congress in a meaningful way in advance of the next US Presidential and Congressional Elections.In the aftermath of this disappointment, I made clear my determination to actively review the situation and to explore possible alternative options, including bilateral arrangements. In the months since the collapse of the comprehensive reform bill, my Department and the Embassy in Washington have initiated contacts at senior official level in Washington and have been engaged in a wide range of consultations with Congressional, Administration and Irish community figures to assess how best to proceed.My visit to the United States this week provided me with an opportunity to reinforce these efforts at senior political level through discussions with members of the Administration and Congress. I also had talks with representatives of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and direct contact with the undocumented Irish community in New York with a view to exploring all ways of finding a way forward on this sensitive and important issue.

A number of these upgraded Embassy websites are already live, such as those for our Embassies in Paris (www.embassyofireland.fr) and in Berlin (www.embassyofireland.de).The upgrade of the website for the Embassy in Ottawa is a priority and will result in a significantly enhanced service to Irish citizens in that country. In the meantime, although the Embassy's website is under construction, the Embassy's contact details and opening hours are available on its homepage. Contact details for the Embassy and for our network of Honorary Consuls across Canada are also available on the Department's main website.For security reasons, passport applications cannot be made online. Irish citizens in Canada wishing to renew their passports should make direct contact with the Embassy in Ottawa. Once a passport application is being processed by the Embassy, an individual can track the progress of their application through the main Department website.I can confirm to the Deputy that our Honorary Consul in Toronto, who was appointed in 1998, has been at his current address, Suite 1210, 20 Toronto Street, Toronto, Ontario M5C 2B8 since 1999. This address has been widely disseminated over the years, including on various websites.Finally if the Deputy wishes to forward details of a particular passport query, the Embassy will be happy to follow it up.

The programme for Government sets out key goals: the creation of an academic Centre for Conflict Resolution, the establishment of a system of roving Ambassadors to affected regions and the development of an annual €25 million fund to assist conflict resolution in the developing world.My Department is in the final phase of completing the work programme for the Conflict Resolution Unit.I also used my address to the United Nations earlier this week to inform the Assembly of the priorities and principles that will guide the work of the Conflict Resolution Unit. Peacemaking, peacebuilding and lesson sharing will be key themes of its work. Human rights and gender and conflict will inform all aspects of its work. Climate change and its potential to generate conflict will be an area of interest. While in New York, I also took the opportunity of briefing senior figures in the United Nations on our plans and the priority we attach to working with the UN and its agencies.The new Unit has been evolving its policy framework and investigating a range of activities to advance its work in conflict areas and enable Ireland to play a more active and strategic role in international conflict resolution and peace-building. There is already a body of existing activities that can be built on — these include our proud tradition of UN peacekeeping, development cooperation activities arising through Irish Aid's growing programme and its work in our priority countries, and the range of funding already provided to organisations active in conflict resolution internationally.The Unit's work programme recommendations will seek to capture these activities, build on Ireland's traditional foreign policy values and set out a framework for future activities.

One of the principal conditions for receipt of FIS is that a person must work at least 19 hours per week or 38 hours per fortnight.The person concerned was awarded Family Income Supplement (FIS) for a period of 12 months from 29th June 2006 and payment continued to 27th June 2007.  The person made a repeat claim on 28th May 2007.  There was a build-up of work in the Family Income Supplement section at that time and, consequently, there was a delay in dealing with all FIS claims.  When this case was examined on 24th August 2007, it was found that this person was not engaged in full-time (19 hours per week or 38 per fortnight) remunerative employment as an employee.  Accordingly, the claim was disallowed and the person concerned was advised of this decision and of the right of appeal to the independent social welfare appeals office.  Under Social Welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by Deciding Officers and Appeals Officers.  These Officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The Family Income Supplement (FIS) is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  Family Income Supplement is paid for 52 weeks provided a person continues to meet the qualifying conditions, and a claim for renewal may then be made.Entitlement to FIS is based on an applicant satisfying a means test and on certification of employment by the employer.  My Department has consistently publicised the scheme in order to maximise uptake by qualified families.  Following significant improvements in the qualifying income limits in the 2006 budget, a week-long nationwide awareness campaign was undertaken in March of that year to encourage increased take up of the scheme.  This, combined with the improvements in the income limits, resulted in a strong upward trend in the level of new claims and, consequently claims for renewals.There are currently 20,177 people in receipt of a weekly FIS payment.  To date in 2007, my Department has received 28,740 new and renewal FIS claims and has decided a total of 22,133 cases.  At end September there were 11,229 claims awaiting decision. These were comprised of 4,622 new claims and 6,607 renewal claims.  The average time taken to award a FIS claim or renewal in 2007 (up to end of Sept) is 14.98 weeks.My Department is committed to providing a quality service to all its customers.  This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.  Measures were introduced to directly address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS:A review of existing processes and procedures has been undertaken with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing;Priority is being given to claims where a claim is being renewed to ensure continuity of payment;The ongoing staffing requirement was recently reviewed in light of the increased volumes of claims.  In view of the efficiencies that the processing improvements are expected to generate, an increase in the staffing level is not warranted at this time.These measures will, over time, lead to more efficient processing and reduce the number of claims on hand.  The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by my Department.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	372	The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn.  The allowance is intended as a contribution towards meeting the full cost of school clothing and footwear.  The scheme operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.A person may qualify for payment of back to school clothing and footwear allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.  Family income supplement (FIS) is a qualifying payment for back to school clothing and footwear purposes.  People in receipt of FIS qualify subject to the standard means test and any income received by an applicant in the form of family income supplement is not assessable.In cases where FIS claims are pending, the Health Service Executive have been asked to use their discretion to make a BSCFA payment when they consider that the payment of a FIS claim is likely.  Anyone who did not apply for BSCFA because they were awaiting a decision on a FIS application should contact their local Community Welfare Officer.The Community Welfare Service of the Health Service Executive may make exceptional needs payments to help meet an essential once-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet out of his/her own resources.  Depending on the circumstances of the particular case, Community Welfare Officers have the discretion to make exceptional needs payments in the event of late applications for BSCFA.  The 2007 BSCFA rates are €180 per child for children aged 2 to 11 years and €285 per child for children aged 12 to 22 years.  Some 174,000 children will benefit from the scheme in 2007 at an annual cost of over €38m.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	373	The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme (BSCFA) operates from the beginning of June to the end of September each year and is administered on behalf of my Department by the Community Welfare division of the Health Service Executive.The BSCFA scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is intended as a contribution towards meeting the full cost of school clothing and footwear.Budget 2007 provided for an increase of €60 per child to €180 for children aged 2 to 11 years and €95 per child to €285 for children aged 12 to 22 years.In 2007, it is estimated that  over 170,000 children will benefit from the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme at an annual cost  in excess of  €38 million.  The additional cost of raising BSCFA to a rate of €250 for primary school children and €350 for children over 12 years of age as suggested by the Deputy would be approximately €12 million.  This would bring total expenditure on the scheme to more than €50m.I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  I am satisfied that the improvements to the scheme for this year provide a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who most need assistance.Any further improvements to the scheme would have to be considered in the light of resources available in Budget 2008 for improvements in social welfare payments generally.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	374	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, provides for the payment of a rent supplement to assist eligible people who are unable to provide for their immediate accommodation needs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Rent supplements are subject to a limit depending on household size and on the amount of rent that an applicant for rent supplement may incur.  The objective is to ensure that rent supplement is not paid in respect of overly expensive accommodation.Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market would have a distorting effect on the rental market, leading to a more general rise in rent levels. This in turn would worsen the affordability of rental accommodation unnecessarily, with particular negative impact for those tenants on lower incomes.Notwithstanding these limits, under existing arrangements the Health Service Executive may, in certain circumstances, exceed the rent levels as an exceptional measure, for example:where there are special housing needs related to exceptional circumstances, for example, disabled persons in specially-adapted accommodation or homeless persons,where the tenant will be in a position to re-assume responsibility for his/her rent within a short periodwhere the person concerned is entitled to an income disregard AND has sufficient income to meet his or her basic needs after paying rent, taking into account the appropriate rate of rent supplement that is otherwise payable in the case.This discretionary power ensures that individuals with particular needs can be accommodated within the scheme and specifically protects against homelessness.In January 2007 a review of the maximum levels of rent which a person may incur and still be eligible to receive a rent supplement was completed.  The purpose of the review was to inform the process of setting new limits, applicable from January 2007 until 30th June 2008.  Arising from the review rent limits were adjusted upwards for a number of household types in 14 counties, including Cork.I am satisfied that the new limits reflect realistic market conditions throughout the country and that they will continue to enable the different categories of eligible tenant households to secure and retain basic suitable rented accommodation to meet their respective needs.  The limits will be reviewed next year. Any revision found to be necessary will be implemented from 1st July 2008.

The programme is 100% funded by my Department and has cost approximately €6m to date.All schools have been advised of the programme and where excess radon levels are located, funding is provided to schools for the mitigation works. Follow-up monitoring continues to take place to ensure that the remediation action has been successful.Radon barriers are included in the design of all new school building projects.

The Act also requires schools to ensure that as regards that policy the principles of equality and the right of parents to send their children to a school of the parents choice are respected.The Act also empowers parents to pursue their rights and the rights of their children to fair and equal treatment when seeking enrolment in a school. With regard to parents who feel that their child has unjustly been refused a school place, they may appeal the school's decision to the Secretary General of the Department under section 29 of the Education Act 1998. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt and, where an appeal is upheld, the Secretary General is empowered to direct the school to enrol the student.My Department has been in contact with the National Educational Welfare Board and with the Visiting Teacher Service for Travellers to determine the circumstances of the case referred to by the Deputy.My Department has been informed that the EWO and VTT have, over the past few weeks, been in regular contact with the family of the child referred to by the Deputy and that the difficulty being experienced by the family arises from a very late application, in August, to one of the schools mentioned by the Deputy. Both the EWO and the VTT will continue to advise and assist the child's parents in relation to schools in the area and the appropriate manner of applying for a school place. The parents have also been informed of their right to appeal, under section 29 of the Education Act 1998, any decision by a school to refuse enrolment.

The child has a full time placement in a mainstream primary school with individual special needs assistant and resource teaching support together with nursing support provided by the Health Service Executive.  I understand also that building works consisting of an accessible toilet, resource room and resting room have now been completed in the school. I wish to clarify for the Deputy that SNA support is provided to assist with a pupil's care needs solely in an educational context and it is not possible to provide this support outside of the school setting.

The brief for the building project is to construct a new 24-classroom primary school to cater for a projected long-term enrolment of 600 pupils.  In addition, my Department has entered into a co-funding agreement with the Local Authority to provide additional community facilities on the school site, which will greatly enhance the indoor recreational area available to the school population and to the wider community.  An architectural design team will be appointed to the building project this month, with an instruction to progress the project as quickly as possible.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	390	In recent years, unprecedented levels of investment has been provided both to improve existing school facilities and to provide extra school places where they are needed. Improved forward planning has also been put in place through greater cooperation between the Department of Education and local authorities and the publication of 10-year Area Development Plans by my Department.This combination of investment and planning has allowed extensions to be built to schools all over Ireland, while many new schools have also been built in order to meet the needs of developing areas. Construction work this year alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils — mainly in developing areas.Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and the Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. The Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.Currently, under Section 29 of the Education Act 1998, parents of a student who has been refused enrolment in a school may appeal that decision to the Secretary General of this Department. Such appeals are dealt with within 30 days of their receipt. It is only where an appeal under Section 29 is upheld that the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) was established under the Education Welfare Act as the single statutory agency with responsibility for school attendance. The general functions of the NEWB are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education. The Board is developing a nationwide service that is accessible to schools, parents/guardians and others concerned with the welfare of young people. To this end the Board is available to provide assistance to parents who experience difficulty with obtaining a school place for their child.

On the 26th April 2007, I issued a letter of Accession to all participating members of the Battlegroup to join the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).The Nordic Battlegroup Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is an agreement between the participants comprising the Nordic Battlegroup, namely Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia, which sets out principles in relation to the operation, deployment and management of the Nordic Battlegroup.  The Operational Headquarters MoU defines the aim, principles and responsibilities for cooperation with regard to the establishment and operation of the EU OHQ in Northwood for the command and control of the Nordic Battlegroup.As part of the initial familiarisation and training phase for the Nordic Battlegroup eleven (11) members of the Defence Forces are currently deployed to the Force Headquarters in Sweden and two (2) are currently deployed to the Operational Headquarters in the UK.Our planned contribution to the Nordic Battlegroup will amount to 100 personnel involving an Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Improvised Explosive Device Disposal (E.O.D./I.E.D.D.) team with its own security detail, together with staff posts at the Operational and Force headquarters.  E.O.D. relates to normal type munitions whereas I.E.D.D. generally refers to devices devised by terrorist groups, such as car bombs etc.  This level of operational commitment will only arise should the Battlegroup be called on to undertake an operation.  The number of personnel involved operationally during the standby period, where the Battlegroup has not been mobilised to undertake an operation, will be of the order of 10 to 12 personnel.  The on-call personnel for the contingent will be based in Ireland during the Standby period.Ireland is committed in principle to participation in the Nordic Battlegroup in 2011. Very preliminary discussions have also been held regarding possible participation in the proposed Austrian/German Battlegroup in 2012.

The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Naas, Castleblayney, Kildare, and Islandbridge, Dublin.The sale of 97 acres approximately at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig was completed in 2003 for a total of €42 million. The bulk of the lands were purchased by O'Flynn Construction. The sale of a site comprising c.2.7 acres to the Southern Heath Board for €1.73 million was completed in December 2004 and the sale of a further site comprising c.1.7 acres to the HSE South for a consideration of €1.1 million approximately is expected to close shortly.  A half-acre site is being transferred to the Office of Public Works (OPW) for a consideration of €1.45 million to facilitate extension of the existing Garda Station located on Main Street, Ballincollig.  As was agreed at the time of the closure and sale of Murphy Barracks, an area comprising approximately 27 acres of the property has been transferred to Cork County Council for community use.An area comprising 19 acres approximately at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, was sold to Cork County Council in 2001 for close to €1 million for economic development of the site in conjunction with the IDA.Castleblayney Military Post, Co. Monaghan, comprising c. 10 acres, was sold to the North Eastern Health Board for €0.8 million approximately in 2002.An area comprising 7 acres approximately at Devoy Barracks, Naas, Co. Kildare, was ceded free of charge to Naas Urban District Council, while a further 14 acres were sold to that authority for €8.9 million approximately.  The balance of the Barracks lands — one acre — was sold to Kildare County Council for approximately €0.4 million in 2002.Clancy Barracks, Dublin, comprising 13.6 acres approximately, was sold to Florence Properties Ltd. for €25.4 million in 2004.The value of sales/disposals completed to date, in respect of the aforementioned five barracks the subject of the July 1998 Government decision, is in the region of €80 million.The Government decided on 1st July 2003 that Magee Barracks, Kildare, would be among the State lands released for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative.  How land at this location might play a role in the delivery of affordable housing units is a matter in the first instance for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department for the development of the Affordable Housing Initiative.  The legal formalities relating to the transfer of lands at this location are being progressed with that Department and in consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's Office.The security, maintenance, consultancy and other costs in respect of those Barracks identified for closure in 1998 are as follows :SecurityMaintenance & Other Costs€€Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig  #1,120,604257,113*Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy  #330,81342,633Castleblayney Military Post  #131,28910,548Devoy Barracks, Naas  #472,65416,959Magee Barracks, Kildare264,79618,715Clancy Barracks, Dublin #649,441203,089#Now sold or no longer in the administration of my Department (no further costs will be incurred by the Department of Defence).*Includes costs relating to the preparation of an Integrated Area Action Plan.

While no absolute guarantees can be given with regard to the safety of troops serving in missions, it is my policy and practice to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately trained and equipped to carry out their mission. All possible precautions are taken to ensure the safety of our troops. In addition, Standard Operating Procedures are kept under review in light of experience and best practice.The Deputy Chief of Staff for Support's Administrative Instruction 07/2000 entitled DEFENCE FORCES SAFETY POLICY is the primary health and safety document in the Defence Forces. This Instruction prescribes within one comprehensive document the Defence Forces policy, responsibilities, and procedures to protect and preserve Defence Force personnel and civilian employees both at home and overseas against accidents and injuries through the implementation of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 and its Regulations as well as traditional Defence Forces safety instructions and procedures.  It provides a safe approach to Defence Forces operations and activities, safe and healthy workplaces, procedures and equipment and assures statutory and regulatory compliance.It is the policy of the Defence Forces to implement the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989 and all the Regulations made under it, except insofar as these may for serious operational reasons, be exempted.  I am satisfied that in these cases the equivalent level of care is given where possible.Occasionally, normal statutory safety requirements may be incompatible with operational demands.  This is catered for in the Exemptions granted to the Defence Forces in the Safety Act, in the General Application Regulations of 1993, S.I. No. 44 of 1993, which states:‘The relevant statutory provisions shall apply to members of the Defence Forces except when they are:(a) On active service as defined in Section 5 of the Defence Act, 1954, (No. 19 of 1954) or deemed to be on active service as defined in Section 4(1) of the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1960 (No. 44 of 1960).(b) Engaged in action in the course of operational duties at sea.(c) Engaged in operations in Aid to the Civil Power.(d) Engaged in training directly associated with any of the above mentioned activities'The Commander will interpret any exemption in the narrowest possible sense, and where an activity is exempted the Commander will endeavour to ensure that the maximum equivalent level of care and safety will be applied.

The determination process is comprehensive and includes an interview and the assessment of a claim having regard to both subjective and objective factors including the consideration of detailed country of origin information before a recommendation is made.In terms of timescales at first instance for prioritised cases, an interview date is usually scheduled within 9-12 working days from the date of the initial application. These applications are normally finalised within a further 5 to 8 working days giving an average processing time of 17/20 working days from the date of application.In the case of  non-prioritised cases, an interview date is usually scheduled approximately 16 weeks from the date of the initial application. These applications are normally finalised within a further 4/5 weeks giving a total processing time of approximately 20/21 weeks from the date of application.With regard to the number of asylum applications awaiting a recommendation in ORAC, there were 1,190 outstanding applications as at the 31st August 2007.  Of these 1,190 outstanding applications, only 125 cases were on hands over 6 months.The Refugee Applications Commissioner continues to keep the procedures for processing applications for refugee status in that Office under ongoing review with a view to limiting the amount of time applicants have to wait for a recommendation to be made.Refugee Appeals TribunalThe average length of time taken by the Tribunal to process and complete Substantive appeals received between 1st July 2006 and 30th June 2007 was approximately 17 weeks.The average length of time taken by the Tribunal to process and complete Accelerated appeals (appeals on papers only) received between 1st July 2006 and 30th June 2007 was 9 weeks.The average length of time taken by the Tribunal to process and complete Prioritised appeals received between 1st July 2006 and 30th June 2007 from five countries — Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and South Africa — was 6 weeks.While many appeals are completed in a shorter time span than above, many factors such as adjournments, postponements and judicial reviews, impede the Tribunal from meeting its objective in every individual case.  High quality, consistent and fair decision making continues to be a priority in the Tribunal.As at the 31st August 2007, there were 3,041 appeals outstanding in the Tribunal. Of these 3,041 outstanding appeals, 1,893 were on hands over six months. A large volume of the appeals outstanding more than 6 months in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal is due to the delay in processing appeals pending the granting of access to Tribunal Decisions following the Supreme Court judgement (in the Atanasov case) on the matter. Following the judgement the RAT set up a comprehensive data bank of previous decisions of the Tribunal, suitably redacted, which is readily available for access by legal representatives of applicants. This data bank, along with other measures being applied by RAT, will be of considerable assistance in clearing the current backlog of cases.Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service - Repatriation areaAn application for Leave to Remain in the State arises where a non-national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(a) of the Immigration Act, 1999.  A person served with such a notice of intent to deport is, since the 10th October 2006, afforded four options, viz. to leave the State voluntarily; to consent to the making of a Deportation Order; to apply for Subsidiary Protection or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons as to why a Deportation Order should not be made and why temporary Leave to Remain in the State be granted instead.In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard to the eleven factors set out in Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act, 1999, as amended, and Section 5 (Prohibition of Refoulement) of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended.  Temporary leave to remain is considered in every case regardless of whether representations are made by, or on behalf of, the persons concerned. Each case is considered in the context of its own individual circumstances and merits; and statistics are not maintained as to the duration of the consideration process in respect of each application, as no two applications are the same.Statistics are not maintained either in a way which distinguishes between those who have made an application for leave to remain and those who have not. The total number of applications awaiting a decision for temporary Leave to Remain is 11,068 of which 10,457 is the number of asylum cases which entered the Leave to Remain process with these cases being at different stages of processing. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that many of those who failed the asylum process, and who did not opt to return voluntarily or consent to deportation, nonetheless left the State before a decision to deport or grant leave to remain was made. It is reasonable to presume that many of those listed as awaiting a decision on Leave to Remain have in fact left the jurisdiction.The total number of sanctioned staff posts in ORAC, RAT and the Repatriation area (which deals with a broad range of issues, one of which is Leave to Remain) of the Department is 464, with current staff vacancies in these areas being approximately 90.As the Deputy will no doubt be aware, the Government in April 2007 published the Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2007. The Bill sets out a legislative framework for the management of inward migration to Ireland and represents a comprehensive overhaul of the State's immigration and protection laws.The Bill will integrate into the immigration code Ireland's processes for honouring our obligations under the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and other international, including European Union, instruments designed to offer protection from persecution and other dangers. It also provides for a single protection procedure within which all grounds (protection or otherwise) on which a person may wish to remain in the State will be considered together at the same time. This contrasts with the present sequential processes for considering different aspects of the same basic question.This new integrated process will bring the State into line with processes in other EU States and will result in the functions currently carried out by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner being subsumed into the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS). The current independent appeal process for asylum claimants will remain with the establishment of the Protection Review Tribunal which will replace the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. This new body will have an expanded remit to consider, in addition to appeals against decisions not to grant refugee status, appeals against decisions not to grant subsidiary protection as defined in the EU Qualification Directive.

The processing time is, on average, 30 months and this is primarily due to the significant increase in the volume of applications received in the last number of years.  The table below shows the total number of applications received in the years 2000 to date. These figures illustrate a significant upward trend and with almost 6,000 applications received to date in 2007, this upward trend looks set to continue for the foreseeable future.YearApplications for naturalisation received20001,00420011,43120023,57420033,58020044,07420054,52320067,0302007

He was accompanied to the State by his wife and their four children, who were included on their mother's file.  Their applications were refused following consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  Subsequently, in accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed by letter dated 30 January 2006 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him.  His wife was informed by letter dated 17 January 2006 that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her four children.  All were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before orders are made; or consenting to the making of deportation orders.  Representations have been received on behalf of the persons concerned.  These persons' case files, including all representations submitted, will be considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (prohibition of refoulement).  I expect the files to be passed to me for decision in due course.

The scheme is administered on behalf of the Department by the Fire Services Council.  Local authorities also operate a Certificate Scheme in recognition of ten years' service.  There is no scheme within the Department's remit for honouring specific acts of bravery by members of the fire service.However, Comhairle na Mire Gaile, (The Deeds of Bravery Council), which was established in 1947 to provide for suitable recognition by the State of deeds of bravery, is administered by my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Comhairle can make awards of medals and certificates for deeds of bravery.  Any person or agency including local authorities can make nominations for this award.

The present legal framework, as determined by the Oireachtas, reflects this. In accordance with section 52 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003, the determination of waste management charges, and any associated waiver schemes, is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it acts as the service provider.  Similarly, where a private operator provides the collection service, it is a matter for that operator to determine charges.

I have raised a number of issues of serious concern with the Ward Union Hunt including in relation to conservation and protection of stags generally and compliance with previous licence conditions.  I will shortly make my decision on the licence application.

This arises where a financial institution objects to a local authority having the first charge on the property for clawback purposes.  My Department has advised authorities where this problem has arisen that it is not a requirement of the scheme that the authority has a first charge and that it should enter into discussions with the financial institutions involved at local level with a view to seeking a resolution to the issue.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	410	I propose to take Questions Nos. 131 to 134, inclusive, together.The Building Control Act 1990 assigns primary responsibility for complying with the Building Regulations to the owners and builders of buildings.  Responsibility for enforcement of the Regulations is vested in the 37 local Building Control Authorities, who are empowered to carry out inspections of buildings and initiate enforcement action, where appropriate.In common with all developments, local authority housing projects must comply with the Building Regulations as well as local requirements under Development Plans.  Part C of the regulations deals with site preparation and includes a provision regarding potentially dangerous substances in the ground such as radon.  The standards relating to radon defence measures are set out in the Technical Guidance Document accompanying Part C.Energy efficiency is covered in Part L of the regulations.  I intend to strengthen these provisions to achieve a 40% improvement in the energy performance of buildings over current standards and have recently published, for public consultation, a new draft Part L and Technical Guidance Document.  I will be making the new Regulations later this year and intend that they will take effect from 1 July, 2008.  My Department also set out best practice in relation to energy efficient design in Quality Housing for Sustainable Communities, published earlier this year.Proposals for the construction of social housing are examined by my Department's inspectorate, and these matters form part of their assessment.  In addition, it is intended to commence a survey of the social housing stock, including an assessment of radon concentration levels and energy efficiency, in 2008.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	411	The EU Waste Shipments Regulation sets out the controls applicable to shipments of waste within, into, and out of the European Union. It is directly applicable in the Member States. All shipments of waste must follow various procedures and control regimes, which are determined by the type of waste shipped and the type of treatment that will be applied to the waste at its destination. Thus, different levels of control regime apply, depending on the risk posed by the waste and its treatment in terms of recovery or disposal.In addition, exports to third countries of waste intended for disposal are prohibited, except to EFTA countries which are party to the Basel Convention. Exports of hazardous waste intended for recovery are prohibited, except those directed to countries to which an OECD decision applies, and to third countries which are party to the Basel Convention or countries which have concluded a bilateral agreement with the EU.Under the Waste Management (Shipments of Waste) Regulations 2007, Dublin City Council is the competent authority designated to regulate exports of waste from the State and my Department has no function in the matter.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	412	Section 10(1) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 requires a development plan to set out an overall strategy for the proper planning and sustainable development of the plan area.  Section 10(2) of the Act sets out the mandatory objectives of a development plan which include, inter alia, the conservation and protection of the environment.  Furthermore, Section 9(6) requires that development plans be consistent with national plans, policies and strategies.Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Development Plans were published by my Department in June 2007.  The guidelines, which have a statutory basis under Section 28 of the Act, state that development plans must offer clear guidance on sustainable development policies and objectives, both national and local, which address the various issues involved such as climate change and the sustainable use of natural resources.  In accordance with section 9(6), the guidelines set out that development plans should be consistent with the objectives of the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2012 and with other related Government initiatives and commitments to reducing energy consumption and modifying the impacts of climate change.Similarly, section 19(2) of the Act requires a local area plan to be consistent with the objectives of the development plan for the area in which it is situated.  Accordingly, climate change policies and objectives contained in the development plan should translate to, and be reflected in, the local area plan.Regarding a Strategic Development Zone (SDZ), section 168(2)(f) of the Act requires that an SDZ planning scheme should include proposals relating to minimizing any adverse effects on the environment, including the natural and built environment, and on the amenities of the area.In addition to the statutory requirements in relation to the planning code for development plans, local area plans and SDZs, and in keeping with Ireland's obligations on greenhouse gas emissions and the need to reduce carbon fuel energy consumption, the Programme for Government provides for a revision of Part L of the Building Regulations to "introduce new national building standards in 2007 to ensure that new housing has 40% lower heat energy demand than existing buildings standards and revise them again in 2010 to achieve a 60% target in further years".In keeping with that commitment, I published draft Building Regulations under Part L of the Building Regulations on 21 September 2007.  These draft Regulations provide for an average reduction of at least 40% in primary energy consumption and a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions.  Moreover, for the first time the Regulations will introduce:a minimum requirement for the use of renewable energy sources;energy-efficient boilers;energy-efficient artificial lighting systems; andimproved airtightness of the building fabric. The draft Regulations provide for a commencement date of 1 July, 2008.The draft Regulations and associated Technical Guidance Document are now the subject of a public consultation process, which will continue to 26 October 2007.  All submissions received will be comprehensively assessed and given due consideration prior to finalising new Building Regulations before the end of the year.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	413	Section 34 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides the statutory framework for the granting of planning permission by planning authorities for developments, including quarries, with or without conditions, or for the refusal of such permission.  In relation to quarries in particular, section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which was commenced with effect from 28 April 2004, introduced a "once-off" system of registration for all quarries, except those for which planning permission was granted in the last five years. Under the registration system, quarry operators were required to register with planning authorities by 27 April 2005.Following registration, a planning authority can impose conditions on the operation of a pre-October 1964 quarry or may require a quarry to apply for planning permission and submit an Environmental Impact Statement in certain circumstances. Authorities can also restate, modify or add to conditions on the operation of a quarry that has received planning permission more than five years ago.The Planning Act also imposes substantial obligations on planning authorities in the enforcement area.  A planning authority is statutorily obliged to issue a warning letter in relation to any unauthorised development it becomes aware of (except in the case of trivial or minor development). There is also a statutory obligation to carry out an investigation and expeditiously decide whether an enforcement notice should be issued.  The planning authority's decision on whether to issue an enforcement notice, including the reasons for the decision, must be entered on the planning register and, in cases where it is decided not to issue an enforcement notice, any complainant must be informed.Planning authorities are, of course, also subject to the law and if any person considers that he or she has been adversely affected by a planning authority's action, or lack of action, with regard to planning enforcement, which he or she considers was unlawful, unfair or unreasonable, it is open to the person involved to make a complaint to the Manager or Director of Planning in the first instance or to the Ombudsman.  I am not aware that any planning authority is not implementing the relevant provisions of the Planning Act in relation to quarries.
