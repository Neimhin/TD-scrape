In 2021 the Irish greyhound racing industry will benefit to the tune of a staggering €19.2 million from the public purse, an increase of €2.4 million on last year. Our motion presents a moral argument. Public opinion has turned on the greyhound racing industry. There has been a dramatic fall in attendance, sponsors are withdrawing and companies and organisations are choosing not to hold social and charity events in greyhound stadiums. The greyhound racing industry is rapidly declining. Its days are numbered and rightly so. A 2019 "RTÉ Investigates" documentary, "Running for Their Lives", exposed that 16,000 greyhounds are bred every year. It found that 5,987 of these are killed because they fail to make qualification times or their performance has declined. Basically, the industry kills almost 6,000 dogs annually for not racing fast enough and our Government funds it. I have seen comment after comment online falsely claiming that the "RTÉ Investigates: Running for Their Lives" documentary cannot be trusted. Bord na gCon, now Greyhound Racing Ireland, wrote a six-page complaint to the Broadcasting Authority about the documentary after it aired. The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland investigated this complaint in full and rejected it in its entirety and found instead that "the programme was a comprehensive exploration of the topic in a factual manner which was fair, objective and impartial". Setting aside the animal welfare issues for a moment, not that I believe for a second that we should, the greyhound industry is a loss-making industry that is hugely unpopular with the general public. Attendance at greyhound racing tracks fell by 55% between 2008 and 2018 and the combined loss for tracks between 2019 and 2022 is predicted to be €30 million.For how long does the Government believe we should keep propping it up? Former trainers and owners have not only highlighted issues with the industry, but have expressed no confidence in its capacity to change. The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ISPCA, the largest animal welfare organisation in the country, has stopped engaging with the industry because it does not believe the industry is serious about reform. We are one of only eight countries that allows greyhound racing and it is declining in many of the other seven as well. It is banned in all but five states in the US and it is significantly contracting in Britain. The Government and some among the Opposition want it both ways. They commend the funding and the industry for its high standards and remind us that 10% of the funding goes on animal welfare, confidential phone lines, care funds and traceability. Those measures are only necessary because of the cruel practices and structural issues within the industry and they do not go nearly far enough. Government often highlights the welfare measures and conditions laid out in the Greyhound Racing Act 2019, however, these merely establish how problematic is the industry. For example, regulations to ensure that racing greyhounds are properly registered and traceable throughout their lives, which will not be commenced until next year, are an indictment of an industry where dogs are being killed or, to use the new euphemism, go unaccounted for. Attempts by Opposition Senators and Deputies in 2019 to introduce clear regulations around the export of greyhounds and breeding practices were disregarded which means that the two most controversial malpractices in this industry are not and will not be properly regulated. Some of the most damning information comes from the industry itself. The Irish Greyhound Board’s own anti-doping and medication review, published in 2016, found “Longstanding and significant deficiencies in policies, processes, and implementation that have been undermining the integrity and reputation of greyhound racing in Ireland”. Another document, commissioned by the IGB in 2017, stated that the industry in Ireland was not focused on the sport of greyhound racing, but on breeding. It also found that the industry was “failing from both a commercial and a regulatory point of view”. That same report found that the industry produces ten times more dogs each year than are required to sustain the sport. It was this report which highlighted the lack of traceability of 6,000 dogs every year, who do not race and are not exported to the UK. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many of these non-performing greyhounds are being killed. This information is from the industry’s own report. State funding has facilitated this cascade of bad practices and horrific acts. The public does not want its money to support this industry any more. The €19.2 million that the greyhound industry is set to receive next year is more than six times what all animal welfare organisations in Ireland will receive. For some reason, the Government's solution is not only to continue funding the industry, but to increase it. This is despite the public outcry following the RTÉ documentary which exposed unspeakable acts of cruelty in the industry, the fact that this industry relies on the overbreeding of greyhounds that leads to the culling of 6,000 dogs a year, the dramatic drop in the number of people attending race meetings, sponsors publicly withdrawing their support and the fact that only 16% of the Irish population agree that Government should continue to fund this industry. The greyhound racing industry has become a financial basket case and is being kept alive by generous State subventions each year. This money could and should be spent elsewhere on much more worthy social and economic areas. We keep hearing that Government funding for the industry is not public money because it comprises ring-fenced funds from the gambling levy. It absolutely is public money. A levy is just another word for tax. Like the universal social charge, it is a tax by another name. Does anyone not consider the USC a tax on their income? I do not believe so. Furthermore, the betting levy was decreased from 5% to 1% when the fund was initially introduced and has now been raised to 2%. This means that the fund has been topped up with public money from other taxes almost since it was set up. The Taxation of Betting in Ireland report, available on the website, gov.ie , clearly outlines this. This industry is funded by public money that needs to be spent where there is real need. We have to stand up and demand that State funding be phased out and that the welfare of dogs be prioritised. I am, of course, aware that many trainers treat their greyhounds well, but that is not a valid argument to continue pumping millions of euro of taxpayers' money into an industry with such scandalous and appalling overarching standards of care that is also loss-making. It is impossible for people to understand why Government continues to fund this and has now increased funding. We are in the middle of a pandemic and constantly hear that there is not funding available for essential services like disability supports, refuge spaces for victims of domestic violence, communities that are flooding and businesses struggling as a result of the pandemic. It is beyond infuriating to see how money is being allocated. I can think of some reasons for this. There is a loud minority represented by a very strong lobby. Politicians have consistently fallen prey to this lobbying and find themselves defending the indefensible. Having been on the receiving end of this lobby, I can understand how it happens, but it is not an excuse. When I was on Cork County Council, a motion was tabled to support a stadium that was no longer viable. I was the only Cork county councillor to object. It is quite incredible that such a small percentage of representatives are opposed to this when the vast majority of the population is. It is quite literally our job to represent that population. It was quite incredible to be in exactly the same boat at the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine yesterday. Last week, a Dublin city councillor took to the airways to give me advice on what is best for rural Ireland. This Fine Gael councillor did not declare, even when asked why he was so invested, that he had worked in communications for the Irish greyhound board in 2017 and 2018. He went on to say that the Social Democrats has an animal rights agenda. I hope he did not mean to insinuate that he or his party have an animal cruelty agenda, but propping this industry up quite literally funds animal cruelty and that needs to be acknowledged.  Why do representatives not represent the population on this issue? It is partly because this is just a small taste of what one is up against when one speaks out about this issue; people also piled on me on social media and a list of other things. It is also because many people and Deputies claim that this motion is an attack on rural Ireland, that any wrongdoing in the industry is a case of a few rogue traders and that we need to give the industry time to reform. The ISPCA, the largest animal welfare organisation in the country, has stopped engaging with the greyhound racing industry because it does not believe the industry is serious about reform. It has had decades to improve standards and anything it has done has only been window dressing, yet it keeps getting more money from Government. What rural Ireland needs is investment in sustainable jobs. The greyhound industry is a loss-making industry that is hugely unpopular. The whole industry defines instability. The reality is that defending it equates to defending the indefensible. We need more public representatives to take a stand. My Social Democrats colleagues will raise the systematic issues regarding animal welfare, the financial issues in the industry and the other vital services which could benefit from this investment. Before other Deputies contribute to this discussion, I ask all speakers to state if they have or have had any links with the greyhound racing industry. It would also help for clarity and integrity if we all only referred to the greyhound racing industry. Part of the argument against our motion has put horse racing and greyhound racing together to inflate the numbers. If the Government needs to embellish its statistics like that, perhaps it might consider the validity of its points.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	1	I will pick up on a point raised by my colleague, Deputy Cairns. We know that the grant from the horse and greyhound fund for 2021 is set to be €96 million, which is to be split in the ratio of 80:20 in favour of horse racing. This motion concentrates, as the Deputy said, exclusively on greyhounds. The greyhound sector will be funded by the Exchequer to the tune of €19.2 million in 2021 when the proposed increase of €2.6 million is factored in. Without State subvention, the greyhound sector is, quite simply, not viable. At a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts, we heard from the chief executive of the IGB, Mr. Gerard Dollard, in October of last year. He spoke about the viability of tracks and told the committee that if one considers tracks from the point of view of their performance, including the tote, events and hospitality services, only the stadium in Cork and Shelbourne Park are viable. If, however, one considers the prize money the IGB pays out, no track is viable. Without the funds transferred to the IGB from the Exchequer, there would be no prize money, so no track is viable. Bord na gCon, which has now been rebranded as the Irish Greyhound Board, is a semi-state company and, uniquely, has not paid a dividend to the State in 25 years. The Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001 provided for excise duty on off-course betting to be ring-fenced.This is one of the very few examples of any tax being ring-fenced or guaranteed. Ring-fencing taxes for a specific sector is not a feature of the Irish taxation system. However, in the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act it is mentioned in regard to excise duty on off-course betting. It established a minimum level of funding and, further, it cannot be less than the amount of excise duty generated in 2000, increased by inflation. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, made a statement in June that the betting duty forecast for 2020 had been revised downward to €60 million due to Covid-19, which is €35 million lower than the receipts for 2019. It appears that this scenario is likely and that central Exchequer funding will be needed to increase the fund to the guaranteed level. It seems, therefore, that greyhound racing is more essential than many essential services. I expect that when this fund was set up most gambling would have been on horses and greyhounds. However, the advent of online gambling has changed that. Today, one can practically bet on two flies going up a wall. Commenting on the amount of funding that goes to football, which is the most played sport, Niall Quinn noted the passion for betting in this country and observed that betting on football matches accounted for more than 40% of betting in betting outlets, online and retail. He questioned why some of that income was not directed to other sports, including football. There are many things we could propose that the €19.2 million could be spent on, including animal welfare. In the area of youth work, for example, 1,400 staff and more than 40,000 volunteers support 380,000 young people across the country. In 2020, they received €61.79 million, which is about 30% less than the allocation to the horse and greyhound fund. If we look at the amount provided to other sports relative to the level of participation in them, there is nothing like the same level of transfers. I will leave it at that and allow my colleague to make further points.
#GaryGannon	unknown-#GaryGannon-party	unknown-#GaryGannon-dob	unknown-#GaryGannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	2	Today, our contributions will focus on the horrific cruelty to animals associated with the greyhound industry but it would be remiss of us not to acknowledge how corrosive gambling is to those who find themselves locked in its vice-like grip. My colleague, Deputy Cairns, requested that each Deputy declare if he or she has a conflict of interest regarding the greyhound industry or associated industries. I will declare my own interest. In my time in university I spent several years working in bookmakers. At first, it was just a job but one cannot help but see each weekend and evening how corrosive the industry is to the lives and humanity of those who find themselves in its all-encompassing grip. A gambling addiction afflicts people at every stage of their lives. Often times, it is silent. It works across demographics and afflicts people in rural and urban areas. We cannot separate the cruelty of this sport from the impact it has on people across the country. This week, 29 dog racing meetings are taking place across the country. On average, there are about ten races per card, although some have more. We can reasonably estimate that well over 300 dog races will take place this week in Ireland. That does not take into consideration the fact that every bookmaker's shop will also screen every dog race meeting in England, Scotland, Wales, Australia and anywhere else these meetings are taking place. Just before a little bell rings and the dogs go off in each race, someone will come to the counter and put €10, €20 or €50 on the race. Inevitably, we will see the problems associated with the industry inflicted on that person. Each person who walks into a bookmaker's shop has a little bit of happiness in him or her but over the course of the day, one will see that eroded. The gambling industry is draining, both for individuals and the economy. In 2017, Irish people gambled €9.8 billion, which is €379.51 per head, with a total loss of €1.3 billion, much of which comes out of household budgets. Deputies who disagree with us on this motion will point to the levies accrued from the industry. This is a moral issue, not simply an issue of how we fund the Exchequer. Since 2001 alone, the taxpayer has given more than €1.5 billion to the greyhound industry. This is an industry that is not sustainable. We will be told that this is a way of life for communities in rural Ireland. The 29 dog meetings that will take place this week will be empty, not just because of the pandemic but because that has been the case for most of them in recent years. Communities do not socialise or bond at dog meetings. They are relatively empty. Deputy Cairns has already pointed out that attendances have fallen significantly. However, race meetings are being funnelled into each and every bookmaker shop and people are having their lives destroyed as a consequence. Many Government Deputies have previously described the greyhound industry as abhorrent. It does not become any less abhorrent because someone is sitting at Cabinet. This is an industry that has long since passed its sell-by date. It does not reflect who we are as a Republic. It is corrosive not only to the animals which are suffering as a consequence of it but also to the human beings who are on the receiving end of its more negative aspects, such as the addiction that is associated with it. The people who benefit from the industry play off that addiction. The dogs killed as a consequence are viewed as par for the course. The Social Democrats introduced this motion because it is long since time the practice stopped. All we ask, however, is that the increase in funding be reallocated to animal welfare. This is an issue each of us can get behind. The motion must be agreed. It reflects who we are as a Republic. I call on all Deputies not to leave their principles at the door just because they walked into the Chamber alongside people with whom they claim to disagree at times.

and— the RCÉ implemented a Covid-19 Care Payment Scheme during the period of suspension of racing activity from March to June 2020, and some €998,000 was paid under the scheme to ensure that the welfare needs of the racing greyhound were met during a period when racing activity was suspended."Successive Governments have acknowledged the importance of the greyhound industry and have supported it through legislation and policy initiatives. The support provided by public funds through investment in the greyhound industry has enabled Ireland to develop a reputation for excellence in greyhound racing and breeding. Funding of the greyhound industry ensures that the sector achieves its maximum potential and that it contributes to economic, social and cultural development. The activity has a strong regional spread and plays a significant role in the broader economy, specifically that in rural areas. The future of the industry is dependent on a strong governance platform and on the industry having the highest standards of integrity and welfare founded on a strong regulatory system. The Covid-19 pandemic poses particular challenges for Rásaíocht Con Éireann and the greyhound racing industry as a whole. The Government's plan for living with Covid-19, Resilience and Recovery 2020-2021, does not provide, at any of the levels set out, for a return to full commercial operations. This will impact significantly on the finances of Rásaíocht Con Éireann this year and up to the end of the time span of the plan in June 2021. It is essential, in these circumstances that additional Covid-related supports are made available to Rásaíocht Con Éireann, reflecting costs incurred and changes to the trading environment. According to the 2017 Power report, the greyhound industry provides and supports considerable employment, directly and indirectly, across the Irish economy. It is estimated that the industry supported 5,058 full-time and part-time jobs in the economy in 2016. In addition, there are 7,313 active greyhound owners. The total number of people deriving economic benefit from the sector is estimated at 12,371. Greyhound racing is an important part of the fabric of rural Ireland and traditionally has strong links to farming. However, it also enjoys a strong urban support base. The industry also contributes to poverty proofing by providing an additional income for members of the farming community in particular. The industry and sport are open to male and female participants, with both high-profile male and female trainers currently involved in the industry. The future of the industry is dependent on a strong governance platform and on the industry having the highest standards of integrity and welfare founded on a strong regulatory system. Provisions in the Greyhound Racing Act 2019, which came into effect on the 28 May 2019, will make a real difference. This legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability. The Act will improve the governance of Rásaíocht Con Éireann, strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions and improve integrity within the sector. It provides the industry with real tools with which it can effect fundamental change and reform. Animal welfare issues are central to Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine engagements with the greyhound sector and funding is contingent on animal welfare measures being implemented. The Department ring-fenced 10% of the fund allocation to Rásaíocht Con Éireann in 2020 for welfare initiatives and will implement similar criteria for funding in 2021. Rásaíocht Con Éireann has been implementing an ambitious care and welfare programme, with a suite of measures being progressed, including the opening of the first care centre in Thurles in July 2020, the implementation of an extensive rehoming programme with over 1,300 greyhounds rehomed in 2020 and the introduction of a financial incentive for all domestic rehoming to encourage more rehoming in Ireland. A key element of the new legislation is the provision for the first time for a traceability system. The greyhound industry is predominantly a rural industry with a strong urban support base and the Covid-19 crisis, as in other sectors of the economy, resulted in a collapse of commercial activity in greyhound racing and a significant reduction of activity generally. Recovery of the industry will require ongoing support to aid restoration of normal levels of activity and to adequately manage the welfare issues that arise.  The advent of new technologies and business models has challenged Government to re-evaluate the funding mechanisms for the industry. As part of its overall commitment to the industry, the Government has addressed, through legislation, the anomaly whereby remote and online betting operators were outside the tax net. Betting tax was increased from 1% to 2% in budget 2019 and, as I said earlier, contributed €95 million to the Exchequer in 2019. The funding being provided to the greyhound racing sector helps sustain a long-standing tradition as the industry is part of the social fabric of our country. This funding underpins economic activity in what are, in many instances, less affluent regions. Relieving the burden on our major urban centres and nurturing rural economies is a key priority for the Government. In this context, this industry should be given recognition for its contribution to rural economic activity and employment. It is crucial that we support the sector at this critical time as it faces the perils of Covid-19 and Brexit as we enter 2021. In doing so, we will help to support and protect both jobs and the economic benefit derived by individuals involved in the sport and industry. Accordingly, I am seeking the support of this House to ensure Rásaíocht Con Éireann can receive the funding provided for in budget 2021. I commend the countermotion to the House.

For many, this was the first time they were confronted with the reality of what goes on behind closed doors in greyhound racing and it spurred a major public outcry. Since the airing of that programme, there has been an increased public focus on welfare practices. However, 18 months on it is difficult to point to the practical application of commitments from the industry and, increasingly, there is the potential for resources to be transferred away from welfare matters towards commercial activities without oversight or consequence. An examination of welfare spend in recent years is revealing. On average, in the years 2014 to 2018 the then Irish Greyhound Board spent a mere 0.2% of its budget on welfare measures. This is set out very clearly under the heading "Contributions to Greyhound Welfare and Irish Retired Greyhound Trust". It is clear that the resources directed towards welfare in the greyhound industry were insufficient to upholding the necessary standards. In 2019, the Greyhound Racing Ireland annual report no longer detailed contributions to greyhound welfare and the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust on its own and makes it impossible to compare welfare spending to other years on a like-for-like basis. Priority should have been given to funding the widespread implementation and promotion of the care fund for greyhounds, including foster schemes, care centres, the greyhound industry support scheme and the freephone welfare line, all of which were committed to by the then Irish Greyhound Board. It should also be noted that a considerable proportion of the care fund is being ring-fenced by Greyhound Racing Ireland to develop and maintain a traceability system for greyhounds.Traceability is a basic operational requirement and the funding for it should not be taken from an already unstable and insufficient pot proposed for the purposes of animal welfare initiatives. Following an increase in funding last year, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has stated that funding for the industry is contingent on maintaining and implementing welfare standards. However, despite seeking further information, it is unclear how these welfare standards are tracked and evaluated against future funding. Indeed, the worry is that there is no formalised structure in place at all. There should have been a strict formal way to make public funding for Greyhound Racing Ireland dependant on transparent, trackable welfare measures. Allocating taxpayers' money to an industry with serious animal cruelty concerns and crossing one's fingers that it will be used for welfare is simply not good enough. A considerable proportion of current welfare funds is being set aside to develop a traceability system, but such a system should be a basic operational requirement unrelated to welfare initiatives. Proper traceability systems track the entirety of a greyhound's life and are essential to tackling harmful welfare practices and overbreeding. Without a reliable system starting from birth, there is no clear record of breeding, euthanasia or export. Equally, there is no transparent rigorous system of inspection in respect of greyhound breeders. Inspections are vital in increasing accountability among breeders and ensuring compliance with the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2005. However, this has not happened. It is clear that by contributing millions of euros of taxpayers' money, the Government is propping up an inherently cruel industry which the Irish public has been increasingly rejecting. It is now time to phase out this industry.

The LauraLynn Foundation, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, the Parkinson's Association of Ireland, Dementia Ireland, the Samaritans, SpunOut, the Irish Red Cross, Pieta House and the Rape Crisis Centres all provide invaluable services to many vulnerable people. They also all receive less money from Government than the greyhounds receive on an annual basis. The LauraLynn Foundation is the hospice that provides terminally ill children, yet it gets less money than the greyhounds. Joe Biden stated: "Don't tell me what you value; show me your budgets and I'll tell you what you value." Unfortunately, this Government and many Opposition Deputies value and prioritise an industry that has a history of questionable governance and animal welfare issues and that is unviable, untenable and unsustainable. For 20 years the State has given special treatment to this sector and provided ring-fenced funding to the tune of approximately €200 million since the Greyhound Racing Act was passed in 2001. I know very few sectors that have been given this special treatment. One would be hard-pressed to see so much funding ring-fenced in respect of front-line community services, despite the huge demand for their outreach supports. During the pandemic, incidences of domestic violence have been on the rise, mental health issues have increased and disability services have been shut down due to Covid-19, yet these sectors have received marginal support from the State to meet the rise in demand. To add insult to injury, the State has decided to increase the funding for the greyhound industry by €2.4 million in the budget for 2021. Funding of €19 million could go a long way towards addressing the increased demand for domestic violence services, and the increase in the number of first-time callers to organisations such as Women's Aid. The shadow of the pandemic is looming large in our society, and it is not cheap for organisations like Women's Aid to carry out awareness campaigns, to fund helplines and to provide that fundamental service to women and children who are suffering from domestic violence. It is certainly not cheap to run a shelter for women and their children, and the money simply is not there for that. The same applies to youth services, which my colleague also mentioned. These services received €5 million in the budget for 2021, but investing in these youth services could pay a society a huge dividend - much more than that from the greyhound industry. I also want to note that a climate and biodiversity crisis has been declared in this country. This morning, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, published its report, Ireland's Environment, which really lays bare the state of our environment. Despite this, front-line environmental organisations are still inadequately funded. If one takes BirdWatch Ireland as an example, it received a paltry €16,000 from the Government in comparison with the €19.2 million that will be given to the greyhound industry next year. The Irish Wildlife Trust received €15,000 in funding. It is now time to put our money where our mouth is and start funding these services that will actually do something for our country and its communities. To the Deputies who argue that this is a rural versus urban issue, I say that it absolutely is not. This is an issue about how the State decides to spend its money and what it prioritises. Rural women need access to domestic violence services and rural communities need access to mental health and dementia services. It is not a rural versus urban issue, and if, as those Deputies are saying, this industry is so successful and important to the economies of our rural towns and villages, well, fine, let us regulate it. However, the industry should stand on its own four legs. We cannot afford to fund this industry. There are other issues and priorities that we should be funding. This is not a complicated motion or issue. The choice is clear: will this Government decide to stand with organisations on the front line of the pandemic and the environmental crisis or will it continue to stand beside, and devote precious resources to, an industry that continues to lose taxpayers' money, which invests in practices that result in the killing of animals and an industry that no longer reflects the majority wishes of the people?
#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	6	I am sharing time with Deputy Martin Browne. At the outset, I want to disassociate myself from those who have attacked the fact that this debate is even taking place. No organisation, body or sector can receive tens of millions of euro in public money without expecting public debate on the expenditure of that money. Having said that, we know that the greyhound sector plays an important social and economic role in many communities. It is made up of many good individuals who care for their dogs and contribute positively to society, but there are real and very genuine concerns - these are shared by many people - regarding animal welfare in the sector and the accountability and transparency relating to the State funding given to the sector. We in Sinn Féin support Exchequer funding for sectors that bring a benefit to rural economies and communities, including the horse and greyhound sectors. We also believe that with Exchequer funding comes responsibility. When public monies are invested, there must be public accountability. Funding for the greyhound industry in 2020 amounted to €17 million, which, by any standard, is a substantial level of funding. We know that a 2017 assessment suggested that greyhound racing delivers an economic benefit of around €302 million, primarily in rural communities, which means jobs, investment and resources in areas that are often devoid of opportunities for development. The sector is facing the same pressures as others as a result of Covid-19, and that is a reality which also cannot be ignored. A number of questions have arisen in respect of the funding of the greyhound sector as a result of this debate. The first of these is whether any funding at all should go to the sector. The motion tabled by the Social Democrats calls for the phasing out of all funding by 2025. Sinn Féin does not support this proposition. As I have said, this would have a detrimental economic impact on many rural communities that have already been left behind. It would also be detrimental to the stated objective behind the motion.Should all State funding to the industry be removed it would result in the sector operating purely on a for-profit basis. I believe that most people will starkly see what this would mean for animal welfare. The motion also relies heavily upon analysis that the sector would not be financially viable independent of Exchequer funding. This fails to acknowledge that almost all social sporting and cultural pursuits would face the exact same challenges if all Exchequer funding was withdrawn. Accepting the premise that funding can be warranted, the second question is around what conditions come with the funding. I mentioned the very real and valid concerns regarding animal welfare. All funding must be contingent on the highest standards of animal welfare and care. It is not good enough to just say that the standards are high. There must be robust monitoring and enforcement of those standards, which must be carried out independently. Aside from welfare, there is a requirement to ensure there is full accountability and transparency in how all moneys are spent. An organisation that receives millions of euro in public funding should present all of its accounts for scrutiny. There must also be an assessment of how the moneys are distributed. The greatest concern and complaint I have with greyhound industry funding comes from within the sector itself. Many breeders and smaller operators tell me that they do not get a fair slice of the cake despite doing everything correctly, from their point of view. There is no point in lauding the economic benefits of these funds if we do not make sure the funds go to where they will have the greatest benefit. I am sceptical that the diversion of huge portions of the funding into prize money actually results in the trickle-down redistribution that is often suggested. The third question is whether the Government's proposal to increase the funding to the greyhound sector by €2.4 million in 2021 is warranted. Sinn Féin cannot support that proposal. The Government has failed to offer an outline for the rationale for this particular increase. Why was €2.4 million necessary? Why was €1.4 million not sufficient? Why was €3.4 million not required? The truth is that it is an arbitrary figure. It is arbitrarily linked to the horse racing fund that has been divided on an 80%-20% basis for several years. When I asked the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, in committee yesterday for the rationale for this particular breakdown he essentially responded that it was always done this way. This House has not been provided with a business case, with an economic assessment or any independent analysis that this funding is particularly required for this sector next year. Given the many competing and urgent demands on public services such as our health service at this time, Sinn Féin does not believe it is prudent to increase funding to the greyhound industry this year in the absence of such analysis. Even within the Department of Agriculture and the Marine there are several sectors that require additional funding. Our suckler farmers are under immense pressures. Our sheep farmers are struggling to make ends meet. Many family farms have been hit by Covid-19 in a variety of ways, including through the loss of second incomes and other pressures. They too would benefit from additional funding. The case has not been sufficiently made that the greyhound sector deserves it more than any other. Sinn Féin's amendment recognises that funding is required for the sector but calls for an increase of €2.4 million to be waived. It calls for funding to be contingent on the highest animal welfare standards being in place and for these to be adequately monitored and enforced. The amendment calls for full accountability and transparency to be in place. It also calls for a long-term strategy for the sector to be developed. This strategy is pivotal. If there is to be a future for the greyhound sector in Ireland, and it is our wish that there will be, then there must be a plan; it cannot be business as usual. It cannot be a case that Governments come to this House year after year proposing increases in funding without adequately outlining how this money will be invested. In 2014 the greyhound sector received an annual payment of €11 million. This funding has risen every year since, bar one year. The Government now proposes that next year the funding will be increased to €19.2 million. Quite frankly, the sector should be thriving with such support. Those at the heart of it, the local breeders, the trainers and those ancillary workers tell me that it is not. The obvious deficiencies need to be addressed before any more blank cheques are signed. While recognising that the industry has made some improvements in animal welfare it would be absolutely foolhardy to suggest that all is fixed. It is not. Most people in the sector will acknowledge that. If the issue of animal welfare is not given the urgent consideration that it necessitates, then public opinion will quickly move to a point whereby no Government will be in a position to allocate these types of resources. I thank Deputy Cairns for bringing this issue to debate in the House. It is one of those issues where both the original motion and the Government amendment warrant consideration and make valid positions, but for the reasons I have outlined I believe that the Sinn Féin amendment is the most appropriate course of advancement on this issue.
#MartinBrowne	unknown-#MartinBrowne-party	unknown-#MartinBrowne-dob	unknown-#MartinBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	7	I also want to talk on the Sinn Féin amendment to the motion. I assure Deputy Cairns that I have no interest in or connection with the greyhound industry, good, bad or indifferent. I must make it clear that Sinn Féin is not opposed to State support for the greyhound sector. I am from County Tipperary where greyhound racing makes an important contribution economically and socially for many families in my constituency. It is a tradition and a skill that has been handed down through the generations. Many people in my constituency believe it is a staple part of rural life. While some people may agree with greyhound racing and others will not, I do know that the reason for the scandal that shocked the country and rocked the sector last year cannot be attributed to the vast majority of those involved in the sport. That is a truth that I must put out there. The vast majority of those who rear, train and walk their dogs along the roads in my county care for their animals. They carefully rear them, they look after them, make sure they get the veterinary attention they need, and ensure they get plenty of exercise. They were appalled at all of those revelations and were ashamed at the practices of some rogue practitioners. Abuse of this nature must be condemned outright. There are no words available that can describe the sense of outrage that was felt. Anybody who sees a dog, or any animal, as something that can be abused, neglected or cast aside without a second thought, is someone I do not want to know. It is someone who should have the full force of the law brought down upon them. This brings me to the next issue I want to address, which is the funding of the greyhound industry and animal welfare. At yesterday's Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine we heard the concern of everyone present for the welfare of the dogs involved in the greyhound racing sector. The issue of animal welfare was one of the key measures raised during the meeting, and quite rightly so. We were told that Greyhound Racing Ireland, GRI, has put into effect a number of measures to address the issue, but of course we need to ensure that these measures are all fully implemented, followed through, and have the desired result. For these reasons, Sinn Féin wants to ensure that a significant portion of the funding given is ring-fenced towards the welfare of greyhounds and to ensure the end of the practice of over breeding, which leads to culling. If the State is to contribute money to GRI then it is crucial that a good portion of that money is used to ensure that the horrors we saw last year are addressed and wiped out. To ensure this happens and is being maintained involves a persistent approach. It requires time, commitment and a good track record. These revelations are fresh in our minds and we have to accept that genuine concerns remain and that a vigilant approach must be taken. This is why Sinn Féin's amendment to the Bill calls for the Government to work with the sector to improve animal welfare with monitoring and enforcement. We must make full sure that the commitments made are delivered upon. It will require constant monitoring and it is a job of all of us in this House to ensure the Government continues to follow up on this commitment. I thank the many organisations out there that help unwanted or abused greyhounds. We have some of those organisations in my own county and they provide a service that makes me proud. They are crucial in our humane response to the scandal. I shall now turn to the funding for the sector. An increase in funding is proposed. Sinn Féin does not believe it is right to spend an additional €2.4 million when households and families are struggling more than ever. There is less money entering families' coffers but demands for rent have not gone away, the Government has seen to that. The health service is about to come under the usual winter pressure, with the added demands of Covid-19. We need to channel all the resources we can into the vital services that people reply on. Sinn Féin is willing to work with the industry to develop a long-term strategy to ensure the sector's viability going forward. The Government needs to step up here also. I and my party want to ensure that the money given to support the sector is spent in the right way, goes to the right people and the right practices.If this is achieved it will make for a viable sport.  This is important because the greyhound industry is a significant contributor to rural Ireland. An assessment carried out in 2017 found that nearly 12,500 people derived economic benefit from activity within the sector. This figure cannot be dismissed. It is estimated that the greyhound industry benefits rural Ireland most through the €302 million it generates. Like the agricultural sector, this is important to rural Ireland. Money generated in communities generally makes its way around them. It has significant knock-on effects and helps the wider locality. The use of Exchequer funding by Greyhound Racing Ireland, GRI, must be transparent. The funding must reach all involved in the industry, particularly the smaller operators who make greyhound racing what it is in my county. It must be proven that whatever commitments have been made to qualify for club funding are delivered on, or at least that a concerted effort to do so is made.  The greyhound sector plays an important role in the economic and social life of rural Ireland. If someone walks, drives or cycles down any road, he or she will find someone else walking a greyhound, whatever the weather. It is more than a sport. It is a way of life, a pastime and a passion. Most of the people one sees walking dogs on a daily basis do not make obscene amounts. They are preserving their way of life. They are involved in an engaging pursuit, a way of life that has been replicated for generations. Greyhound racing is many people's one and only social outlet. They care and they need support.  The Government has said that the greyhound industry has improved its governance and practices. I welcome this, but in light of the level of abuse revealed in last year's "RTÉ Investigates", constant surveillance is needed to ensure those efforts are doubled and tripled. The Government must continue to work with GRI to improve and progress animal welfare monitoring in the industry. We must also identify and adopt a long-term strategy to ensure the viability of the sector. Sinn Féin's amendments put welfare first and foremost, support the sector and note the contribution it makes to rural Ireland.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	17521	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	8	Many sports in Ireland, including greyhound racing, receive State funding. We share the concern of the many people who have expressed deep unease about the welfare of greyhounds bred for racing. We welcome any progress on the welfare of greyhounds but see any current measures as only the first step on a very long road. There is a long way to go before anyone can safely say that welfare issues have been addressed to everyone's satisfaction. For many years, the Labour Party has consistently called for higher standards of animal welfare in many areas of society, including the greyhound sector. We welcome the progress which has been made to advance the welfare of greyhounds. Since 2010, the Labour Party has endeavoured to make the greyhound racing sector operate on a revenue-neutral basis by ensuring that a percentage of the funding raised through the betting tax is used to support the sector. That proposal is now reality. The Labour Party does not support the removal of State funding for greyhound racing at this time. We are fearful that any defunding now would lead to the gradual resumption of a regime where practices were not subject to any proper scrutiny. The Horse and Greyhound Fund gives the taxpayer power. It makes the taxpayer the scrutineer of all welfare practices. I would be very reluctant to remove that power at a time when the attention paid by the public to this sector has never been greater. We will continue to support further measures to enhance the welfare of greyhounds. I particularly welcome the fact that 10% of the State funding given to greyhound racing is spent exclusively on the care and welfare of greyhounds. This is a positive first step but it should not be the endpoint. I welcome the fact that the sport's governing body, Rásaíocht Con Éireann, has been implementing a care and welfare programme.  However, the Government amendment is a cut-and-paste job based on a Rásaíocht Con Éireann briefing note. This amendment does nothing for the sustainability of the greyhound sector. One fundamental issue is whether the board of Rásaíocht Con Éireann enjoys the confidence of the wider public and its own stakeholders on delivering on the agenda of animal welfare and the sustainability of the sector. We contend that the only way to ensure confidence is to make tangible improvements beyond the measures implemented so far. For instance, we would like to see evidence a nationwide roll-out of care centres similar to the one in Tipperary. Evidence of the construction of a second centre might build some confidence. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that designating 10% of the fund for welfare and rehoming would allocate €1.9 million to the purpose. That is a significant pot of money, which will not be available if funding is cut or phased out over time. Public trust in the sector and the administration thereof is very low. Recent revelations in the industry are proof of that. The only way to restore that trust is a further roll-out of care centres across the country and clear evidence of rehoming. This is not just the demand of the public. Owners and trainers throughout the country are calling for the same thing. In my experience, greyhound owners are intelligent people who know instinctively that the future of their sector, which is loss making, depends on a transparent and world-class welfare and rehoming programme that demands 100% traceability. Every trainer I have spoken to is looking forward to the traceability regime and accepts it with open arms. Such a regime is dependent on a governance structure that subjects the expenditure of public money to the type of rigorous oversight we witnessed when Deputy Alan Kelly had the sector in his sights at the Committee on Public Accounts. We need further evidence of the roll-out of the traceability system. Until then, doubts will remain. Turning to the fund itself, we note that the 2010 Labour Party proposal has become practice. Back then, we proposed that the Horse and Greyhound Fund should be revenue-neutral. We welcome the increase in the betting tax, which yielded €95 million in 2019. We fear that any defunding of the greyhound sector, which has been proposed in the many emails I have received on the matter, would force animal welfare gains backwards. We contend that the money given to the fund gives the taxpayer skin in the game and helps to ensure animal welfare and traceability standards are met. I note that the motion does not refer to the horse racing industry, which whether we like it or not also has serious welfare issues. If the fund is revenue-neutral, we should bag the very small gains that have been made on welfare and traceability and use the funding to make further gains. The relevant Oireachtas committee should ensure that those responsible for animal welfare in the horse and greyhound sectors are subject to rigorous and independent scrutiny on a regular basis. For instance, the statement by the board referring to the implementation of an extensive rehoming programme, with more than 1,300 greyhounds rehomed in 2020 to date with assistance from the Irish Retired Greyhound Trust, should be subject to greater scrutiny.  The board claims that the traceability system will ensure that important events in the life of racing greyhounds, including birth, microchipping, registration, racing career, changes of ownership or trainer location, export, retirement and end of life, are accurately recorded. This should be subject to ongoing and rigorous scrutiny.The Social Democrats is right to shine a light on an important and vital sector, which traverses urban and rural life. Taking away its funding is not the best way to bring about these urgently needed changes.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	9	I thank Deputy Cairns and the Social Democrats for bringing this motion forward. Since I was elected, my colleagues and I have been among a small number of Deputies who every year have opposed the handing over of public funds to the greyhound racing industry. It is great to see this motion and the debate we are having. The bottom line is that there is enormous cruelty involved in the greyhound racing industry. That is an unavoidable point. That does not mean there are not greyhound racers who love their dogs and treat them well - of course there are - but incredible cruelty is involved in the industry. It is that which many of the speakers in this debate want to avoid. Up to 6,000 dogs a year are killed because they do not race fast enough. Greyhounds are exported to places which effectively have no animal welfare standards, including Macau. There are horrific stories of dogs being boiled alive, not to mention the use of drugs in the greyhound racing industry in Ireland. There is a deep cruelty involved in it. RTÉ did the public an enormous service with its "RTÉ Investigates: Greyhounds Running for Their Lives" programme last year. It shone a light on this reality that many are trying to avoid. It was so blatant that even a Government Minister at the time was forced to express his "deep concern". What was the punishment for the industry after that exposé of cruelty and barbarity? It is to provide an extra €2.4 million in subsidies next year, which is incredible. It seems that when it comes to this cruel practice, the Government has deep concern, but even deeper pockets. It is proposing to hand over almost €20 million next year to line the pockets of the greyhound industry. Without that funding, the industry simply would not survive; it would go away and with it would go the cruelty that comes with greyhound racing.  It is worth looking at what else this money could be spent on. It is ironic that it is the Government that normally tells the left it cannot spend money on everything and it is necessary to make tough choices. The choice the Government is making is to give this money to a cruel industry, as opposed to, for example, the Health and Safety Authority, HSA. The HSA, which is responsible for maintaining workplace health and safety and protects millions of workers in Ireland, gets the same support as the greyhound industry. That is a political choice. We can also talk about the underfunding of our refuges. Today is International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and it is a choice not to put this money into the area of gender violence. It is time to stop subsidising cruelty. I will briefly respond to the points made by Deputy Sherlock from the Labour Party and, unfortunately, the contributors from Sinn Féin. They do not bode well for my Bill to ban hare coursing, unfortunately. Deputy Sherlock's argument was that we should keep giving this industry money because we buy some animal welfare standards. Animal welfare standards can be set down in law and animal welfare can be insisted upon. It is not necessary that we fund this industry. It is a nonsensical argument to continue funding this cruel industry, which should have its funding removed. We should spend that money elsewhere.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	10	On this International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, it is worth making the point - we discussed this issue last week - that the budget given out by the Minister for Justice to support organisations providing support to women suffering from violence is only a fraction of the overall budget for the greyhound racing. It says a lot about our society that we think more of this cruel industry than we do of protecting women who are very vulnerable. Having read the Minister's statement, it strikes me that he is basically making a Keynesian argument to justify funding for this industry in that it returns more to the Exchequer than it costs as it stimulates economic activity in different areas. The Minister needs to spell out exactly what he means. My father was an avid greyhound racing fan and I remember going as a child with him to Harold's Cross greyhound racing stadium. From what I saw there, most of the economic activity was at the Tote booth where people were putting on bets. If that is the activity to which the Minister is referring, he needs to spell that out. Even in a classical Keynesian argument, however, the €1 billion spent since 2000, to which the Minister referred, could have been spent on more worthwhile projects that would have benefited the people of rural Ireland in a real way, for example, the western rail corridor. If there is that much worry about rural Ireland, surely thought could be given to doing that in a more sustainable way. This money could be spent on renewable projects and public housing on public land. That would definitely stimulate the economy without inflicting the unbelievable cruelty emanating from this industry, to which previous speakers referred. In comments that a fully endorse, Nuala Donlan, a spokesperson for Greyhound Action Ireland, stated:Instead of ending funding, they have sanctioned an increase of €2.4 million on last year's figure, thus ensuring the widespread abuse and killing of unwanted dogs by this industry will continue. It is hugely regrettable that the Green Party has now become complicit in propping up an activity that inflicts such suffering and death on the beautiful, gentle greyhound.It is worth noting that the organisation was also highly critical of the Minister of State, Senator Pippa Hackett, in particular. Deputy Shane Cassells of Fianna Fáil, another Government party, was quoted as saying at a meeting of the Committee of Public Accounts attended by Bord na gCon that it was "galling" and "sticks in the craw" that this much public money goes to this industry. He also said that more people were on the home help waiting lists than attended dog racing in his constituency. That is an important point. The issues which really affect society are being ignored for the benefit of a tiny few who gain from this industry. The point made by that Fianna Fáil Deputy and the opposition shown in the past by the Green Party should be highlighted because they are now being utterly hypocritical, as we will see from how they will vote on the motion. I thank the Social Democrats for tabling the motion. I take the point made about the horse racing industry. More money is being spent on the horse and greyhound racing industries on the basis that they stimulate the economy. There are far better ways to stimulate the economy than by inflicting gross cruelty on innocent animals. We know that not spending that money would obviously hurt some people who are passionate about greyhound racing, but the point is that we must get our priorities right. We fully endorse the motion.

It is a serious time, with Covid-19 and people on their knees all over the country with the way the economy is. I would love to see a motion being brought forward to support an industry. This industry and its spin-offs are vital to rural and urban Ireland and to many families. There are 40,000 jobs in the horse racing and greyhound racing sectors. It is great to listen to the contributions from the parties of the left here. Where are they going to get the money from to have some other industry instead? We do not have it. This is part of our heritage and culture. The vast majority of the greyhound people love and protect their animals and are diligent about animal welfare. They resent being tarred by the RTÉ programme and being included with some rogues. Any rogue element in the industry should be banished from it. There is no truck with that. Many greyhound owners are small farmers who are involved for the supplementary business. They always look after their animals and they love, tend and nurture them. We want supports. We want Government support and we welcome this funding being put into the industry because it comes back in spadefuls. It benefits the physical and mental health of the people in this sector.Deputies should be supporting them in this time of need rather than putting forward a motion that will diminish, if not wipe out, an entire industry. What will replace it? What will replace the money that is earned and the satisfaction provided? I support the greyhound industry 100%. People should be left with their animals, allowed to nurture and mind them and to have their hare coursing and greyhound racing. Racing is worth so much to Clonmel as well.

I certainly have not been lobbied by anybody. I will make up my own mind based on what the people of Cork South-West tell me. The people of Cork South-West have spoken to me, including people that own and love greyhounds. They love walking their dogs, minding and caring for them but they are being treated like outcasts who have done something wrong. Do Social Democrat Deputies realise that 10% of the funding will be spent on greyhound care centres, foster homes for greyhounds, injury clinics and on the confidential telephone line? There is a whole lot of care attached to this funding. It is not all bad and negative news. It is a terrible thing to suggest that all greyhound owners are bad people on the basis of one RTÉ programme broadcast last year. A lot of issues come up on television from time to time and we will jump from one issue to another on that basis. I certainly will not support this motion. I will support the people who have greyhounds and the people of Cork South-West who love and care for their dogs. I will not support this motion in any way, shape or form.

Deputies have told mistruths about the respectable people involved in this industry. The image of 6,000 dogs disappearing per year is factually incorrect. Under the IGB system, dogs are registered at 12 weeks of age and are named before they are 12 months old. If a dog gets two trials and races on an Irish track, that dog can then be sold in England or elsewhere. It can be retired abroad if it is not good enough for racing here and can finish up in a good home in Germany, Italy or anywhere. On the system, it will look like that dog has disappeared but the dog could be quite happy and alive. For people to portray that image is wrong. The impression has been given that this is taxpayers' money and that is also wrong. The money is coming from the betting industry. I have heard people saying derogatory things today about the betting industry. Is there something wrong with a person having a drink? Is there something wrong with a person having a bet? There is not. I am friends with people who go to the racetrack in Tralee on a weekly basis. They might bet €5 a night in total, placing 50 cent on this dog and 50 cent on that. They are making small bets. These are retired people, predominantly, and they love the enjoyment of the bit of sport. It is not as though they are betting the household weekly budget but that is the impression that is being given here.  Every dog is worth a lot of money in this country. The greyhound sector generates more than €300 million worth of business in the economy. The amount being provided by the State is very small. Furthermore, a lot of the money that the Social Democrats want to take away is actually for the protection and well-being of the animals.

I know many ordinary people who have greyhound racing dogs and they are very good people. Limerick is lucky to have a state-of-the-art stadium for greyhound racing. I want to get rid of the myth that a night out at the dogs means the death of a dog or a hare. That is not factual. A mechanical hare is used. People in this country are entitled to their traditions. We must consider the 12,500 people who are employed directly or indirectly. We have a minority of people who have no respect for their dogs and they need to be dealt with through the hard rigours of the law. However, we also have great people who are looking after their dogs, walking them and nurturing them. It should be noted that €95 million went into the Exchequer through the dog system and the people who care for their dogs. In 2018 and 2019, the sum of €6 million was raised for charities, for people that the Government cannot support, through the dog industry. The next thing the Social Democrats will be calling for is a ban on the cat chasing the mouse. For God's sake, wake up people.

It is their culture and their sport and they are entitled to have it, like everyone else. To say that it is wrong to give this money to the greyhound industry is totally wrong. These people deserve and are entitled to their sport. RTÉ said that 6,000 dogs were destroyed but that is wrong. I can give an example of a father and two sons who had 35 old dogs between them. They rehomed the animals themselves. They are looking after them. The dogs have hot floors and are being bedded, fed and kept right. There is a care fund for injuries and welfare, with 10% of admission fees and 5% of the Tote going towards animal welfare. There are greyhound care centres in Kerry, Tipperary, Limerick, Cork, Clare, Belfast and Dublin. There is a demand for old greyhounds abroad in places such as Montreal, the USA and mainland Europe, with people taking them as pets. Dogs have not been destroyed in the way suggested. These people are paying their way in betting taxes that they pay every night when they place their little bets. A lot of that money is going to the central fund when it should be going to the industry. I support the money provided by the Government to make up for lost gate receipts and returns that the industry did not enjoy this year because of the coronavirus.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	17	I thank Deputy Cairns and the Social Democrats for tabling this motion, which seeks to waive the increased funding of €2.4 million due to be given to the greyhound industry, to incrementally refocus greyhound racing funding on the welfare of dogs impacted by the breeding and racing associated with the industry and work towards the gradual phasing out of State support for the greyhound industry by 2025. A reality check is needed here. Attendance at greyhound tracks around Ireland fell by a massive 15,900 in the first two months of 2020 according to an economic report commissioned by the IGB. The Indecon report, published earlier this month, shows that more and more people are turning their backs on cruel greyhound racing and are staying away from the tracks. Attendances plummeted by more than 50% in the past decade and the downward trend has continued into 2020. In January and February, respectively, numbers dropped by 7,200 or 30% and 8,600 or 28% compared to the same period in 2019. The authors of the report predict that the greyhound industry is likely to experience a continued decline in attendance levels and that this decline will accelerate. As I said, the greyhound racing industry has witnessed a significant decline in attendance over the past decade. The report outlines that 1.1 million attended races in 2008 but this had fallen by 55% to just over 500,000 by 2018. It adds that a further negative impact was seen in 2019 that was likely to exacerbate the pre-existing long-term decline and that the latest attendance figures for January and February of this year show that this decline has continued.  A breakdown of the figures shows that the IGB's Dublin track at Shelbourne Park sustained a massive 36% drop in attendance in January 2020 compared to the same month last year. Attendance continued to fall at Shelbourne Park in February when it was down by 41% from 8,900 to 5,200. The track has seen twice-weekly protests since the broadcasting of the "RTÉ Investigates: Greyhounds Running for their Lives" documentary which led to nationwide boycotts of greyhound racing and several companies disassociating themselves from the so-called sport. Shelbourne Park is one of the worst tracks in Ireland for greyhound injuries and deaths. At least 178 greyhounds have suffered injuries and 43 have been killed by a track vet at the stadium over the past five years alone, as sickening IGB statistics show. Among the victims was a greyhound that collapsed after a race in August 2019 and died of a heart attack and another that was carried away bleeding with a leg bone popped out. The IGB brought the activists who have been campaigning at Shelbourne Park to stop the so-called sport to the High Court in January 2020 by issuing nasty, threatening flyers around Ringsend, supposedly signed by the activists. This backfired badly on the IGB. It cost the board €30,000 to get the activists into the High Court and more than €300,000 in expenses, but the activists won. It is important to register that fact. The IGB's tracks outside Dublin experienced a 21% drop in attendance in January and February, while attendance at privately-owned tracks plunged by 43% in January and 20% in February. This is a dying trade. People are rejecting it and are not attending races, and it is going to decline even more in the future. This is not a sport about loving dogs. It is about putting a dog into a stadium where it could get badly injured and die.

It has been such a difficult year for so many and many small businesses are afraid that losing their Christmas trade could force them to close their doors permanently, but could opening business cause a loss of life? These are not easy decisions, but I would put health before profits while ensuring that sufficient Government fiscal supports were available to those businesses remaining closed and staff who are still off. Communities have come together over the past nine months but there has been an horrific increase in instances of domestic abuse, so much so that there is a specific Garda operation for this. The reason I am talking about Covid-19, domestic violence and resources during a debate on a Private Members’ motion on greyhounds is that the greyhound industry receives considerable sums in Exchequer funding. The amount for 2021 is said to be €19.2 million, which includes the increase of €2.4 million in funding that the motion seeks to reverse. I am talking about this because people have said to me that greyhounds are getting more money than women’s services. As well as reversing that funding increase of €2.4 million, the motion calls on the Government to increase funding for the welfare of greyhounds and to phase out State support for the greyhound industry. Why is the State still funding this industry? Yesterday, I spoke to the Regulation of Lobbying (Amendment) Bill 2020 and it is worth noting the strength of the greyhound industry lobby in this country. The "RTÉ Investigates: Greyhounds Running for Their Lives" programme aired in 2019 and documented some of the cruel acts taking place in the industry. Advocacy groups have told us that greyhounds are being overbred and that some 6,000 are culled every year. As people have become more aware of the industry, attendance has dropped. It is not the fun social event it once was. The public could no longer ignore the stories of drugging, maltreatment and export. It would be remiss of me not to mention former Deputies who undertook significant work on the welfare of greyhounds in the previous Dáil. Maureen O’Sullivan and Tommy Broughan often raised the important issues of animal welfare and the treatment and export of greyhounds. Tommy Broughan worked with Dogs Trust Ireland to bring forward the Welfare of Greyhounds (Amendment) Bill 2017. The former Deputies and the now MEP, Clare Daly, worked with Senators Higgins and Ruane on Committee Stage of the Government’s Greyhound Racing Bill 2018 to try to improve it. The Government did not listen to everything we called for then but I hope it will listen now, although I doubt that very much. The public are more aware than ever of our public spending and the areas they want the Government to support, but as usual it will be behind the people. The greyhound racing industry is so problematic. The serious issues and maltreatment of these dogs have been widely documented. Live hare coursing should also be banned. I know there are some greyhound breeders and owners who adore their dogs and treat them well but, unfortunately, there are many who see them as money-making machines, and weaker pups and litters as collateral damage. What about the older, retired greyhounds? When they are no longer of use, what happens to them? Greyhound racing encourages gambling too, which has its own detrimental effects on society. Why is this industry supported by taxpayers' money? Ideally, I would like this type of racing to be done away with as a sport, but if it must still happen, it should certainly not be supplemented by the public purse,nor should it take scarce resources away from areas such as domestic violence, housing, health provision and so on. I cannot let the moment pass without mentioning the Claire Byrne interview on Wednesday last, 18 November, where a Fine Gael councillor, David McManus, repeatedly lied about the 33,000 jobs in the industry. I commend Deputy Cairns on bringing forward the motion and returning the issue to the floor of the House. I am more than happy to support the motion and believe that it is important for us to defund the greyhound industry.

Nevertheless, I strenuously oppose their views and will do so with every breath in my body. Yesterday, the party posted a video to social media that had been recorded at the gates of Leinster House. It featured a lurcher. It clearly illustrated the lack of understanding the Social Democrats have about the exact role that this industry plays in rural Ireland. I am privileged to have owned greyhounds and I also have the leg of a horse from time to time. It is part of our heritage and culture. I am not going to talk about the economics of it but it is part of rural Ireland. If the Social Democrats get their way on greyhound racing, what target will be next? Will it be point-to-point racing, hunting, shooting or fishing? These are all sports that we grew up with and that we will defend. They are part of our heritage. Yesterday, the Minister appeared before the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine, which I am privileged to chair, and the opportunity was there for Members of Dáil Éireann and the Seanad to cross-examine him about what the money is being spent on and where it is going. We had a detailed discussion on the fund and the committee referred the matter back to the Dáil and the Seanad, where it will be voted on, as is the democratic process. This is not about the money, however. It is about a way of life and our heritage, and we will not take any more. Rural Ireland and people who love their sports have taken enough. A strict line is being drawn on our pursuits. I will leave out the economics. The regulations are there and are being stringently enforced. There has been much talk of the "RTÉ Investigates" programme. Some of that footage was recorded outside this jurisdiction, while other parts were very dated. There is no place for people who break the regulations. We have a strictly regulated industry and will defend it to the last.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	20	I oppose the motion put forward by the Social Democrats. The proposed increase in the Horse and Greyhound Fund is necessary, given the severe impact of Covid-19 on the horse and greyhound industries. The most recent economic assessment of the industry was undertaken by the economist Jim Power in November 2017. Mr. Power's report found that the greyhound industry delivers €302 million to the economy, with 12,371 people deriving economic benefit from it. Many families have been raised thanks to the owning, breeding and training of greyhounds, getting children through college and school from the earnings delivered from the industry. Greyhound racing is an integral part of rural Irish life. It is simply outrageous to hear the constant, unjustified bashing of the industry. These attacks are littered with false claims and allegations and are deliberately designed to undermine greyhound racing. Yesterday's publicity stunt by Deputy Cairns, where she stood outside the gates of Leinster House with a lurcher and then went on to say it was an abandoned greyhound, is further evidence of the false claims being put forward.Today's motion is another direct attack on rural Ireland by the Social Democrats, an urban-based party that is determined to ban greyhound racing, coursing, horse racing, point-to-point racing, hunting and all other rural pursuits. The repeated insulting claims of widespread appalling mistreatment of greyhounds by people involved in the sport are simply not true. The chief inspector of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine that the number of contacts the organisation receives concerning greyhounds is negligible. At a time when many industries are closed because of Covid-19, it is incredible that the Social Democrats Party is trying to close down this vital industry for rural Ireland.

There is a range of factors that justify continued Government support for the greyhound sector. The programme for Government contains a strong commitment to ensuring that there is a continued improvement in animal welfare within the industry. Future funding of the sector is contingent, on an annual basis, on welfare standards being upheld and compliance with those standards being strictly monitored. Like many other industries, the greyhound sector is particularly affected by the Covid-19 crisis. The most recent economic assessment of the industry, undertaken by Jim Power Economics in November 2017, outlined how the sector delivers a significant impact for the national economy, with 12,300 people deriving an economic benefit directly from it. According to its annual report for 2019, Rásaíocht Con Éireann employs 125 full-time staff and 112 part-time staff, measured in full-time equivalents, with approximately 700 casual staff also employed at peak periods. The greyhound industry is predominantly rural but it does have a strong urban base. It has been significantly impacted by the Covid crisis as a result of the requirement for behind-door racing, or the absence of racing, for much of this year. Recovery of the industry will require ongoing Government support to aid the restoration of normal levels of activity and adequately manage welfare issues in the process. The future of the industry is dependent on a strong governance platform and the industry achieving the highest standards of integrity and welfare, founded on a strong regulatory system. Provisions in the Greyhound Racing Act 2019, which came into effect in May last year, will make a real difference in this regard. The legislation strengthens the legal basis for the industry, with a view to fortifying the integrity of the greyhound racing sector and improving provision for greyhound traceability. In accordance with the requirements of the Act, Rásaíocht Con Éireann has conducted a procurement process for the introduction of a new traceability system. It expects to have the system operational by the end of this year, with statutory regulation to follow on from that. This will provide a very strong mechanism to ensure that racing greyhounds are registered and traceable throughout their lives and that enforcement mechanisms are in place. It will provide for the recording of important events in the life of a racing greyhound, including birth, microchipping, registration, racing career, changes of ownership, trainer and location, export, retirement and end of life. The sections of the Act commenced last month signal a new era for the greyhound racing sector. They facilitate Rásaíocht Con Éireann in focusing on its key priority objective of achieving the highest standards of care and welfare of greyhounds. There is a very strong commitment to improved animal welfare in the programme for Government, as I indicated, and future funding is contingent on meeting the required standards. It is crucial, as we go forward, that we continue to support the sector for all of the reasons I have outlined. We recognise that it is an important part of our heritage and tradition in many rural and urban areas. It is important that the State should recognise that tradition and, in so doing, acknowledge the significant contribution the industry makes to economic life in those areas. We have had a very active debate, with clear positions set out by various speakers. The Government is very clear in its support for the sector. The Social Democrats also have a clear view on the matter. At yesterday's meeting of the agriculture committee, Deputy Cairns was the only member to speak against continued funding for the sector, but there are others who share her views. Some people are trying to hold to both sides of the track on the issue. I note that Sinn Féin is not supporting the increased funding of €2.6 million in the budget, which recognises the pressure the sector is under as a result of the Covid crisis, but it does support the existing funding. If my recollection serves me right, the party opposed that funding when it was announced last year. The view Sinn Féin Deputies give and the position they take on this issue depends on who they are talking to about it. We must all be clear on where we stand on the issue. From the Government's point of view, and in accordance with the programme for Government, the industry deserves support. We recognise the very strong efforts by Rásaíocht Con Éireann to ensure that there is oversight and transparency in regard to the welfare of greyhounds in the industry. We also recognise the commitment and care shown by those involved in the sector towards their animals. In any instances where that is not the case, we are committed to ensuring there are mechanisms in place to intervene and address it. Situations where animals are not properly cared for cannot be tolerated.

I commend her on bringing forward this motion and I thank all the Deputies from the different groupings for their contributions to the debate. It is regrettable that Government time was not set aside for this important debate and that it must instead be taken in the limited time available for Private Members' business. Government members often say that Opposition parties do not offer solutions or only put forward solutions that cost money. This motion is constructive. It aims to save money, improve animal welfare and redirect much needed resources into other areas. The motion is about animal cruelty but it is also about what we prioritise, as a Dáil and as a society. It is not a radical motion. All we are proposing is that the market should decide what happens to the greyhound racing industry and that it should no longer be propped up with State subsidies. There should be a very strong case and rationale for propping up any industry in that way, but I have not heard any such strong case or rationale in this debate. The one argument that has been made which does have a measure of validity relates to the importance of the jobs in the industry. However, if resources being put into it were redirected to another area, we would retain and create jobs in that way. Retaining jobs is not sufficient rationale for State subsidies to the sector. I do not agree with the argument put forward by the Labour Party that we must subsidise the industry in order to be able to scrutinise it. If that argument applies in this case, does it apply everywhere else? Does every industry have a claim to State subsidies on the basis that we can only regulate and scrutinise those sectors that are subsidised by the taxpayer? That does not make any sense. We must be cognisant of the impact of this particular industry on gambling addiction, taking account of the clear power of the gambling lobbying industry in terms of its influence on politics. Several speakers referred to greyhound racing being part of our culture, tradition and heritage. We cannot make decisions about how we prioritise resources based simply on what happened in the past. If we consider some of the areas that are not getting the resources they should, the culture and heritage argument does not make sense. In the context of the €19.2 million that is put into this industry, a relevant comparison is the funding provided this year for people who have become homeless and the resources it would take to ensure they get a long-term, secure Housing First tenancy. The people involved have complex needs. They include people who are sleeping rough, people who are in and out of emergency shelters, and people with addiction, mental health and other complex issues. The amount we are spending, as a State and a society, on providing long-term, secure Housing First tenancies for that group of people is €2.9 million this year.If we redirected some of the resources for the greyhound industry into long-term, secure Housing First tenancies, we could ensure that everyone who has a need in this regard could have that need met. It is not part of our culture, heritage or tradition to have people who are homeless left in those situations. It does not speak to us, as a society, at all, and yet this is an area in respect of which we are not providing sufficient funding. For the sake of the kind of sums of money that we are talking about, we could be making real inroads. That is the choice that is being made today by the Government in deciding to put additional resources into the greyhound industry, which, in my view, does not have a future and the time of which has come. In any event, let us remove the State subsidies. If there is a demand for the industry, and I do not believe there is, let it be self-sufficient, which is the case, of course, with so many other industries.
#HollyCairns	unknown-#HollyCairns-party	unknown-#HollyCairns-dob	unknown-#HollyCairns-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	23	I will start by addressing some of the blatant misinformation aired by Deputies this morning. Sinn Féin and the Government stated that €302 million is generated for the economy by the greyhound industry. There were 1,606 race meetings last year and the average attendance was 288. Are we to believe that every meeting generates €188,000? The other claim is that some of the money comes in from tourism but we all know that the vast majority of tourists do not come to Ireland to go to greyhound racing tracks. Another common feature of the debate has been the disputing of the figures. After the RTÉ documentary, Greyhound Racing Ireland filed a complaint to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland about it. The authority investigated the complaint in full, rejected it in its entirety and found instead that "the programme was a comprehensive exploration of the topic in a factual manner which was fair, objective and impartial." It is important to put that on the record again. I am also constantly hearing that we are referring to all trainers as terrible people who are involved in animal cruelty. I do not know how many times we have to say that we are aware not all trainers treat their dogs badly. Indeed, many of those trainers have been in touch to thank us for tabling this motion because they are so aware of how badly dogs are treated in the industry. Many Deputies talked about employment and support for rural areas and help for farmers, which is laughable. The vast majority of rural people, farmers and fishing communities could think of so many preferable things to spend one quarter of a billion euro on. Rural populations are concerned about Brexit, about the immoral prices farmers are receiving for their product and a lack of State services. These are the issues on which the Government needs to be spending our public money. Predictably, some Deputies labelled this motion as blatantly anti-rural. This is a simplistic argument that paints all rural Ireland as uniform and conservative by default. This is not only insulting; it is simply untrue. Just because we are from rural areas does not mean we are unable to understand facts or engage in meaningful debate. A Red C poll conducted in 2019 found that only 16% of people support this industry. It is simply not true to say that the Government is representing all of rural Ireland. Claiming to have a monopoly on speaking for rural Ireland is, quite simply, ridiculous. The Government's amendment, and, indeed, the Labour Party, speak of the great progress that will be made in animal welfare, in traceability and in greater accountability. The Government is so confident about this it is willing to give the industry €2.4 million but we know that this is blatant lip-service. Attempts by Opposition Senators and Deputies in 2019 to have clear regulations in respect of export and breeding practices were disregarded so that we know that the two most controversial malpractices in the industry will not be properly addressed. Independent organisations, whistleblowers and other political parties know that this industry has proven to be incapable of the necessary reforms. Members of the public know this. They are voting with their feet. Sponsors and companies know this. It seems that the only people who do not know it are politicians and people who are invested in the industry. State funding has facilitated these significant deficiencies and overbreeding practices. It has insulated the industry from commercial reality and allowed Greyhound Racing Ireland to ignore public opinion. This has to stop. We have an opportunity to do it now. The Government's decision to give an extra €2.4 million to the industry in the budget, ratified by the Joint Committee on Agriculture and the Marine yesterday, can and should be halted. The remaining investment should be put towards the gradual winding down of a declining industry. Imagine for a second if the greyhound racing industry did not exist and my colleagues and I in the Social Democrats came in here today and proposed it, using the same arguments that have been used to defend the funding of the industry. It is difficult to imagine but, I suppose, the motion on the matter would go something like this:I propose that we create an organised competitive sport of sorts, in which dogs are raced around a track and people can go along and bet on them and I think that the Government should fund it to the tune of €19.2 million annually. The estimated loss for the taxpayer over the next four years will be approximately €30 million and, in an attempt to avoid criticism for so many millions of euro of public money being pumped into a loss-making industry, I suggest that a levy from the gambling industry be ring-fenced. Then we can use that to argue we are not using public money despite the fact that we are.Unfortunately, in order to get dogs that I believe will run quick enough, we will have to breed approximately 16,000 of them a year. This level of overbreeding will mean that we will have to kill about 6,000 of those dogs but we can defend this overbreeding and extreme cruelty by saying that some trainers treat their dogs well and that it is the lifeblood of rural Ireland.We also suggest that we tie it in as closely as possible with horse racing and claim that the two are intrinsically linked and that if you are against a loss-making racing industry that carries out the cruelty of greyhound racing, you are also anti-horse racing. We could even go as far as to use the employment figures from horse racing to make the whole argument more robust.Finally, if any of this is researched and aired or published, for example, by the national broadcaster, we can just ignore it.We all know that this would be seen as the most outrageous thing imaginable but, in reality, voting down the Social Democrats motion this evening is just as outrageous. I am calling on all parties to stop falling prey to lobbying. The solution is clear. We need to stand up and acknowledge the reality of this industry and stop turning a blind eye to its abuse and throwing more money at its failings.

I express my condolences to his family and friends. I just wanted to acknowledge the passing of this man, as it is almost six years to the day of Jonathan Corrie's death. The scandal of street homelessness and rough sleeping must be dealt with and it needs to happen soon. Today is International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and it marks the start of the 16-day campaign against domestic and gender-based violence. It is an annual campaign, as the Taoiseach knows. I and others a stand up in this Chamber year after year and we recite the statistics that attempt to capture the horrific abuse and violence to which so many women and children are subjected. I have no doubt that everyone in the Dáil gets angry when they hear the heartbreaking stories of women who have been battered and emotionally broken by the violence inflicted upon them. The physical scars and bruises are all too apparent signposts of the trauma experienced, often on a daily basis. The mental suffering, the theft of victims' dignity, confidence and sense of safety is less obvious but it frequently runs deeper. The fear cast by domestic violence, by every beating, every insult and every attempt to control and degrade is something that victims can overcome, but the shadow of abuse is something they carry with them for the rest of their lives. It is time to face up to the fact that we have a real problem with domestic and gender-based violence in Ireland. It is time for the political system and Government to move past whatever unease they have about owning up to this fact. Violence against women and abuse behind closed doors and drawn curtains is at epidemic levels. The truth is that successive Governments have failed women and children who have been caught up in the horror of this abuse and until a Government confronts this problem with the honesty and the determination that it demands, too many of the cries for help from abused women will go unanswered and unheard. The domestic violence support services providers in Ireland do remarkable work, despite the fact that they have been underfunded for decades but while the abused women battled to survive the impact of the violence against them, these service providers have been battling for resources, funding and proper support from Government. I struggle to find words to express my anger about how this issue has been swept under the carpet for years. It is time our problem with domestic and gender-based violence was brought out into the open so that we can finally deliver policies, supports and the funding necessary to tackle it head on. I welcome that emergency funding is provided to help services meet Covid-19-related costs; I am very glad the Taoiseach responded to that call. This will help with the immediate Covid challenge. However, we must discuss and deal with the chronic lack of refuge places for women who need to escape the violence, the abuse and the coercive control. Between March and June of this year, 1,351 requests for refuge went unmet because the services were full. Nine counties have no refuge provision at all and this is a scandal. We know that incidents of domestic violence and abuse increase over the Christmas period. Victims, their children and the services they rely on will face a very bleak picture in 2021 if the Government does not act. I, therefore, ask the Taoiseach on this day if he will now commit to ensuring the refuge shortages across the state are urgently addressed.

I offer her husband Damien and children Ciarán, Ríoghna, Sorcha and Eoin our sincere sympathies. The programme for Government is very clear and has a very strong commitment to developing the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. There can be no toleration for violence against women in our society. We must do everything we possibly can to assist and support women and families who are the victims of unacceptable violence, aggression and control. We have provided additional resources in the most recent budget to An Garda Síochána, Tusla and other services that support women who have been victims of violence, and we will continue to do that. The Minister for Justice is currently undertaking an audit of all services in this area, which is an area all three Government parties want to prioritise. I assure the Deputy that if she wishes to engage with the Government on the areas or the specific locations where additional funding is required, I will ensure that a response will occur in that regard. Particular funding has been given to Tusla in the budget to deal with the Covid-19 impact. We were particularly concerned about the elevation to level 5 following the experience of the first phase of the lockdown and its impact in the form of increased domestic violence. There was approximately €2 million in addition to approximately €25.3 million that had been allocated to these services for the entirety of 2020. The Deputy identified an important point about culture and the importance of ensuring within society at large that Ireland makes it very clear that, as a society, there can be absolutely no toleration whatsoever for gender-based violence. We must be absolute about that and then, through education and through a variety of fora, make sure that is clear. We must then ensure that the adequate supports are available so that people can be freed and be enabled to leave that coercive control and situations of violence, safe in the knowledge that there is a pathway out of that experience that, unfortunately, too many in our society have had over the years. Across various Departments, we want to do everything we possibly can to help victims or anybody who is at risk of domestic or sexual abuse. We will continue to be available to help in that regard and provide the necessary supports, and also to strategically deal with this in an effective and comprehensive way.

The Taoiseach says there must be no toleration of violence against women and children in our society but the facts are that there is such a tolerance. The Taoiseach says we must do everything we can but everything is not being done. The Taoiseach says we must provide all of the necessary resources and on that point we agree. That, however, is not helped by playing games with big figures such as pointing to the additional money that has been given to Tusla when he knows not one cent of that money has been ring-fenced for domestic violence services. I know there is an audit under way. That could be a really important and significant intervention in all of this but only-----

The programme for Government is very strong on this. It includes a number of relevant and key commitments, including the development of the third national strategy, which would place a priority on prevention and reduction and include a national preventative strategy. As I said, an immediate audit is to be conducted in terms of responsibility for this area across different Government agencies and Departments. The Government is committed to implementing a plan for a future refuge space and to investigate the provision of paid leave and social protection provision to victims of domestic violence and to learn from the experience of the coercive control model in the United Kingdom, including training for An Garda Síochána, legal professionals and Courts Service personnel to ensure there is clear understanding of the offence. The Government wants to legislate to introduce domestic homicide reviews, update the Sex Offenders Act 2001 to ensure convicted sex offenders are effectively managed and monitored, enact a harassment and harmful communications Bill, which the Minister has been speaking about, to outlaw image-based sexual abuse and to prevent abusive sharing of intimate images online and, crucially, to implement the findings of the O'Malley review of supports for vulnerable witnesses in sexual violence cases to support victims.

I understand the principal was on the radio this morning to challenge the reports. Clearly, young people, male and female, in the school are very upset and believe that something very wrong happened here. There must be no place for victim blaming or body shaming in our schools and I ask that the Department investigates this matter further. Women and girls in our society have to put up with crap all their lives. Last week, we saw sexual abuse on a grand scale with the mass sharing of intimate images online without consent. This morning, researchers in Trinity and Maynooth tell us one in five Irish women have experienced rape. Today is the UN's international day for the elimination of violence against women. Globally, each year as many women of reproductive age die from male violence as die from cancer. More suffer ill health as a result of this violence than suffer ill health from all of the traffic accidents and malaria cases in the world combined. The programme for Government describes sexual violence as an epidemic in our society. It has worsened in the Covid era and is now widely described as the shadow pandemic. I put it to the Taoiseach that he is not tackling it in the way he would tackle either an epidemic or a pandemic. With the pandemic the Government put society on a war footing. It organised lockdowns. The message to mask up, socially distance and wash our hands comes at us every day, and rightly so, from radio, television and the press. With the epidemic of sexual violence where are the emergency measures? The Taoiseach will commission a report here and a speech is made there and a few million euro is thrown at the problem from time to time. Gender-based violence and sexism are systemic issues. To a greater or lesser degree, all of the institutions of the State and others are laced through with sexism. Mass feminist movements from Chile to Spain and from Poland to Peru are putting the system in the dock and pointing the finger at the establishment and the state. These movements offer real hope for the future. Two years ago, eight months after the Belfast rape trial and at the time of the Cork rape trial, my colleague, Ruth Coppinger, held up a thong in the Dáil in protest at a woman's clothing being used as evidence in a rape case. Two years on, I will conclude by asking the following questions. Will the Taoiseach support the establishment of a task force on gender-based violence, staff it with survivors, advocates and women who work in the sector, set aside a very healthy budget and pledge to implement its proposals? When will the Taoiseach act to stop victim blaming in the courts? When will he act to stop rape myths being used in trials? When will consent be made the central issue in rape cases?

In relation to the Presentation Secondary School in Carlow, I did not hear the interview this morning but I agree with the Deputy that there is no place for victim shaming in any context and the Department of Education and the Minister will clearly receive a report on it. If the principal is challenging the report of what we read in the media, in fairness to the House we have to seek out the full facts before passing commentary on it. In terms of the broader issue, the Deputy summed it up when he said gender based violence and sexism are systemic. This is why it requires a systemic response. It cannot just be a response for six weeks or six months. Our response has to be truly systemic throughout our society. It has to be based on fundamental human values of respect for one another, for the dignity of the human person and for the most basic of human values. Those basic human values, particularly not to injure others and not in any shape or form ever raise a hand or engage in violence towards a woman, are something that were ingrained in earlier years. It is wrong and it is horrific that the level of violence is as it is. We know from various reports on abuse itself that it has been systemic and it needs a systemic response. It needs constant engagement at all levels of society from the earliest ages in terms of inculcating basic values of respect, toleration and understanding the dignity of the human being and that certain actions are never right in any circumstance. In my earlier response to Deputy McDonald, I outlined the Government's broad range of commitments. The implementation of the O'Malley report is very important. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is very committed to this area and is acting on a number of fronts, not least the legislation to be brought in on the sharing of intimate images.

They tend to say "I've lost count of the number of times that I've been raped."I welcome the fact there is to be a pilot scheme in Cork to provide a refuge for homeless rape victims but I ask the Taoiseach what is the timescale for this initiative to come to fruition. In all of Cork city and county there is one refuge for families who are victims of gender-based violence. There is space for six families there but it had to be restricted to two families during Covid. This is a sign of the scale of the failure of the Government and the State and the lack of investment in this issue. I listened to the Taoiseach when he said the Department of Education will clearly receive a report on the events in the school in Carlow. I ask him to comment that the Department will not just receive a report from the school authorities but will seek the views, opinions and experiences of the students themselves on this issue.

When I was Minister for Health and Children, we were involved in setting up the first forensic sexual violence centre in the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital in Cork.Mary Crilly is a tireless worker. I met Mary Crilly, Caitriona Twomey and Lavinia Kerwick at Cork Penny Dinners recently to discuss the phenomenon of the rape of homeless women and men. It was quite a shocking story that they had to tell. They have come forward with an idea around developing a pilot project to help the homeless and to protect the homeless from sexual violence and rape. I said I felt that was a very good idea and that I would pursue it with them and with the homeless authorities, and that the local authority and the HSE would have to be involved. I said we would take a co-ordinated approach to dealing with this issue and then see if a model could be developed that could then be rolled out across the country. Given the evidence they brought forward to us, it is an issue that merits that consideration, although it will take a bit of time to get that up and running and to get it right.

It was a service that was provided exclusively by the Irish Air Corps for decades up to the year 2002, when it was handed over and outsourced to a private company. Most members of the public will be familiar with the large red and white helicopters that sometimes fly overhead. What they may not be aware of is that these helicopters are not owned by the Irish Coast Guard, nor are they even owned by the State. They are owned and operated by a foreign private helicopter company which is on a very lucrative contract from the Irish taxpayer. When I say “lucrative”, I am talking about €600 million over a ten-year period, or €5 million a month, if one wants to look at it from that perspective. Not only is the contract very expensive, it is also finite in time. At the end of the ten-year period, Ireland is left with absolutely nothing. The helicopters will be taken away and we will have to go back to scratch to retender the contract again for another ten years. The reason I am bringing this up today and the reason it is so pertinent is that the process to renegotiate a new ten-year contract from 2023 onwards is shortly to get under way. It is estimated that approximately €1 billion will be used to provide this contract over the next ten years, which is the financial equivalent of half of a national children's hospital, so that is the scale of the project currently taking place. I raised this matter on budget day in October. I have been very heartened and encouraged by all of the Deputies who have supported what I have said. These are Deputies from all across the political divide, on both sides of the Chamber. It is clear there is now an appetite to re-examine a better, optimum model of delivery which would provide better value for money for the Irish taxpayer but also, crucially, provide a more sustainable and more sovereign service for the country. That is something the country deserves. For example, we do not outsource policing in Dublin city to a private security firm; we resource An Garda Síochána to provide that policing capability on our behalf. Rather than funding a foreign private helicopter company to run a service for a fixed and finite period of time, would it not make more sense to invest that money in the Irish Air Corps to provide a more sustained and sovereign service into the future? At the end of the ten years, Ireland would still own the helicopters and we would not have to retender the contract after ten years.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	40	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. There is currently a project under the remit of the Department of Transport to consider development of a new marine search and rescue, SAR, aviation contract for future service provision, as the Deputy has outlined. The Deputy has been fair in saying the provision of search and rescue aviation services in Ireland has, to a great extent, involved a mix of private provision since the 1980s, and has been fully provided on a 24-7 basis by a private entity since 2004, with the Air Corps providing support, including top cover support, to the Coast Guard on an “as available” basis. As part of this ongoing project, a preliminary appraisal of service provider options ruled out the option of either the Air Corps or the Coast Guard taking full responsibility for SAR aviation services in Ireland at that stage. However, given its historical role in the area, the Government would like to explore further the option of the Air Corps providing some element of the aviation services. I know the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, has asked his officials to engage with the Department of Transport to explore this matter further and that is part of the detailed appraisal of SAR service provider options. It is important we get this right for everyone. As the Deputy said, there is considerable State funding at play here and the provision of a life-saving service is the ultimate aim of all concerned. The next step in the process will be to bring a detailed business case to Government early next year, with an appraisal of the viable options and a recommendation on the way forward to delivering this service and the procurement strategy to achieve it. The Department of Defence and the Department of Transport are liaising closely on this. Both the Naval Service and the Air Corps currently provide support to the Coast Guard on an “as available” basis and that will continue. It is a valuable role. I will engage with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, on this issue. There is still time to develop the best option. I am conscious there has been a need for increased and ongoing investment in the Air Corps and also the retention of personnel. However, there has been significant investment in equipment and personnel. The replacement of the Air Corps Cessna fleet, as provided for in the White Paper, with three larger aircraft, which are equipped for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, has been completed. These aircraft, which cost just over €43 million, are now operational. In March, a fourth PC-12 NG aircraft was purchased to provide very immediate additional fixed-wing capacity to meet the unique situation arising from the Covid-19 pandemic. The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the CASA 235s with larger, more capable aircraft, which would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo carrying tasks. A contract for the supply of two C295 maritime patrol aircraft was entered into with Airbus Defence and Space in December 2019. The cost of the contract, including equipment fit-out and ancillary support, was approximately €221 million and the aircraft are scheduled for delivery in 2023. In terms of personnel, a service commitments scheme for pilots was sanctioned by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and implemented in the third quarter of 2019, which has had a stabilising effect on numbers. Other measures, such as a recommissioning scheme for former Air Corps pilots, have also boosted pilot numbers, and a range of initiatives which will see accelerated training through outsourcing is restoring capacity to the Air Corps as quickly as possible.

I fully appreciate, like everybody in the Chamber, that there is huge demand on the Taoiseach’s time currently. I also understand that he gets the occasional direct flight from Baldonnel airbase directly to Brussels, which is completely appropriate given his status as Taoiseach. Would he consider arriving an hour before his flight sometime early in the new year so he could visit the helicopter wing in Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, which is only a couple of hundred metres away? He could discuss this matter with the crews on the ground and see for himself the facilities, aircraft and equipment that are available, and get a sense of the tools and talent that are already available within the public service before we choose to outsource it to a private operator.

That is a very good idea.

I will take the Deputy up on that suggestion, which is a good idea.

We are rightly told to follow the science, but science is empirical and it is based on data. I am concerned by the lack of published data. Peer review and transparency are central to any scientific response. I want to focus in particular on the data on mental health. The National Self-Harm Registry Ireland in Cork ceased functioning for the duration of the first lockdown.At the end of August, it started to collect data again, both prospectively and retrospectively, but at the time of the second lockdown there were no data available in respect of the first. However, we were told that the national clinical programme for the assessment and management of persons presenting to emergency departments following self-harm - that is quite a mouthful - which is run by the College of Psychiatrists of Ireland and the HSE, was collecting data throughout the duration of the first lockdown. Where are those data? Has they been collated? At the time we were announcing the second lockdown and this Dáil was voting to facilitate it, I was standing where I am now when the Minister of State, Deputy Mary Butler, told me I would be provided with those data. I have not yet been provided with them and I have not managed to obtain them. The collection of those data is publicly funded. It is in the public interest that these HSE and College of Psychiatrists of Ireland programme data be collected. The programme is funded by the public so surely those data should be in the public domain to inform this House and the Government on the measures they take. Yesterday, the Tánaiste talked about a third lockdown. We cannot go into a third lockdown without at least knowing the impact of the first one on mental health. I do not know whether those data are available. I am told they are but they may not be collated. If they are not collated, they are of no benefit because we cannot consider the impact of data that have not been collated. Will the Taoiseach commit to publishing those data? There is a broader issue regarding publishing the data and evidence available to NPHET to ensure that they are transparent and can be peer reviewed. That is not to undermine NPHET. Peer review, whether regarding the development of a vaccine or any medical or scientific response, is central and we cannot do that without the transparent publication of data, modelling codes and evidence.

For example, coming out of the first phase when the country reopened and cases began to rise again during the August and September period, we brought in a team from the HSE, commissioning EY, to look at all of that detail with greater analytical tools and to identify where outbreaks happened and what was the correlation, what were the events and what were the combined circumstances that gave rise to spikes across the country. The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, HPSC, the HSE, the Department of Health, the Central Statistics Office and other Departments - the Deputy referenced the Department of Health - including the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Social Protection and Justice, have all been inputting into the assessment and the impacts Covid has had on the different sectors of society. That will inform how we exit level 5. We are learning all of the time. We will publish those data and make them available to give people some understanding as to why we are arriving at particular decisions in respect of how we exit level 5. I have already identified some areas that have been of concern that emanated from those particular data. For example, in this phase we kept the schools and construction open. In the future, the Deputy can take it that we would do things differently from how we did them even during level 5 and from the first phase. We are learning all the time. On mental health, there are two sources of figures on self-harm, the hospitals and clinical programmes. Hospitals could not report for a period of time due to Covid but reporting on statistics continued throughout Covid through the clinical programmes. I will qualify what I say here because we need more data and comprehensive research on this, but at the moment the data from the clinical programmes show that there is no evidence of an increase in self-harm as the figures are broadly similar to those for the same period last year. I put a caveat on that until I am satisfied that there is a full, comprehensive analysis of all the data. With regard to suicides, there is a time lag as it has to be determined by the coroner. However, a real-time local study of suicide incidence in Cork shows no significant increase on the 2019 figures. Interestingly, a study on suicide in England found no evidence of a large national rise in post-lockdown suicide compared with previous lockdown suicides. It is an area that will continue to receive our attention.

I greatly welcome his commitment to publishing data. I note that Ernst & Young have been brought in to crunch data. If those data are provided by the State or an organ of the State and collected with public moneys, they should also be made available. The most important point is the evidence and data available to NPHET, and the modelling code. Information about the code has been published but I am told by statisticians, and I am not a statistician, that it is not enough to do a comparison. To return to the mental health data, I note the Taoiseach says there are data available. Will the Government publish the data that were available to it in the middle of October? The Taoiseach says the data are not complete but what was and was not available? We need to know that in a democracy. Will the Taoiseach commit to publishing that information? I am not asking him to get a lot of information. What information was available to the Government at the time and will he publish it by the end of this week or at least by this day next week? Also, has any study been done on the impact of the mental health tribunals? We have changed how they operate. Has there been any study into the impact of the change in the way they operate on those who are affected, that is, those who are involuntarily detained?

Very significant additional funding has been secured by the Minister of State for the mental health budget. Following that meeting, we briefed the Deputy at a leaders' briefing meeting in respect of the information we had.

The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has made it clear that she is willing to answer questions in this House. She said that last Thursday evening. The Opposition opposed that and any facilitation of that, which was due to happen next Tuesday, because of the format of how the questions would be asked. I believe withdrawing from the Business Committee based on the format of how questions are asked is wholly disproportionate. That is a reform that I championed. I believe in the Business Committee and I support its continuation. I want to make that clear. I spoke to the Ceann Comhairle this morning. The Ceann Comhairle has legal advice about the parameters and the nature of what can be asked. He is clear that questions must be on process and not commentary on the suitability of candidates or criteria, which some Deputies asked me about earlier. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, and I discussed this issue. The Minister was taken aback last week when she made an offer to come into the House and answer questions-----

That is utterly without precedent. I asked 18 questions of the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach last week. The Taoiseach has repeatedly said that if Deputies have questions, they should submit them and they will be answered. They are not being answered. One simple question that I asked was when the Taoiseach was informed that Mr. Justice Woulfe was to be appointed. No date was provided. All 18 questions were merged into one generic, rubbish answer from the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach. I will seek to meet the Ceann Comhairle later today to discuss how we will go forward. I have been down this road before with Ministers and I will not stop until I get my questions answered. The people of Tipperary put me here to hold this Taoiseach and Minister for Justice to account, and it is my intention to do so. We will get there, slice by slice. The Taoiseach can trust me on that. Before I ask my question on promised legislation, I want to express my condolences to Damien Carrick, Ciarán, Ríoghna, Sorcha and Eoin on the death of Trish. I have had some dealings with Damien. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h-anam. I asked the Taoiseach to consult party leaders before making decisions on the changes that will be brought about post level 5, which he is to announce on Friday. He has not done so, which is his prerogative. It is wrong. It is too late now and it is wrong. I offer my commiserations on last Sunday, when my county beat the Taoiseach's county. It is slightly ridiculous that for the sake of ten or 15 extra people, full panels cannot be allowed at all-Ireland semi-finals and finals. I presume common sense will prevail on this.

People should be able to travel until early January so they can go home and see their loved ones.

Today, Micheál Lehane said it is likely to be 7 December when gastropubs and restaurants will open. The Irish Independent has run a story that pubs can serve indoors but only if they have a chef on site. The Tánaiste has gone on a solo run saying gyms, barbers and shops will open first and gastropubs and restaurants will potentially open after that. This is creating major anxiety in the city centre constituency I represent. I am not asking the Taoiseach to give me clarity today on an exact date. Will he tell me what constitutes proper notice, as referred to by him yesterday? Is it a seven-day or five-day period? What will constitute proper notice for restaurants and gastro-pubs in order that they may open at some point following the cessation of level 5?

I always admire the capacity of good hard-working journalists to secure information from various sources, which continues apace. I stated at the commencement of level 5 that the landing zone for the Government was in and around level 3, and I have been saying that consistently. If the Deputy looks at what is allowed for at level 3, he will get a fair idea of what would be permissible if we keep the numbers down and low this week. The last two days have been good but it does not take rocket science to work out some of the main areas that would be permissible under a level 3 scenario. I indicated yesterday, in answer to a question from Deputy Richard O'Donoghue who spoke about the need for preparation, that I believe preparation is important and that adequate notice will be given to the various sectors that require that notice.

I asked the Minister a question, which was passed to the HSE, on the numbers of those redeployed from other services who come from speech and language therapy, occupational therapy and the psychologist professions. I asked this because there are tens of thousands of parents who are anxiously waiting for those services for their children. They include the parents of Shay, an eight-year-old boy from Walkinstown who has Down’s syndrome and has no speech and language, occupational therapy, physiotherapy or psychology services. In this context, the HSE tells me that. as of 18 September, 16 speech and language therapists and eight occupational therapists were redeployed to tracking and tracing. Given that those waiting lists for desperately needed services are expanding exponentially, can the Taoiseach guarantee that no speech and language, occupational therapist, child psychologist or other desperately needed personnel is or will be redeployed to tracking and tracing?

It is my view that there should be a separate dedicated workforce for swabbing and contact tracing. That is what the HSE has been undertaking. That means redeployment back to the front line and to key services such as physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and other services. Those personnel are best deployed in those scenarios to look after people such as the young boy the Deputy mentioned. That is what we are going to do and very significant progress had been made on that. In my view, we should not have therapists doing the contact tracing work. There may be some incidents where someone could be in a managerial role-----

There are people who will build up experience over the first and second phase. We do not want to throw all of the experience out immediately. Some people who know how to operate and manage the system will, I imagine and surmise, be required but our objective is to have therapists back providing therapy services.

This proposal will in effect move the threshold from a de facto minimis amount of 1 cent to €75. In County Waterford bus tours and cruise visitors avail of this VAT rebate when purchasing Waterford Crystal, woollen crafts and traditional gifts and mementos. This tax change will affect a significant number of retail businesses and geographic areas. For Waterford Crystal, it will remove nearly 60% of all US customer sales and will have a similar effect across the south and west coasts. This is being done to try to solve a problem with UK visitors. I ask the Taoiseach to look at this measure to see if some other form of enforcement can get us over this problem?

There will be a need for a threshold from an administrative perspective. This is informed by Revenue and its assessment of the volume, data and so on. I have no doubt the Minister will keep this under review but he has brought the threshold down significantly from where it was in the recent amendment.

They have been magnificent. Self-employed and ordinary people need guidance. The Taoiseach promised the leaders two and a half weeks ago at a meeting that he would have a further meeting with us to give notice to people of how they could recommence their business. The people will, in the spirit of Charles J. Kickham, the people of Mullinahone and T.J. McInerney, rise up because they are fed up with this and with being dangled on a string.The Taoiseach never stood behind a counter or worked in a shop and so does not understand the damage, trauma and stress affecting families. Would he please at least respect them by giving them notice of what they can and cannot do in the coming weeks? They are on their knees. The banks and Revenue Commissioners are knocking at their doors and the Taoiseach is giving them no guidance. He is disrespecting the other parties in this House by not having the meetings he promised with Dr. Holohan and others to get the science and data, which he has not been given. He has not been given any science or data; he is operating on a wing and prayer and he will not even allow the people to say prayers.

Just after 1 a.m., security hired by KPMG arrived at the scene in Limerick and cut the chains securing the gate to the loading bay. An unmarked truck with a Dublin registration arrived at around 4 a.m. but the workers had gathered and prevented the removal of the stock from the store. The truck continued to Tralee and those on board tried, at around 7 a.m., to grab stock from the former Debenhams store there. The workers in Tralee stopped them again. I am aware that the Taoiseach met representatives of the Mandate trade union last week and the shop stewards. He said he would get back to them early this week. It is urgent that he do so. I do not believe he has got back to them yet in respect of the mediation process he was talking about. I ask him to get back to them. When will he do so?

I did say that we were going to activate a third-party intervention. We want the basis of that third-party intervention to be effective and, hopefully, achieve a resolution. I appeal to all parties concerned to give space to facilitate the intervention of a third party that might - I am not saying it will - effect a resolution to this long-running strike and situation for the women concerned.

This is unacceptable. It is not an acceptable reason not to pay the farmers a payment that has been due to them since 16 October. Farmers are depending on it to pay for rations, to pay contractors and to live. The Taoiseach should investigate this and get the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine to make sure that his Department pays the more than 1,000 farmers who are awaiting their basic payment scheme money.

Industrial sources have warned that the problem could result in major disruption to existing meat supply chains between the island of Ireland and Great Britain and could reduce the price of cattle with immediate effect. What action did the Taoiseach take yesterday, last night or this morning in this regard? How are the Ministers for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and Foreign Affairs addressing this problem, which is of massive concern to the farming community of Ireland?

I take the Deputy's point that there should not be delays of this kind in respect of payments to farmers who need the income. On the question raised by Deputy Danny-Healy Rae, Brexit is not good news. It has created many challenges. The issue the Deputy referred to is due to different stances being adopted by the various parties to the negotiations on Brexit and the operation of the protocol to the withdrawal agreement. There have been technical discussions. Technocrats have been involved in trying to iron out details of that kind. The story is not over yet and the negotiations are continuing. We have an input in that regard through the joint committee in relation to the operation of the protocol relating to Northern Ireland and the Republic. We will obviously seek to prevent what the Deputy describes from materialising. It would be damaging.

It is a cause that has been championed by Vera Twomey on behalf of her daughter Ava and thousands of others in the country. I have always maintained that where credit is due, it should be given. I will give the Taoiseach credit today because he has helped Vera on more than one occasion over the past few years to jump the huge hurdles in her battle to gain access to medicine for her daughter and others. Unfortunately, this cannot be said for the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, who is running a mile from this serious issue. Can the Taoiseach guarantee that the arrangement for the delivery to Ireland of medicinal cannabis products can be made permanent with the appointment of a distributor or whatever measures are necessary to provide security of supply in the future for Ava Barry and many more who need this medicine to save their lives.

I have worked with Vera Twomey and others on an ongoing basis in regard to this matter. To be fair to all concerned, including the Minister for Foreign Affairs and others, an arrangement had been made to facilitate the distribution of medicinal cannabis, from Holland to Ireland, during the Covid-19 pandemic. That has been facilitated by the State. Obviously, after Covid - we all want to get to a post-Covid world - measures will have to be adopted to facilitated the distribution in Ireland of the various medicinal cannabis products in order to prevent families from having to travel abroad. People obtain different types of medicinal cannabis from various distributors or manufacturers. That is important as well.

I take some encouragement from the progress being made on greenhouse gas emissions. However, the report shows broadly that we have a huge amount of ground to make up. At a time when Covid dominates and many of us are re-evaluating our priorities, it is crucial that the Government also re-evaluate its priorities in this regard. I would like it to be essential in the new national economic plan that is to be published shortly that we secure a major commitment to State infrastructure for offshore development, waste infrastructure, which is deficient in Ireland, and water infrastructure, which needs to be developed. I draw the Taoiseach's attention to slippage in respect of some of the actions in the climate action plan, particularly regarding the maritime Bill, wind regulations and the rolling out of electric vehicle chargers. It is understandable that there has been a delay because of Covid-19 but we need to get these back on track.

I have been working with the Minister concerned and the Attorney General to get that complex legislation, which has been around for a bit, published and on the Statute Book because it is central to realising the economic potential of our seas and so forth. The Deputy is correct that the State will prioritise because the legislation is also key to offshore development. We regard offshore wind as a key factor in the future economic development of our country and also in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The Deputy is correct regarding waste infrastructure. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform prioritised water infrastructure in both the July stimulus package and the budget and will continue to do so.This is because it is very important infrastructure for economic development and in terms of environmental protection and quality of water.

It might be of interest for the Taoiseach to know - and I will ask him a little more about this later - that in the United States, online content moderators did not go into work at all between March and October because of Government restrictions there. Here, they have been working in large workplaces for the past number of months. To my mind, this is in complete breach of the level 5 restrictions. The Taoiseach will be aware that former members of this group of workers are taking legal cases here and in the United States over the post-traumatic stress disorder they suffered as a result of the content they dealt with for Facebook and others in outsourced, badly-paid jobs. Is this issue on the Taoiseach's radar and does he intend to address it?

#PaulineTully	unknown-#PaulineTully-party	unknown-#PaulineTully-dob	unknown-#PaulineTully-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	190	I have been contacted by the parents of a two-and-a-half-year-old boy who has been on the waiting list for an assessment for autism for 12 months. They have been told he will have to wait a further six to eight months for this. This child is practically non-verbal. He needs speech and language therapy immediately but he cannot access it until he is assessed. The parents have been told that some staff are still redeployed to contact tracing, which is adding to the delay. Another parent was in contact. Her son is six years old. He attends the local school with an attached autism spectrum disorder unit. He was receiving services from Enable Ireland until he turned six. Then he had to return to the HSE list. He has been told that he will be waiting for services for five years. These families cannot afford to pay for these services privately and they should not have to contemplate doing so. The Minister of State with responsibility for disability services, Deputy Rabbitte, has indicated that she will ensure no one has to wait longer than six months for an assessment. I welcome that, but the first family will have been waiting 18 to 20 months before they get the assessment. Moreover, assessments need to be followed up by immediate access to whatever therapies are required.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	191	Will Deputy Tully submit the details of that to the Minister of State? My understanding is that there will be some capacity to support parents to access services privately, if they can. I do not believe in this rule that has applied within the HSE and in bureaucracy to the effect that because a person has not had an assessment he cannot avail of therapy services. Some common sense and cop-on need to be applied. A student does not have to wait for assessment in the education environment and provision can be made. I am unclear about why the six year old to whom the Deputy referred had to leave Enable Ireland services and go back to HSE services. Again, I do not know the individual details. My view generally is that all service providers, including the HSE, exist to look after children. Advocacy for children should be centre stage. All agencies and services should work together and co-ordinate to ensure that children get the services they need.

One fact for the Taoiseach is that from March until today, 0.002% has been the outbreak rate in the hospitality sector. The Irish Hotels Federation statistics are available. Every minute and every second that the Taoiseach takes before he tells them will count. The Taoiseach should give the statistics on the level that people can start ordering food. It will be at a certain level if we sustain this level. Those in the sector want the Government to address them now. The Government should stop acting like this. I said it yesterday. It is like if people do secret Santa. The Government should tell them that if we are at 100, then we are going to open. The Government should give them the statistics now. The figure of 0.002% is the figure provided by the Irish Hotels Federation. It covers the period from March, when Covid-19 first arrived.

We can park that because I do not believe that is the important point. International and nationally, where there is congregation and so on, the infection rate relating to the virus rises. The challenge really will be to try to control it. As we move from level 5 to level 3, the issue will be one of risk. No one in Dáil Éireann or the Government wants to destroy or undermine anyone's livelihood. I am sure that should be clear to everyone at this stage. All we want to do is protect lives and livelihoods. That is the only agenda. We want to do this as effectively as we can. Yet, there will be issues around this and people will get notice. They will get plenty of notice.

At the moment there is a temporary cath lab that is available a couple of times per week. This is an ongoing issue and there has been a campaign to put in place the service for many years. People who live in the north west and who need the service are being deprived of it. There is also an issue with the recruitment of a cardiologist. Dr. Donal Murray is due to retire. He told me personally that getting a replacement is a major issue because of the absence of a cath lab in the hospital. People who want to come and work as senior cardiologists want to ensure they have access to the proper services. The denial of that service to the people in the north west is having a knock-on effect. I appeal to the Taoiseach to speak to the Minister for Health to ensure that the service is put in place as quickly as possible. It is almost 30 years since it was first mooted.

That is the level at which these decisions are being taken. Significant resources were made available by the Minister for Health in the budget. The amount involved is €4 billion in total: €2 billion to cover Covid-19; and €2 billion for additional services on top of the current services. There are substantial resources available. Operationally, it is clearly a matter for the HSE to get those issues sorted.

In 2013, Fine Gael published the general scheme of a gambling control Bill. In 2018, the Fianna Fáil Party published the Gambling Control Bill. The Bill passed Second Stage but lapsed with the dissolution of the previous Dáil earlier this year. These two parties are now in government. Yet, the Minister of State with responsibility for public health and well-being, Deputy Feighan, told me last week that it will be the end of 2021 before he finishes drafting gambling control legislation. Why will it take over a year to draft legislation that is already sitting on the shelves gathering dust? The Fianna Fáil Party said it would be a political priority for the next Government.

Yet, towns in my county have seen the Expressway services cut, especially towns like Cashel, Cahir, Roscrea and Nenagh. When the restrictions are lifted and we beat this pandemic, my town of Cashel will be hardest hit by the withdrawals. We depend on the Expressway service to bring tourists to our town. We have no public transport. It is time the Government and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Ryan, woke up. The Minister fobbed us off last night by talking about the railway from Limerick to Ballybrophy. We need the Expressway service. We need public transport in rural towns like Cashel for students going to college and people going for hospital appointments. We depend on it. The two Expressway services in Tipperary are being taken away. I am asking the Taoiseach to intervene or make a statement on it for the people of Tipperary.

#ClaireKerrane	unknown-#ClaireKerrane-party	unknown-#ClaireKerrane-dob	unknown-#ClaireKerrane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	207	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the establishment of a commission to make recommendations and report annually on the adequacy of social welfare rates in the State; and to provide for related matters.From a social protection perspective in recent months, Covid has done two things. It has put a spotlight on the adequacy and effectiveness of our social welfare rates and it has shown how quickly one Department can make big changes. As soon as Covid hit, one thing became clear. People who lost their jobs could not live on €203 per week. In fact, the pandemic unemployment payment, when introduced in March, was up almost 75% from the regular jobseeker's payment of €203. That in itself is a recognition of the inadequacy of €203. That is an issue we must now look at to ensure our social welfare system can, at the very least, protect those relying on it from poverty. That should be a basic aim but we are not achieving it and I believe Covid has exposed that fact. Currently, weekly social welfare rates are set below the poverty line. This Bill ensures that increases at budget time are based on needs and evidence and it will put a stop to the political football we see every year approaching budget time. Nobody who relies on social welfare in this State should be left hoping for a fiver when the budget comes around. Social welfare rates should be set at the minimum essential standard of living to ensure adequacy and protection against poverty. That is the least that the most vulnerable in our society who rely on social protection deserve. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Social Justice Ireland, the European Anti-Poverty Network, the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice, Age Action Ireland and the National Women's Council of Ireland have all called for social welfare rates to be set at the minimum essential standard of living. They are the organisations on the front line supporting and advocating for those who rely on social welfare supports and they should be listened to. This Bill also makes provision for a poverty impact assessment on Government policy decisions before they are implemented. If that was in place when the age limit was reduced to seven on the one-parent family payment as well as the cut to the earnings disregard at that time, that policy would not have gone ahead and lone-parent families would not have suffered as greatly as they did. An Indecon report on the impact of those changes taken by Fine Gael and the Labour Party that we secured in the Social Welfare Bill in 2016 concluded that the evidence indicated it was that Government policy that increased the probability of lone-parent families being at risk of poverty as a direct result of those changes. Government policy actively made life more difficult for lone parents and their children and that should never happen. That policy was introduced with no regard for the consequences. Similarly in relation to the increases in the pension age which began in 2014, such a poverty impact assessment would not have allowed such a policy to go ahead. As we sit here today, over 90,000 children are living in consistent poverty every single day. These children have been robbed of their childhoods, of that carefree nature, the fun and the make-believe. That has been replaced with fear, worry and uncertainty. Two months ago, a Central Statistics Office, CSO, report showed an increase in deprivation levels in the last year alone of over 45% of lone-parent families and over one in five children. We are nowhere close to tackling poverty in this State. I know what I am proposing in relation to social welfare rates cannot be done overnight but we need to start taking steps to strengthen and improve our social protection system so that, at the very least, it guarantees an adequate payment and protection from poverty for our lone parents, for carers, for persons with a disability, for young jobseekers who are expected to live on €112 per week, for widows and for older people who have contributed so much in their lifetime to society. I commend this Bill to the House.

The legislation programme included no Bills in preparation in my Department as there are no legislative matters which require to be prioritised at this time.

The Taoiseach has committed to a process of dialogue on this issue with employers' organisations and trade union organisations. I understand a meeting has already taken place in this regard. Are there terms of reference for this process? Have they been published? If so, where? Which organisations are being invited to participate in the process? How long is it intended for the process to continue? Is it the intention that proposals be put forward at the end of the process? Many observers doubt this process would even be taking place if it were not for the struggle of the Debenhams workers. Some 15 minutes ago, the Taoiseach asked for space on this issue and he is committed to appointing a mediator. I will comment briefly on that. Despite the fact that he gave a commitment to the workers that he would report back to them early this week on progress in this regard and did not do so, I will respect his request. However, I will make it clear that if there is not progress on this issue by the time we convene next week, there will be a row on the floor of the Dáil about this. These women have a deadline as well. They want Christmas with their families and the dispute solved by then.They know that the company is trying to get packaging in and high-value stock out this week and is planning to do so at night or early in the morning. This is a disgrace and the company should back off. Please, appeal to them for space on this issue as well.

In 2016, he called on the then Government not to control the Dáil but it seems that, if matters relating to the Business Committee do not change quickly, that will fall by the wayside. At the time, the current Taoiseach stated: "We believe that the new Dáil should not represent more business as usual – that it should involve a decisive move towards a reformed politics." On the judicial appointments controversy, the Taoiseach has on numerous occasions stated that Deputies should submit questions. I submitted seven questions to his Department. They were pretty basic and I hope to speak to the Ceann Comhairle about them later. They asked for dates and specifics, they were about the process and they were in order, as the Ceann Comhairle has accepted. I asked when the Taoiseach, in his current role, was informed about the proposal to appoint Mr. Justice Woulfe. I asked when he, his Department or his advisers were informed of the decision of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB. I asked him a range of questions relating to the documentation process. I am not looking for documentation or anything that was said at Cabinet level. I know all about Cabinet confidentiality. With these questions in mind, why is the Department of the Taoiseach refusing to be transparent and answer questions, given the Taoiseach's commentary in the past that Governments needed to be more open? I guarantee him that I will not stop until we get answers to these questions.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	218	Seeing as how, as the Taoiseach suggested in a previous answer, the Government is not busy with any particular legislation at the moment, and given that he is responsible for co-ordinating the response to Covid, may I suggest something for his Department to do? There are many aspects to this, but one that is staring us in the face, is growing more evident every day and will be the key to any kind of return to normality is the need for more doctors, nurses and healthcare assistants to increase the capacity of our health service. On 20 October, the Taoiseach suggested that student nurses should have the pay they received in March and April returned to them, but the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, has not done so. I was shocked to discover at a meeting of student nurses that a huge obstacle to the recruitment of sufficient nurses and doctors is the level of fees they are being forced to pay. Legislation on this would be a good idea. Student nurses working on wards on the front line pay €3,000 in fees. Mature student nurses pay €7,500. Graduate-entry medical students who are training to be doctors, a group of whom I met recently, payi€15,000 per year in fees. All of them said they could barely hang on. There is an active financial disincentive to get the trained doctors, nurses and midwives that we need now more than ever. The Taoiseach should be doing something about this. It is crazy to put financial obstacles in the way of training the front-line healthcare professionals we need. This is putting them through the wringer financially in trying to complete their training.

The Government is to legislate to defer the increase in the State pension age to 67 from January, but we have not seen that legislation yet. This delay is causing great uncertainty for many citizens. It should be remembered that the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition first proposed the pension age increase, introducing one of the fastest and largest pension age increases in Europe. In 2016, we tabled a motion calling for the immediate reinstatement of the State pension transition payment for those who retired at 65 years of age. The age at which someone is entitled to a pension ought to be 65 years in any civilised society that respects its workforce. However, Fianna Fáil voted against that motion. It then went on to commit to the provision that we had set out in the election. Fianna Fáil has been all over the place on this issue. The bottom line now is people need to know when the legislation will be introduced. Will it remove or defer the pension age increase to 67 years? If the Taoiseach can do nothing else today, it would be helpful if he at least clarified that and answered Deputy Kelly's questions.

Deputy Barry raised the issue of the process, the dialogue and discussions on company law reform and the need to amend the laws, particularly in regard to liquidations, the rights of workers and the honouring of collective agreements, and also the measures to implement the Duffy Cahill report, which is not directly applicable to the Debenhams situation but nonetheless should happen. It relates to the Clerys situation as well. The Ministers of State, Deputies Troy and English, had good meetings recently. They convened a forum to discuss that with the social partners. That process will continue. The Tánaiste is engaged in his Department with those two Ministers of State on the company law reform process. That is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The issues can be complex enough, but there is a resolve and a determination to deal with them. I undertook to return this week regarding the appointment of a mediator to deal with the Debenhams situation with a view to seeing if we could bring a resolution to it. I asked earlier for space to be allowed. That included all parties to this. I do not think any moves should be made until this particular process is completed. This has been a very, very difficult dispute, which is not easy to resolve. We had a good meeting. I am very clear about the dangers of precedent and so on, but we do want to resolve this ultimately because it has been a long time on the picket line for the workers in particular. They have suffered a lot in inclement weather and they are under a lot of pressure. I acknowledge that. In relation to Deputy Kelly's questions, I have said that the Government is committed to publishing the judicial appointments commission Bill as soon as possible. That it will be published quite shortly is my understanding of this. Work is under way by the Minister. I have always said that the system needs reform. As part of the programme for Government, we indicated that we wanted to reform the Bill that was before the previous House to create a better balance that would respect the separation of powers to a greater extent than the Bill that was going through the Houses in the previous Oireachtas did. That is the agenda. I do not agree with the Deputy on the replies to the questions that he asked. I have answered those questions.

I introduced the nursing degree programme when I served as Minister for Health. At the time, it represented a very radical transformation of nursing education, and I put enormous resources into it in order to create the new facilities we have in universities and institutes of technology across the country. Those changes were informed by nurses and the nursing unions. During the period in question, the Department brought in nursing personnel who headed up the nursing unit and engineered the proposals around this dramatic reform, which meant that students moved from the apprenticeship model within hospitals and to instead being students at third level. That changed the model entirely in terms of payments and so on. That was signed up to by the INMO and all of the parties concerned. We transformed postgraduate nursing education and created far more opportunities for nurses. I understand that things move on and that advances are made. However, it should be acknowledged that enormous investment went into that reform and most people did not think it could happen, but it did and on my watch. The current situation has been under negotiation by the INMO and the HSE at the appropriate fora for quite some time. I wish the matter had been brought to a conclusion, but the various asks have been be made. It is now part of the industrial relations process and has to be resolved through that process. The postgraduate medical programme was an innovation which was sought at the time so that people would be given an opportunity to pursue medicine. I acknowledge the Deputy's point that it is expensive, but, as a programme, it has been effective for many people who had previously been debarred from going down the medical route. They can now access the postdoctoral process. The legislation on the increase in the pension age to which Deputy McDonald referred will be published very shortly. It has gone through Cabinet and will remove any increase in the pension age to 67 years. We will take a more consistent approach than the Sinn Féin Party has taken in Northern Ireland-----

I spoke with President-elect Joe Biden by telephone in the afternoon of 10 November to offer my congratulations on his and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris's recent success in the United States election. We spoke about his strong ties to Ireland, Mayo and Louth in particular, and his most recent visit here in 2016. He is proud of his roots, like so many of the Irish diaspora in America, and we are deeply proud of the contribution Irish people and people of Irish descent have made to life in the United States. I also acknowledged the huge significance of the election of Vice President-elect Harris - a leap forward for all of us who champion diversity and equality around the world. President-elect Biden reaffirmed his full support for the Good Friday Agreement, and we discussed the importance of an outcome on Brexit that respected the agreement and ensured no return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. He supports the Good Friday Agreement because he believes in it and, as he told me, he wants to see it upheld in letter and in spirit in all circumstances. I took the opportunity to extend an open invitation to President-elect Biden to visit Ireland once he has taken office, if circumstances permit, and he in turn assured me that he looks forward to maintaining the long-standing tradition of events in Washington DC for St. Patrick's Day.

I am sure we are all delighted he was elected. This may very well be the last opportunity we have where a person of such close Irish descent is elected President of America and is able to work with the Government on the many difficult issues we face. In the past 24 hours, we have seen the support of the President-elect for Ireland in respect of the Good Friday Agreement and our relationship with Northern Ireland and Britain. Is it the intention of the Taoiseach to continue what previous Governments put forward, and which I and my party supported, namely, having an envoy to travel to and manage relationships with the United States in respect of those who are undocumented? If that is the case, it is something we would support. It is a worthy cause and something that is very pertinent to all of us across politics. The Taoiseach and Government need to utilise all of the various different relationships, connections and capacity on Capitol Hill and elsewhere, throughout all Irish communities and sectors, to be able to push this agenda given that there will be a very much Irish-oriented President in the White House. Will the Taoiseach consider doing that? If so, what are his timelines for appointing somebody?

I extend to him and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris my best wishes in meeting the challenges that will face the new administration. The President-elect is a long-standing friend of Ireland and has remained unequivocal in his support for the upholding of the Good Friday Agreement. He has consistently taken the position that the US will not allow an international agreement that brought peace to Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit. This is a very important message that comes at a critical time for all of us. The President-elect restated his view that the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland cannot be countenanced as recently as last evening. He and both parties in Congress have made it clear that there will be no trade agreement with Britain unless the Good Friday Agreement is safeguarded in all of its parts. Like the Taoiseach, I look forward to working with the new President and his Administration to ensure that the Good Friday Agreement is protected and its transformative potential fully realised. I also hope that the new Administration will advance the cause of the undocumented Irish in America. While Brexit has dominated much of the public discourse in terms of Irish-US relations, it is important that we acknowledge the hope expressed by our fellow countrywomen and men living in the United States that their situation might finally be regularised in the years ahead.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	232	The life of an undocumented person living without papers in another country is difficult at the best of times. It is hard to imagine how difficult it might be at a time of global pandemic. There are currently 11 million undocumented persons living without papers in the United States. I support their right to stay, irrespective of race, colour or background. Can the Taoiseach report to the House on plans to secure the position of up to 15,000 undocumented Irish people in the US under the new President? It is important for us not to be hypocritical about these matters. Therefore, a Government striving to secure the position of the Irish undocumented in the US needs to secure the position of undocumented persons in this country. There may be as many as 26,000 undocumented persons in Ireland, more than four out of five of whom have lived here for more than five years. They pay tax but have no access to social welfare, healthcare, third level education, etc. Does the Taoiseach agree that if we argue for security for the Irish undocumented in the US - I think we should push very hard for that - we must also provide it for the undocumented in our jurisdiction?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	233	I congratulate the American people on sacking Donald Trump. It is very gratifying to see his increasingly desperate and farcical attempts to deny reality. It reminds me a little bit of Chemical Ali trying to claim that Saddam Hussein was still in charge when the walls were shaking around him. It is amusing but people hope it will bring real change, not least given the absolutely disastrous manner in which Donald Trump dealt with Covid-19. The Taoiseach mentioned that and I want to ask him about it. An issue that is emerging relates to the intellectual property rights of big pharma, which is heavily based in the United States and this country. Big pharma is using intellectual property rights, and essentially its desire to make a profit from vaccines, to prevent their adequate roll-out throughout the world, which is critical. Trump wanted to buy up all the vaccine for America and this is happening in Europe and so on. It would be a disastrous strategy because it would lead to many parts of the world not having the vaccine, resulting in the likelihood of mutations and the vaccine becoming effectively useless and ineffective for all of us. It is absolutely critical that intellectual property rights in respect of propriety technology and the means to produce vaccines once they are declared safe be waived. We need emergency measures - legislation, if necessary - to waive the normal intellectual property rules for the vaccine in order that we can end this pandemic and that profit will not get in the way of that.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	234	To respond to Deputy Kelly, I want to put on record my view that successive ambassadors to the US have punched well above their weight. Our diplomatic performance in the US has continuously been at a very high level, and the current ambassador, Daniel Mulhall, has demonstrated great capacity on a number of fronts. Our diplomats have great experience and have developed significant contacts on both sides of the aisle, and we will continue to nurture those contacts. Progress on the undocumented has been slow because of the changing composition of Congress and of the political circumstances in the United States. There has been the growth of the Latino power base, in particular, which has been proactive in monitoring any changes to the granting of visas to one ethnic group over another and, therefore, the challenge of getting consensus in the House of Representatives and the Senate, in particular, has been difficult. As far back as when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs, the position in respect of the progression of the E-3 visa was close, but not close enough. During Enda Kenny's time as Taoiseach, it came very close but lost by one vote, and that may have subsequently happened again. It has been very tight. I hope, in the first instance, that under the Biden presidency, a more humane approach will be taken to the undocumented generally, of all races and countries of origin, that sanctuary cities will be respected again, and that the sort of threat or the sense of impending intervention will not hang over the undocumented as much as it has in the past four years. As for the question of an envoy, I will keep the proposition under review as to whether it would add value to our diplomatic team. I will consider it and consult people about it. Turning to Deputy McDonald's question, President-elect Biden has been a consistent supporter of the Good Friday Agreement and his comments in the past 24 hours bear witness to that. That is important. As I said earlier in response to Deputy Kelly, I believe there will be a more benign and humane Administration in respect of the migration issue, the undocumented and the progression of the E-3 visa issue. Our diplomatic team will work on this issue and engage with the new team appointed by President-elect Biden as soon as it takes office. We will engage with the team, as will I, and will continue to work with him on this issue. It is a very important issue for those who have been undocumented for quite a long time. The proposal being developed previously to link us to the Australian E-3 visa, was a good and innovative one and may yield results. To respond to Deputy Barry, all countries have to have structured migration strategies and policies, and Ireland is no different. For those who have been undocumented long term, we have to find a solution and the programme for Government has commitments in respect of aspects of that. It is also important to be clear that, along with almost every country, there are a number of processes for migrating to Ireland and they have to continue and be managed in a humane and proper way. The current programme for Government, more than any other, is very committed to a radical reform of a range of provision in this area, from direct provision and minors who have come into the country unaccompanied to those who have been undocumented for quite a length of time. As for Deputy Boyd Barrett's point about big pharma, governments throughout the world do not have the capacity to manufacture vaccines. People talk about big pharma, but the issue is that big pharma and pharmaceuticals in general are necessary. They need to be monitored, and there need to be proper health surveillance, authorisation and assessment of medicines by the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency, for example, at European level and the Food and Drug Administration in the US. Standing back, however, the capacity of companies to get to the stage where we now are, in terms of delivering vaccines-----

While the large orders that have come in from the US have played a role, capacity is important too. I recall, when I was Minister for Health during the severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, epidemic that the European capacity to deal with the vaccine issue was negligible. We have made a great deal of progress on making vaccines available to large numbers of people. Governments need to step up in terms of COVAX and greater resources-----

On 22 October, I set out the Government's vision and priorities on a shared island in an online event at Dublin Castle. More than 800 people participated online, comprising a broad range of civil society, community, sectoral and political representatives throughout the island of Ireland and in Britain. A shared island unit has been established in my Department and the unit is focusing its work in three areas, namely, commissioning research, fostering dialogue and building a shared island agenda, including delivery of the commitments in the programme for Government. The unit is developing a comprehensive research programme and will work with the Economic and Social Research Institute and other partners. North-South and east-west collaboration will be an important part of this work. My Department has also asked the National Economic and Social Council, NESC, to prepare a comprehensive report on shared island issues in 2021. This will provide valuable input from economic, social and environmental partners. Strengthening social, economic and political links on the island and the promotion of all-island approaches to the strategic challenges facing Ireland, North and South, are key objectives for this work. On 22 October, I launched the shared island dialogue series to foster constructive and inclusive civic dialogue on all aspects of a shared future on the island. The series will start on Thursday, 26 November, with a dialogue on "New generations and new voices on the Good Friday Agreement". The dialogue series will focus on important issues for people on the island in the years ahead, such as the environment, health, education and the economy, and key civic concerns that are addressed in the Good Friday Agreement, including identity and equality. The initiative will actively seek as broad a range of perspectives and experiences from civil society on the island as possible, with a focus on the inclusion of voices that have been under-represented in the peace process, including women, young people and new communities on the island. I have had constructive engagement with the British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, on the Government's shared island objectives and commitments. I have made it clear that we are happy also to engage on an east-west basis as we take this work forward. In budget 2021, the Government announced the shared island fund, with a planned €500 million to be made available out to 2025. The fund provides significant new, multi-annual capital funding for investment on a strategic basis in collaborative North-South projects that will support the commitments and objective of the Good Friday Agreement.

I have sent the Taoiseach a copy of our document and I hope that he and his officials within the shared island unit will consider the research and discussions contained within it. As the Taoiseach is aware from his recent engagements with various groups, academics, policymakers and opinion formers, the discussion on Irish unity is taking place right now. We published our discussion document in that spirit. It is a contribution to the exciting and hopeful debate on what a united Ireland might look like. As we approach the centenary of partition, which was imposed on this island with enormous and tragic human and social costs, we believe it is now appropriate, timely and necessary to discuss the economic and democratic deficits that partition produces. In our document, we examine and set out public finance and expenditure data which demonstrate that we can afford to unite this island and, more to the point, that we can no longer afford partition. We consider the precedent of German reunification and we explore the constructive role the EU can provide as we move towards unity. I am regularly bemused by the Taoiseach's opposition to the particular discussion around reunification and a unity referendum. In January last year, he and the leader of the SDLP launched a partnership arrangement which was to deliver an array of policies on three key themes, one of which was Irish unity and the arrangements for a future poll on unity. The obvious next step for the Taoiseach on taking office should have been the establishment of a joint Oireachtas committee on Irish unity, the setting up an all-island Citizens' Assembly, critically, to discuss and plan for reunification, and for Government to develop and publish a White Paper on Irish unity. I ask the Taoiseach again to reconsider the exclusion of all of this work from his shared island unit and its organisational objectives.

In the context of the shared island initiative, a shared vaccine programme would be an immediate way of giving us common cause, North and South, to deal with the pandemic and get us out of the cycle of lockdowns. The Taoiseach should take that idea very seriously. As I said earlier - I would like to hear the Taoiseach's response on this point - the question of intellectual property rights surrounding vaccines is already emerging as a potential block to their roll-out. Ireland, North and South, is in quite a strong position to influence this because of our relationship with the new US President and the significant position of the pharmaceutical industry in this county. We need to be saying, as the United Nations is saying at this time, that intellectual property rights, that is, protections around making profit from new scientific technologies, should simply not apply in the face of a pandemic and the urgent need to roll out a vaccine. We should discuss this issue with our Northern counterparts and with the US President. Does the Taoiseach agree that profit and intellectual property rights should not get in the way of the roll-out of a vaccine? I was very pleased to meet recently with the Ireland Future group. Its proposal is for an all-Ireland constitutional assembly on Ireland's future and looking at uniting the island on a different basis. It has to be a different, better Ireland and it must be about a new future, not just an amalgamation of the two existing states that were so damaged by partition. We would be making a damn good start in that regard if we worked together on delivering a solution to the pandemic by making sure big business does not get in the way of the roll-out of a vaccine.

I certainly will have a look at it, as will the officials in the shared island unit. I would say to the Deputy that it is time to stop playing politics with the North. The shared island initiative is a genuine attempt to create a discussion on how everyone living on this island can share the island into the future. It is a genuine attempt and we want to being new voices into the discussion. It is not about appealing to electoral bases or to one's support base. It is about broadening the discussion out and trying to advance areas and issues that are common challenges to us, such as climate change, energy security, environmental protection and a range of other issues in terms of health, social services and transport. Where common sense is applied, there is a whole range of projects where we can work together to get them done. The playing of politics has undermined the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement for far too long on all sides. The collapse of the Executive for three years was horrendous to me. I just could not understand it and I still do not understand it, given the impact it had on trying to advance mutual understanding. It is good that the Executive has been restored, notwithstanding the challenges it faces, because it gives us some chance of moving forward. The North-South Ministerial Council meetings are now recommenced. The sectoral meetings between Ministers North and South have recommenced. That is the working out of the Good Friday Agreement, which was a watershed moment for all of us on this island. It involved all parties applying themselves pragmatically to constitutional change, which we did, followed by an all-island referendum which voted through the Good Friday Agreement and put in stone the institutions of the agreement, which are important in terms of the advancement of North-South relations and bringing together the two traditions on the island of Ireland. My officials and I have met and briefed Deputy McDonald and her party on the work of the shared island unit. I did not attempt to score political points during that meeting and I would ask the Deputy to desist for a time. She does not have to, every single time that a statement issues, attempt to undermine and score points. I do not really have to talk about my commitment to this issue. It is long-standing. Childish sorts of remarks are an attempt to undermine one party versus another. They do nothing to advance the substantive issues that need to be advanced. In regard to Deputy Boyd Barrett's points, I agree that intellectual property should not be a barrier to the roll-out of the vaccines and nor should profit. A number of companies have been successful so far and the indications are that we could end up, in the shorter term, with seven companies that may, in the next while, get their vaccines through the various regulatory authorities.Oxford–AstraZeneca is an interesting candidate, which has been well supported by the government of the United Kingdom. We, through the European Union, have entered into a pre-purchase agreement there as well. Their vaccine would be far more distributable across the world because it does not have the same temperature conditionality attached to it. It makes that a powerful potential vaccine for Africa and other continents. The WHO has been developing, and seeking funding from world governments to fund, the provision of vaccines on a global basis and that fund could be more generously supported by governments. If one considers the trillions of euro that governments have put in to try t0 keep economies afloat all over the world, a fraction of that investment is all that is required to make sure that we can fund vaccines for populations all over the world that cannot afford to procure vaccines.

Companies can also play their role. My understanding is that some companies will play their role in sharing the data, etc., in relation to this. The overarching priority has to be to get the vaccines out there. We have signed up for three - Pfizer and BioNTech, Oxford–AstraZeneca and Moderna - and will be aligned to the European Commission's pre-purchase agreements that it is engaging with various companies on to make sure that we have the maximum vaccines. We have a national task force and, of course, we will work with the authorities in Northern Ireland. They, obviously, will liaise with the UK public health system as well on vaccines through the NHS. The idea, obviously, is that the entire island is vaccinated as quickly as possible and that people would take up the vaccines on an all-island basis because it is a very important development in our fight against Covid-19.

I do not think there is a Deputy, Senator or councillor who does not know what prompted me to table it for debate. I do not know of a measure to gauge the frustration and anger that exist but I suggest that both are off the scale. The number of people who have contacted public representatives, providers, particularly Eir, and the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, is unprecedented. I appreciate the challenges of Covid-19 but the customer service and the type of response being provided to people are completely inexcusable. The level of frustration expressed by members of the transport and communications committee earlier on when we had the CEO from Eir before us reflected the wider frustration and anger among the population and the users of those services in particular. The meeting could have gone on all day such was the level of engagement and the number of concerns that people had to raise. As I said, I appreciate that Covid is a particular challenge but I do not accept that as an excuse from Eir or any other provider because some of these issues have been around since long before Covid-19. Eir came before the committee today and apologised for the service and promised a better future, but we have been listening to those promises for a long time and I, for one, am not confident that they will be realised. Consequently, people are caught in a catch-22 situation; they feel that they have nowhere to turn and that they are not getting a response. Many people will have seen the RTÉ "Prime Time" programme last night. It was proof positive that some of the claims being made by these companies are not actually being realised in practical terms. The average waiting times are one such example. I would be interested to hear what the median is because very many people are waiting far in excess of ten minutes and often up to 40 minutes. I have seen Facebook and other social media posts about people waiting on the line for in excess of two hours. At the root of this is a lack of accountability, an impotence, if you like, on behalf of the regulator and it is this House that legislates for the regulator. We should not have privatised these industries; that is part of the problem here and we are paying the price for it. Huge damage has been done to the public's confidence in this sector and a lot of work must be done to address it. I am glad the Minister is here. I want to know what he has done to engage with the sector to address this issue and to improve it in the time ahead.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	249	I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this issue, which was also raised by the Ceann Comhairle on Question Time in the House two weeks ago. The electricity and gas retail markets in Ireland operate within the European Union regulatory regime wherein electricity and gas markets are commercial, liberalised and competitive. Responsibility for the regulation of those electricity and gas markets is solely a matter for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. However, I understand the Deputy is referring directly to the recent published coverage of the telecommunications customer service issues. It is important to note that the provision of the telecommunications services occurs within a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent market regulator, ComReg. The latter is responsible for the regulation of the electronic communications sector in accordance with national and EU legislation. As part of its role, ComReg implements the telecommunications regulatory framework which requires each telecommunications service provider to establish and operate a code of practice, including requirements for complaint handling and means of contact with customers. Service providers must implement these measures, at a minimum, to assist consumers when they need to contact them with a complaint. A copy of the code of practice can be accessed online at www.comreg.ie. Any operator failing to comply with any of these requirements is a matter to be pursued by ComReg. ComReg is aware of the unhappiness with the level of customer service currently being provided by telecommunications operators and by Eir in particular. In this regard, it has been in regular discussions with the company in an effort to address the current deficiencies in its customer care service. I understand that while Eir recently experienced a significantly higher turnover in consumer care staff, it is proactively engaging with ComReg and improvements have been made to its customer services in recent times. ComReg has published on its website a detailed note on all the actions it has taken to resolve those customer care issues. This information includes a recommendation that customers who have complaints should in the first instance contact the service provider using its customer complaints number. Regarding Eir specifically, ComReg advises that the company has two customer complaints numbers: Eir at Home and Eir Business. Details of these are provided on the ComReg website.ComReg understands that wait times for these complaint numbers are substantially lower and more acceptable than Eir's general customer service number. Customers whose complaint has not been sufficiently dealt with by the service provider within ten working days should contact ComReg, which will then contact the provider on the customer's behalf to resolve the complaint. I recognise that further work remains to be done and, consequently, in discussion with the Department, ComReg continues to review what additional measures could be taken to assist in protecting consumer interests. This includes consideration of what, if any, further legislative or non-legislative changes the regulator considers necessary and appropriate. Furthermore, the Tánaiste and I recently met Eir and Vodafone to raise concerns about customer care issues. Today, Eir appeared before the Oireachtas joint committee, where the Deputy had the opportunity to discuss the matter directly with management of the company. I am certain the telecommunications customer care issues will be resolved in the short term. This is a critical issue. As the Deputy said, widespread complaints have been raised in the House and all of us take it particularly seriously. Some of the ways it has been raised here, including in comments by the Ceann Comhairle, have helped bring the matter to the attention of the wider public and I hope this is one way that will make sure things do change.
#DarrenORourke	unknown-#DarrenORourke-party	unknown-#DarrenORourke-dob	unknown-#DarrenORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	250	It is important to put on the record that the scale of the problem has not been properly reflected in the figures that have been made public. Last night, for example, RTÉ reflected on the number of complaints that ComReg dealt with, which was 1,062 over a three-month period. It also had a number of other queries. In fact, only a fraction of the people who have problems and issues with these providers ever go to ComReg. Earlier today, Eir told us it deals with the massive number of 230,000 calls a month. We know the frustration of a significant percentage of these people is related to the decrease in the number of call centre staff and the delay in getting a response. We should be frank regarding the scale of the problem. It is not reflected in the ComReg figures, with the greatest of respect to the commission. The Minister is correct that we should say loud and clear from here with regard to Eir that people should be encouraged to use the 1800 number instead of the 1901 number because this can make a difference. With regard to the his responsibility and the role of ComReg to enforce the code of practice, at present the code of practice is not a deterrent. It is essentially a voluntary scheme and the slap on the wrist amounts to nothing, perhaps a €5,000 fine for a company such as Eir that makes profits of €222 million. ComReg wants and needs more power. It is looking for it and the Government has committed to this in the programme for Government. When will we see the legislation?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	251	The Deputy is correct that the numbers are only a small reflection of the problems that exist. However, the numbers do help to give some indicative sense of where the problem is, and in this instance the volume of complaints about problems with Eir's fixed line service was multiples of the next nearest company, Vodafone, which was, in turn, a multiple of the next nearest company. It also shows clearly that the problem was with fixed line services rather than mobile. It also reflects that not only was Covid a partial cause of some of the difficulties that arose but also a real cause of concern for householders because at this time more than any other, people need their fixed broadband service. The scale of the problem is beyond compare, as the Deputy said, and cannot be underestimated. When it comes to further remedies or further actions, the Department, and I as Minister, keep in regular contact with ComReg, while recognising it is an independent regulator. To work best it has to have independence to be able to sanction and make calls on investment or other criteria. If there are proposals from ComReg regarding using its powers to help implement the customer codes, the Government will be immediately forthcoming. This is not a constraint that will limit our ability to make sure customer care improves. We will absolutely work in collaboration with ComReg to make sure it has all of the power it needs to manage the issue. Wait times for calls and the inability to get through to someone is the most frustrating aspect, and then when people finally do get through they are so exasperated that it is not an easy conversation. The wait times I hear reported from the company have improved in recent weeks. The worst of this problem emerged in late summer and early autumn in terms of the inability of Eir to hold onto the staff it needed and the increase in demand from customers who, because of Covid, had genuine complaints and reason to complain. This variety of circumstances has somewhat been addressed in terms of, I understand, shorter and improved response times but if there is any call from ComReg for further powers for it to be able to further police this, the Government will respond straight away.

They need broadband to be able to work from home, for college, to run their businesses and for social use. A great number of people from Ballingeary, to Ballinora to Ballyhea and everywhere in between are in the intervention area and waiting for services. While there is a patchwork of wireless operators, including Rapid and Imagine, they are only able to cover some of the area and many people are left without options. The national broadband plan, NBP, has been up and running for a year at this stage and it will take another four years at least to cover much of the area. It is only covering one area in each county as it stands. In a county the size of Cork, which covers one eighth of the island, this is only a drop in the ocean. Macroom's council area is the size of County Leitrim and there are nine similar areas in Cork. The plan is being rolled out in an uneven way with only one area in each county. Larger counties such as Cork, Mayo and Galway are losing out. It is very frustrating for people who need to be able to access broadband, which should be made available more evenly. It is very frustrating for people when the fibre is so near their home but they do not have access, especially if they do not have a wireless option nearby. People have also been raising with me how they cannot get a handle on a timeline on the plan. They are left very much in the dark waiting for broadband. The NBP does not seem to be taking on what appear to be low hanging fruit, for example, where commercial fibre is passing homes. People are not getting the opportunity to make a connection to it. From Derrynacaheragh to Coppeen to Castletown and Kilmichael, vast areas do not have the option available to them and are very much dependent on getting the NBP moving quickly. It is not only an issue for rural areas. On the edge of the city boundary, in Ovens and Ballinora, which overlook the global cloud computing company, Dell EMC, many people are struggling to access broadband services. Even the blue commercial zone there are serious issues, for example in Heathfield, Ballincollig, where residents have been in for almost 16 months and Eir is still not rolling out fibre connections to them. It does not make sense. We would have expected that within the blue commercial zone these would have been the areas where Eir would have quickly had the service rolled out.We will find every kind of excuse, from Eircode postcodes not being available to not being able to get on site and so on. This is despite the fact residents in Heathfield have had their Eircode postcodes since February last. Ducts have been installed as part of the construction, the builders have moved to phase 3 and still the fibre has not been laid when people have been living there for 16 months. Is there some way the Minister can raise this with Eir and ComReg to see if they can quickly roll out broadband in those blue areas, as well as in the intervention area? It is very frustrating for people who have to sit so close to the fibre and not have an option. There are also many people in rural areas who really have no option of getting broadband and who are waiting for the national broadband plan.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	253	The national broadband plan contract was signed with National Broadband Ireland, NBI, in November last to roll out a high-speed and future-proofed broadband network within the intervention area, which covers 1.1 million people living and working in over 544,000 premises, including almost 100,000 businesses and farms, along with 695 schools. The national broadband plan will ensure that citizens throughout the entire country have access to high-speed broadband services and that nobody is left without this vital service. The national broadband plan network will offer users a high-speed broadband service with a minimum download speed of 500 Mbps from the outset. I should point out that this represents an increase from the original 150 Mbps committed to under the contract. The current deployment team forecasts premises passed in all counties within the first two years, and over 90% of premises having access to high-speed broadband within the next four years. The high-speed broadband map, to which the Deputy referred, is available at broadband.gov.ie and it shows the area in Cork which will be included in the national broadband plan State-led intervention, as well as areas targeted by commercial operators. There are 273,548 premises in Cork, of which 79,424 premises will be covered by high-speed broadband through the State-led intervention. A further 194,124 premises are in areas where commercial providers are either currently delivering or have plans to deliver high-speed broadband services. Government investment in County Cork under the national broadband plan will be of the order of €314 million. As of 16 November, over 131,000 premises across all counties in the country have been surveyed by NBI. Of this figure, over 16,000 premises have been surveyed to date in County Cork, including in the areas of Carrigaline and Midleton. NBI crews have started initial works with a build in around 4,000 premises in the Carrigaline area, including Fountainstown, Ballinhassig, Monkstown and Upper Rochestown. The first fibre-to-the-home connections are expected next month in Carrigaline, and they will be subject to technical testing and validation prior to wider release of the area. I am advised that, from the end of January, retailers will be able to resell the service and householders in these areas will be able to order high-speed broadband provided via the NBI network. Further details are available on specific areas within Cork on the NBI website, which provides a facility for any premises within the intervention area to register an interest in being provided with deployment updates through that website. Broadband connection points, BCPs, are also a key element of the national broadband plan, providing high-speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre to the home network. It is anticipated that some 275 sites in rural areas will be installed with broadband in this way by the end of the year, including 75 schools. As of Friday, 13 November, 147 sites and 43 schools have had those connections installed. The high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for publicly available sites, and by the Department of Education for schools. These national broadband BCPs are located across County Cork, where the public will be able to benefit from the services at Ballindangan community centre, Aghabullogue community centre, Castletownkenneigh community centre, Lisavaird community centre, Whitechurch community centre and the TO Park in Labbamologga. Further infrastructure is being installed by NBI at Bear Island heritage centre, Laharn heritage centre and Ballydaly community hall, and it is anticipated that these sites will be connected in the coming weeks. Further details are available on the NBI website. Clogagh and Ballycroneen national schools will also connected for educational access as part of that initiative. My Department continues to work with the Department of Education and the other schools in the intervention area in Cork. While substantial progress has been made, the Covid pandemic has had an impact on delivery of the network and the extent of that impact is currently being assessed. We have committed to putting in place measures to mitigate the impact as far as possible.

I again draw the Minister's attention to the fact that, despite the size of Cork, there is nowhere within 40 or 50 miles of that where the service is being delivered. It is similar in north-west, west and east Cork, which makes up one eighth of the country. The national broadband plan is being rolled out but areas such as Lissarda, near Kilmurray, Castletown, Coppeen and Togher have been left without service. Those responsible for the national broadband plan need to get a handle on rolling out into those rural areas much faster and serving communities. I have outlined to the Minister the situation in regard to the blue zone, where it was expected that broadband would already have been rolled out in commercial areas. I have outlined to the Minister the very slow pace. Heathfield is in phase 3 of construction, people have been living there for 16 months at this stage and Eircode postcodes have been available since the beginning of this year, yet, despite the ducting being available, Eir has not run fibre through it. Eir must be answerable somewhere because when it is raised with ComReg, it is always the case that Eir has provided some sop of an answer about 3 Mbps, which will probably only deliver 1 Mbps. It is not working. Eir needs to be answerable and it needs to roll out the fibre. Nearby, in Killumney village, again in a blue zone, many people would have expected to have the nearby fibre connected, yet their properties appear as yellow dots on the national broadband plan, which means their connection has been delayed further. People in the blue zone would reasonably expect to have had services rolled out before now. I ask that the national broadband plan would be rolled out more quickly and also that the Minister would raise the issue of the blue zone with ComReg and with Eir to get those areas served more quickly.

In response to the earlier question from Deputy O'Rourke, I said we had met both Eir and Vodafone to discuss this issue of the customer complaints service. I used that opportunity to also ask about the roll-out of broadband in other areas. There are a number of points. First, the key next stage in the development of rural broadband is the involvement of Eir and the ESB in taking these surveys, given 130,000 houses have been surveyed already, and turning it into a plan, pole by pole, for how we get fixed broadband to the house. The company committed that it would give it full urgency and do everything to match what exists in government and in NBI, which is a desire to accelerate the roll-out programme, particularly because of the acceleration in the demand for broadband services due to Covid. That is possible, and it requires Eir to have a critical role. Second, the company said it has now delivered on the 300,000 or so houses that it had committed to providing with high-speed broadband in rural Ireland, on time and ahead of schedule, with a huge pick-up in demand. With Cork accounting for one eighth of the country, that would equate to some 35,000 houses in the Cork area that will have got broadband through that service, although I will have to check that figure with the company. Third, and critically, SIRO, which is a joint venture involving Vodafone and the ESB, has also been very successful in rolling out broadband, more in towns than in rural areas because that is where it has targeted. The Deputy is correct that it is important we get the national broadband plan right. However, it is also important that, in other areas of rural Ireland which are not in the intervention area, in the towns and, I have to say, in the urban areas as well, that we get the same level of investment so every single house in this country has access to the high-speed fast broadband that we need. I am confident in the policy we have, given that there is a variety of different companies which are not competing against each other.Where that does not exist we intervene in the market to cover the house that would not have otherwise been covered. We will cover every single house in this country and we will do it quicker than the original seven years set out in the national broadband plan. It is essential that we advance that quicker in Cork and everywhere else.

It relates to a friend of a constituent who, along with the partner and family, borrowed money during the boom times. It was not wise borrowing. The Ceann Comhairle or I would not have approved or authorised it but many things happened during the boom that we would not have authorised. In any event, the family suffered a number of bereavements, which substantially altered the ability to repay and serious issues were arising. A partial solution was found in 2018 where part of the properties were sold to liquidate some of the debt and, as the Ceann Comhairle and I know, the worst possible solution is a partial solution; it has to be all or nothing. We now have a situation whereby the current lender proposes to secure the rest of the property and make the person homeless. I intervened some weeks ago explaining the reason I wanted a delay in the process until some dialogue could be entered into and an arrangement agreed within the capabilities of the borrower to meet and for the bank to accept. Very little followed from that until, in the past week or so, the remaining borrower received notice to the effect that it looked as if the intention was to seek liquidation or receivership. I corresponded once again on 18 November to the effect that I was anxious to obtain an urgent response in order to engage with some entity which could speak with authority. I did not receive a reply until I sent a further letter and email in the past 24 hours to state that I proposed to raise the case in the House at the earliest opportunity, that I had already raised it in the finance committee and had invoked the Central Bank to respond and get involved in dealing with that kind of situation in a way that gives some recognition to the plight of the borrower when she is doing her best or cannot do any better than she is doing. To be fair, I then received a response from the solicitor acting for the companies who said there was no longer any need to raise it in the House because they recognised there was a possibility of some discussion taking place but that they would not defer further action because they only received my letter on the day after they had authorised the legal action. That is immaterial because the client can always instruct her legal representatives to go ahead or stop as the case may be. I am particularly grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue in the House. I believe that it is possible to make a meaningful contribution provided that the lending institution involved is prepared to recognise that it has a role to play also and that there are human issues in this type of case that should be recognised. I hope that as and from today we will have a situation whereby I can enter into dialogue on behalf of the borrower, which hopefully will be of benefit to that borrower.

In the first instance I wish to express my sincere condolences to the borrower on her recent bereavements. In this case I assume the Deputy is referring to a borrower whose mortgage is held by the entity to which he referred in the details supplied. This entity in question is authorised on a transitional basis on the Central Bank's register of credit servicing firms. This provides for entities to be authorised until the Central Bank has granted or refused their authorisation as long as they were carrying on the activity of a credit servicing firm before the requirement to be authorised. While under consideration for full authorisation, the loan owners nevertheless still have to comply with a suite of consumer protection and other regulatory requirements, including the Central Bank's statutory codes, and therefore the consumer protections which applied when the loan was initially made continue to apply fully following the purchase of a loan by the new creditor, which I will detail now. The code of conduct on mortgage arrears, the CCMA, in particular provides a strong consumer protection framework for borrowers who are in arrears or pre-arrears on a mortgage loan secured on a primary residence. The overriding objective of the CCMA is to ensure the fair and transparent treatment of consumers in mortgage arrears or pre-arrears and that due regard is had to the fact that each case of mortgage arrears is unique and needs to be considered on its own merits. The CCMA recognises that it is in the interests of borrowers and regulated firms to address financial difficulties as speedily, effectively and sympathetically as circumstances allow. It also sets out the mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, which is a four-step process that regulated entities must follow. The key step in this MARP is the resolution of a particular mortgage difficulty. In this regard, the CCMA requires, in respect of a co-operating borrower, regulated entities to explore all of the options for an alternative repayment arrangement, ARA, offered by that lender. Furthermore, the regulated entity is required to document its considerations of each option examined, including the reasons the option or options offered are appropriate and sustainable in the individual circumstances of the case and also the reason options considered and not offered are not appropriate and not considered to be sustainable for the borrower's individual circumstances. Where a regulated entity does not offer an ARA it must, among a range of requirements, set out on paper or another durable medium the reasons for that decision to the borrower, inform the borrower of the other options available to him or her, such as a voluntary sale or mortgage to rent, and inform the borrower of his or her right to appeal the decision under the CCMA to the lenders appeal board and also the right to consult a personal insolvency practitioner. In addition, following an internal CCMA appeals process, the regulated entity will also be required to inform the borrower of her right to refer the matter to the statutory Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman of Ireland. It is also necessary for the lender to engage in real, effective and proportionate communication with the borrower. In this regard, it should be noted that provision 8 of the CCMA provides that at the borrower's request and with the borrower's written consent the lender must liaise with a third party nominated by the borrower to act on her behalf in relation to her arrears situation. That is an important provision but it is also a very clear rule, which is at the heart of the Deputy's question. The lender must liaise with a third party nominated by the borrower. For example, for borrowers relying on the help of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, the lender must engage with that service. However, the provision does not prevent the lender from contacting the borrower directly regarding other matters or issuing communications required under the code directly to the borrower. Furthermore, under provision 22, a lender must ensure that the level of communications is proportionate, that communications are not aggressive, intimidating or harassing and that borrowers are given sufficient time to complete required actions. I hope this will offer assistance to the Deputy in his engagement with the constituent who is experiencing mortgage difficulty.

The one fault that I and many other Members in this House have raised regarding such issues is that the MARP that is available is something the lenders draw up and immediately tell the borrower and those acting on their behalf that they do not qualify and cannot get the benefit, that the borrower has a distressed loan and that the lender believes he or she does not have the ability to discharge it. That does not mean that it is impossible to resolve it. There is almost €170,000 in interest in this particular situation, which is a considerable amount of money, particularly when part of the loan is covered by a very low interest tracker mortgage. There are many issues to be discussed in regard to this case and it should be possible to bring about a satisfactory resolution.The most important thing is that Deputies have access to the Ceann Comhairle to raise these issues and to the Central Bank via the relevant committees of the House to be assured that what is happening is in accordance with the legislation, due process and best practice. I thank the Minister of State for his reply and the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating me in raising the issue.

Borrowers have a suite of protections and lenders have a range of responsibilities to discharge when dealing with borrowers in arrears. There are also a number of public supports available to borrowers in debt difficulty, such as MABS and the Abhaile service for mortgage debt. I encourage any borrower who is experiencing difficulty to engage with these services. If a borrower is in significant difficulty, the Deputy may also wish to note that there is also scope for a personal insolvency practitioner, PIP, to be appointed by a borrower to assist him or her in reaching a satisfactory outcome with the lender. Where a PIP is appointed, the PIP may make a proposal to the borrower's creditors, and even where that proposal is rejected by the creditors, there is the ability, if the arrangement includes a loan which is secured on a principal private residence, for it to be adopted by the courts. As the Deputy will know, the Minister for Justice is currently bringing forward legislation to extend the circumstances in which this option is available to borrowers. Much has been done over the last years to enhance protections for borrowers and I assure the Deputy that the Minister for Finance will continue to work with the Central Bank, as regulator, to ensure that the full suite of consumer protection measures is available to borrowers and that lenders who do not meet their requirements are dealt with appropriately under the supervisory framework for regulated financial service providers.

The Minister of State is well aware of the cross-border directive that has been in place for a number of years and the fact that people have availed of procedures that can be carried out in the North. Has the Government put into the Withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Consequential Provisions) Bill 2020 a provision or an arrangement to allow the cross-border directive, under which more than 5,000 people from the South have had eye-saving surgery, hip and knee operations in the North, to remain in force? If not for this directive, thousands of people, mainly from west Cork and Kerry, would have gone blind or been left in severe pain. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I have taken more than 2,000 people for surgery and we want to know if this will continue. We have been led on a merry dance for the past couple of months and no clear answer has been given.

I have been taking people from Kerry and Deputy Michael Collins has been taking people from west Cork to Belfast to get their sight restored, have hips and knees replaced, have operations on shoulders and other ailments and, for youngsters, to have their tonsils removed. I took a child of eight years of age to get cataracts removed from both eyes so that he could go back to school and I took a man as old as 95. Is the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, replying?

Will the Government put this bilateral arrangement in place? The Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, gave an assurance that patients from the North would be reimbursed if they had to be treated in the South, so why can people from the South not get similar reimbursement if they have to be treated in the North?

They have brought thousands of people to Belfast to have operations performed in order to stop them from going blind or to replace hips. I have had a number of people from Tipperary accommodated and they got successful treatment. With no disrespect to the Minister of State, it is a scandal that neither the Minister for Foreign Affairs nor the Minister for Health is here to answer this. This has been kicked around on the head of a pin for the last several months because we are frightened. People are ringing every day to try to get in before 1 January. We have all the bilateral agreements and everything else, and people can come here, rightfully so. This Government seems to be making an effort to stop this because it is embarrassed. It would rather let people go blind and have issues with hips, knees, backs, scoliosis, tonsils and everything else, rather than accept what the rural Independent Deputies are doing, which is the Government's job, and help people to get services that they should be getting here. It is an embarrassment that they have to go to the North. We have to have a clear and definite answer, and at least a month's moratorium for January, because there are queues of people waiting to go. It is totally unfair to them. They are sick.

The directive on patient's rights in cross-border healthcare, commonly called the cross-border directive, provides rules for the reimbursement to patients of the cost of receiving treatment abroad where the patient would be entitled to such treatment in his or her home member state. The directive seeks to ensure a clear and transparent framework for the provision of cross-border healthcare within the EU for those occasions where the care patients seek is provided in another member state rather than in their home country. The EU cross-border directive which has been implemented in Ireland since 2014 has enabled many Irish patients to access health services in many other EU member states. Geographic proximity to Northern Ireland and the UK means that the vast majority of Irish patients tend to access care in that jurisdiction. That is why the decision of our neighbour, the UK, to leave the EU has a very real impact on our citizens. As the cross-border directive is underpinned by EU legislation, from 1 January next, the provisions of this scheme will no longer apply to Northern Ireland and the UK in general. This is an unfortunate and undesirable consequence of Brexit that is outside the Government's control, but the Minister for Health is acutely aware that patients and Deputies are concerned about the loss of access to services, particularly in Northern Ireland, which are accessed under the directive. As part of Department officials' Brexit planning, there has been extensive examination of this matter, which has raised a number of key policy and legal issues. Noting the importance the Department places on ensuring that Irish patients will continue to access this capacity, the Minister has tasked officials with examining the feasibility of implementing a unilateral arrangement similar to the cross-border directive to provide that Irish residents can continue to access services from private health service providers in the UK post the end of the transition period. That work, which is detailed and complex, is ongoing. I reassure Deputies that it is the Minister's intention that Irish patients should be able to benefit from accessing these services in future. It important to restate that patients will still have recourse to access health services under the EU cross-border directive scheme in 30 other countries from 1 January 2021.

His reply was a bit confusing in that I am not so sure that the bilateral arrangement will be secured or about what will be covered. He stated that there is an option to go to mainland Europe. I do not think it is fair to tell someone in their 80s or 90s to get on a plane to travel abroad to get a cataract removed, while it is not an option at all for those seeking to have hips and knees replaced or for children of eight years of age.For such a child that might have cataracts, that is not a real option. I am asking the Minister of State to pull out all the stops to ensure that we get a bilateral arrangement which will ensure that people will be reimbursed.

I know that other Deputies and councillors besides those of us here are inundated with urgent phone calls from people. They are frantic to get to the North before 31 December because they are going blind. We need 100% confirmation that this scheme or a scheme like it will continue and that people can go to the private hospitals in the North regardless of where they are so that this can continue. I am not making this up because if the Minister of State came down to the lower floor of the Chamber to me later on I will show him a list where over 100 people have phoned me over the last week begging me to take them North because they think that the scheme is going to end.

He runs like a scalded cat every time we have a question or a motion down to talk to him. It is a total disrespect to the Rural Independent group. A scalded cat would not go through the skylight as fast as he has gone and he is like snow off a ditch on other occasions. The answer given by the Minister of State is condescending to older people. My colleagues here bus people to the North. Unfortunately we do not have the technology to enable buses to travel on water to go abroad and to tell people that they can go there. We have to tell people at the 11th and a half hour that the Government is looking at a bilateral agreement. It had two years to do this. The Government never accepted that the British were going to go. It should have in order to be ready. We are closing the stable door when the horse has well bolted. We want certainty and to know that people can go. First, these people should be treated in Ireland and it is the Irish taxpayer who pays for this. It is a mockery that they have to go there but the opportunity was there and I want to thank Niamh and all of the staff in Kingsbridge Private Hospital for being so helpful and to thank Deputy Michael Collins and others who have organised this, together with the staff in Deputy Collins’s office who run around in the middle of the night picking up people to bring them to a bus in Cork. The Government has no idea the effort that goes into this. It is worth it because people can see, stand up and walk and live with some modicum of quality-of-life. This is not acceptable at this point in time. It should have been in the omnibus Bill.

The decision of our neighbour to leave the EU will have unfortunate, negative implications for Ireland that are outside our control. This includes the loss of access to healthcare services currently provided for through the cross-border directive, CBD, representing a substantive and real loss of access to healthcare services for Irish people. As I said, the Department of Health officials are continuing to examine this matter with a view to ensuring that access to services in Northern Ireland and the UK might be retained in 2021. Separately, it is useful to note that we have a memorandum of understanding with the UK that will be signed shortly which will ensure continued access for Irish residents to essential healthcare in the UK post the end of the transition period. This is a very positive outcome in terms of the Irish and British Governments’ commitment to maintaining, insofar as possible, the current healthcare arrangements under the common travel area. In addition, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, I assure Deputies that both the Irish and UK Governments are fully committed to continuing existing cross-border health services like cardiology, cancer treatment services in Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry and paediatric cardiology and related maternity services in Dublin and to ongoing health service co-operation into the future. Finally, the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, will keep Deputies updated on progress as to the examination by Department officials of the feasibility of implementing a unilateral CBD type arrangement.

It has 22 parts and has 11 different Government Ministers dealing with the legislation as a whole. I thank Opposition parties, in particular spokespeople, and the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating what is a very unusual approach to legislation albeit the most appropriate approach, given the complexity of the challenges that we face in the context of Brexit and I hope that we can work through this Bill with Ministers coming and going as they must deal with the sections that they are responsible for. That is 11 different Ministers potentially between now and 9.30 p.m. I want to recognise and thank the House for its co-operation.These two amendments that I am dealing with are very straightforward and completely uncontroversial. Amendment No. 1 is simply changing the title of the Minister which had been in the previous omnibus legislation from the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation and to substitute the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Amendment No. 3 is doing the same. It is simply deleting "Minister for Justice and Equality" and substituting "Minister for Justice" which again is recognising the current ministerial title. These are two technical amendments and I assume that nobody will have any difficulty with them.

Amendment No. 17 inserts a new single section Part 20 into the Bill, which amends a number of provisions in Schedule 1 of the Defamation Act 2009. The amendments essentially aim to ensure that post-Brexit fair and accurate public interest reporting of certain statements, meetings and press conferences that are held in the UK will continue to be protected against claims of defamation by the defence of qualified privilege in exactly the same way that it exists today. It is making an amendment to include the United Kingdom as part of the structure that currently exists. The amendments arise because several provisions in the 2009 Act regarding the qualified defence applied to reporting of statements and meetings which occur in EU member states. The amendments simply amend these provisions to refer to reports of matters including members of the United Kingdom. It is quite straightforward. Amendment No. 18 provides for the amendment of the Long Title of the Bill and this is necessary simply because of the insertion of the section of the Bill to provide for the amendment to the Defamation Act.

I apologise as I have only just walked into the Chamber for the debate and I believed we were dealing with section 4. Part 4 of the Bill provides for amendments to the Companies Act 2014 to facilitate the operation of a substitute securities settlement system compatible with the law of the EU after the transition period. The settlement of securities trades, whereby securities are transferred by the seller to the buyer and funds are transferred from the buyer to the seller, is typically made in a securities settlement system operated by central securities depositories, CSDs. The statutory changes are in respect of securities held by a company in a CSD authorised by the EU Central Securities Depositories Regulation 2014. I refer to public companies with shares and other securities using a CSD which are listed on the Irish market. Payment and securities settlement systems are essential to the efficient functioning of all modern economies, which rely, for their continued growth and overall well-being, on the free and open trade of goods and services. This relates to legislation introduced by the Department of Finance, the Migration of Participating Securities Act 2019, which came through the system last year. The changes to the companies legislation are to allow for electronic transfers as opposed to written certificates, which have been used under the UK model. I can go through each section if the Deputy wants.

Until now, the system was operated under the UK's central bank. Owing to the changes because of Brexit, we are moving to a Belgian bank. This was dealt with in legislation by the Department of Finance last year. The UK system was paper based. The changes to companies law are to facilitate electronic transfers in respect of certificates and securities. They are to copper-fasten the electronic system.

This section is amended so that investments made in the UK can be taken into account in the calculation of the amount of relief. It is a capital gains tax measure. We need to provide for gains in the UK to be taken into account in calculating the amount of relief in respect of capital gains tax.

We are only changing Irish law. We have no jurisdiction to change English law. It is a good question. Is it being reciprocated on the other side? It may or may not be. That is the answer. If it is not reciprocated on the other side, Irish and English taxpayers will be covered under the normal double taxation agreements that apply between countries in any event. If the UK reciprocates, that is perfect. If it does not, the double taxation agreements in place between Ireland and the UK and many other countries will apply to all of these situations regardless of whether the UK changes the legislation at its end.

“Amendment of section 2 of Act of 2010
61. Section 2 of the Act of 2010 is amended—(a) in subsection (1), in the definition of “Community”, by the insertion of “, subject to subsection (4A),” before “has the same meaning”,(b) in subsection (4), by the insertion of “, subject to subsection (4A),” before “references to Member States”, and(c) by the insertion of the following subsection after subsection (4):“(4A) In this Act, each reference to—(a) Community, and(b) Member State, shall apply as if the reference included a reference to Northern Ireland, save—(i) where the reference occurs in a provision specified in Part 1 of Schedule 9, and(ii) in the case of a provision specified in Part 2 of Schedule 9, in so far as the provision applies to services.”.”.Amendments Nos. 8 and 12 relate to value added tax. The changes proposed in amendment No. 8 are designed to ensure that our primary legislation on VAT is consistent with the protocol by including Northern Ireland in the definition of member states and the European Union where those references relate to transactions in goods but not with regard to transactions in services. This means the definition of "Member State" and "Community" in a VAT context will differ depending on the nature of the transaction under consideration. Section 2 is amended to ensure transactions involving Northern Ireland are defined correctly having regard to the Northern Ireland protocol. It inserts a new section 4A which specifies sections of the Act that are included or excluded from the application of the revised meaning of "Member State" and "Community" in the amendments section, depending upon the type of transaction. Amendment No. 12 inserts a new schedule to the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010. The amendment to the definitions of "Member State" and "Community" will ensure Northern Ireland will be considered after the transaction period to be within the community and a member state with regard to goods from outside the community and not a member state with regards to services. This correctly reflects the treatment contemplated by the Northern Ireland protocol. As a result, the treatment of taxable transactions involving Northern Ireland is not universal but differs according to the type of supply is at issue and whether it relates to goods or services. Provisions governing goods must deem Northern Ireland to be part of the Community and a member state while provisions relating to services of the same Act must deem Northern Ireland not to be part of the Community or a member state in accordance with the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol. Schedule 9 consists of two Parts. Part 1 sets out the provisions in the Act to refer to services and disapplies the definition of "Member State" and "Community" to Northern Ireland. Part 2 deals with the provisions of the Act that reference transactions in both goods and services. This presents a complication as the Northern Ireland protocol requires that Northern Ireland is seen to be within the Community for the purposes of goods but outside the Community for the purposes of services. This is addressed by the section by disapplying the definition of "Member State" and "Community" to Northern Ireland only in respect of services. Members can see that under the agreement, there is a different treatment relating to goods and services. We include Northern Ireland as part of the "Community" or a "Member State" in respect of one but differently in respect of the other, depending on the nature of the transaction.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	314	I move amendment No. 9:In page 42, to delete lines 12 to 15.I am joined by my colleagues in the Labour Party, my Independent colleagues and those in Sinn Féin on this issue. This amendment is simple and straightforward. It is to reinstate tax-free shopping that is about to be abolished, especially for visitors to these shores from the United States. This is a valuable sector of trade and business within the overall tourism trade. With the stroke of a pen, the Government is proposing to use a sledgehammer to crack a nut in adopting this vehicle in its amendment to close off this VAT retail export scheme. The objective behind the amendment is to enable people who visit Ireland from outside the European Union and who are resident outside the European Union to claim VAT back on purchases and bring those purchases back to their country of origin. Historically, the rate has been set at 0% so that people do not pay any VAT whatever.As we all know, the retail and tourism sectors are on their knees due to the lockdown we have experienced and the restrictions that have been imposed over the past eight months as a result of Covid-19. Next year, not only will they have to deal with the challenge of Covid-19, the knock-on impact, the carry-forward of debt and the lack of cash flow from 2020 into 2021, they will also have to cope with the unique challenges that will be thrown up as a result of Brexit. These challenges are immeasurable at this point. Effectively, this proposal by Government is turning the screw on the financial viability of quite a number of businesses, many of them along the western seaboard. In my constituency, we have Dubarry of Ireland, based in Ballinasloe, where there are 50 staff. There is a question mark over their jobs as a result of this measure by the Government. Jobs across the midland counties are hard to come by. We have seen the challenges in terms of Bord na Móna. We have a particularly difficult challenge in terms of job retention in the town of Ballinasloe. There are 50 people working for Dubarry and now there is a question mark over some of their jobs as a result of what is proposed. At present, approximately 50% of the transactions involving US visitors to Ireland are under the threshold of €75. As a result, we are excluding 50% of the purchases by US visitors to this country. No other EU country is increasing its VAT rates as a result of the United Kingdom leaving the Union. In fact, Spain, which has the largest number of UK visitors annually, is reducing its VAT threshold for non-EU visitors from €80 to zero. France, which is closer to the UK than Ireland is and which has a far greater level of frequency of services, is reducing its VAT reclaim threshold from €175 to €100. Spain and France, the two biggest destinations for UK visitors, are reducing their thresholds and, at the same time, we are increasing ours from zero to €75. This will send out a bad message to UK visitors. We want them to come and visit Ireland and yet we are increasing taxes on purchase they make in this jurisdiction while our counterparts in Spain and France are doing the opposite. The reputational damage that will be done to the Irish tourism sector, particularly in the British market, could take decades to repair. In the interim, it will damage employment prospects across the tourism and retail sectors at a time when they are dealing with the twin financial plagues of Covid-19 and the disruption as a result of Brexit. It is not the time to tinker with these thresholds. In 2019, people from Great Britain accounted for 35% of all visitors to Ireland and for one fifth of the total expenditure by visitors in this country. Non-EU visitors to Ireland spend more than €3.2 billion annually here. The Taoiseach was questioned on this issue earlier today by my colleague, Deputy Shanahan, who has a particular interest - naturally enough, coming from Waterford - in Waterford Crystal, a company that will be disproportionately affected by this announcement. The Taoiseach said in response to Deputy Shanahan that Revenue has produced an assessment that there needs to be a threshold introduced. I have not seen this assessment. Will the Minister of State indicate where it can be found on the Department's website or on Revenue's website? Has that assessment been published? The Taoiseach went on to say that the Minister for Finance is bringing down the threshold from €175 to €75, which is complete and utter spin. The threshold today is zero and it is going up to €75. The Government was proposing changes that would increase that to €175 and, because my colleagues and I have tabled these amendments, it has backed down to a certain extent. I welcome that it is not €175. However, the threshold, at €75, is still significant. In the context of the Revenue assessment the Taoiseach outlined earlier, what does it say about those two figures, namely, the €175 threshold and the €75 threshold? It seems to me that these figures are just being plucked out of the sky and could easily be brought down to €25, €5 or back to zero. I would really like to know what type of an assessment the Revenue Commissioners have done. On 5 November, I asked the Minister for Finance the number of reclaims that are made and the value of these. In his reply, the Minister stated that there were no specific or separate reporting requirements so the figures requested were not available. If the figures are not available to me, as a Member of Dáil Éireann, when I ask the Minister for Finance for them, where is the assessment coming from that the Revenue Commissioners have come up with? The Revenue Commissioners will always look at a belt-and-braces approach to any particular loophole. The concern is that if a resident from outside the EU gets relief from VAT, now that the UK will become a third country from 1 January, British visitors here will exploit the system if there is no minimum threshold put in place. In a parliamentary reply, the Minister stated: If the scheme applies to visitors from Britain post-Brexit and if the UK were to operate a similar scheme for EU visitors, Irish consumers would be able to buy goods VAT free in Britain and visitors from Britain would be able to buy goods VAT free in Ireland. This could give rise to a considerable displacement of consumer purchases ...However, the Minister went on to state: "The UK has announced its intention to exclude EU visitors from [the] Retail Export Scheme." There is one of the Minister's ifs gone straight away. The UK is introducing a system that will include EU visitors from the retail export scheme. This means that Irish residents who continue to purchase goods in this country will not be able to exploit any loophole in it. We are increasing our threshold by €75. The same exclusion will apply in France, where the authorities are reducing their threshold by €75. The same rule will apply in Spain in respect of UK visitors. Spain is reducing its threshold by €80. It seems that we are going in the opposite direction to our EU counterparts. The Minister went on to state, "It was always my intention to adopt reciprocal measures in Ireland to the greatest extent possible if the UK adopted such restrictions". We could argue for the proposed measure if it was specific to British residents but that is not the case. The Minister is saying that he wants to introduce a reciprocal arrangement in Ireland with regard to Britain.If the Minister wants to reciprocate the UK's measures, why are we excluding every other country outside the EU, in particular the traditionally lucrative US market? What is the reason for lumping the US in with this if we are talking about reciprocating the UK's arrangements? This measure does not seem to be specific to the UK. The Minister stated that the volume of retail export scheme claims likely to arise would present significant scope for abuse. When I asked for the figures via parliamentary questions, none were available. How are the Revenue Commissioners arriving at figures for the scale of abuse? There is no basis for that assertion. I have drafted my amendment in a particular manner. The Minister's amendment to VAT law introduces a requirement for proof of importation into the UK, and associated proof of payment, where applicable, of relevant UK VAT and duties on those purchases, of goods that qualify for a VAT refund under the scheme. The Minister is introducing two conditions. First, he is increasing the VAT refund threshold for all visitors to Ireland from outside the EU, including those from the US, from €0 to €75. Second, he is introducing a specific provision whereby visitors from the UK must show evidence that they have paid VAT and duties in the UK if they are to claim a rebate in Ireland. We all know that if people had to go through the process of paying duties, levies and VAT in the UK and submitting documentation to reclaim VAT in Ireland, the majority would not do so. This provision alone will curb any potential exploitation of the difference in VAT rates for non-EU visitors if their country of origin is the UK. There is no need to introduce a new threshold of €75. It sends out the wrong message internationally, including to visitors from the UK. I do not doubt that, be it done blatantly or in an underhand manner, tourism promotion agencies in Spain and France will quietly whisper to tour operators and people who are considering visiting the EU that they should come to Spain, which has a 0% VAT threshold for refunds, or to France, which has reduced its threshold by €75, rather than Ireland, which has increased its threshold in advance of the UK leaving the EU to penalise British visitors. I hope that the Minister will withdraw this aspect of the proposal and accept that the current regime should remain in place. I hope that he will not force a vote on this issue.

I thank the Minister for listening. It is not related to his Department directly, but he has taken on board the trenchant and clear arguments made by Deputies across the House that this need not, and ought not, be done. I argued on Second Stage that if there was a concern about the loss of revenue from British visitors to the Irish jurisdiction being able to claim VAT refunds on purchases in Ireland, it would be more than adequately dealt with in Part 3. Although it has been referenced by Deputy Naughten, I wish to underscore how this is an extraordinarily high hurdle to jump for any UK national to get a VAT refund. That is a simple fact. A traveller whose place of habitual residence is in the UK must provide proof that the goods have been imported into the UK on behalf of the visitor to Ireland and that VAT, duties, customs and excise chargeable under UK law have been paid on the importation of those goods. When leaving the country, the normal VAT refund that would accrue to someone via VAT refund companies would not be applicable to UK travellers. They would have to go home, pay the duty in full and then go through the process of applying for an Irish tax rebate. The bulk of people will not do that. It is an extremely high hurdle and a robust safeguard to prevent any erosion of revenue that might arise from any potential mass influx of tourists to Ireland availing of duty free goods. The figures have been put on the record. Approximately 20% of the purchases in question are made by UK nationals. My concern relates to the proposition in respect of all foreign nationals to increase the threshold from VAT refunds from €0 to €175. The proposed figure in amendment No. 10 is now €75. While a significant improvement, it still only amounts to 50% of all purchases that have availed of the refund to date. These are not massive purchases. The people in question are going to craft shops and stores selling Irish knitwear. These purchases sustain those shops. Mention has been made of crystal. Waterford Crystal and all crystal products would fall into this category. These are purchases that people make to bring home souvenirs, and 50% of them are under the €75 threshold. The amendment will devastate that market. My party has been supportive of all Brexit initiatives taken by the Administration. The Tánaiste has gone on record more than once voicing appreciation for the united and co-ordinated approach taken by all parties in the Dáil on this issue. We have not been divisive. We have not sought party political gain. We have not sought to score points. We have stood shoulder to shoulder to make the best of a very bad lot and to make as many mitigations as we can to the undoubted negative impact that Brexit will bring upon us. However, this proposal in the Bill, in particular the middle part of section 64, which reads, "the supply of a traveller’s qualifying goods, where the total value of that supply of goods, including tax, is more than €175," has nothing to do with Brexit.It affects American, Canadian and Japanese visitors and, it is to be hoped, the growing number of Chinese visitors who will come when we get back to some semblance of normality with travel. They should not be affected one way the other by the fact that the UK is no longer part of the EU, yet they will be affected because clearly somebody in Revenue decided that this was not a good idea.  If the Government wants to amend tax law, it should do so in the finance Bill and argue its case in the finance committee. It should not be buried or sought to be included in a Brexit-related Bill when it has no implications for Brexit. As I said, the issues in terms of protecting revenue are more than adequately addressed in Part 3. Deputy Nash and I have sought a review of it for the very reason articulated by Deputy Naughten, which will no doubt be articulated by others. Amendment Nos. 9 to 11, inclusive, are being taken together. Amendment No. 11 asks that no later than 12 months after the coming into operation of section 64 the Minister shall review the operation of the amendment effected by the section and lay before each House a report on his or her conclusions. The idea of that is to deal with the very point being made.  Others in the EU see an opportunity in these arrangements and are looking to see how they can capture the UK spend. In a previous debate, I mentioned what happened in Portugal, which is actively setting up new tax-free facilities to capture British spend. Mention has been made of the changes being introduced in Spain and France. We are actively going in the other direction, but so be it. Due to our proximity, perhaps there is a case for that, but that is more than adequately covered in the third part of this section. Let us review it in a year's time so we can determine whether it is needed or whether we need to mirror what is happening in other European countries. I have heard no argument whatsoever for the increase in the threshold for VAT from €0 to €75. It is an entirely arbitrary figure. The figure was €175 last week and now it is proposed that it be €75. Why not make it €50? All of this has a real and damaging impact on small retailers who are already on their knees. We have been desperately anxious in this House to find mechanisms to assist those retailers in getting back to business. They have been closed down. We do not want to add another millstone around their necks while they are in the middle of trying to recover from the pandemic and are also impacted by the costs associated with Brexit.  I implore Government to address this. Retailers across the country have been in touch with us. The amendment I and others have tabled proposes to delete the increase in the VAT threshold from €0 to €75. It has no part in a Brexit Bill because it is not Brexit-related. Something which affects Japanese, American and Canadian tourists is not Brexit-related. It is simply an overreach by Revenue to try to claw back money that it does not feel should be there in the first place. If it wants to argue that, let it do so in a budgetary statement and through a finance Bill, not in a omnibus Bill that we are facilitating in a special way without pre-legislative scrutiny and which is being fast-tracked through the Houses. The vast bulk of what is in the Bill is needed. In the spirit that we have approached all of this, I ask the Government to work in harmony in regard to the need to prepare our economy and people for the inevitable harm that Brexit will do and mitigate that to the best of our ability. We do not want, in the middle of all of that, to include a clause that will hammer one very vulnerable sector of our economy, namely, small retail groups and those involved in VAT refunds. Why would we do that when we are desperately anxious to examine what supports we can give to the sector? As I said, the Minister for Foreign Affairs gave a very ready listening ear on Second Stage. I hope whoever responds to this, whether it is the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will ensure that the Government takes another step back so we can be united on every section of the legislation. Let us ensure that the common approach to Brexit that has characterised the past number of years is maintained and we not do something that I am absolutely certain would be harmful to a sector of our economy that is already reeling from enough blows. I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment tabled by me, Deputy Nash and a number of other Deputies and not press his amendment.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	321	My colleague, Deputies Howlin and Naughten, articulated the case against the Government's proposition extremely well. I support the objective. Deputy Howlin and I spoke at length in our Second Stage contributions about the impact of this particular proposition from the Government, the changes that are planned in the treatment of UK citizens and the intention to increase the threshold. We also discussed the impact it will have on a very important subset of the retail sector that has been crucified as a result of the pandemic and the public health initiatives needed to address all of the associated problems. It is ironic that the State has spent countless billions of euro supporting a sector that is on its knees as a result of Covid-19 and help it through this unprecedented and difficult time to allow their doors to be kept open but is now, in effect, turning the gun on that sector after all of the efforts made to ensure that sub-sector of retail could remain viable until such time as the threat of the pandemic recedes and it can return to profitability. If we proceed with the Government's proposition, this will have a catastrophic effect on the sector identified by Deputy Howlin. Those who sell souvenirs and small companies, which are often family run and, in some cases, passed on from one generation to the next, will be no more. That is the truth. I find it curious in the extreme that an attempt has been made to essentially amend our finance or tax legislation in the context of a Brexit Bill. It seems to me that this is some kind of pet project for an official in the Department of Finance or Revenue who has decided that this represents an opportunity to shoehorn in this particular initiative without any real due diligence, as we have identified and referred to, no pre-legislative scrutiny and no impact assessment worth the name. That is a significant injustice to the retailers who will be negatively impacted by this proposition. I read the tax strategy group papers presented before our consideration of the budget very diligently and could not identify any initiative from Revenue or anybody else that proposed to make the kinds of changes proposed in this Bill, such as increasing the threshold to qualify for the retail export scheme from €0 to €175, as was indicated in the initial Bill when published. The figure in the Minister's amendment is now €75. This is not the place or time to introduce measures like this when the sector is on its knees and needs our support.It is reckless, ill-conceived and very poorly timed, and no objective basis has been presented for it. Most of us in the House, I hope, believe in evidence-based policymaking. It is difficult to make the case to support a proposition such as this from the Government without any evidence. The evidence from those on ground, however, suggests this will have an extraordinarily negative impact on their businesses and employment levels in the sector, and on sustaining those businesses that are on their knees. There is an acknowledgement by the Government that the original proposition was, to put it charitably, imperfect, and a concession of sorts was made in seeking to reduce the €175 refund threshold to €75, but that misunderstands the issue and the concerns of the sector. Splitting the difference will not make any difference. It is an entirely pointless, tokenistic concession to give the pretence that there is some movement in the direction of what the sector requires. I ask the Government, in the spirit of the consensus that Deputy Howlin mentioned and the general unanimity we have had in the House in our national approach to the existential challenge of Brexit, to dispose with its proposition, to accept the amendment tabled by Deputy Howlin and others, including me, and to reflect again on the proposal for the treatment of UK citizens in the application of this section. That can be dealt with. As I said in my Second Stage contribution, if the Government is determined to make such a provision, let us keep it under review and closely examine the impact of the second part of the proposition. I hope we all believe in the notion of evidence-based policymaking. This is poor policy, shoehorned into an inappropriate Bill in a badly timed and ill-conceived way, and I appeal to the Government to drop it and to accept the amendment.

From the get-go, we endeavoured to work with the Government, put on the green jersey and get the Bill across the line because it was the right thing to do and it was necessary. There needed to be a consensus to show across the water and throughout Europe that Ireland is united on this issue. The Government, however, has overstepped the mark in bringing forward this proposal, which is not Brexit-related. I do not see a strategy for how it would benefit the tourism sector, and indeed, points have been made about how damaging it will be. We have known since 1985 how beneficial the retail export scheme is for non-EU tourists, and particularly in areas outside Dublin, where it is estimated that almost 66% of the spend takes place. The sector has been effectively wiped out by Covid-19 and is very much on its knees. Unfortunately, the Government's stay-and-spend scheme has been described as a damp squib. Even the Tánaiste has admitted that it has not had the desired effect and that, essentially, it is not fit for purpose. There does not seem to be a coherent overall strategy for trying to help out a sector that is completely on its knees. The initial proposal was to elevate threshold from zero to €175 but, thankfully, someone in government made a decision to bring forward an amendment to reduce that to €75. Clearly, that is not in line with the views of the majority in the House or, more critically, of the sector, which has said this is the wrong decision, not least at this time with everything that is happening because of Covid and the impact it is having. It will just decimate the sector. Along with others, I appeal to the Government in the spirit of wearing the green jersey and how united people have been. This is the only amendment that Sinn Féin has tabled and it reflects how we see the matter. It was tabled in the names of my colleague, Deputy Munster, and others. Analysis has been carried out by Fáilte Ireland, which estimates that for every €1 million of tourism spend, 27 jobs are supported. It quantified the 2019 spend under the scheme as supporting 1,200 jobs. Given those figures and everything that has been said about the impact that Covid has had on the sector, it is imperative and right that the Minister not move his amendment and allow the subsection to be deleted. If he needs to bring it back, let him bring it back in some other legislation where there is clear rationale for it, and let us debate it at that point. Now is the wrong time to make the provision and the wrong mechanism is being used, and it is blatantly the wrong thing to do.

It was tabled by my colleague, Deputy Munster, who felt strongly, like a number of the other speakers, that now is not the time, under the guise of Brexit legislation, to hammer the tourism industry. As has been noted by many other Deputies, we are going through a brutal pandemic. There have been attempts by the Government, and proposals from the other side of the House, to provide necessary sectoral supports and actions, and tourism is one area where people have been absolutely hammered. It does not make sense, therefore, in any way, shape or form to remove the retail export scheme and the VAT refund, which makes a significant difference to people. People who sell arts and crafts were mentioned earlier, and the scheme also helps other small sales within the tourism sector. I agree with others that if a consideration needs to be made in respect of this, it should be taken away from Brexit legislation and dealt with separately. It does not make sense at this time to further hammer this sector. I do not need to add to the figures that have been outlined. The €175 limit does not make sense, and nor does the Government amendment to reduce it to €75, which I assume arose due to the number of people who had commented or tabled amendments on the issue. We need a sensible solution to this. As Deputy Brady noted, we need as much consensus as possible on dealing with the problem of Brexit and to remove this impediment to the tourism sector, which is being crippled. I add my voice to all the others and reiterate that this point is a very important one for Deputy Munster, which is why she tabled the amendment. The Government has a very simple ask in front of it and has just to carry it out. It is as simple as that.

Brexit remains a very significant challenge for this country. The sounds coming from Europe today do not bode well. This particular provision of the omnibus Bill is a retrograde step in the context of the challenges of Brexit, particularly for my city and county of Waterford and the whole south-east region. We are very exposed to all of the issues arising out of Brexit. The region is an exporter in the agri-food area and it has supply chains that are heavily embedded in the UK. That will give rise to significant difficulties after Brexit in terms of customs and all of that. The provision under this section of the Bill will, in effect, largely curtail and strangle the cost benefit for foreign travellers of making purchases when they come to Ireland. In my city, for example, Waterford Crystal estimates that 60% of its foreign tourism sales will be affected by Brexit. That is a huge figure for an industry that is already feeling the effects of international competition. The Waterford Treasures Medieval Museum has a significant number of overseas visitors every year who purchase mementos and souvenirs. All of that will be affected by this provision. Waterford city has businesses like Kite Design Studios and a number of jewellery makers which rely on transactions where people are spending €20, €30 or €40. Their business will be significantly impacted. I cannot understand why this provision is being introduced. I brought it up with the Taoiseach this morning and asked about the direction and thinking behind it. Has the Government met with people in industry to look at other ways of achieving the security we need? I understand the Government view is that there is a likelihood of abuse if a threshold is not put in place. The initial limit of €175 was very strong but the new threshold of €75 will have much the same effect. We need to do something about this. I implore the Government to speak to industry leads in the retail sector to see what other provisions might be made. There must be an ability to implement additional measures that will address the risk of tourists abusing the situation. The message must go out that we need to support indigenous business, particularly in the craft, tourism and hospitality sectors. This provision is a retrograde step and I join previous speakers in asking the Government to rethink it and find a different solution. The current proposal is not a solution but a grave error.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	325	As other speakers have pointed out, this section is out of synch with the rest of the Bill. I read the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and it states that the threshold for third-country residents to qualify for the scheme is €175. That has not been updated. We need an explanation of where the Government is coming from with this provision. As colleagues have noted, the retail sector is on its knees. Instead of discouraging people from spending, we should be encouraging them to spend more. We are facing into uncertain times with Brexit and, as such, we should be trying to encourage more people to travel to Ireland in a safe manner post Covid. This provision will discourage people from spending when they get here. Instead, we should be encouraging every tourist who comes to Ireland, particularly next year, to spend more. I do not understand the logic and thinking behind the section. I join previous speakers in asking the Minister of State to think again. The section does not add to the Bill but takes way from it. A large number of Opposition Members have called on the Minister of State to reconsider what is proposed. Even at this late hour, I ask him to go back to his officials and look at it again. Reference was made to the fear that there could be widespread abuse of the scheme. There is nothing stopping us from introducing legislation to address that. At this stage, looking to next year and the difficulties the sector is going to face, common sense would suggest that the Minister of State should withdraw this provision.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	326	Amendment No. 9 seeks to delete the section of the Bill that provides for a threshold for the retail export scheme. As referenced by Deputy Seán Crowe, the explanatory memorandum to the Bill refers to the original provision that the value of qualifying goods must exceed €175 in order for third-country residents to qualify for the scheme. It also requires UK citizens to show proof that VAT and customs and excise duties have been paid. These measures do not eliminate the use of the VAT retail export scheme for UK residents post Brexit. Instead, by excluding goods below a certain value threshold and requiring proof of declaration of import into the UK for any goods for which a refund is claimed by a UK-based traveller, they provide the legal basis to protect Exchequer revenues and control and minimise the scope of abuse of the scheme. This is necessary given Ireland's proximity to the UK and the volume of traffic between the two countries. Therefore, unfortunately, the Government cannot accept this particular amendment. However, our amendment No 10 proposes that the limit of €175, as set out in the Bill as published, be reduced to €75. This is done in recognition of the challenges facing the retail sector and to support the sector in these challenging times. It will apply to all third-country travellers who are seeking the refund. This change was influenced to no small extent by the views put forward strongly by Deputies on Second Stage that the figure of €175 was very high and a new limit needed to be introduced. The Minister took on board everything that was said during the debate, both inside the House and outside it. In recognition of the challenges facing the retail sector, he is introducing this amendment to set the threshold at €75, which is a substantial reduction from the original figure. This is the result of the Minister paying close attention to everything that was said by Deputies in the debate to date and taking careful consideration of it. Amendment No. 11 calls for a report on the operation of the provisions of the section within 12 months of their coming into operation. A lot of people have argued that we should wait to see whether there is abuse rather than anticipating it. We are concerned that there is a risk of abuse and, as such, we are taking a prudent approach by introducing the €75 limit. Deputies Howlin and Nash are making the case, in this amendment, that we should see how the scheme is working and review it after 12 months. I will clarify our position in that regard in a moment. I wish to make a few points about the operation of the scheme. As I said, it will not prevent visitors from the UK from making purchases here. To put a fair picture on it, the other side of the equation is that the UK has publicly announced that it will not operate the retail export scheme for any traveller from 1 January 2021. This means that Irish travellers to Britain will not be able to reclaim the VAT they pay on purchases in the same way that British travellers can in respect of goods purchased in Ireland. The UK has moved unilaterally to cease operating the scheme, which means Irish people travelling there will not be able to get the benefit of reclaiming the VAT, but people coming here from the UK will be able to do so. We have been more generous on this issue than the UK, which is dropping it completely.We have mentioned the possible abuse of the scheme. Owing to the close proximity of the UK, the number of transactions involved and the amount of traffic between Ireland and the UK, this is one area we have to look at. By excluding goods with a value of less than €75 from the scheme and requiring proof of declaration of import into the UK for any goods for which a refund is claimed by a UK traveller, the proposed measures will ensure that we avoid any double non-taxation. It is important that we protect the Exchequer. We have heard of double taxation but there is a real possibility of double non-taxation in this situation. If people can claim the VAT back when they return to the UK, they will got the VAT back from the Irish side. Arrangements in the UK, which are separate and already in place, provide that proof of payment of VAT in the UK will apply where the value of the goods exceeds the UK's personal allowances. Proof will only be required for goods valued at more than €440. Already, there is a threshold in the UK at which one does not have to produce any proof of payment of the VAT. People could travel from the UK and claim the VAT back under the Irish scheme before returning to the UK where they are resident and obtain a VAT refund without having to prove that they paid VAT. Unless this measure is in place, they would be able to get a refund in both countries. There is a real risk of both countries losing out and non-taxation occurring in both jurisdictions. That is an issue we would have to look at. Thresholds in other countries were mentioned. There are significant thresholds in other countries, some of which have been cited. For example, the threshold in France is much higher than the threshold here. Much of the discussion has centred on the practicalities of supporting and encouraging businesses. The scheme is an opportunity for retailers to increase their business and sales to foreign visitors when they come to Ireland. There is a real opportunity for them to do that, as anyone who follows the logic by which people spend money will understand that. For example, in many of the main supermarkets, people get a tenner off if they spend €50, provided they have a €10 voucher. That is a big incentive. If someone feels like spending €35 in a supermarket, it will cost €35 to do so, whereas anyone who spends €50 will get a tenner off and the cost will be only €40. In the Irish psyche, and in the psyche of all travellers and tourists, an offer of getting something back for buying in a certain shop is an incentive to go to that shop. If we take the system as it works now, somebody who spends €40 on a souvenir can get approximately a quarter of that cost back. Let us say €8 or €9 can be reclaimed in VAT when a company processes the VAT. The company that processes it takes 50% or thereabouts for processing the VAT, so the person will be lucky to get €4 or €5 out of that, which is very little. That is not a major incentive. I will put it this way. Irish retailers have a keen sense of business and of their customers. If a customer comes into a shop and says he or she wants to buy a souvenir and it is €50, it costs the customer €50 under this scheme and he or she will not get any VAT back. If the customer spends €60, it will cost €60. However, if I was a clever retailer - Deputies spoke about craft shops run by families for more than one generation - and I had somebody coming into my shop to buy something for €60, I would tell the customer that if he or she spent over €75, he or she would get €18 back. It would actually only cost the person €57. This is a great incentive for tourists who are spending €50 or €60 to spend €75 because it will actually cost them less than €60 once they get their VAT rebate. It is a bit like the person going into the supermarket. Every Irish person understands that a voucher gets us a tenner off if we spend €50. Who is going to spend €48 if spending an extra €2 will get us a tenner back? There is a great incentive here. This is the exact same principle that I keep saying Irish people and tourists understand. If we encourage people to spend €75, they will get approximately €18 back in a VAT rebate. That is a great incentive to spend €75 they might not have spent otherwise. That point will not be lost on the retailers of Ireland, the souvenir and craft shops and all the companies that have been mentioned. It will encourage people to spend an extra few bob and it will cost them less as they will get VAT back. That will encourage purchases of over €75 and change the current dynamic where people say many of the purchases are below price. It will encourage trade and most of the purchases will be over €75 in the future. That will result in more business and more profit for local business because it will generate additional sales. We want to encourage business. I accept that was probably not the reason the Revenue proposed this measure but when I saw the proposal in the Department of Finance, I could see a benefit. As a person who regularly uses the voucher that gives €10 off the next €50 purchase in a supermarket, I said that this sounds like a similar scheme. It is sensible because it will encourage people to spend and that will help the tourism trade in all the different areas that have been mentioned. There has been quite a debate on this and the idea of trying to achieve consensus and a general approach to this matter is much appreciated and accepted. There has been goodwill and support to ensure this legislation is passed "unanimously", if that is the right word, by the House without calling a vote. We are listening carefully. I am very much taken by the amendment by Deputies Howlin and Nash. It proposes to insert the following:
"Review of operation of section 64
65. No later than 12 months after the coming into operation of section 64, the Minister shall—(a) review the operation of the amendments effected by that section, and(b) lay before each House of the Oireachtas a report of his or her conclusions from the review.".That is a sensible compromise. Having listened to the debate, I encourage Members to accept the State's view that there is a legitimate possibility of people paying tax in neither jurisdiction and both sides losing out, and to recognise that we have a system in place to allow UK travellers in Ireland get VAT back on purchases over €75 notwithstanding that it is not reciprocated. We cannot get anything back there. We are being generous on that basis by allowing the scheme to continue, which is not part of the arrangements in the UK based on public statements today. Deputies asked whether there was evidence. As the UK is directly involved in this legislation and was cited in the original section 64, it is necessary to have a specific provision in this legislation for UK travellers. The point has been well made that it catches travellers from outside the UK and the EU, such as visitors from America or China. That may be the case but it would make the operation of the scheme more complex to have different rules for people outside the EU, one rule for the UK and maybe a different rule for Chinese or American visitors. I accept that this aspect may need to be examined further in the light of experience that we gather during the 12 months of operation of the scheme but it is only fair at this stage to take the prudent course and introduce the measure. Amendment No. 11 provides for a review of the scheme. On that basis, on behalf of the Government, I will be happy to accept amendment No. 11 as a fair and sensible approach to reviewing the operation of the scheme after 12 months. Another point made is that some of these provisions could have been included in the Finance Bill. It is more germane to this legislation because it deals with the UK. There is a sentence in the provision that is not specific to the UK but we are trying to introduce a level of consistency in the changes we were making. We included a particular sentence to make this consistent for all countries outside of the EU. I hope Deputies will accept our bona fides on that. I accept the good case being made that we need to review the scheme and see how it works out. Instead of voting down the provision, let us give this threshold of €75 a chance.I expect Fáilte Ireland will be very strong in promoting the fact that visitors who spend €75 or more will be able to get VAT back. That will encourage people to spend while they are here and retailers will encourage their customers to spend more when they get them into the shop. I am sure lots of shops will take great advantage of the scheme, which is the equivalent of a voucher in that people get 23% back if they spend over €75. I would like to see how this scheme will work out in the course of a year. On that basis, the Government amendment on reducing the figure from €175 to €75 needs to kept in this legislation because part of the relevant section is UK-specific. However, I also accept the point made in respect of amendment No. 11 that a review be carried out after 12 months. That is a very fair consideration in the circumstances. I hope the House will agree to accept the Government amendment alongside amendment No. 11 to ensure there is a 12-month review. To be clear, I am not giving a commitment that the amendment will be written into the legislation when we conclude business this evening because we are disposing of all Stages tonight. We will not have an opportunity to come back to this on Report Stage next week as we will complete Committee, Report and Final Stages. It is not an issue we can tease out in the coming days. I hope Members will accept the Government's bona fides in agreeing to amendment No. 11, which is a fair amendment.

The very least we can do is review the operation of the three proposals in this section after a year and I welcome that. I also admire the Minister of State's mental dexterity in being able to argue that introducing a new high threshold will be welcomed by retailers. By that logic, if we raise the threshold to €500, they will be ecstatic because people would flock in to spend €501. The Minister of State missed his calling; he should obviously have been in public relations. I spent five years in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform but this concept of double non-taxation the Minister of State has introduced today is certainly a new one. If the UK tax authorities were so decent as to subsidise Irish retailers, I would be delighted. If we get a VAT refund for sales in Ireland and the UK tax authorities outside the European Union decide to give a tax rebate there as well, would that not be a great thing? It would be a real boon to retailers and purchasers and would encourage people to spend in Ireland at the British taxpayer's expense. Why in God's name would the Minister of State regard that as a bad thing? I do not see any merit in that argument whatever. The basic contention is very clear here and Deputies on the Opposition benches who have made this argument have been clear. If there is a real threat to revenue from UK nationals becoming third-country nationals and spending and getting VAT rebates for their purchases in Ireland, I do not see that there will be any great loss from that because they are spending money in Ireland. However, if the Minister of State thinks there will be a loss, let us see how that impacts. There is not going to be mass tourism in the next 12 months, as the Minister of State knows. It will be well into next year before we have mass vaccination and even after that, many people will be reluctant to travel. There will be no mass tourism in 2021 so the very businesses we are talking about here - craft and souvenir shops, knitwear shops and the small jewellery shops - will all be clinging on for survival in any event Why in God's name would we impose another burden on them now? The Minister of State has taken the first step by indicating the Government will review all of this in 12 months. None of us is seeking to amend the third part of this, the high hurdles that have been put in for UK nationals. Very few people will jump those particular hurdles to get their money back if they have to pay up front, return to the UK, prove they have paid duties and taxes in the United Kingdom and then apply to Ireland for the rebate. How many people will do that? I do not think there will be any discernible impact on revenue from that so that is closing off the fear. However, the extra yard the Minister of State is insisting that we go now is to deal with people who are not affected by Brexit, good, bad or indifferent, namely, tourists from the United States, Canada, Australia, China, Japan or any other third country who now enjoy the possibility of getting excise returned on expenditure from a zero threshold. The Minister of State wants to raise that threshold to €75. That has nothing to do with Brexit. It will impact on retailers and we have been told as much. The independent economic evaluation the retailers have done shows that the Minister of State's proposed new threshold of €75 will impact on 50% of their sales. It is not too late. If the Minister of State cannot make a change now and if he needs to discuss it further with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, will he give us an undertaking that he will consider the matter overnight? I understand we will deal with Report Stage tomorrow. Is that not correct? We could deal with that amendment overnight if the Minister of State cannot deal with it now. However, in a very comprehensive and elaborate Bill that has brought consensus, why would the Minister of State introduce a note of discord and cause the House to divide, which he will do if he does not go this last step?

The Minister of State has gone so far as to at least understand the concerns we have expressed on behalf of those who will be so adversely affected by this change he appears determined to introduce. Like Deputy Howlin, I am stunned by the Minister of State's logic and his particular understanding of consumer behaviour. Whenever our political careers end, hopefully not any time soon, we might consider going into business together because the Minister of State's understanding of consumer behaviour would lead to considerable profitability for any business he might get involved in. I ask the Minister of State to examine our proposal again. He has gone this far and there has been a concession by the Department of Finance and the Revenue in understanding the logic of where we are coming from and the concerns of retailers by reducing the threshold from €175 to €75. We are nearly there and the Minister of State should consider this a little more. As Deputy Howlin said, the third element of this provides for some onerous obligations on UK citizens who purchase goods here. They will go through an onerous process, including proving purchase, reclaiming VAT, and so on. As I said on Second Stage, from looking at the evidence provided to us by the retail sector and speaking to those who are directly involved, I believe the Minister of State's view of the potential impact on the UK and the potential for lost revenue is exaggerated. We are also not looking at the potential, if we leave things as they are, for increased activity, revenue generation and employment taxes. That is something we need to consider and there needs to be a trade-off in that regard.I want to correct part of the contribution I made earlier. I reflected and there was reference to this issue in the tax strategy group papers. This leads me to be even more surprised than I was that no reference was made to this proposal in the budget speech of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, in mid-October, no reference was made in the Finance Bill, and no reference was made in any engagement at the finance committee in recent weeks on Committee Stage of the Bill. That is surprising. This is no place to discuss this proposal, which will have a wide-ranging impact on our taxation system and the treatment of a retail sector in this country that has been disproportionately impacted. We need to do everything we can to make sure these businesses can keep their doors open. They have been benefiting from the temporary wage subsidy scheme, the employment wage subsidy scheme and, in recent times, the Covid restrictions support scheme and other supports provided through our local enterprise office network. It would show a wilful disregard to them if we were now to turn around and place an additional burden on their shoulders. They are looking to 2021 with some hope that they can keep the door open, thanks to the supports provided by the Members of these Houses. They are looking at 2021 with a bit more optimism, as we hope we can have a vaccination programme that will keep people safe and get our economy back to some form of normality. They are now struggling for viability. They can be viable, and let us support them to profitability next year by parking this proposal in full. I implore the Minister of State to reflect on this again. Let us engage over the next short period with the Minister for Finance to reflect on the impact this will have on those who will be affected by it and do the right thing by them. I acknowledge the efforts of the Minister of State to reach a form of consensus with Deputy Howlin and myself on a review. There would be no need for a review if we had the entire evidence base the Minister of State says is available to him, which guided this particular policy proposition in the first place. In the absence of all this, we simply cannot support the proposal he has made because of the damage we know it will do. Of course, a review would be useful and it is good policy practice but we do not want to see this occur in the first place. Our amendments are designed to protect the sector and those businesses, and ensure the more than 1,000 jobs that may go as a result of this intervention are protected and that those livelihoods are protected.

I do not want to see the House divided. From his response to us earlier, the Minister of State is willing to engage in compromise. If he is willing to compromise and take on board Deputy Howlin's suggestion, there is a mechanism whereby he could bring forward an amendment in the Seanad and we could deal with that amendment next week through amendments from the Seanad. The vehicle is there for the Minister of State if he is willing to do that and if he is prepared to indicate along those lines.

I listened to the speech of the Minister of State and I must write a note to myself not to shop in his store in future. I do not think there was anything he outlined to us that would change our minds on this. We are all starting from the position that we believe the sector is on its knees and this will introduce a new element that will make it even more difficult for people to recover. I listened to the Minister of State speak about the Labour Party proposal and his compromise that he would review it after 12 months. I would welcome this but it does not necessarily need to be in the Bill. He could articulate to us today that he will review it after 12 months. It is the sensible thing to do. I still think it is more sensible not to introduce this section and the €75. There are different types of tourists who come to Ireland. Some have bigger pockets than others. I do not think the argument about some of the stores where people spend €50 and get €10 back encourages more spending. If it did, the Minister for Finance would look at alcohol sales and there would probably be changes in that regard. I accept the Minister of State probably cannot make this decision now. Other speakers have referred to the fact the Minister for Finance was in the room during the debate. The Minister of State needs to consult the Minister and if there is a mechanism whereby he can come back to us, such as an amendment somewhere else, perhaps we could look at it. It is wrong, from the starting point of baldly looking at this issue as that it will do more harm than anything. I also listened to what the Minister of State said about the British not having a reciprocal measure. Again, with regard to what the Brits do and what we do, we need to look at what is good for the Irish people and the Irish economy. We know that Brexit is not good for the economy. We know that the road the British Government is bringing its people down is the wrong road. There are people throughout Europe, and probably throughout the world, who would accept the premise that what the Brits are doing is madness but they are intent on it. They had a referendum and they believe it is the right thing for them to do. We have a contrary view. We need to look at what is good for Ireland and clearly this is not good for Ireland with regard to those visitors whom we hope will return to our shores. I agree with Deputy Howlin's statement that there will not be massive tourism. Certainly all of us want to go back into the sun and holiday mode. One of my colleague spoke about the staycation. It did not really work, particularly for people in Dublin because we were in more lockdowns than other parts of the country and many people who bought those staycation breaks did not get the opportunity to use them. I hope they will get to use them early next year or when the current lockdown is lifted. I appeal to the Minister of State to put on his thinking cap. He is clearly thinking about how good this will be for the taxpayer and businesses. We have a contrary view. We do not think it is good, particularly for those businesses that have been hammered, as Deputy Nash said. They are on their knees. It is an element being introduced that will do serious harm to the sector. It is something it could do without. It is an additional headache for the sector. With regard to the argument on having a different arrangement for other countries, and the Minister of State mentioned the US and China, there is nothing stopping any legislation having something about Britain. If he is worried about getting new legislation through the House, we know from our experience that if we set our minds to it we can introduce legislation within 24 hours if it was felt necessary. I have been one of those people who has sat up half the night to get legislation through the House. That is not an argument.The Minister is introducing an unknown. My instinct is that this will harm the sector, which is what my colleagues and others in the Opposition are saying. I appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs to immediately get in touch with the Minister for Finance, and to think again and revisit this particular element. If he cannot make that decision, he could park this while we go through the other parts of the legislation. If the Leas-Cheann Comhairle thinks that is possible, we could deal with the other sections and then come back to this later in the evening. The Minister needs to think again and to change his approach in this regard.

It is to our credit, as a country, that our approach in general on Brexit has been quite united and quite agreed, which contrasts sharply with what is happening across the water. It is a shame there is not agreement between the Opposition and the Government on this. The prudent approach would be to take this out of the Bill. The issue can always be revisited at a later date or on a later Stage, if necessary. However, given the pressures the sector is under, it goes beyond belief that we could introduce a measure that will create further stress, worry and anxiety for people in the sector. I ask the Minister to look at this again and to consider withdrawing it.

The Minister is halfway there in regard to accepting it is a good idea to have a review. Nobody is absolutely clear, including himself, in regard to the outworkings of this. Our belief is still that it could be detrimental to the tourism industry that has been absolutely hammered up to this point. If there is some mechanism whereby this is not dealt with now and is postponed so it can be reviewed and dealt with somewhere else, I believe that is the right thing to do. That would allow us to largely deal with the Brexit omnibus legislation on a consensus basis. It is as simple as that. If the Minister can find some sort of solution that takes this off the agenda, even if it is to be reviewed and dealt with quickly within the next days or couple of weeks, that would be preferable. The Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Finance have the powers and the levers to do this, so I will leave it to them.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	338	I reiterate the appeal to the Minister. He presents himself as a Minister willing to compromise and to take on board some of what the Opposition is saying. The amendment he brought forward to reduce the sum to €75 from the initial proposal of €175 was presented as a compromise, when it is not a compromise because it does the same thing: it damages a sector that is completely on its knees. When I say “on its knees”, I picture the stores in rural parts of Connemara and the western seaboard that are open purely for the tourism industry and that sell themselves as tax-free shopping ventures. They now have to make very difficult decisions while the shutters are down, because activity in the sector is non-existent. They have to make decisions now as to how they can feasibly reopen in light of this amendment, which can only be described as a way of penalising them. It will be perceived as penalising foreign tourism, particularly in those areas. We know 66% of the money spent is spent outside Dublin and particularly in those areas. If the Minister truly sees himself as willing to make compromises, I reiterate the appeal at this point to withdraw the amendment. It will come up in the Seanad next week, when he can bring forward an amendment and listen to what is a united voice across the Opposition in this regard. Let us have a united voice on Brexit and on the omnibus Bill. We do not want to push these amendments. As I said in my opening contribution, it is the only amendment that any of my colleagues in Sinn Féin has opposed because we do not see it as part of the fit in terms of Brexit. The Minister has overstepped the mark. He has an opportunity to rectify that and withdraw the amendment to help save a sector that is very much on its knees, and to do the right thing. I reiterate that appeal.

I have been concerned about it because it will have a devastating effect on businesses along the west coast. When I look at Connemara and the number of families who depend on craft shops to make their livelihoods over a few months, I see the disaster that this year has been because, even when it opened up, the kind of stock held by the shops was not really for Irish tourists and much of it had been bought for non-Irish tourists. I have expressed time and again my dissatisfaction with Bills coming into the House, in particular very important Bills, where we are up against the wall for time. I believe we often spend too much time before we bring Bills to the House and way too little time when the Bills are in the House, when we are actually dealing with the meat of the Bills, with the details, with what will go into law and what will stand. The idea of having Committee Stage and then having Report Stage where Members cannot resubmit amendments from Committee Stage to Report Stage is wrong in principle, unless it is emergency legislation that could not have been foreseen. Brexit has been foreseen for a long time. As I said when I spoke on Second Stage, many people in Europe and in Ireland went into denial about the British decision, instead of saying that they have had their referendum and made their decision, that we accept the democratic right of the people of Britain to make that decision, and that now we must prepare. I cannot understand how it has happened that this Bill has come into the Dáil with so little time for discussion and no time to do the thing I think we all learn in the seat the Minister is in, that is, it is a good idea when something comes up on Committee Stage, when the Minister sees the validity of an argument, to say he will reflect on that and come back on Report Stage. That is not practical because of the configuration in the Dáil with regard to the time that has been set for this Bill. A practical suggestion was made that an undertaking would be given to look to introduce an amendment to deal with the issue between now and the Seanad debate. It is fair to say Department of Finance of officials will always take the negative side of everything. For a lot of things in this country, if the Government had willy-nilly accepted Department of Finance proposals, we would not have had very brave and innovative things that were thought up over the years that went against the dead hand of advice, but are now lauded as great ideas. I cannot see why it would not be possible to reflect on this issue and to take the time before the Bill goes to the Seanad to listen and cogitate on the validity of the arguments. In a previous Dáil, as I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will recall, we dealt with the Gaeltacht Bill 2012 and, again, it was scheduled under the same system.It should not have been rushed. There was no emergency about it. It was foreseen but, for some reason of scheduling, it was decided to proceed with Committee and Report Stages in one sitting. I am proud to say that I organised a walk-out in total of the Dáil that day. Some Deputies, I suspect, did not really know the reason they were walking out. We were walking out not because of the manner of the Bill but the principle of taking all Stages in one session and not allowing engagement on Committee and Report Stages. I know it is unusual for somebody in a Government party to speak in these terms but for years I have felt passionately about the time towards the end of the session when issues that were foreseen for years suddenly become rushed and the most important function we have as elected representatives gets put aside. Governments say they would like to take suggestions on board and Ministers sit in their seat and say they wished they had more time to consider an issue but they cannot because they have been told that it has to be passed by the House in whatever time. I hope that the Minister of State will give a commitment to reflect on that and if it cannot be done in the Dáil because of the rather bizarre arrangements in terms of this Bill, it could be done between the Dáil and the Seanad. As the Minister of State knows, if an amendment to the Government amendment was passed by the Seanad, it would take five minutes for it to get through the Dáil. In fact, it could be done on the same day the Seanad passed it. That is not an excuse. We have got many sitting days until the end of the year to get this right but to rush into it and get it wrong could do a great deal of damage to people who are already on their knees and suffering terribly after this disastrous year. We know already that next year will not be a good year for tourism and it is fair to say that 2022 might not be a good year either. As a result, hitting tourism with a double whammy at this time is not a good idea.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	340	We have had a discussion on this topic for the past couple of hours. It is very important that all of the views would be discussed but this is one issue on which we have not arrived at a consensus. The Bill before us contains approximately 120 sections and 50% of them relate to the Department of Finance. The entire essence of everything we have done relates to various arrangements between Ireland and Northern Ireland as a result of the protocol and between Ireland and the UK, which is no longer a member state of the European Union, and different rules and regulations regarding VAT for services and goods to and from Northern Ireland. We have had many Brexit-specific debates. The essence of this section is to make a change in respect of the United Kingdom regarding the particular scheme before us today. As I said, the original proposal was €175. As a result of the Second Stage debate and the comments of everybody during that debate, both inside and outside the House, it was agreed to reduce it to €75. Having listened to the debate we agreed that this matter needed to be examined in further detail. I indicated on behalf of the Government that we would accept the amendment from Deputies Brendan Howlin and Nash on the 12-month review of the operation of the amendments and that that would come back before the Oireachtas in 12 months' time once the legislation is enacted. We felt that was a fair and reasonable move to accommodate a proper analysis of what might happen when the scheme is actually up and running. We also felt it was necessary that we need this in respect of the UK because, as I mentioned earlier, the volume of traffic between Ireland and the UK is very high because of the close proximity. The number of transactions that would be involved is very high because of the proximity and the number of people who travel between Ireland and the rest of the UK. As a result of the arrangements the UK has for claiming back VAT - they do not have to prove payment up to a figure of €440 - the very likely scenario is that if we do not make the change in respect of the UK in this legislation people will get the VAT back here as well as in the UK. To use a phrase that I am told was one of the first times it was used, it would result in double non-taxation. We do not want a side effect of this legislation to allow a situation where there is double non-taxation in terms of people getting VAT back twice on the same transaction. I do not believe anybody would think that is a good idea. Britain has made its decision to withdraw from the EU. That is its right and we will respect that when it happens but I do not believe anybody would agree that there should be a double non-taxation or a practicality in many cases that no VAT at all would be paid anywhere on these transactions. Not only would someone get the VAT back once but they would get it back a second time possibly in the UK also. I do not think people have considered what would happen if we do not have this particular section in the legislation. If there is a scheme to allow people get VAT back, that is fine. There should not, however, be an opportunity for a person, on foot of Brexit, to claim VAT back twice on the same transaction and make a financial gain as a result of us not dealing with this issue. It is incumbent on us to deal with this issue in order to ensure that there are not double VAT reclaims or double non-taxation. Nobody would support a regime that was designed to facilitate double VAT reclaims on the one transaction in two different jurisdictions. That is the reason that is in the legislation. The other suggestion made was that part of the legislation as drafted will affect people in other countries, whether it is the United States, China or whatever the place of origin of tourists coming to Ireland. It has been suggested here in the past hour or so that we should make different arrangements for the other countries and do for them what we are doing in regard to the UK and that we could have a different situation but Ireland has decided to be a fully fledged member of the EU. Britain has decided the opposite. When a country is a member of the EU we are obliged to follow all the EU VAT directives and those directives do not allow for separate thresholds for different countries. We cannot have one arrangement in respect of VAT on a transaction here with England, which will be a third country, and a different arrangement for a tourist who comes here from the United States. That would almost be a tariff on one or the other tourist depending on their country of origin and EU legislation and the VAT directives do not allow that. The Minister is being asked to make a change to that to exclude the other countries from this legislation but to do so would be in complete breach of EU directives on VAT. Ireland has always supported the common agreements we have in respect of VAT and we cannot unilaterally change VAT arrangements for different people visiting the EU depending on their country of origin. I hope people understand that we cannot separate that particular sentence in the original section of the Bill from the rest of the section, which is necessary to deal with the UK's decision to withdraw from the EU. What we have said so far is that this came in at €175.People have asked to meet somewhere in the middle. The Government has more than done that. We have come down 60% of the way from €175 to €75. We did not just halve it. We have come a long way in, unusually, accepting an amendment from the Opposition to include a report. Normally at this point, a Minister would commit to produce a report within 12 months, but we are going a step further than would normally be the case and we are agreeing to amend the legislation to include the report. That is not normal but we are going that extra step. This legislation may not be completed tomorrow or it could be completed this evening. I do not know if there is any procedure to skip this section and move on. I doubt if there is and I would not like to ask to establish a precedent on that if it is not normal. Another point that was raised was that it can perhaps be looked at in the Seanad. That is still a possibility. I am not in a position to say that the Government will table an amendment in the Seanad but I think that everybody knows the reality, that if people feel it is definitely necessary, it is possible. Considering that we have moved from €175 to €75 and stitched a commitment for a 12-month review into the legislation, I have gone as far as I feel I can on behalf of the Government. I am in a position to accept amendment No. 11 in Deputy Howlin's name, amendment No. 10 is from the Government, but I am not in a position to accept amendment No. 9 from the Opposition. There may be opportunities for the matter to be looked at again in the Seanad, to reiterate what other Members have said, but I am not in a position to give a commitment that the Government will table an amendment. I have gone as far as I can.

We accept that the Minister of State has gone as far as he is going and that is his prerogative. Let me make it clear that the threshold is being increased by 7,500%. The Minister of State should not try to twist it around to say that it was at €175 and that it is being brought down to €75. It is going up by 7,500%. The Minister of State is saying that he is afraid about the double tax-back and is trying to protect the Chancellor of the Exchequer. I have heard many things in my time in this House but it is the first time that I have ever heard a Minister of State at the Department of Finance come into this House and say that all he is worried about are the takings of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The last Parliament that worried about that matter abolished itself in 1800. I do not think we will go back to do that now. The Minister of State should not worry about the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Let us worry about our own small, indigenous businesses around this country, not about the British coffers. The Minister of State said that we cannot make different arrangements for the UK to those made for other countries. He might look at this legislation, which specifically identifies UK tourists as being different from those from every other country in the world. They have to comply with additional conditions, including having to provide certification that they have paid their VAT and duties in the UK before they can claim it here. I said at the outset that I support that provision. I am willing to leave that provision in, but I am not willing to have a situation where the Government puts in place a double system that penalises every other tourist across the world who had that entitlement up to now. It will crucify small, indigenous businesses the length and breadth of the country. We will be pressing the amendment.

I support Deputy Naughten and the others who tabled this necessary and quite deliberate amendment. It is alarming, at this time of severe crisis, pain and suffering for all small businesses across the country and in Northern Ireland, as Deputy Ó Cuív said earlier, that we are debating these issues at the last minute, in the second last month of the year, when we should have debated them over the past two years. I too am concerned about the tourism industry. I am concerned about the products, people and VAT. To echo what Deputy Naughten said, we should not worry about the Chancellor of the Exchequer. They did not think much about us when they came into Croke Park 100 years ago last Sunday. They did not think much about the Irish when they implemented all the penal laws, and we have some of those back again now. We have our independence and it is our Exchequer that we should worry about. It is getting cleaned out at the moment, which is helping, but it is not enough to sustain small businesspeople, with the uncertainty that they have from Brexit coupled with the uncertainty caused by Covid. The Tánaiste has been talking about having more lockdowns next year. People are being driven demented. Deputy McNamara asked a question earlier about mental health figures but we cannot get them. Our own mental health is suffering because we get so many queries and so much hassle. People are so despondent, especially at this time of year. It was refreshing to go out in the fresh air earlier on this lovely bright day, but with dark, gloomy days and long nights, people are concerned about their families, the future of their education and of their businesses. I support the amendments.

I wish to speak on section 65. As Deputies know, I have served in the House for some time. I have never seen a situation like this. The Minister of State, in the course of a long debate, accepted an amendment and all the contributions were predicated on that acceptance. Then he called a vote and the amendment was voted down. The Minister of State led the House to believe that the Government had accepted the amendment. I was formally told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Government had accepted it. That is simply bad faith. As I indicated previously, this Bill is something we have worked on in consensus. It involves 11 Departments. It is a national effort to prepare for Brexit. This was the one discordant part of it. The Opposition united to say that we did not want this in the Bill. The review section was accepted by the Government and that was put on the record of the House. Then that position was resiled from when it came to a vote. That is quite shocking and not acceptable. I wanted to make that point. It augers badly for the notion that we are working in concert, as we have done for years on the issue of Brexit, which is uniformly badly news for this country. We have stood shoulder to shoulder together in legislative preparations and other preparations. The fit of pique we witnessed with the Minister of State deciding that, because the House divided on a previous amendment, he would withdraw his support for the amendment of which we have just disposed is simply unacceptable.

This was not part of some transaction or deal that he did with the Labour Party on the basis that we have resiled from the initial amendment that we proposed relating to the threshold on the scheme.

I do not want to accuse the Minister of State of misleading the House, because that is a different charge altogether, but he has behaved in a manner that is ill-becoming. What was done was dishonourable and deeply regrettable. I call on the Minister of State to consider his approach to this. While the damage may be done now, the Government will have the opportunity to revisit this in the context of the amendments that will undoubtedly be considered by the Seanad. I would prefer if we could deal with this here and now. The Minister of State has the opportunity to set this straight and resile from the position he has adopted.In my view, he has behaved dishonorably in this regard.

He must understand that he gave the House information in good faith, which is how we took it, that he would do one thing and then decided he was not happy and called a vote. I will not say "misleading information" either, but the Minister of State led the House to believe one thing and then reneged on it after a long discussion and many points being made about one issue. There has been unanimous support and agreement in dealing with this omnibus Brexit Bill but the Minister of State is riding a coach and four right through it. I am confused, to say the least, or maybe he is confused. I do not know who is confused but it is certainly not good politics. If there was a mistake, perhaps it can be corrected in the Seanad, but he was intent on calling the vote, so I do not know whether it was a mistake or what it was. It is strange and bizarre.

We approached this from a united perspective and the Minister of State has single-handedly managed to turn it into a divisive exercise, when it does not need to be one. A number of Deputies from a number of parties have their names attached to amendment No. 9. My colleague, Deputy Munster, tabled an amendment in her own right and had intended on pressing it to a vote, irrespective of whether there was a deal done, which clearly there was not, between the Labour Party and the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 11. A vote would have been called on this amendment regardless but the Minister of State's actions are unbelievable. He gave a commitment to the House that he would accept the amendment and, in the next breath, out of stubbornness or childishness, he called a vote on it, taking back what he had committed to less than five minutes previously. It is bizarre and he has managed to turn something into a divisive issue when there was no need for it. There is an opportunity for him to make amends and bring forward or support amendments in the Seanad to rectify a serious mistake on the Minister of State's behalf.

There was one discussion on the three amendments. It was a group discussion and there was no separate discussion on each amendment. The grouping order was accepted by all Members before the debate commenced. It was agreed to discuss the three amendments together. The grouping order was agreed and everybody knew we were discussing the three together at all stages during the debate. As part of that, in an effort to assist co-operation in the matter, I put a proposal that if the proposal for the €75 was included and amendment No. 10 in the name of the Minister was accepted, we would agree to the 12-month review. There is a difference on that but the facts are the entire debate was a linked debate on the three amendments. I would understand the point if we came in and had a discussion on amendment No. 9 and a straight vote and then we came in on amendment No. 10 and there was an issue and then on amendment No. 11. However, they were grouped for discussion purposes. It is not correct for anyone to say there was not a grouped discussion on the three amendments. Everyone who spoke hopped from one amendment to another during that debate and one was contingent on the other. That is the way the debate went. It was a grouped discussion. I know Members are disagreeing with it now but it was on that sole basis I put forward on behalf of the Government that we could look at the review. That was contingent on the Government amendment going through. It was not contingent on the basis that the Government amendment would be defeated and the only division in this House happened in respect of amendment No. 9, where the decision was made to vote against the €75. That is where the division arose in the House and there was not consensus in that group discussion, as evidenced by the Members of the Opposition who called a vote on amendment No. 9 and voted against the Government proposal. The Opposition in the group discussion demonstrated that it was not coming to an agreement on the three amendments that were down for collective discussion. My view all along was to come to a compromise without dividing the House but Members chose to vote on amendment No. 9 and divide the House.

There was no conditionality and had the Minister of State made it a condition of us not pressing amendment No. 9 and made his vote for amendment No. 11 conditional on not supporting amendment No. 9, we would not have accepted such conditionality. However, no conditionality was ever made and the transcript, which anybody can read, will show that. I am disappointed in the Minister of State.

As a result of the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol, EU excise laws will apply to and in Northern Ireland from the end of the UK transition period. The changes proposed in the amendment are designed to ensure that our primary legislation on excise is consistent with the protocol by including Northern Ireland in the definitions of "Member State" and "European Union". We have had this in respect of a number of other sections. While Northern Ireland will not be a member of the EU, it is being designated as a member state or in the EU under the Ireland and Northern Ireland protocol. We have had similar amendments on the same issue under other tax headings.

I raised this issue on Second Stage. Will the Minister for Justice confirm that the European Commission has issued Ireland a legal warning over delays in extraditing criminal suspects? It is my understanding that suspects wanted in other EU states should be extradited within two to three months. In 2019, 59 suspects were not extradited within the required timeframe. The explanation for this could be that the Garda needs more resources for extradition cases or the High Court is delaying in dealing with the applications. I will agree to this section. It is necessary if we are to put in place new arrangements to deal with extraditions to the UK in the context of Brexit. Will the Minister confirm whether Ireland has been warned by the European Commission? Is she concerned about it? What will the Department of Justice do about it?

We are studying the correspondence from the Commission and are taking the matter seriously. As the Deputy outlined, this part of the Bill is important. It deals with extradition and provides for amendments to the Extradition Act 1965. One of the key issues that has been identified by my Department is the need to ensure that we have efficient arrangements between Ireland and the UK in place and that they can be maintained. In a no-deal scenario, the European arrest warrant would no longer apply to the UK. As such, this section of the Bill is important. We only received the Commission's correspondence recently. We are taking it seriously. There is an issue with resources but applications are for the courts to adjudicate on.

I appreciate what the Minister has said. I hope that, as good Europeans, we will address the issue in due course.

I would like to express my thanks to all parties, including the Opposition parties, and Ministers who have co-operated on and contributed to what is an important Bill that is very much in the national interest. I accept all of the contributions that have been made. We divided on an issue which is of national import rather than on the overall international Brexit situation, but I appreciate the sentiments expressed by Deputies. I would emphasise that we appreciate the united approach to being taken in the House on Brexit.  The Bill is necessary, deal or no deal, and the most important message that should come out of this debate to our citizens, businesses and the British people is that whatever happens in terms of a deal in the negotiations – we wish our negotiators well – there will be significant changes when the transition period ends. I strongly encourage people who are affected by Brexit, in particular businesses, to access resources at gov.ie, and the financial supports available.  I want to thank Members for their co-operation. We will go to the Seanad and consider any amendments that are put forward there. It is very important that the Bill has been passed as quickly as possible. We will consider timetables before Christmas in terms of what happens in the Seanad. I thank Deputies for the debate and the continued united approach in the House on the Brexit issue.

I have been privileged to work on the stakeholders' forum. We were briefed extraordinarily well every step of the way by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and everybody provided their input in common endeavour. That was the approach we took to the two omnibus Bills, which are extraordinary creatures in legislative terms. A hybrid of different enactments has been piloted by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Different sections were taken by different Ministers. We have to continue in common effort. There are many more hurdles to come.  In that vein, if the Opposition is asked, required and expected to be supportive, a little bit of reciprocal respect is expected. What happened today when a Minister accepted an Opposition amendment during a two hour debate, resiled from it at the last minute and called a vote on and defeated it leaves a sour taste in that common purpose. We will put that behind us because there will be an opportunity to address that issue again. It is an important issue for a sector of our economy. It is to be hoped our colleagues in the Seanad will be able to do something about that.  I wish the Minister for Foreign Affairs well in his endeavours. It is to be hoped that the very delicate phase that the trade negotiations are currently at will be overcome and we will have the best possible outcome - it will not be a good outcome – for all of our people as we approach a different relationship with the United Kingdom.

It has been united, and that has certainly been my party's approach from the get-go. I concur with the comments from Deputy Howlin on some of the unfortunate scenes and developments during this debate. Let us not allow that to cloud the overall objective which was achieved. There is an opportunity to come back to what we have discussed. Our approach to Brexit has been good from the get-go, as I said. There has been a united approach in trying to achieve the Irish protocol which thankfully became a common theme and demand across Europe.Europe has been steadfast in its defence of the Good Friday Agreement and its protections for Ireland. This legislation is very important. It is unlike the previous omnibus Bill, which was put in place in case we hit a cliff edge. We now face that, inevitably, at the end of the year. We have probably done as much as we can from a legislation perspective, but there is much more to be done. There have been some concerns and it is only appropriate that I voice them now. They are concerns from some of the leading human rights and equality organisations on the island, which are deeply concerned about the impact that Brexit is having on the protection of rights and equality provisions in the Good Friday Agreement, given that European law is critical for such supports. They have lobbied, as have others, to secure human rights protections in the EU-UK withdrawal agreement via the protocol, which guaranteed there would be no diminution of human rights as a result of Brexit. Those groups believe, however, that there is still a threat to those rights and protections as a result of the UK Internal Market Bill and the risks associated with securing an EU-UK future relationship Bill. The groups, unfortunately, are not convinced that the Government is advocating strongly enough to ensure that those human rights protections will be secured in any agreement or in the event of no agreement. I am not speaking on my own behalf but echoing their concerns. They are not convinced that the Government is lobbying to ensure those protections will be on the table, nor that despite their requests directly to the Government and the media coverage, the Government will raise the issue at a European level or push it with the British. I do not want to finish on a down note but concerns remain. While we are about to pass this legislation and to bring it forward, serious concerns have been expressed by some of the leading organisations and agencies that the Government is dropping the ball on these critical areas. I appeal to the Government to address these serious concerns. If it is the case that the Government is not doing enough about these issues - by the sounds of it, it is not - it needs to up its game, because they are critical.

Obviously, Brexit will cause an awful lot of upheaval and complications in many sectors of all our lives. I do not know whether it was good or bad fortune, although I enjoyed it thoroughly, to work with the excellent, hard-working Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Union Affairs, comprising all parties and none, over a number of years while preparedness for Brexit was taking place. One issue that I have begged the Government to address relates to the urgent need for a bilateral agreement with Britain on the cross-border directive, whereby people seeking urgent medical healthcare will be able to travel North to receive the excellent care they get in private hospitals, and that our health service can pay for it. As recently as last weekend, I sent a busload of patients from County Kerry to Belfast, where they received excellent care in a manner in which they could afford to pay for it. The big problem is that, right now, I have more people ready to go, before the danger zone of 31 December, but there is such pressure on the hospital at the moment that it does not think it will be able to cater for all the patients coming from the South. Between 5,000 and 6,000 used that service last year. It is for care. There is nothing more important in this world, in my book anyway, than our two eyes, because we have only two. If we lose one, we will be down to one eye, and if we lose that, we will be down to nothing. Sadly, I know people who have gone blind waiting to have cataracts removed in our country and that is wrong. I am again pleading with the Government to please come to some sort of arrangement or bilateral agreement with the UK Government whereby we will still be able to avail of cross-border initiatives such that the funding can be supplied and that these patients can receive treatment, whether for their hips, knees or cataracts. Many of these people are elderly but many are not. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to discuss the issue.

I hope that is worked on on a cross-party and unified basis, as everything else with respect to Brexit has been.

I accept what they said and I think they accept the trust we need in the country's negotiation position. The negotiations in the days ahead will be difficult. I reiterate my message that no matter happens, deal or no deal, significant changes are coming and we need this legislation in order to ensure we are ready for that. I do not accept what Deputy Brady said about us not fighting for the human rights of citizens in Northern Ireland. Unfortunately, the citizens of Northern Ireland are victims of a decision to leave the European Union taken by people across the sea from them. We have worked with might and main with every party in the House - the previous Government and this one - to ensure that the needs of the people of Ireland, North and South, would be top of the agenda. I am pleased to report that every Minister I speak to tells me they have two priorities for the negotiations, namely, the Good Friday Agreement and the rights of the citizens of Ireland, and the European Single Market. Both issues are crucial to us and those in the North. I do not, therefore, accept that criticism. We are working very hard on this and the negotiators, led by Michel Barnier, the Commissioner who set up the PEACE programme for funding Border counties in the North, are intimately aware of the issues facing the North and the wider island. I am grateful for all their input and everybody else's in the House. We are continuing to work on the cross-border treatment directive. Unfortunately, this just one of the consequences of Britain leaving the European Union but the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health are working to try to find a solution. It presents difficulties but we want to solve it, and I assure Deputies of that. These are not straightforward issues and others will undoubtedly transpire in the new year. There will be inconveniences and difficulties caused solely by the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. We as a nation - our businesses and citizens - have made significant preparations but there will be contingencies that we simply will not be able to deal with.There will be disadvantages to Britain leaving the European Union that will be completely outside of our control. There are huge changes coming. I encourage everybody to look at the resources available online, including on gov.ie, and I urge businesses to avail of the supports we are providing. As I said, there are big changes coming.

Yesterday, all of the Opposition Whips, on behalf of our parties and political groups, made a stand and said that the Minister for Justice must come before the democratically elected Dáil to take questions and answers. We have said this repeatedly. We told the Government that this issue would not go away and that respect must be given to the House. Whenever there is a matter of serious public concern, we expect the Minister of the day to come into the Dáil to make a statement and take questions and answers. We told the Government it had to happen and now it is happening. However, even now, the Government could not do it with good grace. The Minister of State came into the Business Committee meeting today and gave us a fait accompli which included five minutes of questions and answers, in real terms, for every group. He knows that, at best, each speaker might get to put one or two questions. We are proud of the Opposition for taking the stand it took in defence of democracy in this State.

We will stand up for democracy and we will demand accountability. It is clear to us that Fine Gael has a huge problem with accountability. It had better get used to it because this is what the Opposition will look like from now on.

It claimed that we go to meetings of the Business Committee and just have a big row. At the meeting today, we spent 45 or 50 minutes putting forward alternative options and trying to make further compromises. We offered something we were not 100% happy with in an effort to get the Government to move from this fait accompli, as Deputy Mac Lochlainn described it. We got nothing in return, not one iota. The Government has been trying to box us into a particular position. It had the media briefed before the Business Committee meeting even happened today. We have operated in good faith, consistently asking the same thing in the same keen way for the past two weeks and more. This is not right, it is not democracy and it is not something we will stand for.

What has the Government got to hide?

What is wrong with a forward and backward exchange with sufficient time - ten minutes, say - to be used for questions and answers or statements, whichever one wishes to do? That is the way we have done things in the recent past. I do not understand why there is a difference on this occasion. It only opens the matter up to further questions and further doubt.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2020-11-25 00:00:00	Greyhound Industry: Motion [Private Members]	412	The Government has spent well over a week trying to shield the Minister for Justice from questioning over the process of selection of Mr. Justice Séamus Woulfe to the Supreme Court. As a result of the collective insistence of the Opposition that the Minister come into the House to face questions and be accountable to the Dáil, the Government was forced to put forward a proposal. That proposal will see the Minister coming in tomorrow, but the Government has attempted to arrange it in such a way that for three quarters of the debate, she will be shielded from any questions at all. That raises very serious questions about what the Government has to hide. At the meeting of the Business Committee today, although we insisted that all of the time available to the Opposition should be given to direct questions and answers, we were willing to compromise on that. We proposed one compromise whereby we would have some time for statements and a slightly longer time for questions. The Government would not accept that proposal. There was then a proposal from the Ceann Comhairle, which we took up, to split the time in half between statements and questions. The Government would not accept that either because it wanted absolutely to minimise the time in which the Minister would be subject to direct questioning. The public needs to ask itself why the Government is doing this if it does not have something to hide.

Speaking on behalf of the Rural Independent Group, this is very bad politics. The Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and everybody else who takes the Chair, including myself, knows that the separation of powers is sacrosanct. We are being warned that we cannot stray into certain areas. I understand that. However, by giving ten minutes for statements and only five for questions, it is giving more latitude for people to stray into areas they should not stray into. I do not know what the Government is hiding but something certainly is being hidden. It has been forced into this climbdown. We all objected yesterday to what was proposed and said that we would not attend the meeting of the Business Committee. When the Taoiseach announced today that the Minister was going to come into the House, we agreed to go to the meeting. However, that meeting was just a case of take it or leave it. We had a five-five vote and there was one missing.We had an extra person from the Government today with a vote and I want to ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, if she or the Secretary General can tell me how come another Deputy was there who had never been at a Business Committee meeting before in my time. He was there when he was Whip and Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh. They had an extra vote. It was massing the troops to keep the Opposition down all the time. This parlance looks to me like - I wish the Minister well and no disrespect - the youngest child in a big family, and the newest girl, and everybody else gathers around her to mind her and keep her safe. That is what it is. It is totally avoiding the responsibility. I believe the former Minister, Deputy Flanagan, did the work here and the Minister was only just sent in then with the note. It was a case of "Off you go with that now". The business was done long before that Cabinet meeting on 5 July. It is an unsavoury, distasteful situation. It is shameful.

It justifies me in my decision to not attend the Business Committee. I had another meeting already arranged and that is why I did not make it today. It is clear that the Government, in its gyrations to make sure the Minister is not accountable to the Dáil, is hiding something. What it is doing is pointing even more to the fact that it is hiding something by the way it is going around it. It is nonsensical and ridiculous. It makes a mockery of the Business Committee. I hope the media will report this properly and show what the Government is doing. If Fianna Fáil was on this side of the House, it would be pushing and leading the charge on this and because it is on the Government side now, it wants to shut it down. That is the reality of the situation.

At that time, there was agreement from the Business Committee, from the minority Government and from many Deputies who are now trying to construct this fake anger towards the constructive compromise proposal the Government has put forward. This format was agreed and approved. Many of the parties here who are opposing this proposal agreed with this format in 2017. The Minister has agreed to come before the Dáil and has agreed to answer any of the questions Members are putting forward, and to make any other suggestion is unfair. In relation to the Business Committee meeting to which Deputy Mattie McGrath and others made reference, it was five votes on each side. There was quite a balanced view at the Business Committee on this. It is also important to note that each time the Government comes up with a compromise and tries to propose something, the Opposition shouts and roars. It is Sinn Féin competing against the far left. We have had many examples where we have tried to provide compromise and it has been voted down. We have a situation right now where we are proposing questions and answers, we are proposing statements with those questions and answers and we have an Opposition opposing the very thing it sought. In the spirit of what we are trying to do with the Business Committee, it is regrettable. It goes to show that with the minority trying to shout and roar at the Business Committee every week, as well as here in the Dáil, there has to be more of a constructive approach from Opposition and it must stop trying to promote an inaccurate representation of what the Minister has agreed to do-----
