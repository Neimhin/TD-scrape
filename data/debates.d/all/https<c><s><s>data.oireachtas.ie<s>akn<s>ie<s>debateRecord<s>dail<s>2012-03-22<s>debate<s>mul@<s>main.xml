          <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_1">Before the general election the Tánaiste promised that the Labour Party in government would not impose cuts to social welfare payments.  Following the Government's first budget, as the detail emerged in the days and weeks after the announcement, we saw that the exact opposite was the case.  The disadvantaged were targeted like never before.  The social welfare cuts agreed to by the Government were cruel, the proposed disability allowance cuts being particularly cruel, with a more than 50% reduction in some allowances.  The Government then paused this budget measure amid opposition and clamour from within this Chamber to add to that from disability groups and campaigners.  People with disabilities have been left in limb, as they do not know for certain where they stand with the Government or whether they receive recognition.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The proposed cuts are deeply unfair.  Young people with disabilities look forward to having an income of their own.  They look forward to the independence it gives and the certainty and quality of life it brings.  Cutting the disability allowance for young people up to the age of 24 years was wrong and should be reversed.  The Government admitted the mistake it had made in delivering the equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, scheme.  It is time to do the same with this proposal.  The budgets announced in 2008, 2009 and 2010 were tough, but, at least, they were fair and did not target those most in need.  This was independently confirmed by the Economic and Social Research Institute which also observed that the 2011 Budget Statement was exceptionally regressive.  Does the Tánaiste still stand over the regressive Budget Statement of 2011?  Will he confirm that the proposed cuts to disability allowance will not proceed?</p>

          <p eId="para_6">We honoured that commitment in the budget.  The Government is absolutely committed to defending the position of people with disabilities and their families, working with them and supporting them.  That work is underpinned by that being carried out by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton.  The Government has given a commitment to defend people with disabilities and ensure their needs are fully met.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_7">The Tánaiste did not address the question I posed.  The Government paused this budget measure.  People who suffer from disabilities and are in receipt of disability allowance are entitled to respect and have certainty in the payments they can expect to receive from the State to support them in their day-to-day lives.  Their daily lives are full of challenges.  The decision to pause this budget measure included charging the chairperson of the Commission on Social Welfare and Taxation to carry out a review.  Where stands that review?  Are the people concerned not entitled to know exactly where they stand?  The uncertainty must end.  The Government is trying to rewrite and re-present some of its budget measures.  Where do people with disabilities stand and when will they know the position on the budget announcement to cut their disability allowance payments?</p>

Will the debt heaped on the shoulders of citizens by Fianna Fáil in 2010 and honoured by the Government to the tune of €3.1 billion last year be reduced?  Will the deal announced last night by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, have any effect on the State's debt-to-GDP ratio and, in turn, any impact on Ireland's return to the bond markets next year?  Will it have any impact on this year's deficit or the Government's plans to suck €3.8 billion from the economy in 2012 and a further €2.25 billion in 2013?</p>

          <p eId="para_51">In recent months the Government has been involved in technical discussions to reduce the burden of debt associated with the recapitalisation of the banks.  In particular, its focus has been on the promissory note arrangement made to fund the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, formerly Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society.  This is an arrangement that requires the State to make cash payments of €3.06 billion each year to the IBRC.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">There have been some developments on this issue in recent days.  While the discussions with the European authorities on the general issue continue, the Government is negotiating with the European Union authorities on the basis that the €3.06 billion cash instalment due from the Minister to the IBRC on 31 March under the terms of the IBRC promissory note could be settled by way of the delivery of a long-term Irish Government bond.  The details of this arrangement must still be worked out and I reiterate the Minister's statement last night that discussions are ongoing.  However, the obvious use of a Government bond would have a positive cash flow benefit for the State, as it would free up the €3.06 billion required to pay the promissory note.</p>

I suggest to the Tánaiste that he is delusional about what is happening in this regard.  I put it to him that this is on the Marie Antoinette scale of delusion and that he is completely out of touch.  I also put it to him that the herd of elephants stampeding from Malin Head to Mizen Head completely unseen by the Government is evidence that there is a massive revolt under way among the ordinary, decent, compliant tax-paying majority in society against a new tier of taxation that they understand will quickly rise to a figure of €1,000 and above.</p>

We will all have the chance to read and consider that report during the course of the day and over the weekend.  I hope that it will be possible to make arrangements, through the Whips, for the House to engage in a comprehensive debate on the Mahon tribunal's report during next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">Deputy Higgins is correct in stating that the matters the tribunal was asked to investigate are not unrelated to the difficulties this country faces today.  The issue with which the Government is dealing at present involves renegotiating the terms of the bail-out relating to the former Anglo Irish Bank.  In a sense, this involves tackling the mess that was created as a result of the need to deal with a financial institution which was the piggy bank for the property bubble that brought the country's economy to its knees.  As we know from some of the evidence presented to the Mahon tribunal, certain aspects of the property bubble were, unfortunately, connected to corrupt acts performed by particular individuals.  What is at issue here is related to the difficulties the Government has in the context of managing its way out of the mess it inherited from the previous Administration.  The latter includes dealing with the issue of the promissory note and the requirement whereby Irish taxpayers will be obliged to pay more than €3 billion in cash every year for ten years in order to bail out the former Anglo Irish Bank.</p>

Some of us believe this is a trick of the eye to ram through the fiscal treaty and that the Government is again conspiring with European Union leaders to deceive people and have the treaty passed.  Will the Tánaiste disprove this theory by showing some urgency on the concrete matters that affect people and specifically one of the worst austerity measures that has been pushed through by stealth, namely, the ending of the construction of social housing by a Labour Party Government?  In that regard, when will the housing Bill come before the House to give Deputies an opportunity to debate the decision of a Labour Party Government to effectively abolish council housing when 96,000 people are on housing waiting lists desperately waiting for homes?</p>

Information and clarity on the new structure must be provided as soon as possible to show respect to the officeholders of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The Tánaiste will also know that a country is defined as being in recession when it has a decline in GDP over two successive quarters.

          <p eId="para_237">I am sharing time with Deputies Ross, Fleming, Wallace and Joan Collins.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The Government's dishonesty in its attempt to deceive people on the issue of our debt burden and the fiscal treaty is really staggering.  We know the Government conspired with EU leaders to try to avoid the referendum on the fiscal treaty.  That was confirmed to us by the German European affairs minister.  When the Government could not avoid the referendum, it came up with a new dishonesty to deceive people into believing they are getting relief on the debt burden on the so-called promissory note.  In reality, it is not relieving that debt burden one bit, but in fact has made a sovereign debt of a crazy commitment - but only a commitment - made by Fianna Fáil to pay off the gambling debts of Anglo Irish Bank.  This makes less likely the possibility of the write down of that debt and guarantees that the debt is now foisted permanently on to the backs of working people and the vulnerable in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The key gimmick, to which the Sinn Féin motion refers, is to suggest that if people oppose the fiscal treaty, they will be cut off from funding from the European stability mechanism.  The Government has peddled this line over the last number of weeks, putting a gun to the heads of the Irish people to try to bully them into voting for the treaty, only to discover that in fact the gun does not exist.  It is in construction and the Government is party to constructing it.  That gun cannot be pointed at people's heads unless we pass the European stability mechanism through this Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">Will the Minister of State give an assurance that the Government will not point the gun at the heads of the Irish people and bully them into voting in favour of the fiscal treaty?  Will he assure us that the European stability mechanism legislation will not come in until after people have had the chance to vote on the fiscal treaty?</p>

          <p eId="para_241">The deal on the promissory notes is not in the bag yet.  Reports from Europe on RTE this morning suggest there still is opposition to this in the European Central Bank and that we should not take it for granted at this stage.  It is also very unclear what the coupon is on the bond, what the interest rate will be on that bond, and it would be wrong to pass any judgment at this stage.  It might be premature.  It might be gone by this evening or we might get more details which would change our view on it.  It is fair enough to hold fire on this particular deal until the actual content of it is known.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">If this news is a prelude to something dramatic or some change, or indeed a write off of the debt in the longer term, then we on this side should tell the Government to keep going.  However, if it is a puff of smoke, we will not be deceived by it.  There are several alternative ways of looking at this.  The sceptical view is that the Government is up against the 31 March deadline and must come up with something, and is sending Patrick Honohan in today with a deal to make it look as if we are actually doing something constructive.  The other view is that there is real movement.  The timing of this particular motion makes it impossible for us to pass judgment on it.  This time tomorrow, it may be clearer when we get more detail, but at the moment it would be wrong to condemn it or welcome it without knowing any of the details, particularly the interest rate.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">There is a spectre haunting Europe.  It is the spectre of mass unemployment.  At the moment, there are 16.9 million unemployed people in the 17 country eurozone and 24.3 million unemployed in the 27 countries.  In Spain alone, there are 5.3 million unemployed.  In Greece, one in five people are unemployed.  There has been a 40% rise in suicide rates in Greece.  Austerity is literally killing Europeans.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">The only solution to the austerity induced unemployment seems to be more austerity.  The Germans argue that any loosening of the fiscal purse strings will increase borrowing costs and might panic the bond markets, yet economic stimulus is working in America.  There have been 23 consecutive months of job growth in the US.  They have created 3.7 million new jobs in the private sector alone over the past two years, yet we are insisting on turning our back on such a measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_250">The irony is that mass unemployment itself is the biggest barrier to deficit reduction.  The best way to cut borrowing levels is to get people back to work and paying taxes.  Unlike GDP or inflation, unemployment is the only major economic indicator that measures real human beings rather than growth or prices.  Having a job is not just about earning a living and paying taxes.  It is about human dignity and self worth.  We are looking at serious social consequences, such as financial hardship, emotional stress, depression, loss of morale and status among people, sickness, premature death, crime, disorder and social unrest.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">There is more to life than the Government's fiscal package.  It is about time it started looking at the big picture.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Collins</from>
          <p eId="para_252">There is also another spectre haunting Europe, and that is a lack of democracy.  The right of the people to be consulted through referenda in respect of changes in the Constitution is a very important safeguard to democracy in our State.  It is something people in other EU states would like to have, given the lack of democracy in how the EU functions.  This right has been fundamentally undermined and turned into something of a joke by the actions of successive Governments and the parties of the political establishment.  Following the votes on the Lisbon and Nice treaties, the verdict of the people was rejected by the establishment parties of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, and we were forced to vote again, with all sorts of threats, blackmail and outright lies on the consequences of voting "No" a second time.  While the Labour Party leader was assuring citizens he respected their vote, at the same he was assuring the US ambassador that there would be a second vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">There cannot be a second bite of the cherry on the fiscal pact, so the Government has taken Johnny Giles's advice and is getting the retaliation in first.  The only argument the Government has for a "Yes" vote is a blackmail clause inserted in the ESM treaty.  It has convinced and colluded in blackmailing its own citizens.  If this is not the case, then it should have no problem delaying ratification of the Article 136 amendment and the ESM treaty until after the people have had their say.</p>

          <p eId="para_257">I am sorry to see the Technical Group leaving <i>en masse</i>.  Perhaps it is a reflection on me rather than themselves, but I hope it is not.  If the Minister, Deputy Noonan, had not come in here last night and we only read this morning on the RTE website, <i>The Irish Times</i> or whatever newspaper of repute that the Government was engaging in this process, there would be a revolution on the opposite side and Deputy Ross and his friends would be giving out.  The Minister was correct to come in here and inform the House and I commend him on doing that.  He made an important point which the Deputies opposite have not mentioned.  He said that details of the arrangements have still to be worked out, which the Taoiseach affirmed again this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">There are two simple questions before us, namely, should a Government's income be more than it spends and should a Government try to reduce its national debt.  Most people who are reflective, honest and who think about where we want to be as a society and an economic State would answer "Yes" to both questions.  This is at the core of the fundamental principles of the stability treaty.  The treaty is about putting in place an agreement between eurozone countries.  It builds on what the European Community was created for and has worked towards up to this very day.  It is an agreement that requires governments to be careful in how they use taxpayers' money and that requires them to take a long-term view.  When I hear Members opposite engage in the politics of protest and in cheap soundbites to gain notoriety, they mislead the very people they claim to represent.  There is an obligation on a Government, of whatever hue, to represent its people and thankfully in the past 12 months we have seen, be it from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade or from the Department of Finance, a Government doing that, representing its people, and if we get this change, it will be very welcome.  It will be a tremendous day for the Irish people and for us as a nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">This treaty is not just an abstract European concept.  It is not about a European bureaucrat being faceless and hidden from us.  Neither is it about the European Commission nor the European Parliament.  It about the very future of the currency, of the European Union and of us individually and as a country within the European Community.  That is why it is important that the euro matters to every single person in this country.  Having the euro currency, being a member of the eurozone and being the only English speaking country in the eurozone allows us an opportunity to be part of a strong currency.  It has also meant that the actions of other countries have affected our currency and our economy.  That is why it is important that this stability treaty recognises the whole ethos of interdependence and interdependency.  That is why it is important for Mr. Sarkozy and Mrs Merkel put aside their political contests in their own countries and be mindful of the broader concept of where they want Europe to be.  The treaty is about eurozone countries co-ordinating policies to prevent economic contagion.  That must be at the heart of what they do in Europe at the level of Government leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">It is important to recognise that we as a nation are benefiting from the European Union through the European stabilisation fund.  We should reflect on where we would be if we did not have it.  We should cast our minds back to that infamous Sunday night when the troika came into town and to where we were in the context of the world perspective on Ireland 12 months ago and where we are today.  Perhaps we are a poster boy for what a country should do right but, more importantly, within the thinking class and among the people who invest, there is a recognition that we have a Government of different political ideologies, working in harmony and unison to benefit our country, and that is what Europe is about.</p>

        <speech by="#DominicHannigan" eId="spk_239">
          <from>Deputy Dominic Hannigan</from>
          <p eId="para_261">I am delighted to speak on this Private Members' motion.  In essence, it proposes that we should not ratify the Article 136 amendment to the EU treaty, thereby in effect holding up the introduction of the ESM.  The proposers of the motion advocate that we should reject the stability treaty and go to the EU and say that if they do not give us access to the ESM we will stop it happening and in the process make sure that no country will get access to the ESM.  If ever we want to talk about blackmail, that is blackmail in black and white.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Sinn Féin has gained too much for too long by threatening people by aggression.  Now it will threaten the security of our country and deny our European neighbours and comrades access to funding that might prevent recession across Europe in their countries and that might protect the people of Europe.  So much for showing solidarity with the working people of Europe.  It is disgraceful for them to claim to be a party of the left and yet seek to deny financial stability to millions of families across the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">It would be a case of "ourselves alone", if we went that way, but we are not alone.  We do not want to be alone; we want to work together.  Sinn Féin may be accustomed to using aggression to get what it wants but that is not the way the European Union works.  It works through negotiation, it works together and it does not bully.  "Le Chéile" is a phrase I use in this respect.  We need to go forward, through negotiation and compromise, with the EU.  The announcement last night in this House by the Minister, Deputy Noonan, shows we can make progress on measures such as the promissory notes.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">All of us accept that it would be foolish at this stage for Ireland to go on an "ourselves alone" pathway.  The Government supports the stability treaty.  We believe in responsible budgeting and economic stability.  I do not see how any credible left wing party can come in here and support irresponsible budgetary measures, considering the crisis facing this country.  This stability treaty will ensure that no future Government ever has to deal with the disastrous mess with which my Government was left.  Sinn Féin does not want to see a repeat of what Fianna Fáil has inflicted on this country.  We envisage this treaty will enhance consumer confidence and thereby enhance investor confidence in Europe.  It will bring stability to our budgetary systems and ensure that across the European Union, regardless of any particular member state, measures will be put in place to make sure each country respects the targets and rules of the European Union and if they do not, they will be penalised.  There is no point in talking about a blackmail clause; there is only one blackmailer and it is clear which party that is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DerekNolan" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Deputy Derek Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_265">The simplicity of this motion typifies the Sinn Féin approach to economics and economic policy.  We are constantly left with the prospect Sinn Féin coming in and its approach being based on emotion and fantasy versus an actual plan or one based on reality.  It is necessary sometimes to take stock of where the economy is at and what this country has gone through.  We have had the collapse of an entire economic sector of society in the construction industry, on which one in six jobs were dependent at the height of its growth, which has led to huge unemployment.  We have a heap of debt hanging around the neck of the country as a result of reckless and dangerous banking policies and a Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin-supported bank guarantee.  That has had a crippling effect on the State finances and the ability of the State to pay its bills and to pay its way, which has resulted in the necessity of external lenders coming into this State to fund our public services and to keep us afloat.  On top that, we have a global economic crisis that is not lifting and continues to reign.  We also have a recession in the eurozone.  On top of all that, we have a crisis of confidence in the future and the very existence of the eurozone currency, the so-called debt crisis and currency crisis.  All these issues are a very heavy burden and weigh severely on our tiny country and they all have to be dealt with one by one.  That is what the Government is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">We need to get real.  We do not have complete and utter sovereignty over our economic matters.  We work within the European Union with a common currency and over the years we have shared sovereignty, responsibility and control of our economic policy.  There are other people involved in paying for the bailout that we have received, people who are putting billions of euro from their economies into the programme.  They want to ensure the money they put in will not cause the problem in the eurozone to drag on but instead solve it.  The treaty tries to repair a design flaw in the currency to ensure the problems we have with excessive debt and runaway spending will not recur.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">Sinn Féin, however, forgets this in our interests.  The euro is not only used on mainland Europe, it is the currency in our pockets that is used by our businesses; it is what we are paid in and what our savings are in.  We are inextricably linked with the survival of the euro.  Perhaps because the Sinn Féin speech writers are paid in sterling, they cannot make this connection.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">It is interesting that the recent announcement by the Government on the renegotiation of the promissory note for this year has been treated with such cynicism and derision by Sinn Féin.  It is clearly a positive step, just as the reduction in the interest rate, the renegotiation of the minimum wage, the jobs initiative and the renegotiation of the asset disposal policy were all positive steps that never even received a small round of applause from Sinn Féin.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">During Leaders' Questions this morning Deputy Mary Lou McDonald criticised the lack of detail on the promissory note, despite being told the negotiations had not concluded.  She asked on which cut backs the Tánaiste would roll back.  This is a constant argument from Sinn Féin that I take on on local radio in Galway and in this Chamber - its complete refusal to acknowledge that on top of our banking debts, there is a fiscal crisis in current spending is shameful.  I have heard Sinn Féin representatives on local radio talking about the paying back of Anglo Irish Bank bondholders, refusing to mention that it does not come from the State and will not have an effect on anyone for ten years, while saying they could easily reverse cuts and change policy if this payment did not have to be made.  The same happened this morning with the promissory note, with Sinn Fein Members saying if we did not pay back the money, we would have an extra €3.1 billion available.  That is not true; it would be an extra €3.1 billion that we would not have to borrow and add to the national debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">This is a fake argument in which Sinn Féin treats people like idiots, manipulates them and stirs up anxiety to create a sense of unfairness.  The people know that times are tough, and the public is suffering, but the manipulation and arrogance shown by a party seeking electoral gain is deeply cynical.  When the history books are written and people look back at the greatest economic crisis the State has ever endured, they will look with scorn at Sinn Féin for the cheap politics it played during a time of national crisis.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Lyons</from>
          <p eId="para_271">I commend Deputy Derek Nolan for his remarks.  I could not put it better, but I will try to add to what he said.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">I welcome the news that the promissory note payment for this month has been delayed.  It is an understatement to say this is good news.  It is evidence that our strategy of patient engagement with our EU partners is working.  As we are dependent on others to finance our deficit, we do not have the option to act unilaterally.  This decision shows we are following the right path in the best interests of the country and the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Listening to the debate on the motion last night and today I heard calls for an honest debate on the treaty and its merits from Sinn Féin, as well as calls not to frighten people.  If anyone rewound the video, last night we heard calls from Sinn Féin peppered with references to the treaty as an austerity treaty with a blackmail clause.  If that is not frightening the people, I do not know what it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">I support one section of the motion which calls for a debate on the merits of the treaty which I see as being about our responsibilities in a common currency area.  This is our currency, the one we use daily and that is in our pockets to pay our bills and mortgages and for our kids' lunches at school.  It is in our interests for the euro to be dependable and speculation about its imminent collapse to no longer be daily news.  That is what the treaty is about; it is as important for the personal finances of the people as it is for those who make investment decisions based on the future stability of a currency.  We should all remember this.  Our objective should be to avoid ever needing a bailout in the future.  That means following policies that allow for growth, which is the intention of the Government.  If, however, we need it through no fault of our own, it is a no-brainer that we have access to ESM money.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">Let us look at the future options available to us based on our current situation.  We are in a funding programme under which we receive loans from the troika, which includes our European partners.  If we did not have access to these loans, we would be at the mercy of markets that are extremely hostile to countries with large deficits and a growing debt.  We should remember this lesson, as we still have a funding requirement beyond the years of the troika programme.  Sinn Féin states that if we reject the terms and conditions applied, we should still be allowed to access ESM money or use the veto to remove the clause.  Saying we should have the option to use the veto in a situation where 12 nations have ratified the treaty is the wrong call.  The rules of the treaty are set down in the revised Stability and Growth Pact of 2011.  Through the golden rule, the deficit rule is made explicit.  The reality is that Ireland must follow these rules; therefore, we should avail of the option of accessing ESM funds.  Let us remember that we have a common currency and shared interests and that playing a poor hand when the rules have already taken effect is not the answer to our problems.  Stability and growth provide the answers and should be our priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">We have and will continue to plan for growth, but we cannot make assumptions about our future.  As no one here has a crystal ball, we must keep our options open.  The policy advocated by Sinn Féin that we demand access to common funds or use the veto, even if the referendum result is negative, is unlikely to get us far.  That is why I will be voting against the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">I stood for election because of the state of the country.  I gave up a job I absolutely loved to come here where my daily job involves a lot of people blaming me as a politician for everything.  I am absolutely sick and tired of the negativity when there is positivity.  I am sick and tired of the rubbish from certain Members of the House in seeking to dampen positive news.  It is inherently wrong to be negative when there are positive things happening.  This has been the best day since the Government took office one year ago.  This shows the economy is moving forward.  We are not there yet, but it is a significant step forward.  It is a shame, however, that there are people who have come here today to play with words, saying this is not a good day.  We only need look at what happened during Leaders' Questions when there was not one positive word, except from Deputy Shane Ross, about the steps taken by the Government.  If we are interested in the people who elected us, let us be honest with them and say this is a bloody good day.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The importance of the upcoming debate on the EU stability treaty for us as a nation cannot be underestimated.  In speaking on RTE two or three months ago I said I hoped the Attorney General would advise that we hold a referendum because it would give us the opportunity to have a real debate on the issue.  That is what has transpired, which I welcome, as it will be of benefit to Ireland if we can get at the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">This is not a good day for politics or politicians in the light of the report published this morning which gives a negative view of them.  Although the burden can be borne more on one side of the House, it is still not a good day for politics.  It is important, however, that we rise to the challenge of being honest with the people.  The media have an obsession with the soundbite and the cheap populist rhetoric of a minority of representatives in the House.  I regret this because the negative campaigning is effective in distorting the facts in this important national conversation on our relationship with the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">The main negative is that the treaty has come too late for my generation, a generation consigned to debt because of the reckless decisions taken by the architects of society in the last decade.  It is to be regretted at our leisure that such a responsible and common-sense attitude to lending was not mandatory in the last ten years.  The debt, both sovereign and personal, and ensuing devastation for so many Irish families could have been spared.  The basis for the deficit in the day-to-day running of our economy was a delusional dependency on unsustainable tax revenues, primarily from the property bubble.  In a belated attempt to ensure this is not repeated, the troika has correctly laid down the condition that Ireland must introduce a property tax, which will provide a sustainable base for collecting our taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">This debate is, yet again, an attempt by the Opposition to request an <i>à la carte</i> style of governance that is devoid of any form of realism or responsibility and dominated by the hollow rhetoric and empty soundbite so loved by the media.  It rejects austerity which, as I have said previously, is no more or less than merely living within our means, and it demands an endless array of services.  It is high time our society participated in a more informed debate on the future of our economy.  This treaty would stand on its merits if we were never part of the EU.  It merely requires a government to decide to live within its budget and control the amount of money it borrows.  Every household in the country is doing that daily, and is very proud and responsible to be doing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">If Ireland was never part of the EU, this would be a sensible treaty.  It is all the more important when we are part of the EU that the other countries in the EU, our trading partners, also comply with the treaty.  This will allow us to grow our exports.  Figures released today which show that our GDP grew by 0.7% last year are welcome.  It is a positive step.  However, what is holding back this country is the domestic economy.  Our trade and exports are thriving but the domestic economy is not, due to the lack of confidence.  That is the direct result of the negativity and constant political games being played by the other side of the House.  It is destroying that confidence and, in turn, holding this country back from achieving what it seeks.  I ask the Opposition to wear the green jersey and be a little more responsible in debating these issues.</p>

          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_283">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I agree with a comment by Deputy Dominic Hannigan earlier in that I do not think Sinn Féin quite knows what it wants aside from publicity and notoriety.  Sinn Féin would have us believe that the inclusion of Article 136 is intended to frighten the public into supporting the fiscal stability treaty in the event a referendum is required in a member state.  The same party was claiming only a few weeks ago that the Government had sought to change the treaty wording to avoid a referendum.  The two arguments are contradictory so can the party make up its mind which is the correct one?  I believe both claims are pure nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">It is only logical that the commitment to greater solidarity among eurozone countries is matched by stricter rules.  The granting of ESM support is closely tied to the new fiscal compact, and by creating this connection the EU Heads of State and Government have underlined the fact that financial solidarity and financial solidity are two sides of the same coin.  The European stability mechanism treaty is an important part of the significant number of initiatives which have been taken at EU level to ensure the economic and financial stability of the euro area and the EU in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, said recently that the funding approved under the existing programme of financial support for Ireland is not conditional on Ireland ratifying the fiscal compact but, as is currently the case, on Ireland successfully implementing its programme.  In short, this treaty is the cornerstone for a new culture of stability in Europe.  The coalition Government has earned international credibility by swiftly cleaning up and consolidating Ireland's banking sector.  An editorial in the <i>Financial Times</i> last September stated that other countries caught in the eurozone sovereign debt and financial sector turmoil could learn from the way Ireland is nursing itself back to health.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">This Government is changing the way Ireland does its business by restoring fiscal discipline, cutting the deficit by 2015 and returning to honest budgeting.  Irish Governments have made some terrible mistakes in recent years, but I do not believe that signing the revised ESM treaty will be one of them.</p>

        <speech by="#PaschalDonohoe" eId="spk_244">
          <from>Deputy Paschal Donohoe</from>
          <p eId="para_287">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate.  I wish to make four points on this motion and the prospect of the referendum on the European stability treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The first point relates specifically to Article 136, which is referred to in the motion.  I ask the people who are making claims against this article to answer an important question.  In a few years, when Ireland is out of the current arrangement, our taxpayers' money will be going into a fund that could be used in other countries.  Is it not in our interest that conditions be put in place regarding how our money is used elsewhere?  Is it not the case that if a fund is set up to which taxpayers' money is contributed, we would want to see that money being used responsibly and properly in other countries?  The answer is obviously "Yes" and for that reason it is appropriate that conditions are included.  Those conditions will be in our interest at some point in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">If one opposes the concept of including such conditions, one is opening up the prospect of Irish taxpayers' money being used in other countries but with Ireland not having a say in how that money is spent or whether it is properly administered.  That clause is about ensuring that in any future arrangement where countries seek money, including the external aid programme we are in at present and programmes in which other countries might participate in the future, there are conditions in place regarding how that money is spent.  It is exactly the same relationship as that which exists between a borrower and a bank.  It is precisely the type of arrangement that should be in place when Irish taxpayers' money is being used in other countries in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">My second point relates to the type of prize Sinn Féin claims is on the horizon if this treaty is rejected.  The party argues that there will be some theoretical increase in our country's sovereignty if we do not participate in this arrangement.  However, what will be the price?  How will our citizens thank us for us being able to say we are freer outside this treaty than within it, if the cost is that we are unable to fund the public services on which those citizens depend?  That is what the rejection of this treaty would mean.  Who would thank any government for saying our independence or autonomy is increased as a result of being outside this arrangement when the price for that increase is that it is unable to access the funding that must be borrowed to fund the public services?  How is that a good deal for the people that this or any future Government would seek to represent?</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Third, what vista would Ireland face if we are outside this arrangement?  It is very clear.  We would find ourselves in a situation where we are unable to access the future European stability mechanism or new bailout fund.  We also would be priced out of the financial markets.  Those markets would look at all the sacrifice our citizens have made over the past four years and ask, "Where is the intent to ensure the mistakes of the past are not repeated in the future?"  We would find ourselves outside the financial markets or borrowing from them at a prohibitively expensive rate while not having access to the mechanism that is designed to help countries that cannot get funding in the first place.  One has heard the cliche about an individual finding himself or herself between a rock and a hard place.  If Ireland were to again find itself in a situation where it is unable to access funding for our public services and there is nobody in the world willing to lend money to us, but we cannot access a programme designed to help countries in such situations, that is a recipe for intensified austerity and losing the country's sovereignty for many years beyond what we are experiencing at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The ultimate question which people who oppose this treaty must answer is very simple - from where would they get the money.  Where would they get the money to fund our public services and the gap between spending and taxation, given that we would be unable to access a bailout fund and the financial markets would be reluctant to lend us money?  The answer is that there is no place where we could get that money, and Sinn Féin knows that is the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_302">Day after day, Sinn Féin Deputies come in here and say they are against cuts in public services, but they are also against any measures to fund increased tax revenue coming into the State to fund the same public services.  In last year's general election, Sinn Féin campaigned on a platform of not dealing with the troika.  Sinn Féin said it did not want the troika's money and would find another way of doing it, while exiting their arrangement.  Where has that rhetoric gone over the last year?  Will we hear what they are about to say now?  Sinn Féin has performed the single biggest U-turn of any party in the Dáil since the last election.  The claim it is putting before the public is a continuation of that political dishonesty that could lead to such damage and difficulty for our country after the searing convulsions we have already been through.</p>

          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_305">I welcome the opportunity to speak on such an important issue.  Today is an extremely poignant day for this country, with the Mahon tribunal publishing its final report on corruption after 15 years' of inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">If accepted by the Irish people, this austerity treaty will have a dramatic effect on the future growth and stability of our economy.  This treaty will not solve the eurozone crisis and, like my colleagues in Sinn Féin, I am certain it will not fix our economy either.  If anything, this austerity treaty will deepen the recession for thousands of Irish citizens across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The treaty will lead to even greater levels of austerity being imposed on families that are already over-burdened.  It will mean more taxes on lower and middle-income earners.  This comes at a time when the Government has awarded a payment of €623,000 to Bank of Ireland chief executive, Richie Boucher.  I remind the Minister that this payment breaches the Government's own pay cap by €123,000.  It is absolutely scandalous that the head of a bank that has received such a huge injection of taxpayers' money should be rewarded, while under this treaty ordinary people will yet again be attacked by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">The stark reality and brutal impact of the Government's austerity policies are being felt by every sector of society, but more so by low and middle-income earners.  Every day in my constituency I see droves of young people leaving our shores.  They are doing so not, as has been claimed, by choice but in search of a better life, which they feel they cannot achieve here.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The most powerful tool for progress as a nation is education.  Education is central to the development of a prosperous and vibrant country.  Yet this treaty, if accepted by the Irish people, will ensure that there will be more public spending cuts.  Where will these cuts come from?</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Within our education system, we have seen the removal of Traveller support teachers, teachers of English as an acquired language, special needs assistants, and home-school liaison.  We have seen an attack on DEIS schools, while small schools are under pressure which is causing major problems in rural areas, especially in the Gaeltacht.  How much more can the Minister for Education and Skills cut?</p>
          <p eId="para_311">This treaty significantly strengthens the capacity of the European Commission to enforce member state compliance with existing rules and new ones.  Member states will have signed up to a legally binding obligation to enter automatically an economic partnership programme when they are in breach of the rules.  The content of this programme will be determined by the European Commission and will be extremely similar to the current EU-IMF austerity programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">Arguments have been made that these rules in the treaty are sensible, and are there to promote growth and stability in the economy.  The rules are far from that, however - they are anti-job and anti-growth.  Many economists, both Irish and international from both left and right, have all challenged the credibility of this treaty and its rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">Sinn Féin believes this treaty will most definitely not resolve the underlying crisis with the euro.  We feel strongly that, if implemented, the treaty will make matters much worse and will in fact further deepen the recession in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I have heard many Government Deputies argue that this treaty and its rules are aimed at ensuring the books are being balanced, as well as preventing governments from spending more than they earn.  This is a ridiculous argument.  Economies are not the same as households.  A requirement to balance the books at year-end does not apply in the same way to an economy as it does to a family.</p>

          <p eId="para_316">In times of strong economic growth, a business - like any other - will run a surplus and use that excess to pay down debts or invest in the business.  In periods of recession governments, like any SMEs, need flexibility both to borrow and invest thus ensuring that people get back to work, and that growth and stability are returned to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">If this austerity treaty is ratified it will place an economic straight-jacket on the State and its people for many decades.  By giving this treaty the protection of the Irish Constitution, it ensures it is permanent and can only be changed by a future referendum and with the agreement of the other signatory states.  It is crystal clear that this is an unfair and unjust treaty, which will be bad for those on low and middle incomes and disadvantaged communities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Colreavy</from>
          <p eId="para_318">First, I wish to answer Deputy Donohoe who asked how Sinn Féin proposed to pay for this.  We should all be aware, including Deputy Donohoe, that some €30 billion, plus €17 billion in interest, is going to Anglo Irish Bank, which is now known as IBRC.  This money is not morally or legally the responsibility of the Irish people.  If we add to that the €28 billion in interest on that borrowing over 20 years, we come to the considerable sum of €75 billion.  That would make some impression on Ireland's debt-to-GDP ratio.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">Second, I refer Deputy Donohoe to Sinn Féin's pre-budget submission which showed that by introducing a wealth tax and capping some public service pay, including politicians' pay and some other measures, we could meet our annual revenue requirements without this austerity treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Third, it is untrue that Sinn Féin supported the bank bailout.  Sinn Féin did support measures to overcome what was described as a liquidity problem for the banks, but within a week it became very clear-----</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Colreavy</from>
          <p eId="para_322">-----that there was a structural problem.  Sinn Féin did not support the bank bailout once that was made clear and once the lies were cut through.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Turning to the matter under discussion, citizens have witnessed much bad governance in recent years.  The political elite allowed bankers, developers and private speculators a licence to use and abuse the State.  When those bankers, developers and private speculators faced the consequences of their actions, they were shielded by the leaders of this country.  Citizens then faced further poor governance as the political elite wielded the sword for cuts and austerity, instead of taking the braver option of ingenuity.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Our citizens have witnessed their leaders making mistakes, blunders and errors, while the general public suffer the consequences.  Perhaps one of the greatest blunders an Irish Government has made is to consign us to austerity for the foreseeable future.  They have supported their own blackmail and are now attempting to use it against our citizens.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">During negotiations in December and January, the Government supported an insertion of the blackmail clause into the austerity treaty and the treaty establishing the European stability mechanism or ESM.  This blackmail clause stated that access to future bailout funds from the ESM would be subject to the Irish people passing the austerity treaty.  In effect, the Irish people were threatened and held to ransom, while their own Government supported it.  This is an indication of the ideology of this Fine Gael-Labour Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">They would rather support a clause that blackmails its citizens into austerity than show some real leadership.  They have handed the European elite the power to coerce our people so that the austerity treaty would be passed in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Many have bemoaned the use of scaremongering during past referendums, but this time it is the Government generating the fear.  Without this blackmail clause, Government knows the referendum will not pass.  All the treaty does is enforce harsh austerity on Irish people.  The Government has agreed to let Europe use blackmail to force the treaty through.  The Government is attempting to place itself in an impossible position in order, like Pontius Pilate, to wash its hands of responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">In his previous incarnation in Opposition, the Tánaiste accused the Government of economic treason.  Can the Tánaiste really say he has bettered Ireland's stakes in his Government's dealings with Europe?</p>
          <p eId="para_329">There is a chance of redemption for the Government.  For the ESM to be created, the European Council must amend the existing EU treaties and give them the power to create a permanent bailout mechanism.  This amendment, known as Article 136, must be ratified by all 27 member states.  Article 136 has yet to be ratified by the Oireachtas and therefore is not yet law.  As a result, the Government has a chance to prevent the Irish people being blackmailed.  We do not hold a veto over the treaty establishing the European Stability Mechanism but we, and the Government, hold a veto on Article 136 on which it is based.  In short, if the ESM cannot deny Ireland a second bailout, there is no reason to pass the austerity treaty.  Beyond blackmail, there is nothing of value for the Irish people in this treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">It is time for honesty from the Government.  The Government should do the right thing and prevent this blackmail clause being inserted in the treaty.  Let the referendum be carried out in the cold light of day in order that the public can make a clear and honest choice over our future.  The Government needs a mandate from the people if it wishes to pursue the severe austerity measures it is set on pushing through.  It has tried in vain to avoid holding a referendum and is now attempting to muddy the waters surrounding the facts.  Europe is not going to kick Ireland out of the euro or deny us a second bailout if we need it.  To do so would be an act of lunacy and would damage the entire European project.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">It is time we took ownership of our own destiny.  We can no longer afford to suffer at the whim of the market and unbridled capitalism.  It we continue to hand over any more of our freedoms, we will be embarking on a very dark path.  I remind the House of these lines from our national anthem:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_332">Sworn to be free,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_333">No more our ancient sireland</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_334">Shall shelter the despot or the slave.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">I highlight these words because, as we continue to hand over more and more of our sovereignty, we betray the sentiment of our anthem.  Only the Irish people have the right to determine the future of Ireland.  The EU, the IMF or the ECB cannot violate or negate those rights.  I call on Fine Gael, Labour and Fianna Fáil, as we approach the anniversary of 1916, to remember what those men and women died for.  It was not for dominion status of the kingdom of Goldman Sachs and its like.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis</from>
          <p eId="para_336">In March 2011, the Government framed itself as an Administration with the mandate of a democratic revolution.  This mandate was to sweep away the corrupt, undemocratic, wasteful, greedy and negligent political practices of the past and usher in a new era of better Government.  This claim was not based on the Government's belief that it really had better ideas or different politics but merely that it could do Fianna Fáil's job a little better and that people would see it as new and refreshing.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">It has certainly not done away with the age old tactic of scaremongering to ram through policy.  In the first and second Lisbon treaty referendums, respectively, we saw how over the top and how effective this can be.  We were told that to vote "No" to these treaties was to vote to leave the EU, destroy our economy further, put everyone in the country on the dole and cast out onto a sea of uncertainty from which we would never return.  We were warned that ATMs would shut down and cash would cease to be.  This was nonsense and scaremongering and it is happening all over again.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Of course, we have a new Government and so we have new scaremongering tactics.  This time it is in the treaty itself, in the form of the European Stability Mechanism and the blackmail clause.  The clause states that access to future emergency funding from the European Stability Mechanism would be conditional on ratification of the austerity treaty.  The Government supported its insertion, raising not one single objection.  This clause would mean people would be making their decision, not on whether the treaty would help to solve the economic crisis across Europe but on whether they believed the scare tactics and propagators of doom on the Government benches.  It would be a vote under a manufactured duress.  None of this has to be done, but it is the route chosen by the Government as a tactic to coerce people into supporting the treaty.  It would not have stopped the crisis and will certainly not fix it.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Some democratic revolution we have had, when this is what the Government thinks it can do to us.  It is nothing less than treachery.  The Government can do something that would be in the interests of Ireland, of democracy and of the wider Europe.  It can delay the ratification of the ESM Bill and of Article 136 until after the referendum on the austerity treaty.  Ireland needs an honest debate on this treaty and on the enshrining of austerity as the only policy available in crisis.  The Government, if it is a government of the people, must stand by the people's decision on this treaty and seek to inform rather than coerce.  If a "No" vote is returned in the referendum, the Government must return to the European Council and seek the removal of the blackmail clause from the ESM treaty.  If the Council refuses to change the treaty, the Government must use its veto to block the passage of the treaty.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">This treaty will heap further austerity on all of us, and on other European countries, and will further erode plans to take back our economic sovereignty.  It will increase the prospect of our losing our economic sovereignty.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_341">First, I assure Labour Party Deputies that no sterling was wasted on my speech.  Labour Deputies who have left the Chamber are clearly upset in this regard.  I assure them that no sterling was wasted on this speech.  I do not know about euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">Speaking to the Dáil on the 28 February the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore explained that the purpose of the austerity treaty was to help build a "thriving and prosperous European economy that has moved beyond the current crisis".  He then went on to claim that it was a package of measures that would help stabilise the situation in the eurozone and that it was "vital to our national interests".</p>
          <p eId="para_343">On the basis of these comments it seems pretty clear that the Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party believes that, overall, the content of the austerity treaty is good for economic recovery and that we should all vote for it come referendum day.  The "Yes" side claim it is simply a restatement of the existing Stability and Growth Pact rules with some modifications to these rules agreed to by the European Council in 2011.  These modifications, known as the six pack, were approved by the European Parliament and European Council in September and November 2011 and came into force from December 2011.  They are five separate EU regulations and one directive dealing with aspects of economic governance.  They were described by the European Council as "the most comprehensive reinforcement of economic governance in the EU and the euro area since the launch of the Economic and Monetary Union".</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Considering the Labour Party's support for the austerity treaty, including those elements whose origins are to be found in the so-called six pack, one would think its MEPs would have been equally supportive of the six pack proposals when they were voted on in the European Parliament last September.  It appears that is not so.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The Labour Party's three MEPs - Proinsias De Rossa, Ms Phil Prendergast and Ms Nessa Childers - opposed the package of measures, voting against four of them, abstaining on one and supporting one.  The reasons for their opposition to the overall package are interesting and put a different perspective on the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">Proinsias De Rossa, a former president of the Labour Party, said about the six pack that the "...legislative package will reinforce the EU austerity programme driving us into recession – that the measures are economically misguided ... will kill growth, destroy jobs and derail economic recovery."  On the same day his party colleague Ms Phil Prendergast was critical of the European Commission proposals.  She stated, "They are missing the most important ingredient: a jobs and growth strategy."  She went on to say the "austerity-only approach is a recipe for the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer."  Focusing on the impact of the six pack on the economy Ms Nessa Childers said, "To focus only on the side of fiscal austerity will depress demand further and destroy job creation...," and called for a "change away from this extreme austerity approach."</p>
          <p eId="para_347">Just as important, the reason the three Labour Party MEPs supported one of the six pack proposals was the inclusion of what is known as the "Monti clause".  It states the regulation will not affect the exercise of fundamental rights or the right to negotiate, conclude or enforce collective wage agreements - Ferreira A7-0183/2011.  This important clause is absent from the text of the austerity treaty.  I suppose one could say it is not the full monty.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">In the European Parliament the Labour Party strongly opposes the "irresponsible", "austerity only" approach of the six pack on the grounds that it will "kill growth, destroy jobs and derail economic recovery," yet their colleagues who were sitting in this Chamber earlier support the six pack inspired austerity treaty on the grounds that it is an "important milestone for Ireland on our road to recovery" and "vital to our national interests".  In European-speak, it is a millstone around our necks, but in Gilmore-speak, it is an important milestone in our recovery.  The European message seems to suggest that by signing up to the new eurozone treaty the Government will have surrendered control over Irish fiscal and budgetary matters to EU officials and be guilty of institutionalising austerity, with the result that generations of Irish people will be forced to endure unimaginable levels of debt and poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The Government's reluctance to hold a referendum is matched by its abject failure to provide any justification to explain why it is in our best interests to sign up to a treaty that will shackle Ireland to the policies of larger EU member states and the troika.  In my humble opinion, not only does the treaty surrender significant control over Irish fiscal and budgetary matters to unelected and unaccountable EU officials, it also imposes drastic and destructive austerity on ordinary citizens who have already had to pay the price of the casino capitalism of bankers, bondholders and speculators.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">If the provisions of the stability treaty were put in place today, the 23 EU member states currently subject to the excessive deficit procedure would have to accept the Commission's recommendations, even if a majority of member states disagreed, and to agree to a detailed programme of economic reforms which would be legally binding under EU law.  It is clear that, by any definition, this austerity treaty will put enormous pressure on ordinary people's welfare and living standards.  It reflects the interests of big business lobbies such as Business Europe and the European Round Table of Industrialists which have been advocating a strengthening of EU economic governance.  The new treaty is fully in line with such corporate demands.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">This Private Members' motion exposes the duplicity of a Government which has embarked on the scare tactics designed to force Irish citizens into accepting the treaty.  Let us be clear about the following points: the Government claims that if we reject the austerity treaty, we will be denied European Stability Mechanism, ESM, funding in the future; that if we do not say "Yes", we will not receive emergency funding in the future.  Not only is that untrue, but the Government, in vetoing the Article 136 amendment on which the ESM treaty is based, would stop Ireland from being forced to institutionalise austerity in law.  The "Yes" side, rather than freely and openly debating the merits of the austerity treaty, have resorted to scare tactics, using its muscle - possibly a six pack - to bully and blackmail and curtail debate and reasonable argument.  Clearly, the blackmail clause is an empty threat, as it has little, if any, legal standing and conflicts with the primary mandate of the ESM to safeguard the stability of the eurozone as written into the EU treaties.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The motion challenges the Government to postpone the legislation on the European stability treaty until after the referendum takes place and veto it if the people reject the austerity treaty.  It calls on the Government, in the event of a rejection of the austerity treaty by the people, to seek a further amendment to the ESM treaty removing the blackmail clause and to use its veto on this matter, if required.  That would allow the public to debate and decide on the austerity treaty on its own merits, free from the blackmail implicit in the threat to deny future bailout funds.  If the motion is defeated in the Dáil, it will be a clear indication that the Government is intent on using scare tactics to have the treaty passed.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">I could read my speech, as other speakers have done, but it would be much more useful for me to reply to the debate in an open and honest way.  It is important that the people listen to it and hear the utterly cynical and contrived speeches that have clearly been written by others with an agenda which is all about not telling the truth to the people.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">We have a fundamental choice to make, namely, are we part of the euro, our currency, and going to embrace the new rules that are essential for its success, or are we going to take a different view and decide to economically and politically paddle our own canoe?  That is the choice facing the people.  It can be dressed up in hyperbole and propaganda, but I find the reference to a blackmail clause astonishing from a political party such as Sinn Féin with all its allies in the past 40 years.  It is a past master at blackmail and blackmailing the people during that period.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_265" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_356">It is important that we have a cold, calm, rational debate on the issue because the euro is our currency.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I voted in favour of the Maastricht treaty which my colleagues opposite argued against.  The same position was adopted by the British Conservative Party at the time.  Sinn Féin was against the euro at the time, but some years later it was in favour of it.  Now it presents itself as a party which has developed a master position on how it can be advanced.  The only way that can happen is if we agree rules, stick to them and over a period develop the stability the eurozone needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">At the tail end of last year we were looking for all parts of the jigsaw to come together.  We were looking for an ESM that would be the firewall to do the things we needed to do in this economy and elsewhere.  We have it in place now.  It seems to be logical and right that if one wants to draw down the funds attached to it, conditions be attached.  The logical condition is that we meet our budgetary and fiscal parameters.  We must do this by 2015, regardless of whether a system is in place.  The economy has gone through an adjustment, to a figure of €25 billion between 2008 and 2011.  That sum has been taken out of the economy in the past three years and between 2013 and 2015 a further €8.5 billion will be taken out.  That is necessary in terms of balancing the difference between what we taken in and what we spend.  Irrespective of the banking debt, the fundamental reality facing Sinn Féin, the United Left Alliance, Deputy Ross and everyone else is that there is a gaping hole of €15 billion in the public finances.  If we cannot borrow, as we cannot at present, we require the support of the European authorities and the IMF to get us over this period in order that we can get back to the markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">Do colleagues honestly believe we will have a greater chance of getting back to the markets if this treaty is rejected?  Irrespective of our very important national anthem, the market view on whether this country has the capacity to fix its deficit and to get back over a period of years to a more manageable financial position is important.  It is delusional to think this country would be in a better position by saying to the markets, and to the world community and Europe, that we will be part of the euro but we are not accepting the conditions around that.  Those who look at this issue honestly, rationally and calmly would come to the conclusion that it is delusional to think such.  I put to the House, particularly to Members opposite, that it is utterly delusional to suggest we can get out of this enormous hole by not agreeing rules which are essentially a part of the currency we want to build.</p>
          <p eId="para_360">The euro is important.  It is a hard currency.  A small, open trading economy like Ireland, which exports more than it imports and which is based on its international reputation, needs to export with a hard currency, and the euro gives us the capacity to do so.  However, we cannot be part of that eurozone or currency club unless we accept and embrace the rules.  Enormous mistakes were made in the Stability and Growth Pact which affected the large and small countries but, as the Minister for Finance stated, we must retrofit it.  We must ensure those mistakes are not repeated and we get a period of stability.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Since the ESM has been in place, the EU leaders agreed in very quick time in January last about this treaty, and the Greek situation has been given some relief, at least for the medium term, the markets have calmed and the eurozone has faced an unprecedented three months of stability.  We are taking baby steps here.  We are coming through the most enormous financial crisis the world has seen since the 1930s, and to get another three months of stability, it is important that we make this decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Sovereignty lies with the Irish people, not this Parliament.  The people will decide whether they accept this treaty.  The Government has stated it is a matter for the people, in one referendum, to decide this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">The train will leave the station with or without us.  I would argue that the treaty is already in place.  One looks at the decision in Spain, only a week and a half ago, in terms of its rules.  It is quite clear that the treaty is already in place.  We must decide whether we are part of that train and whether we want to get the country to a better place.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I contend, and will so contend in every part of this country over the course of the next few months or however long this campaign takes place, that it is in the national interest that we remain part of the euro, that we accept the rules of the euro, and that we do it in a way in which we have the support.  We have obtained the support of the European authorities, and while that is sometimes an unpopular statement to make, this country would be in a ten times worse position without that support in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">We continue to get a better deal, as the Minister for Finance stated to the House last night.  We continue to renegotiate.  The fundamental mandate given to this Government is to renegotiate that deal, but we do that on the basis of being part of something.  We do it on the basis of agreed rules.  We do not do it on the basis of pretending to the people and to the world community that we can take unilateral action and, suddenly, this county will be in a better place.  It is delusional and a fundamental lie.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I put it to the Sinn Féin Members that the only reason they are taking up their "No" position is because they see this treaty as another political opportunity, another part of their grab for power and another part of their agenda, which has nothing to do with the interests of this country and everything to do with Sinn Féin and its little political project.  I believe the people will reject that and that they will support the considered view of the Government on this issue when it is put.  The sooner that debate happens, the better.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PadraigMacLochlainn" eId="spk_266">
          <from>Deputy Pádraig Mac Lochlainn</from>
          <p eId="para_367">I always enjoy listening to speeches of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.  I read his article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> recently where he wrote of the reds under the bed of Sinn Féin, the threat to the State and all the madness with which he goes on about Sinn Féin.  It has been his track record for many years, but at this stage he really would need to cop himself on as regards that type of nonsense and rhetoric.  It might receive an audience with the editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> but it certainly will not receive an audience with the types of communities that he is supposed to represent in Dublin South-West.  He would want to listen a little more to those he represents.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">On the specifics, let us be clear that there is no solution to Ireland's economic crisis or Europe's economic crisis in the austerity treaty.  This treaty is about the need for the German Chancellor, Dr. Angela Merkel, to be re-elected.  It is about the need for Dr. Merkel to put out a narrative that what caused the economic crisis we face in Europe was fiscal indiscipline.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">As Deputy Brian Hayes spoke of Maastricht and how he voted for it, let us look at the record here in Ireland.  For most of the 11 or 12 years since the State has been a member of the eurozone, it was below the 3% deficit ceiling and within the debt-to-GDP ratio target of 60%.  Ireland met those targets for most of those years.  We stopped reaching those targets when we were saddled with the horrendous banking debt at the insistence of the European Central Bank, at the folly of the Government and in the betrayal of the people.  The economic crisis in Ireland was caused not by the failure to meet some set of arbitrary targets but by the fact that the people were saddled with profound banking debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">There are three core elements to the crisis in Europe: the banking crisis; the sovereign debt crisis; and the investment and unemployment crisis.  The Government does not have a solution to those three issues.  It does not have a real and radical reform of the financial and banking sector.  What we see are those within an ideology - I accept Deputy Brian Hayes shares this as he is right-wing and a Thatcherite politician - such as the technocratic Prime Minister of Italy, Mr. Mario Monti, the technocratic Prime Minister of Greece, Mr. Papademos, and the man in charge of the European Central Bank, whose common denominator is that they come from the Goldman Sachs philosophy.  When the Greek Prime Minister dared to suggest a referendum, he was quickly shunted aside and replaced by a technocratic Prime Minister from the exact same ideology of unfettered, unbridled right-wing capitalism that has failed, not only Europe but the United States and much of the global economy at this time.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">As to whether there is a redirection of Deputy Brian Hayes's ideology and whether there is any humility that he might have been wrong in following that ideology all of those years, seeking to bring down public services and workers' terms and pay, to privatise public services, to provide for light-touch regulation and deregulation, and to let the markets grow with trickle-down benefit for all of the people on the ground, there is none whatsoever.  It is more of the same.  That is what this austerity treaty is about and that is why Sinn Féin opposes it.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">We are not alone.  The European Trade Union Confederation has given a damning analysis of this treaty.  The expected next President of France, M. Hollande, stated he will seek to renegotiate this.  The Dutch Labour Party states it will look to oppose this if it cannot get guarantees around deficits that are unreasonable.  The Minister of State's colleagues in the right-wing Government in Spain are seeking renegotiation.  These arbitrary targets are not going to solve our economic crisis and that is the basis on which we oppose it.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">I listened with great interest to the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, and his colleagues in Government express their serious concern that the backstop, to quote the Minister of State's terminology, of the European stability mechanism would be lost to the Irish people if we were to reject this treaty or if we dared just to take this treaty on its merits or demerits.  If the Government is so concerned about it, and if it is serious and real, it has the capacity to stop it happening.  We know it conceded it in the negotiations but it now has the opportunity to stop this happening because it can veto it.  The amendment to Article 136 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is something the Government has the capacity to veto - that is a reality.  It can stop this happening.  It can refuse to bring this legislation before the House and give the Irish people their right to look at this treaty without the threat of access to future funding - it can do all of that if it chooses.  Otherwise, will it actively collude in this blackmail and threat?  It can give us no other description than that.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">When I check my dictionary and read the objective of that clause put into the preamble, I can only come to this conclusion.  Let us be very clear, in case the Government tries to muddy the waters.  We are challenging the Government to put its money where its mouth is.  If it is concerned about this issue and attempts to use it during the campaign, we will remind the Government, if it votes against this motion, that this was its choice.  It colluded in it and is part of that agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">Let us look at the whole issue of alternatives and what Sinn Féin has said in regard to the banking crisis.  Most reasonable economists would agree it is long overdue that we had rigorous stress testing of the European core banks, the large banks that were responsible for the recklessness and lending that took place in the periphery, to private banks in the Irish case.  We need the full facts to be on the table regarding all of these derivatives, securitisation agendas and credit default swaps.  Everything they were involved in needs to be on the table and a cleansing of the banking system needs to take place.  When that takes place, on a case-by-case basis, we should have de-leveraging and then recapitalisation on a sensible, prudent, case-by-case basis.  Of course, that has not happened at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">We then need to look at the issue of sovereign debt.  The Minister of State tells us we might be able to transfer this promissory note for a bond and kick the can down the road.  However, there is no writedown of our debt, this unjust burden that was put on our people.  We were saddled with the full impact of this crisis.  It is remarkable that we have no deal for our people.  How can we sustain growth?  How can we really have a plan if we do not get a fair deal - a writedown - in the short, medium and long term for the interests of our people?</p>
          <p eId="para_377">Next is the issue of investment and unemployment.  It is not just Ireland that is impacted in this way.  Spain has half of its young people out of work.  Unemployment is rife, particularly across what are known as the peripheral states.  Austerity has been an absolute failure.  Those on what would be called the progressive left, with all its different elements in the social democratic movements and trade union movements, are stinging in their criticism of this agenda, this right wing coup that has taken place, and which I understand the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, supports because it is part of his ideology.  It is a grave injustice to our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">What could be done?  There is the National Pensions Reserve Fund of €5.3 billion.  We could ally those resources with the potential of the European Investment Bank, which has a track record of prudence and investment with return.  We could look at next generation broadband, on which there was a presentation in this House.  Imagine what it would do for Ireland's economy if we could roll out next generation broadband, which is doable.  We could have a real plan supporting our small businesses and linking them to export opportunities.  We could give entrepreneurism hope.  We could give hope to the people who are queuing up for the overseas jobs expo.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">No hope can be given to our people in this way.  We must fit in to this crazy, right wing coup that is taking place in Europe.  This is strange to me when one considers that what has caused this crisis is a fundamental failure of that ideology.  Deregulation left the financiers free to do their job, and look at the disaster it has brought upon our people.  These are the reasons we have opposed this treaty and these are the solutions we offer up.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">What I find interesting is the speaking out of the side of the mouth-type language that we would need a backstop and that we could not access support if we reject this treaty.  As Deputy Shane Ross said, we have the most compliant Taoiseach.  This is the most complaint Government in all of Europe in regard to these issues.  The reality is that our people, at the insistence of the European Central Bank and due to the past and ongoing folly of our politicians, have been left to carry the can for a fundamental failure that was not Irish in its genesis but European and global.  We have met all the targets we have been asked to meet.  We have delivered punishing austerity on our people.  We have met every troika demand, and every quarter it comes here to tell us so.  How can the Minister of State possibly suggest that, having been the most compliant Government and people in Europe, we would be refused access if we needed it again?  It is patent nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">What Sinn Féin is asking the Government to do is to remove the scare tactics from this debate, to take away the threats from a people who are weary, a people who have had to carry the burden for what was a European financial crisis, which was fundamentally a failure of the European banking system and of global capitalism.  Our people have carried that burden for too long.  What we want is a plan and a strategy for growth and jobs that is real, just and fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">The Minister of State talks about extraneous issues.  This is the extraneous issue of this campaign, namely, the threat that we could not access support if we reject this treaty.  I ask the Minister of State and the Government to do the right thing.  If it is sincere in its concern, then our motion is reasonable.  The Government should not put through this legislation.  It should give the Irish people their say and give them clear space to look at this treaty and decide whether we can really meet these targets and move with more austerity.  That is the question we put.  The Minister of State should not muddy the waters or have any doubt about our approach in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">I understand, Minister of State, that you are a right wing politician, a Thatcherite politician.  You are into "reds under the bed"-type articles in newspapers.  That has been your track record and long may it continue because it inspires us to work even harder for our communities.</p>

How can it stand over a situation where the right wing in Europe is rewarded and encouraged for the catastrophic failure of its approach?  How can a party that follows in the footsteps of Connolly and Larkin enthusiastically sell this treaty to the Irish people?  How can the Labour Party in Ireland act in isolation of the Labour parties in Germany, the Netherlands and France - its sister organisations - and of its grassroots in the European Trade Union Confederation?  How can the Labour Party in Ireland, enthusiastic members of the European family, ignore its own brothers and sisters on the left within that European family?  These are the questions the party must ask itself.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryMitchellOConnor" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Deputy Mary Mitchell O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_770">Before the debate adjourned last night, I indicated that I hated quotas.  In 2011, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank stated that appointing women to the bank's executive board, which did not have any women, would make it "prettier and more colourful".  His comment made me laugh as I am partial to a bit of colour but I was also reminded of the following great words of encouragement I once received, "Toughness does not have to come in a pinstripe suit."</p>
          <p eId="para_771">Gender bias is one of the oldest forms of discrimination.  Within living memory, our mothers - not our fathers - were forced out of the Civil Service when they married.  Equality laws were introduced in large part because we joined the European Union.  Nobody died and there were no riots in the streets when they were implemented.  Instead, a steady stream of women made its way into third level education and professions such as medicine and business.  In medicine, for example, where once a female student was the isolated exception, female students now outnumber their male counterparts.  Slowly but surely women are making their way into the top ranks; for instance, we now have a woman consultant as master of a national maternity hospital.  Better still, girls in secondary school do not have any sense that anything is shut off to them.  They are right not to care about the feminist fights of the past.  Women in earlier generations fought to hand today's young women the opportunities they take for granted and the point is they should take them for granted because women are human beings and equal citizens, full stop.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">One of the hold-out areas is the political arena.  Let me make clear that when I argue in favour of having quotas to ensure a certain number of women make it onto the ticket in each constituency, I am not arguing that the current absence of women on these tickets is due to prejudice.  It is inertia rather than active prejudice that is the largest speed bump on the road towards women's progress.  Prejudice is up front and takes many forms, from lads sniggering together over a woman's dress sense to the failure to appoint women to private boards.  It can be challenged, however, and I have done so.  Last week, Professor Brian Lucey challenged prejudice in appointments to the boards of private companies when he stated that women make decisions about high risk investments that follow a different process to the one adopted by men.  He did not argue that the process was better or worse, only that it was different.  Professor Lucey also made the point that this difference, this contrasting voice, could be useful to commercial companies.  Christine Lagarde, the director of the International Monetary Fund, put the matter more bluntly - women can be very blunt - when she stated that if we had Lehman sisters, we may not have had Lehman Brothers.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">What is at play in politics is not active prejudice but quiet inertia, a view that if one leaves the issue alone, it will fix itself in its own good time.  It is as if the imbalance in our Houses of Parliament were like a head cold, in other words, self-limiting.  According to this view, if we drink lots of liquids, the problem will be gone in a week or ten days.  The imbalance in Leinster House will not be redressed by lemon drinks but will be solved by quotas.  While quotas will not and should not change the face of Leinster House overnight, they will kick out the inertia and allow people of both genders a wider choice.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">Yeats stated, "peace comes dropping slow."  The same could be said for other things.  Change and equality come dropping slow, much too slow.  It is time to get a move on in this place, which is supposed to be a source of thought leadership for the nation.  Quotas will not bend democracy out of shape.  They will bend it into shape and will be one last step towards acknowledging the equality of half of our population.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">One of A. G. Wells fictional characters stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_776">It is our very importance that degrades us [women].  While we were minding the children they [the men] stole our rights and liberties.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">Quotas are helping minority groups claim back their rights in politics and education and deconstructing structural discrimination.  They help change cultures by forcing society to unlearn.  As a teacher and school principal, I always argued that learning adds value.  I hope and believe this Bill will begin a process of unlearning.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#HeatherHumphreys" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys</from>
          <p eId="para_778">I welcome the opportunity to speak to the Bill and commend the Minister on bringing it before the House.  The legislation addresses two long-standing issues in Irish politics, namely, the lack of female elected representatives and the issue of political donations.  As I am one of only 25 female Deputies, I will speak mainly on the impact of the Bill on promoting the role of women in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">When enacted, the legislation will require each political party to ensure at least 30% of candidates in a general election are female.  Should a party fail to meet this requirement, it risks losing half of its State funding.  The percentage of female candidates required will rise to 40% seven years after the general election at which the requirement first applies.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">Regardless of the arguments on the merits of gender quotas, the achievement of the Bill has been to get people discussing the role of women in politics.  This is a positive development in itself.  At present, 15% of Dáil Deputies are female.  That this figure is the highest percentage of female Deputies ever elected only serves to further highlight the problem.  While the introduction of gender quotas may raise the profile of women's involvement in politics, it is not the final solution to the problem.  There are no guarantees that more female candidates will mean more women Deputies.  It is ultimately a matter for members of the public to make the final decision on who they elect to serve them and I am firmly of the view that this decision should be based on a person's ability to do the job rather than his or her gender.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The role of a public representative is highly demanding.  We are on call for 24 hours per day and we must have a thick skin.  Politics has been a male dominated world and it may be a job that is not attractive to some women.  Women need to become more empowered in order that they acquire the confidence and self-belief to take on a political role.  It is clear there needs to be a significant change in attitudes if this issue is to be properly addressed.  To start this process, changes are required to the Constitution.  We are living in the 21st century, yet the Constitution still recognises a woman's place as being in the home.  Article 41.2 reads:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_782">1° In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_783">2° The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">It is all well and good discussing changes that could be made to promote women's rights and progress that has been made in this regard but the fundamental legislation governing this country still enshrines the view that a woman's role should be in the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">The words "neglect of their duties in the home" is enshrined in our Constitution, and I believe this needs to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">We are at a point in Ireland where we have had female Ministers, a female Tánaiste, two fantastic women who served as President and we currently have a women in the role of Attorney General.  Women have held some of the highest offices in this country in terms of having influence on legislation.  This is why it is astonishing that the issue of amending the Constitution has not been addressed sooner.  If we are really serious about promoting the role of women in politics, changing the Constitution seems like the place to start.  We need to make provisions so that the mother can actively participate outside the home.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">There are times in a woman's life when it may not be practically possible to serve in the Dáil, such as a nursing mother with a young baby, and a further deterrent is the fact that there is no maternity leave in place for female politicians.  Essentially, it is extremely difficult for a young female TD who is planning to have a family.  The flip side is that if a woman were to take a few months' leave when having a baby, would the public be forgiving or take that fact into consideration when the next election comes around and her constituency colleagues have used the opportunity to attend every function they can?  These are all very real obstacles which hinder the participation of women in politics.  They will not be solved by the introduction of gender quotas alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I welcome the Bill.  It has started the process to get more women involved in politics and it has focused attention on the issue of female participation in politics.  However, I again reiterate the point that we must tread carefully on this issue.  I do not believe anybody should have a rite of passage to be elected due to his or her gender, and we certainly do not want a situation to arise where we have token candidates for the sake of a party saving its political funding.  Political parties are continually trying to attract young people into politics, and I feel there is a need among political parties to put a greater emphasis on attracting young women into politics.  Perhaps we need positive discrimination at grassroots level.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">I commend the Minister on bringing forward this Bill and I urge that the constitutional convention review article 41.2 of the Constitution and give serious consideration to its appropriateness in modern Ireland.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PeterFitzpatrick" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick</from>
          <p eId="para_790">I welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill.  There are two key areas of reform.  First, there is to be a further limitation and greater disclosure of political donations to reduce influence over political parties.  Second, the promotion of greater gender parity in politics will be attempted through amending the rules of political funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">Today's Bill will provide that corporate donations of more than €200 will not be allowed unless the person meets strict conditions.  First, the person will have to provide details of memberships and shareholdings, and will have to provide each year copies of accounts and annual reports to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  These details will be included on a register to be published on the commission's website.  Each donation will have to be approved by the general meeting of the members of the corporation or body.  These provisions will apply to non-governmental organisations such as trade unions, companies, partnerships, co-operatives, societies, charitable organisations, building societies, clubs, associations and any other unincorporated bodies of persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The citizens of our country have a right to know how our political system and political parties are funded.  We all know that corporate donations need to be restricted.  It is better to have a large number of small donations, rather than a small number of large donations from a big business, which this Bill sets out to achieve.  Donations to political parties will fall form €6,348 to €2,500.  For a candidate or elected representative, the limit will fall from €2,539 to €1,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The programme for Government has made it clear that the role of corporate political donations in Irish politics must be curtailed.  We must restrict the influence of corporate donors.  In the past, we have had a close relationship between politics and business.  For example, the Moriarty and McCracken tribunals investigated payments to politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">Citizens ask me what is a donation.  A donation is defined in the Electoral Act 1997 as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_795">...any contribution given for political purposes by any person, whether or not the person is a member of a political party.  This includes a donation of money, property or goods, conferring the right to use any properly or goods, the supply of services without payment or other considerations of it, the difference between the commercial price and the price charged for the purchase, acquisition or use of property or goods, or the supply of any service where the price, fee or other consideration is less than the commercial price...a contribution made by a person to a fund-raising event...the donation is the part which attributed to the net profit deriving from the event.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Only donations for political purposes are covered by this Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The Bill also proposes to amend section 17 of the Electoral Act to use the existing public funding of political parties in Ireland to promote a greater gender balance in the Dáil.  As an incentive to encourage the selection of a greater number of women candidates, the new legislation includes a provision that political parties will face a cut of half their State funding if they do not have at least 30% women and 30% men candidates at the next general election.  At present, 15% of Members of this House are women.  The quota for 2016 is 30% and 40% for 2021.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">There are currently 25 female TDs, which is just more than 15% of the total in Dáil Éireann.  This is the highest percentage ever achieved.  At the general election held in February 2011, 86 of the 566 candidates who sought election were women, representing 15.19% of the total.  Prior to 2011, the level of female representation in Dáil Éireann never exceeded 14%.  The average across parliaments in Europe is 24%.  However, women account for approximately 50% of the population of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">I would like to take this opportunity to extend my deepest sympathies to the family and friends of the great Jim Stynes, who was a good Gaelic footballer in Dublin and represented the country in Australia.  I also commend this Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_801">The Bill is relevant today, of all days, in respect of the restrictions it seeks to place on corporate donations.  As we read the report that we have on our computers today, perhaps this Bill does not go far enough.  I know we will debate the report in full next week, but many people sat in this Chamber over the years - male and female - and they sat in local council chambers around this island, and 95% of them have served their country and their community for no other reason than to serve it.  All of us who seek to serve the public are sullied today by what is in that report.  In that context, we must look at this legislation and see if it is time once and for all to ban corporate donations.  That places a responsibility on the Exchequer to fund democracy and to fund the operation of political parties.  Perhaps that is where we need to go for a few years, as we reassess our priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I was intrigued by Deputy Humphreys's contribution.  It would reflect what I hear from people in my party who serve as councillors around the country and from people who served in this House.  They got here on their own right.  They had to fight a lot harder.  I am in two minds as to whether the issue of quotas will get people here on their own right.  We have a problem.  We have never breached the 15% mark, and we need to do so.  It was the former President of Ireland, Eamon de Valera, who described women as the boldest and most unmanageable of revolutionaries.  That is the kind of attitude we need in this Chamber and in public life at the moment.  However, we are not getting it because people are not voting or we are not putting forward enough candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">Perhaps gender quotas might be a temporary fix to break that system, but my worry is that it might be seen as a temporary fix and not address the real problem.  We have a career and a profession that is not friendly towards anybody, regardless of one's gender or age.  Perhaps those of us who are in here are so like mice running around in a cage, as it were, that we do not see that.  I am intrigued by the number of new Members elected to this House last year who see that but their desire to change the hours and pressures wanes as the Dáil term proceeds because they get sucked into that race.  We all sign up for it.  I am very honoured to be here and one deals with the job one has.  In terms of attracting different types of people to stand for public office, be it more women, young people or old people who have a great deal to give, while gender quotas might be an easy fix, if we do not change the nature of the job and the way we do our business, even if we have gender quotas, quotas for young people or quotas for older people, will those people stay in the job, having completed a five-year term and still have a passion for it in the way it is currently mixed and designed?</p>
          <p eId="para_804">The work the National Women's Council of Ireland is doing in terms of promoting and mentoring a public discussion on the nature of the job is interesting.  I am not sure if it favours a 50:50 approach.  What  Deputy Heather Humphreys said reflects what I hear from our female representatives throughout the country, namely, that they want to be here in their own right.  They are on councils in their own right because they work hard in their communities and districts.  The notion of quotas is alien to many of them, but if we need to introduce quotas to challenge those of us who in this House to change the nature of this space and the way we do our business, then we must examine doing so as a temporary fix.  That would reflect much of the opinion I hear on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">I have said what I intend to say on corporate donations.  We will have a further opportunity to examine this issue next week.  The way the legislation is designed is clunky.  We are putting in place a registration process for the smallest of donations.  If we are not going to ban them completely, which is something we should examine doing, putting all this paperwork and registration process in place is a bit of a joke.  One has to register a donation of nearly 20 cent at this stage.  We should either ban them completely or examine this kind of roundabout system of registration.  I do not believe that will change the culture we are trying to change and that I believe everybody wants to change.  The Government might review this legislation in light of what has been published today.  It might stand back from it before it proceeds to Committee Stage, do the brave thing, ban corporate donations and level the playing pitch.  However, the public needs to understand that in banning corporate donations, which is a very easy thing to do in the context of where we are at today and having regard to many reports over many years, we put the burden onto the State of funding democracy and funding the necessary work political parties have to do in terms of research, campaigning and advocacy.  That will have to be fully State funded and that is where people's taxes will go if we go down the line many people will be seeking in the next few days in reaction to what they will read today.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The legislation is interesting and challenging but in terms of corporate donations it is not bold enough.  In terms of gender quotas and changing the membership of this House, I repeat what I said about the boldest and most unmanageable of revolutionaries.  I had the privilege of being Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs for 19 months and the first Minister for labour affairs in this country was Constance Markievicz, but we seem to have set ourselves back since those days when it was virtually unheard of for a woman to serve as a senior Minister.  In the early days of the State we set ourselves very high standards and we seem to have moved back from those in many ways but particularly in this area.  If one said to Constance Markievicz today that she would be in here as part of a 30% quota, I suspect that the boldest and most unmanageable revolutionary part of her might come to the fore.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government  (Deputy Jan O’Sullivan)</from>
          <p eId="para_807">I would like to share my time with Deputy Durkan.  I note he is not in the House but if he arrives, I would like to share my time with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">I am not circulating a speech because I am speaking very much as a woman Member of this House particularly on the gender elements of this legislation.  I want to put on record that today of all days there are huge lessons to be learned in terms of the relationship between politics and big business.  The Mahon tribunal has a large number of recommendations and huge evidence of corruption in this State in the manipulation of the planning process.  As Minister of State with responsibility for planning I will very carefully examine its recommendations in terms of necessary changes to legislation and other changes.  My colleague, the Minister, Deputy Phil Hogan, and the Government will also examine its recommendations to ensure we learn lessons from this highly expensive tribunal, which has been very costly to the taxpayer but even more costly to our citizens, the political system and the country.  Today is a momentous day for politics in Ireland and we must learn lessons from the tribunal report.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">I want to speak specifically and particularly on the gender quota element of the legislation, even though the word "quota" is not used in it.  I record my satisfaction and pleasure at being a member of the Government that is introducing this legislation.  I have stood fairly and squarely behind the idea of quotas because I believe it is the only way we will get the critical mass we need to have somewhere near equal representation of the genders in the political system.  It is important we have appropriate representation from both genders in making the laws that apply to everybody in this country, to the 50% of the population that is female and the 50% of it that is male.  This is an appropriate way to do that.  The legislation is not telling the electorate that it has to vote for women.  It is simply giving the electorate the choice to vote for women, and that needs to be put on the record.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">Speaking as a woman who has been involved in politics since 1985 and having been a voter prior to that, I find it extremely offensive that there are women in this country who do not have the option to vote for a woman, particularly a woman who shares the same political views as they do.  There may well be a woman candidate in their electoral area but they may not want to vote for that woman.  I emphasise that women do not just vote for women because they are women, but women want to have the option to vote for a woman who shares their political philosophy, and that is essentially what this is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">If one checks the tables detailing gender representation in other countries, one will note that Sweden, which has 46.4% women in parliament, and the Netherlands, which has 40.7% women in parliament, have political party quotas.  Another example of success is the British Labour Party which implemented gender quotas in its party several decades ago.  They were described in a not very politically correct manner as "Blair's babes" at the time but essentially what it did was bring women into politics in Britain.  Anyone who watched the budget speech in Britain yesterday would have seen the significant number of women who are still on the Opposition benches.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">I have read about and studied this area and I am convinced that having a quota system of candidates - not forcing people to vote for women - brings up the level of participation.  I am very strongly in favour of quotas.  They do not have to last forever and they should not.  I view them as a temporary measure to ensure we bring about a level of participation that provides the type of balance that any healthy democracy requires.  Quotas were introduced internally within the Labour Party structure and we have seen the results in that we have greatly increased the participation of women in our party.  I am proud of that but we have to introduce quotas more generally and I believe that will have a positive result.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Many women are put off getting involved in politics because they perceive it primarily for men.  In every community in Ireland, however, there is a huge level of activity among women and there is no reason that activity should not be translated into participation in the political process.  The measure we are taking will greatly assist in that regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_289">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_814">I welcome the debate on this issue which has been the subject of many discussions during the years.  I do not pretend to be an expert on it, but there is a benefit to society to be gained from greater representation by women in Parliament.  It is difficult to achieve, however, because it is a difficult job and it is difficult to find the time and space to do it with other things.  That applies to men and women; it is not as simple as it looks.  There are many who presume public representation is simple and easy, but it is not.  I am reminded of the general election of 2002 when as a party we had a high number of women candidates, but we suffered losses.  In elections in which we had a high number of female representatives we did badly electorally.  It was sad to see, but that was the way it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">I am not 100% certain the quota system is the answer.  I have visited countries which have quota systems in place that seem to work well and I have seen delegations from countries, 80% of the members of which have been female.  However, it did not continue.  There is no way to presume the introduction of quotas will achieve the desired result.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">It is important to have another opinion beyond that of the male population in Parliament.  That has been proved over a number of years.  The female population thinks differently, which is good.  There are those who say with a degree of credibility that if the average woman running a household was running the country in the last ten or 15 years, we would not be where we are.  Many of my female constituents have told me repeatedly that they knew the economic model would not work because if they used it at home, they would be broke.  Realism is the reality.  Having to deal with the issues of a household on a daily basis gives the female population of the country a greater sense of responsibility when it comes to taking risks.  This is something we must all recognise.  My dealings with constituents give me a sense that if there is an inner track or Midas touch, anything will work and all that a person need do is throw the dice and things will always turn out right, but it does not work that way.  It is in that regard that women are more cautious and bringing that sense of caution to the Oireachtas would be of major importance and prove to be constructive.  The same applies to local authorities.  It goes without saying there is a need for a reasonable balance.  I am not certain that the quota system will work because it can be counterproductive, too.  Suffice it to say that, at least, the issue has been recognised and something has been done about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">We should not let the occasion pass without paying tribute to the countless women who were elected to the Oireachtas and the contribution they made and continue to make.  That should not be forgotten, especially at a time where elements of the political system are being criticised, rightly so.  We should recognise the many women who made a positive contribution in the House on behalf of women, families and the wider economy.  They deserve to be complimented.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">This issue is not the preserve of the Oireachtas.  To an extent, it applies to State bodies and Departments.  In some areas, however, it is more difficult to see in which direction the project is moving.  If we presume the Oireachtas must aspire to achieve a particular objective, we should also assume something similar should apply to all State boards, bodies and agencies and in the private sector also.  There have been occasions in both the public and private sectors when for some unknown reason, notwithstanding the ready availability of the relevant and competent cohort of women, they did not get the nod to which they were entitled with their male counterparts.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">The presumption is that everyone comes into the world equal and with nothing.  When we leave it, there is no need to bring the cheque book.  It should be recognised that there is a need for equality in the public and private sectors.  I will not touch on the banking sector, as it would be insensitive of me to deal with it after some of the problems we have encountered in recent years.  Suffice it to say, if more women had been involved in it, we might have had a different outcome.  The economy might not have collapsed to the same extent because women have a habit of applying the practicalities to all economic issues.  As society evolves, we will have more reason to benefit from this.  I hope the proposal works, but I am not certain it will.  The need is obvious but how to achieve the objective with a reasonable degree of fairness and success remains to be seen.  We must acknowledge, however, the huge contribution made by the women elected to this House, including those most recently elected.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">In serving the public, the vision and the mission might often not be the same, but the commitment is.  Those who see the option of public life as a simple and easy one should be reminded that there are no longer such options.  They do not happen anymore, and people who pretend they do or should will be sadly disillusioned.  It is hugely important that those who have served for a number of years and have seen the contribution it is possible to make should be able to help those who were more recently elected and who might find themselves disillusioned that all is not what it seemed.  All that glisters is not gold, so it is not a bed of roses.  Nevertheless, it is something in which we wish both male and female colleagues the very best of luck in the future.</p>

        <speech by="#SandraMcLellan" eId="spk_290">
          <from>Deputy Sandra McLellan</from>
          <p eId="para_821">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill and I will focus my remarks on gender quotas.  I commend the Minister on this legislation.  The introduction of gender quotas is a welcome first step towards increasing the number of female representatives in the political institutions in this State.  Sinn Féin supports gender quotas and considers them necessary if we want political reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Full and equal representation is necessary within the political structure and institutions in this country.  The evidence from other jurisdictions suggests that gender quotas deliver, and delivery is required at this juncture.  Currently, only 25 of the 166 Dáil seats are held by women.  Females have never made up more than 15% of the membership of this House, which is the current percentage.  Recent years have not been especially positive.  In the most recent general election only five more women were elected than in 1992.  This compares with an average of 24% female representation across all European parliaments.  This has been a persistent trend.  Since the foundation of the State only 91 women have served in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">Many people have fears and concerns about gender quotas and tokenism.  Research has shown that in other jurisdictions in which gender quotas have been applied their political institutions have been transformed.  In nearly all states that have introduced quotas there has been a significant increase in the representation of women.  In Sweden, 45% of members of parliament are female, in Germany it is 32% and in Norway it is almost 40%.  Research carried out by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women shows that in order for females to have a substantial influence on the decisions taken by a governing body they need occupy only one third of the parliamentary seats.  The European Parliament went further in a resolution on 18 January 2001, which refers to achieving a balanced gender representation of a minimum of 40% of each gender in parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">We must ensure there is an increase in representation of women in both the Dáil and local government.  Studies have shown that the overwhelming majority of evidence in Ireland suggests that one of the main barriers to women entering political life relates to the socioeconomic position of women in society in terms of their attitude to flexible working patterns, attitudes to sharing child care between parents and the quality and price of child care.  Research undertaken by political scientists in Ireland has found that once women are selected as candidates voters do not discriminate on gender grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">The stark reality is that although I am one of the majority outside this Chamber, within it I am just one of 25 females elected to the Dáil.  As a mother, I am well aware of the reality of what is involved in being a female politician.  One of the biggest obstacles to political life for women is child care in view of the times at which meetings are held, the time required to be dedicated to political activity, the male dominated culture of society generally, the network surrounding politics and, critically, the length of time away from one's family and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">At present, there are many issues affecting women from all socioeconomic backgrounds.  Women are the largest group of those who were excluded from the benefits of the Celtic tiger economy.  Households headed by lone parents and older women remain at high risk of poverty and structural inequalities continue to trap many women in low paid, part-time employment.  We must ensure they are given every opportunity to enter political life.  I have engaged with many different female organisations and there is much support and assistance available to ensure we achieve equal representation for women.  These organisations are extremely enthusiastic and committed to the objective of increasing women's participation in political life.  We must engage with these organisations to make progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">Every time the issue of gender quotas is debated there are strong reactions, both supportive and oppositional.  However, I urge everybody to look at the evidence.  Studies have shown that where gender quotas have been introduced, they have led to remarkable and rapid increases in women's representation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoannaTuffy" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</from>
          <p eId="para_828">I am sharing time with Deputies Anne Ferris and Ciara Conway.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">I wish to put on record my opposition to the gender quota proposals in this legislation.  My first reason for opposing the provisions is that they are very likely to be unconstitutional.  They appear to be against many provisions in the Constitution.  Second, I believe they are undemocratic and, third, I believe they are discriminatory.  Those are my grounds for objecting to the proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">The move towards introducing legislated quotas in Ireland is based on information that is basically misleading.  People have been misinformed about examples such as the situation in Sweden, as mentioned by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, and Deputy McLellan.  Most countries in the EU have not legislated for quotas, nor do they have constitutional quotas.  In the majority of countries in Europe some political parties have voluntary quotas but even in those countries it is not necessarily the norm or the majority of parties that have voluntary quotas.  Our proposed legislation has not been implemented in most countries and in countries where it has, it has been unsuccessful.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">I wish to deal with the claims about Sweden.  I have read a great deal about this.  It is often cited as an example of where quotas have worked but, in fact, quotas have never been legislated for in Sweden.  I wish to refer to a paper by Lenita Freidenvall, an academic in Sweden who is based in the University of Stockholm and is a member of the Women in Politics Research Centre.  She also carries out research on behalf of the quota project.  She obviously favours quotas but this is what she said about the Scandinavian countries and Sweden:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_832">In international literature on women in politics one finds the argument that women's political representation reached a historical and worldwide high in the Scandinavian countries - Denmark, Norway and Sweden - due to quotas....  This is, however, not quite accurate.  For instance, there have never been any constitutional quota requirements in the Scandinavian countries.  Moreover, while almost all parties in Norway have quota provisions, no parties in Denmark use them.  Furthermore, only some political parties in Sweden have introduced quotas for public election.....</p>
          <p eId="para_833">To summarise, she says the Center Party, which has enjoyed the best record in terms of the representation of women in Sweden, has never operated quotas and does not even have targets for women in politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">She points out that the real breakthrough for Scandinavian women occurred in the 1970s before the introduction of any quotas.  It has been a slow process along an incremental track.  In addition, she points out that only three out of seven parties in Sweden have ever operated gender quotas.  That is important information that has not been made available up to now.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Another misleading point being made is that the parties are somehow an obstacle to women becoming involved in politics and running for election.  In fact, however, that is not borne out by the statistics which anyone can consult, as I have done.  For example, in the 2011 general election the percentage of independent women candidates was 8.9%, or 18 of 201.  The percentage of women candidates who ran for registered political parties was 18.3%, or double the independent women's figure.  One finds that many parties ran quite a high percentage of women candidates.  For example, Labour ran 26.4%, Sinn Féin almost 20% and People Before Profit 44.4%.  The party in the Dáil with the highest percentage of women Members is the Socialist Party with exactly 50%.  That party, however, ran one of the lowest percentages of women candidates at 11.1%, or one in nine candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Parties are positively encouraging women to run for election, so there are obviously other reasons women are not putting themselves forward for election.  I have never been presented with evidence to show that women are any less likely to be selected at a selection convention than a man if they put their names forward.  Men win and lose at selection conventions, as do women.  Generally, women who put their names forward for selection conventions in political parties are very successful.  That is the factual situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">Twelve years after introducing the kind of legislation we are proposing here, France has only 19% of women members in the national parliament.  That is also the figure for women's participation in parliaments internationally, and is not much greater than what applies in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">As I have said many times, quotas are not democratic.  They do not leave it to voters at selection conventions to make up their own minds on who to choose.  Quotas try to engineer the outcome and are imposed from the top rather that from the grassroots.  It will be in the hands of the leadership to implement quotas, so they will be imposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">In addition, quotas do not suit our electoral system which involves multi-seat constituencies with individual names on ballot papers.  We do not have a list system whereby one could put 50 men and 50 women candidates on such a list.  Very often, a party might pick one or two candidates in an Irish constituency.  If a party leader decides to impose a candidate on a constituency, and the decision is to have one female and one male candidate, in practice it means that a woman who got more votes than the highest placed man in terms of the contest, would not be selected because the man had to take the place on the ballot paper, even though she would have more votes.  If she was the second placed woman in that contest, but the highest placed man was below her, she would not be selected either, even though she had more votes than the man.  That kind of discrimination often backfires and defeats the purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Swedish courts have recently ruled against quotas in universities because they have discriminated against women.  Women have had better results than men but are losing places in university courses due to the quotas that were in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">Many people would agree that if we want more women involved in politics, including running for election, we need women to become active in politics at grassroots level and have a real say.  Quotas, however, do the opposite to that by undermining participation by men and women in political parties.  They undermine democracy in political parties and give too much control and power to party leaders.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">As I have mentioned, quotas are discriminatory, blunt instruments.  Many people have said so, even those in favour of quotas.  They are an even blunter instrument in our electoral system where one cannot just decide on a quota; one must pick and choose constituencies where they are implemented.  One may be pretty sure that party leaders will not impose quotas against the men or women they want to see on the ticket.  Therefore, quotas are a blunt instrument that can be abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">This legislation enshrines discrimination in our laws.  There is currently no discrimination in our laws concerning a person's gender when they want to run for election.  Article 16.1.3o of the Constitution states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_844">No law shall be enacted placing any citizen under disability or incapacity for membership of Dáil Éireann on the ground of sex or disqualifying any citizen or other person from voting at an election for members of Dáil Éireann on that ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">However, we are making the issue of gender a factor in whether someone actually gets to run for election for a political party.  The quota system also makes an issue of one's gender, as opposed to people running as human beings.  People are being distinguished by their gender rather than working in solidarity as men and women.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">I wish to raise briefly the unconstitutional aspect of quotas.  Some years ago, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution examined the PR-STV system.  That committee was advised that measures which went further than merely encouraging parties to take positive measures with regard to female candidates would raise serious constitutional questions.  The committee felt that any measure that coerced political parties to select certain types of candidate or which imposed quotas in that regard would be unconstitutional.  It also mentioned the case of Kelly <i>v</i> the Minister for the Environment where a judgment was made on the basis that one cannot treat candidates unequally in elections.  In the legislation before us, however, State funding would be used to discriminate between candidates on the basis of their gender, which I believe is in conflict with the Kelly case.  Other people have also raised concerns about this.  It obviously affects freedom of association and makes an imposition on political parties using the State mechanism of funding in terms of what they should do in elections.  I believe this will be found to be unconstitutional.</p>

        <speech by="#AnneFerris" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Deputy Anne Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_847">The Bill is a welcome measure and I am delighted to see it before the House.  We know all too well that the link between politics and money is an unhealthy one and, therefore, the greater transparency that is brought to this matter the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">I also welcome the commitment to introduce gender quotas for political parties, because I believe that in a democracy, it is truly representative of the people.  When half of one's own country is not properly represented in this House, the laws we make and the decisions we take can be too reflective of a male dominated society.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The main tenets that form the core of this Bill are necessary and today's publication of the report by the Mahon tribunal emphasises this necessity.  It was with great dismay that I read the outcome of the tribunal whose report has been 15 years in the making.  Its 3,270 pages make for interesting, yet desperately disappointing, reading.  It is certainly true that Fianna Fáil has severely damaged the economy, but it is equally true that the body politic has been undermined by the revelations contained in the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The Mahon tribunal's report has demonstrated that Bertie Ahern failed to account truthfully for more than €165,000, which is quite incredible.  This is the same Bertie Ahern who gave the performance of a lifetime when he told his sob story on RTE, and has now been found to be totally lacking in credibility.  If this information from the Mahon tribunal had come out at the 2007 elections, I wonder how different things might have been.  A different government would likely have been elected and the responses to our economic downturn would, in my opinion, have been far better than those of the last tired Government clinging to power.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">Mr. Bertie Ahern was not the only Fianna Fáil TD who has been subject to findings in this report.  Indeed, findings of corruption have been made against several former TDs, including people like Pádraig Flynn.  I was also disturbed that members of the previous Cabinet made sustained and virulent attacks on the integrity of the tribunal's members.  The report states that "There appears little doubt but that the objective of these extraordinary and unprecedented attacks on the Tribunal were to undermine the efficient conduct of the Tribunal, erode its independence and collapse its inquiry".  Perhaps this is not unexpected, given that previous Cabinet members repeatedly stood by Mr. Bertie Ahern when the dogs in the street knew something was off in the affairs of the then Taoiseach.  I am in favour of tying political funding to the selection of female candidates at general elections.  It is unfortunate that quotas are necessary, as the idealist in me would like to see a natural 50:50 breakdown in representation.  However, given that only 15% of Members of the Dáil are women - this is an historic high - it is clear that change is needed.  Of the Members of the previous Dáil, 13% were women and before that there were even fewer.  These percentages are appalling and reasons abound for the lack of representation.  An Oireachtas study carried out in 2009 demonstrated that five Cs need to be addressed to facilitate the entry of more women into politics: confidence, child care, cash, culture and candidate selection.</p>

          <from>Deputy Ciara Conway</from>
          <p eId="para_852">I welcome the chance to speak on the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011.  However, the revelations of the Mahon tribunal have done more damage to anyone getting involved in politics than the issues addressed in the Bill.  The carry-on of the previous Government, the antics of Fianna Fáil and the relationship between big business and politics have done more to damage the participation of citizens in politics.  That needs to be stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I am a recent convert to the principle of gender quotas.  In the past I thought, along the lines of my colleague Deputy Joanna Tuffy, that if women put themselves forward, they would receive a positive response.  Within the Labour Party I have never found it an impediment to be a woman.  Since my election to the Dáil, however, I have noted the severe lack of women and their contribution.  This is reflected in some of the issues that have failed to be legislated for in the past 20 years.  Twenty years after the X case we do not have legislation to deal with an issue that pertains solely to a woman's right to her body.  Is that because women are not fairly represented in this House?  We heard on radio this morning about the horrific cases of women who had to travel to England to undergo the medical procedure of abortion.  This is an Irish solution to an Irish problem whereby women are exported and people turn a blind eye.  Is it because women are absent from this House, in which legislation is passed, that no one has the wherewithal or the gumption to tackle this issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_854">I welcome the changes in funding for political parties in terms of women being selected as candidates.  That is a positive move.  However, the Bill misses an opportunity to focus on the selection of candidates for local elections.  I served on Dungarvan Town Council for two years before being elected to the Dáil.  Although one of only nine members of a very small council, we were a hard working and effective section of local government.  Such experience is of huge benefit for a woman, as it allows a person to understand what is expected of him or her.  I am a single mother of one child who is nine years old.  As a Deputy for a rural constituency in County Waterford, it is very difficult to leave one's child on a Tuesday afternoon to come to the national Parliament for three or four days every week.  We need to do more, therefore, than look at gender quotas.  We need to look at how child care is provided and the expectations placed on politicians, not only with regard to the hours kept and the way business is done in Parliament but also in terms of the work to be done in the constituency and how it can be a seven day a week operation.  That can prove to be difficult, too.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">The Bill gives us an opportunity to look at how we can make positive changes to encourage more women to become involved in politics.  On 8 March, International Women's Day, I was asked to speak to pupils at my old secondary school in Waterford city about women involved in politics.  A recent report highlighted how women's pay still lagged behind that of their male colleagues.  Again, one has to wonder why that is?  At a certain point in their careers men forge ahead, while women seem to stay static.  The same is true of politics.  All over the country women are involved at grassroots level on local committees and in GAA and youth clubs but do not seem to want, or are not asked, to become involved in politics.  The gender quotas to be implemented under the Bill will enrich political life and offer people the opportunity to choose a female Deputy to represent them.  Of the 15 candidates who stood in the general election in Waterford, I was the only woman and I am the first female Deputy in the constituency of Waterford for 60 years.  That tells us that something needs to be done.  The Bill should be an interim measure.  We should come back in five or ten years time and see how matters have progressed.</p>

        <speech by="#SeamusHealy" eId="spk_294">
          <from>Deputy Seamus Healy</from>
          <p eId="para_856">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill.  It is opportune that today marks the publication of the Mahon tribunal report because it impinges directly on the provisions and culture of the Bill.  In 1997 the Mahon tribunal, originally the Flood tribunal, commenced its business of inquiring into the planning history of 726 acres of land in north Dublin.  Its terms of reference were extended a number of times, between 1998 and 2004.  Today, after fourteen and a half years and at a cost of several hundred million euro, we have its final report.  Its recommendations impinge directly on this legislation which deals with electoral expenditure, donations and contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The tribunal has found that corruption affected every level of political life and that former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern failed to truthfully explain the source of money.  It has rejected his evidence of dig-outs.  It has also found that the former European Commissioner, Mr. Pádraig Flynn, wrongly and corruptly sought donations from Mr. Tom Gilmartin, that the late Mr. Liam Lawlor accepted inappropriate and corrupt payments from Arlington plc and that Mr. Owen O'Callaghan paid €1.8 million to Mr. Frank Dunlop over ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">The report states that corruption affected every level of Irish political life and was allowed to continue unabated.  It also draws attention to the various attacks on the tribunal by Ministers in an attempt to undermine the tribunal and to deflect it from its business.  The recommendations and findings of the tribunal are far reaching and they must be taken into account in this legislation.  In the wake of the report I call on serving politicians who were members of the Cabinet under the former Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, to resign and retire from public life.  The report's recommendations are a devastating indictment of the conduct of political affairs in this country over a long period.  Those who served in high office in those Cabinets and who are still in public life should resign and retire from public life immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">The Bill must be withdrawn following the report's publication and, at a minimum, redrafted on the basis of the tribunal's recommendations.  I would go further than that.  I will elaborate on the matter in due course.  The Bill must be withdrawn and cognisance must be taken of the tribunal report's recommendations in the redrafting of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">It is important to put on record some of the general details outlined in the report about corruption in general.  The report outlines that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_861">Corruption, in particular political corruption, is a deeply corrosive and destructive force.  While frequently perceived as a victimless crime, in reality its victims are too many to be identified individually.  Political corruption diverts political resources to the benefit of the few and at the expense of the many.  It undermines social equality and perpetuates unfairness.  Corruption in public office is a fundamental breach of public trust and inherently incompatible with the democratic nature of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Those are strong words from the tribunal.  The report continues: "Although the tribunal recognises that corruption is most obviously a failing of individual morality, it believes that it is also a problem of systemic failure."  In other words, the operation of the political system and of public life gives rise to a culture and a ground for corruption and dishonesty.  The report further states: "The tribunal is concerned that existing conflicts of interests measures do not sufficiently identify or otherwise regulate certain types of conflict of interest."  The tribunal makes it clear that the conduct of affairs in this country in recent years is, in effect, a web of dishonesty and corruption.  That must be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Some of the recommendations which directly impinge on the Bill are important.  They deal with such issues as donations and expenditure.  It is important to read some of the report's recommendations on donations and expenditure with which the legislation deals.  The recommendations must be taken into account as a minimum in redrafting the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">On donations, the tribunal indicates at chapter 18, 1.37 that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_865">There are several difficulties with the way the political finance Acts define the term "donation", namely, as "any contribution given for political purposes".  In particular, whether or not a contribution is a political donation is dependent on the reasons the contribution was made rather than on the use to which it is put.  Moreover, several types of contributions fall within this definition including, for example, commercial loans.  The tribunal is therefore recommending that the definition of the term "donation" be amended in both the political finance Acts [such as this] so as to define a donation as "any contribution given, used or received for political purposes".</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The report outlines in chapter 18, 1.41 that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_867">The political finance Acts limit the amount of money which an individual politician, a political party, or a third party may accept from an individual donor.  The tribunal is concerned that the existing limits are too high and note that this concern is also reflected in the 2011 Bill, which lowers those limits to €2,500 in the case of donations to a political party, "accounting unit", and "third party" and to €1,000 in the case of donations to an individual electoral candidate or elected representative.  While the tribunal welcomes this proposal, it notes that at the moment, there is nothing to prevent an individual donor from giving a donation to each member of a political party and the party itself.  This could amount to a significant amount of money capable of giving rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.  Consequently, the tribunal is recommending that an overall limit be placed on the amount which an individual may give to a political party and electoral candidates or elected representatives who are members of that party.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The report continues in the same vein in a number of areas on donations and the minimum amount of donations.  In chapter 18, 1.43 the report deals with the question of expenditure between elections:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_869">The tribunal is of the view that the existing expenditure rules suffer from a number of deficiencies from an anti-corruption perspective.  First, they only cover expenditure during the electoral period.  As there are no restrictions on expenditure outside that period, they do nothing to reduce the incentive to accept corrupt funding in respect of that expenditure.  Secondly, few candidates meet the expenditure limits, which suggests that they are too high and therefore ineffective.  Thirdly, those limits do not apply to expenditure by third parties which may serve to undermine the limits applicable to electoral candidates.  Finally, they do not apply to Seanad elections [to which the tribunal says they should].</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The tribunal refers specifically to the Bill in a number of areas.  While the report welcomes some elements of the Bill it suggests that much more must be done.  The report must be taken into account in redrafting the legislation.  However, we must go further than that.  Political parties must be funded through the public purse and donations must be prohibited.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">Donations should be prohibited because the web between big business and politics has let the country down over the past number of years.  The only way to ensure that corrupt payments are not made is to ban these payments completely and to fund political parties from the public purse.  It had been said that would cost considerable amounts of money but, as we all will be aware, there are significant amounts of money being paid to political parties and individuals as we speak.  It would cost no more than the existing funding to fund political parties properly in the future and to ensure the area of donations is prohibited.  If one looks, for instance, at the party leader's allowance for the 12-month period since the Government took office, and this would be reflective of any year, the income from the leader's allowance was as follows: Fine Gael, €2.076 million; the Labour Party, €1.37 million; Fianna Fáil, €1.23 million; Independent TDs, €617,000; Sinn Féin, €944,000; the Socialist Party, €143,000; and People Before Profit, €143,000.  As we speak, there is a total of €6.24 million of funding to political parties.  The political system and political parties could be properly funded through the public purse at no additional cost over an above what is being provided by way of funding to those parties and individuals as we speak.  That is what should be done because it would stop the question of corruption in future.  As I stated, I hope this Bill will be withdrawn or at least redrafted on the basis of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal report.  I would prefer that the parties would be funded through the public purse at no additional expense.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Before I finish, I want to move on to the question of gender quotas.  Certainly, it is a welcome step in the right direction but, in truth, a minimal enough step affecting general elections only.  A number of Members have already made the point that the quotas do not deal with the question of local government elections, but maybe the Minister will abolish nearly all the local authorities and feels there is not any need for quotas in that area.  If we are introducing quotas at national level, then they should also be introduced at local level.  Many Oireachtas Members come through the local authority system and the introduction of these quotas should be done both at national and local level.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">It is unacceptable and unsustainable that one would have a situation where only 25% or 15% of 166 TDs are female when females make up more than 50% of the population.  There are wider issues as well.  Quotas, of themselves, will not fully address the situation in which we find ourselves.  Other Members referred to the Oireachtas committee report that drew attention to a number of areas.  Child care and candidate selections are two significant issues.  In particular, child care is a significant issue for women candidates who have children.  Of course, the less than family-friendly hours worked in this House and in the Seanad do nothing to ensure that there is a proper level of representation of women in the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">The culture of the political system is another area which needs to be addressed.  There needs to be a general audit of all provisions on a gender basis.  No doubt political parties should ensure that their Front Bench or, if they are in government, Cabinet would have the necessary representation of both genders.  Certainly, women have not had such proper representation in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">These gender quotas, of themselves, will not solve that problem.  There is a wider problem.  As I stated, attention was drawn to that by the committee, which reported it involved cash, child care, confidence, culture and candidate selection.  The provision is a start, but I would like to see the provision extended to local authority elections as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">No doubt there should be a general audit in this area of Government, where it appoints members to commissions, committees or public bodies of any kind, and even in the representation of females in RTE where there is a public broadcasting authority, and the representation of women on programmes in that broadcasting authority is an issue as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">I certainly welcome these quotas.  I hope they will improve the situation significantly.  It has happened in other countries.  Hopefully, it will happen here as well, but it needs to be addressed in a much more fundamental way.</p>

          <from>Deputy Regina Doherty</from>
          <p eId="para_882">This Bill includes a measure to introduce a 30% gender balance requirement for political party candidates at the next general election, rising to 40% a further seven years later, and it is this aspect on which I want to concentrate.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">The Dáil currently has 25 women TDs, which is just over 15% of the representation of Dáil Éireann.  This is the highest percentage ever achieved, but it is still a shockingly low representation of women.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">With the passage of this legislation, at the next general election political parties must select at least 30% women and 30% men or face losing half of their State funding.  Seven years from the general election where this provision first applies, this will rise to 40%.  I, for one, welcome this.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">The only argument against this Bill is that it tokenises women.  There is no tokenism in a measure that will address an issue of major concern in the functioning of Ireland's democratic system where women are significantly under represented.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">This coalition is the first Government to bring forward a meaningful proposal to increase the participation rate of women and to give them the opportunity to be candidates in a general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">More than 90 years after women in Ireland won the vote, only 15% of Deputies are women.  Clearly, there is a glaring democratic deficit.  These concerns will not be addressed and will continue until there is positive intervention enforcing parity among candidates.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">International bodies such as the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the European Union note that true democracy requires that parliaments should have gender balance.  Given the slow speed by which the number of women in politics is growing, quotas present one such mechanism.  At the same time, quotas raise serious questions and, in some cases, strong resistance.  It can be said of quotas that they are against the principle of equal opportunity for all since women are given preference over men, they are undemocratic because voters should be able to decide who is elected, they imply that politicians are elected because of their gender, not because of their qualifications, and they violate the principles of liberal democracy.  However, quotas for women do not discriminate but actually compensate for the barriers that prevent women from gaining their fair share of political seats.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">It is the political parties that control the nominations, not primarily the voters who decide who gets elected.  Therefore, quotas are no violation of voters' rights.  Quotas can contribute to a process of democratisation by making the nomination process more transparent and formalised.  Electoral gender quotas  open up "the secret garden of nominations" by making the recruitment process more transparent and formalised.  Research shows that women need to reach a critical mass of at least one third of the seats of a legislative body to be able to exert a substantive influence.  France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal all have legislation which obliges political parties to put forward a percentage of female candidates.  This Bill will bring about the balanced participation of women and men in political and public decision making.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">We know the diversity of our needs.  Women are the experts of their own lives and need to be able to voice and act on those needs.  Since women have different life experiences and prioritise issues differently, an increase in the number of women in Parliament would provide a broader spectrum of views, not just on women's matters but on all policy matters.  Numbers do matter.  Much of the detailed policy work is done in parliamentary committees.  Parliament is the place where the country's policy direction is set.  A democratic Dáil reflects the views and interests of the society from which it is drawn and allows those perspectives to shape the society's social, political and economic future.  When women are involved in all aspects of political life, including as TDs, our society becomes more equitable and our democracy is both strengthened and enhanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">The passage of this legislation will, I hope, change the face of politics forever.  In total, only 91 women Deputies have been elected since the foundation of the State and it is my privilege to be the 73rd of those.  It has been a long, hard road for us all to get here but, with initiatives such as this Bill, the road might get just a little shorter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_892">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important Bill on political reform which was identified in the programme for Government as being badly needed in this country.  I want to point to three items I find particularly welcome.  The first is that on the day the Mahon tribunal report was published, the tribunal has identified both public sector and private sector corruption across our society.  It is clear we need to address this problem and, in terms of the caps on political donations, the Bill certainly does that.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">Second, I welcome the list of lobbyists.  It is only fair that people know this information and that we have a more open and transparent democracy.  To have such lists will mean we know exactly what is happening and who is lobbying for what.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Third, while many have spoken about the cost of the tribunals, they have done us a great service in establishing facts.  I have no doubt the legal processes in this country will follow that trail and pursue where necessary.  A further point is that they have provoked Government into producing ethics legislation around our democracy, which is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">I wish to focus primarily on the gender balance provisions in the Bill.  It is a shame that, as a society, we have to intervene in this area.  We are a representative democracy but, unfortunately, one gender is not properly represented in the House where 85% of Deputies are male.  This is a significant indicator that we are not a fully representative democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">I draw the attention of the House to a number of interesting facts.  Where quotas have been introduced, they have been known to work.  For example, in Sweden, 46% of parliamentarians are now female following the introduction of quotas and the figure is 44.5% for South Africa.  It is well established that this intervention is very positive in terms of ensuring a true democracy that really works.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The various barriers have been well documented at this stage - cash, culture, candidate selection, child care and confidence.  All of these have applied to me as a woman entering the political arena.  Once we can address and recognise those barriers, we will go a long way towards addressing the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I have heard comment that many people, both male and female, are very concerned about tokenism, and I completely understand their sincere concerns around this issue.  However, we should remember there are plenty of male token candidates who are added to the ticket at the discretion of the parties to ensure they win seats.  I doubt very much that any of them lie awake at night wondering if anybody is declaring they are only token candidates.  I do not see this as being an issue.  At the end of the day, the Bill encourages the parties to have candidate quotas, not seat quotas.  In the election last year, I was the only female candidate out of 20 candidates in Laoighis-Offaly, so I know that selection is only half the battle and that a person still has to get elected.  Anybody who can get themselves elected, regardless of whether they are added on by a party, deserves the seat and should not be considered in any way as a token candidate.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">The Bill seeks to ensure that within seven years we will have 40% women candidates, which is a good target.  I believe this will only be a temporary measure.  If we have role models so that our young people can see women in all walks of life, we will certainly provide encouragement.  Reference was made to the local elections.  While I would have liked to have seen this introduced for local elections, I understand an amendment to the Electoral Act would be required.  However, Fine Gael introduced this during the last local elections for town councils and we were successful in that we not only found the candidates but they got elected.  It does work.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women refers to a critical mass of 30% to 35% female participation to ensure we have equality in society.  I acknowledge the National Women's Council of Ireland, the joint committee which produced the report in the last term of Government, the Women in Government group and the 50:50 group for the fantastic research and work they are doing to help us to encourage people to support what we are doing.  I hope we will see the first female Taoiseach in my lifetime.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulConnaughtonJnr" eId="spk_301">
          <from>Deputy Paul J. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_901">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is unfortunate we have to discuss it when all the news today is about findings of the Mahon tribunal and that we are not discussing the more positive news from yesterday in regard to the promissory notes.  Such are the revelations that have come out today, however, and such is the level of corruption that took place in regard to planning irregularities and politics that I can see why this is so newsworthy at present.  I know that issue will be dealt with in the Chamber next week, so I will not dwell on it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">How politics is funded is a key element of democracy in any country.  If a country is to function for the benefit of its citizens instead of big business interests, it is only fair and reasonable that corporate donations be discouraged in favour of individual donations and that a clear record be kept of where the money for parties is coming from.  Under this legislation, corporate donations would be severely curtailed and there would be greater openness.  People have a right to know how political parties are funded, and the measures contained in this Bill will go a significant way to increasing transparency on this matter.  The legislation significantly lowers the maximum amount of money that can be donated from a corporate source to a political party, from just over €6,000 to €2,500.  The maximum amount for a political donation by an individual is reduced from €2,500 to €1,000.  The new limits apply to Deputies, Senators, MEPs and all candidates in Dáil, Seanad and European Parliament elections.  An important element of these provisions is the establishment of a register of corporate donors.  This list will be published in order that voters know which organisations are providing funds to political parties and candidates.  The term "corporate donor" encompasses all companies, partnerships, trade unions, trusts, co-operative societies, charities, non-governmental organisations, clubs and associations.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">Efforts to introduce a more balanced political representation in terms of gender are another key aspect of the Bill.  Parties whose female candidates do not comprise at least 30% of their total at the next general election face the prospect of losing half their State funding for the lifetime of the next Dáil.  There is undoubtedly a need for greater female representation at parliamentary level.  One need only consider that the Oireachtas currently comprises 183 men and 43 women.  However, while the aims of the gender provisions in the Bill are commendable, their success or otherwise will depend on how individual parties implement the various elements.  For example, disputes could arise in a particular locality where there is a view that the right to choose a candidate is being hindered by party officials who are anxious to achieve the 30% threshold, which threshold will increase to 40% post-2019.  Such situations will not serve to bolster the number of female representatives in the Dáil or Seanad but will rather set up an artificial barrier between the genders.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">Individual donations to political parties are the best way of ensuring politics remains rooted with the people.  The caps proposed in this legislation will help to deter a "Big Donor" culture.  On the other hand, the danger with individual donations is that they may result in the wealthy being disproportionately represented.  However, the cap on private donations will limit this danger somewhat.  There are also dangers in having political parties paid solely out of the public purse.  First, it places politicians at a distance from the people and cushions them from public opinion.  Second, by providing a secure and guaranteed income, there is less thrift.  Third, and perhaps most importantly, by providing funding to parties based on the current level of representation, there is a danger of creating inertia in the political system whereby the larger parties will always remain the largest, maintain the highest degree of funding and become immune from the necessity to interact with their supporters in terms of funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">The Minister has ruled out any increase in the amount of public funding to political parties to compensate for any reductions in funds arising from the new restrictions on corporate funding.  The bottom line is that there are no extra funds to disburse in the current climate.  Forcing political parties to rely more heavily on donations from individuals will ensure that greater cognisance is given to creating a more fair and just society.  This legislation is timely, balanced and fair.  It discourages a corporate business culture in favour of representation for and by the people.  It will result in much greater transparency in regard to political funding and will help to redress the long-standing gender imbalance in representation at parliamentary level.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">I commend the Minister on tackling this long overdue legislative change and look forward to working in a more transparent and balanced political system.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanKyne" eId="spk_302">
          <from>Deputy Seán Kyne</from>
          <p eId="para_907">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill.  Other Deputies have observed that on the day the report of the Mahon tribunal is published it is timely to be discussing the issue of political funding.  Some of the activities highlighted in that report were prevalent before the representation allowance was introduced with a view to ensuring local authority members would have a more professional role.  That was a positive initiative by a previous Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">In the early years following the foundation of the State, only business owners and certain professional people were wealthy enough to participate in politics.  That remains the case in some countries today.  For example, a recent report in the United States found that more than 60% of members of Congress are millionaires.  This is reflective of the level of costs involved in funding political campaigns in that country and of keeping one's seat after it is won.  In Britain we have seen people giving donations of €1 million to political parties and subsequently receiving a peerage or knighthood.  There is plenty of evidence of that in the honours lists.  The United States President, Mr. Obama, has largely forgone the option of public funding and instead sought to fund his re-election campaign by way of individual donations.  He made great use of the Internet to that end in the last presidential election.  All of these issues must be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">There is a broad range of views in this State on the issue of political funding.  I have heard people argue that taxpayers' money should not be used to fund political parties.  Others have expressed indignation at party activists collecting money at church gates.  I have listened to arguments for the complete banning of corporate donations.  My view is that State funding is necessary, but we must ensure there is transparency in its administration.  This Bill delivers on the commitments in the programme for Government in this regard.  Anonymous donations of more than €127 are banned, foreign donations from persons with no direct link to Ireland are outlawed, and the maximum donation that can be accepted by a public representative and a political party will be just over €2,500 and just over €6,300, respectively.  These standards will ensure a greater degree of transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">On the issue of gender quotas, the majority of people agree on the desirability of a greater representation of women in politics.  The question is how that can be achieved.  In my first election in 2004 there were four candidates in my constituency, two men and two women.  In the next election there were two men and one woman and last year there was a 50:50 split.  We seem to be above the curve in Galway West, including Connemara - even though it is sometimes regarded as a conservative place - in terms of the selection of female candidates.  That is not always the case in some of the neighbouring constituencies.  In Galway East and Clare, for instance, it is my understanding that there were all-male tickets at the last election.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">My concern in regard to these proposals is that they are targeted at the next general election.  I urge political parties to consider introducing gender quotas voluntarily at the coming local government elections.  Must of us have come through the local authority system.  By ensuring we get more female candidates elected to county councils we will give them the spur to go on and take seats in a general election.  We have heard much about the prospect of token candidates.  Of course the ideal situation is that we will find women of merit to stand for political office, which I am confident we will.  There are women who are opposed to quotas on the basis of these concerns regarding tokenism.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Marcella Corcoran Kennedy, who, as chairperson of the internal justice group within Fine Gael, invited various groups to engage in discussion on this issue some weeks ago.  There are jurisdictions in which quotas have not been successful but, on balance, I agree with the principle.  I am confident they will facilitate more equal gender participation within the electoral system.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_303">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_913">As other Deputies observed, it is opportune that we are discussing this issue on the day of the publication  of the report of the Mahon tribunal.  We have not had the opportunity to study that report in detail - it will be nice bedtime reading for us all - but the headlines grab the attention in pointing to a clear rejection by the tribunal of the evidence of the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern.  It could hardly be otherwise when one considers the entirely threadbare character of that evidence.  Corrupt practices were identified on the part of Pádraig Flynn and others.  It is unfortunate that a significant number of those found guilty of engaging in corruption or corrupt practices are now dead, whereas some of those still living seem to get off more lightly.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">This report forms the backdrop to the debate on this Bill.  Its provisions have their roots in the Moriarty and Mahon tribunals, which put a spotlight on the correlation between big business and the political establishment and political decision-making process.  These measures are being put forward in part as an attempt to deal with that.  One must recognise the points made by the Taoiseach approximately one year ago, when he stated the Government was committed to the most comprehensive programme of political reform since the 1930s.  Clearly, this measure falls well short of that objective and would comprise only a tiny piece of that entire agenda.  The link between big business and politics and the practice of money buying influence in Irish politics has existed since the foundation of the State and goes far beyond any of the measures that are identified in this Bill, allegedly to curtail it.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">Such practices have been evident since the 1960s in particular.  While much attention justly has been given to the carry-on of former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, in the past, in many ways what he did was to take the situation to a new level.  The practice of buying political favour was in existence well before that and I refer to the obvious example of the infamous Fianna Fáil Taca fund-raising organisation in the 1960s.  Monthly meetings for top construction companies were organised to gain access to Ministers, in return for a bite to eat and the hand-over of a couple of wads of cash and so on.  Such absolutely reprehensible practices were contributed to by companies such as McInerney, Sisk, Gallagher and so on, which, in the years of the boom came to dominate the skylines in respect of construction.  It was not an accident that while those dinners were taking place and this money was changing hands, the Government sat on the findings of the Kenny report and refused to implement reports to control the price of building land.  This inaction, more than 30 years ago, has led to the crisis we now face, the price of which now is being borne by hard-pressed homeowners, people living in sharply constructed dwellings and so on, as well as the taxpayer who is bearing the consequence of the overall debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">We are the ones who are paying these bills because, despite the disbandment of Taca when its existence became common knowledge, the practices continued thereafter by Fianna Fáil in particular although obviously not exclusively.  Fine Gael has had its own problems in this regard, some of which were identified in the Moriarty tribunal, such as the carry-on of former Fine Gael member, Deputy Lowry, and so on.  The only difference is Fine Gael probably was not in power for long enough to have sufficient favours to offer and perhaps did not appear as often in consequence.  However, even the Labour Party was trying to get in on the act.  I recall the infamous incident during the 1990s when that party offered dinner at £100 per head to gain access to Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the then Minister for Finance.  The Labour Party was of course obliged to back off because of the negative publicity but it was considering such a measure, thereby aping the conduct of the other parties at the time.  This is not to mention the pristine Progressive Democrats, who were found to have a skip-load of documents when the party conducted a spring cleaning of its head office, only for the paperwork to end up in the hands of the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>.  The paperwork revealed a ten-year period of massive political donations to the Progressive Democrats from the likes of Larry Goodman, P. J. Hayes of Waterford Glass, PJ Hegarty &amp; Sons, builders, Irish Distillers, Irish Continental Bank, Martin Naughton of Glen Dimplex, John Sisk &amp; Son, Cement Roadstone, Stokes Kennedy Crowley, Arthur Cox &amp; Co, solicitors, Fyffes, GPA etc.  It reads like a never-ending list.  At the time, Mary Harney stated these moneys never had any interest or impact on decisions to privatise economic policy, which is complete and utter nonsense.  The dogs on the streets know it is nonsense and needed neither the Mahon nor the Moriarty tribunals to show this.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">This is because historically, the political establishment in Ireland has been bound by a thousand threads to big business and money interests within this society.  One needs only to consider what happens to Ministers, once they resign or end their political lives in the Dáil.  In a number of cases, a practically seamless transition is evident from the Dáil Chamber onto the boards of companies all over the place.  While Members could spend the entire afternoon going through them, it is important to put on record a flavour of some such transitions.  Charlie McCreevy was appointed to the board of Ryanair, with a payment of £57,000 at the time.  Bertie Ahern stood down in 2008 and left behind a legacy of disaster for the people to shoulder, including massive unemployment and a crippled economy.  He swanned onto the board of Parker Green International, an international property company, and is chairman of the Swiss-backed International Forestry Fund where he now plays a role in its efforts to get its hands on our State forests.  He also is on the board of other international companies.  Incidentally, it is not only Irish politicians who benefit in this way, as Tony Blair landed a £2.8 million advisory role with the investment bank JP Morgan and so on.  Former Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald was on the boards of hedge funds, while Albert Reynolds chaired Bula Resources and John Bruton was on the board of Ingersoll Rand.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Ministers for Finance are particularly in vogue and Ray MacSharry ended up on the boards of Eircom, Ryanair, Bank of Ireland, Irish Life and Permanent and London City Airport, as well as that of John Magnier's organisation and so on.  Alan Dukes, David Andrews, Joe Walsh and Dick Spring were appointed to the boards of Anglo Irish Bank, AIG, Bank of Ireland and Eircom, respectively.  Tom Parlon went straight from the Dáil to become director general of the Construction Industry Federation.  The list goes on and on and really demonstrates a web that historically has tied wealthy interests in Irish society to the political establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">The idea of State funding is put forward as a solution to this connection.  However, I consider this to be far too much of an innocent solution to what is an endemic problem.  It is not a solution to the overall problem and I note that all the rules concerning standards in public office, ethics and so on have not changed what has happened.  The amount being spent on elections has, if anything, risen but it simply is managed in a different way.  All Members will have observed many candidates in their respective constituencies spending huge amounts of money in advance of elections being called and so on.  Such candidates might put up billboards on people's private lands without declaring such expenditure, without getting its equivalent monetary value and so on.  In principle, I am opposed to State funding of political parties and the taxpayer should not foot the bill in this regard.  However, while the system is in place, there is no doubt that it most definitely should be operated on the same basis for everyone, that is, on the basis of a level playing field.  Sadly, the present system does not do this.  It clearly favours those who already are in power.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">This is an absolute fact and if Members contemplate serious reform, they must address some of these issues, including salaries for Deputies, Ministers and so on.  The original idea behind paying people to work in Parliament in Britain was that it was meant to facilitate working-class representatives to take their seats in Parliament.  Obviously, what has happened subsequently is that it has become a highly lucrative career for many people, as well as an enticement into public life that is unacceptable because it is out of kilter with the average industrial wage and the average living conditions of ordinary people.  It may be one reason there is such a disconnect between what happens in this Chamber and the real world outside, because most people who dwell in here do not live a normal lifestyle in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">I wish to deal in particular with two aspects of the Bill under discussion.  I refer to the question of trade union donations and the issue of gender quotas for political parties with candidates.  As for the first issue regarding trade unions, I fundamentally object to the bracketing and comparing of trade unions with private companies that donate to political parties.  It is not in any way the same thing.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#ClareDaly" eId="spk_305">
          <from>Deputy Clare Daly</from>
          <p eId="para_923">Trade union donations effectively are an amalgam of very small donations from a union's members.  Individual amounts from the aforementioned members would fall well below the ceiling for any individual decorations that it would be necessary to make in the course of a single year.  It is clear this is different to the case of a wealthy individual or company making a donation and seeking a favour in return.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">I refer to words and slogans that have been termed retail or wholesale corruption.  All Members are aware of the instances that have taken place and which have been referred to in the Mahon tribunal report and so on.  There have been examples of what is known as retail corruption, whereby a specific donation or bribe is made to a party or politician in return for that politician or his or her party voting a particular way or introducing a particular legislative item.  A Deputy and former Minister in my own constituency was obliged to resign as a result of such behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">There is another type of more wholesale corruption on the part of pro-capitalist parties - in the main these are the big business parties - which is more common but in the context of which direct exchanges of X amount of money in respect of Y decision do not necessarily take place.  This kind of corruption involves buying influence, having an impact on ideologies and policies etc.  The position in this regard is not similar to that which obtains in respect of the trade union movement.  The link to trade unions developed in a much different way and their relationships with political parties are also entirely different.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The trade union movement in Ireland and Britain arose as a response to the development of capitalism and capitalist industry.  That development took place in both countries against a backdrop where two parties - the Conservatives and the Whigs or Liberals - were in direct competition for power and were basically two sides of the same coin.  In the struggle for better wages and conditions, the trade unions initially allied themselves to the Liberal Party.  That was their original stance because they saw the Liberals as the lesser evil.  However, a debate took place within the movement and over time it was decided that the unions needed political representation of their own in order that the needs of working class people might be catered for.  That was very much the basis on which James Connolly and Jim Larkin established the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and its political wing, the Labour Party, almost 100 years ago.  For Connolly and Larkin, without political representation the union movement was fighting with one arm tied behind its back and they believed there was a place for political representation for ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">If one considers the sacrifice these two individuals and others like them made 100 years ago in the context of the absolute scandal relating to the contributions being made to the Labour Party in the name of defending workers' rights, one comes to the conclusion that the latter is a nonsense.  We are, after all, aware of what the Labour Party is doing in government.  To this day, Labour continues to obtain contributions from SIPTU, Unite and other unions.  Many SIPTU members are completely unaware that a percentage of the fees they pay goes towards funding the Labour Party.  They will be horrified to discover this.  On foot of the role the Labour Party has played, I strongly encourage SIPTU members who pay the fees to which I refer to investigate the position and then complete the form necessary to stop the relevant deductions being made from their union fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">I am not stating that the principle of political funding and that of people who are members of trade unions being entitled to fund a representative or representatives of their choice should be abandoned.  In my opinion, this entitlement should be defended because it is incredibly important.  There is a need for political representation for ordinary working people.  A debate is taking place within the trade union movement in respect of this matter.  In that context, it should not just be a case of putting a stop on the money being paid to the Labour Party.  A discussion should take place within the trade union movement in respect of how people might contribute to parties and candidates who advance the cause of the movement.  In that sense, I do not believe we are comparing like with like.  The measures in the legislation do not represent a step forward in this regard.  However, neither I nor many other workers will shed any tears with regard to the Labour Party losing access to its funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">Another issue in respect of which work must be done is that of gender quotas.  The Bill contains a very weak provision in this regard.  There is no doubt that there a major problem in the context of the participation of women in politics.  The CSO's figures for last year reveal that women are completely and utterly under-represented at every level of the decision-making process.  It is not just the fact that only 15% of Deputies are female, fewer than one third of the members of State boards and one fifth of the members of local authorities are women.  In addition, women comprise just over one third of the membership of VECs.  That is an absolutely scandalous situation but it is not unique.  The average female representation in the national parliaments of EU member states is only in the region of 25%.  That is pretty pathetic.  This problem is not just limited to Ireland, although there are issues which make the position here perhaps slightly worse than in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">As previous speakers indicated, where quotas were introduced, for example in France, the situation with regard to the participation of women has not improved.  In countries such as Denmark, where there are no quotas, there is a much higher level of female representation.  Other Deputies have probably alluded to the fact that when one considers the number of women who put themselves forward for election as independent candidates, it is obvious that the position is not dramatically different from that which obtains in respect of political parties.  It is clear that imposing a measure on just those parties is taking an extremely simplistic approach to the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_931">People who use the term "tokenistic" are not demeaning the women candidates who might be selected, they are, rather, referring to the fact that the relevant measure in the Bill is tokenistic in nature.  Let us be honest, this is something of a sop which was put forward to offer the illusion that the Government is doing something positive to improve women's access to politics.  It is being offered at a time when the Government has probably adopted more measures that are anti-women than was the case with any of its predecessors.  In this regard, I refer to the vicious attacks on the lone parent and carer's allowances and to the various measures which have hit women on both the double and the treble.  One cannot engage in such attacks and then inform women that they can put their names on the ballot paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">There is a major difficulty with regard to the participation of not just women but also ordinary workers in politics.  I refer here to manual workers or, for want of a better term, ordinary people.  The composition of this Dáil is wholly unreflective of society at large.  It is also extremely unrepresentative.  I like to believe that the adage to the effect that women have a great deal more sense is at least partly true.  Who would want to be one of the handful of Deputies present in an almost empty Chamber this afternoon ready to make a contribution in a prearranged slot, particularly when the Government has a built-in majority and the outcome of any vote is known in advance?</p>
          <p eId="para_933">If we are to discuss real participation, then we need real and participative democracy.  Such democracy must begin at local level.  The way politics is organised now, most people who become Members of the Dáil begin their journey with their local authorities.  The problems exist at local authority level and there are no measures in place to address these.  There is a need to stand the political system in this country on its head.  We must consider taking a more locally-based, bottom-up approach that will allow people a real say in respect of both their communities and their lives.  The reality is that in communities and at local level it is women who are to the fore in respect of campaigning on many issues.  This must be reflected in the decision-making process.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">I am of the view that the very limited provision contained in the Bill is not going to have any impact whatsoever.  This provision does not even make sense and it misses one important point, namely, that gender is no guarantee of anything.  This was very well highlighted by certain Members who referred to what the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, stated when in opposition in respect of last year's budget.  The Minister indicated that the problem with that budget was that there were not enough women in government.  When she took the helm in her own Department, however, she visited even more severe cuts on women and children than did her predecessors.  Gender is no guarantee.  There are many men on this side of the House who would defend the interests of women much better than any woman who would stand for election as a member of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael and who would implement policies that are anti-women.  I do not believe the measures contained in the Bill will improve the situation.  What we need is a system of positive encouragement in order that more women will take on the roles to which I refer.</p>

          <p eId="para_940">I will use the two minutes available.  Deputies Clare Daly and Higgins have, on many occasions, lectured us on the position regarding the workers versus the capitalist parties in this country.  The Deputies inform us that they only take the average industrial wage out of what they are paid and that the remainder of their State salaries are transferred into party funds.  I often wonder whether this is ethical and whether the procedure involved is correct.  I am of the opinion that what is being done is this regard is wrong.  Deputies Clare Daly and Higgins should practice what they preach in this regard.  They are, after all, pumping taxpayers' money into their party.  That is neither correct nor proper.</p>
          <p eId="para_941">At a time of increased public accountability, the Bill will hopefully make the position in respect of political funding more transparent.  The perception that politics is not so much about democracy as it is about big business needs to be replaced as a matter of urgency and a system of total transparency must be introduced.  I welcome the fact the Bill goes some way towards achieving this.  I do not doubt that intention.  This Bill will ensure mechanisms are in place to remove the power of large political donations, which can and have been used to influence outcomes.  There is something surreal about such actions, which have the scent of the sort of corruption associated with cinema and television serials.  However, corruption of this kind has no place within the political sphere, be it on a party or individual basis.  It goes without saying that in the Ireland of 2012, transparency in every facet of government is the basic right of the electorate, which has put us all here.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">The Minister referred to the input of the Council of Europe group against corruption, and this legislation will take on board its recommendations, along with those of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The main proposals from both groups recommended that consideration be given to lowering the current disclosure threshold for political donations.  Recommendations made by the Moriarty tribunal, published last year, will be also responded to.  It is amusing, in these circumstances, to consider the yardstick used by the Minister to decide that this legislation is long overdue.  He mentioned that amounts referred to in previous legislation, the Electoral Act 1997, are given in punts.  One would almost wonder if the term should be explained to younger Members; one of those Members, Deputy Harris, is on my left.</p>

            <from>Deputy Simon Harris</from>
            <p eId="para_945">I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise in the House this afternoon this important matter and I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, for being here for the debate.  Next week in the House we will discuss extensively the issue of political fraud, and we will read much about it today.  I want to focus on a different fraud element which is seeing significant growth with the increase in the use of Internet and on-line purchasing.  This specifically concerns card-not-present fraud, commonly known as CNP fraud.  This is an increasing problem for Irish companies seeking to remain profitable, to protect jobs, to reach new markets and to grow a business.  If a consumer is affected by CNP fraud - often referred to as ATM skimming - as I was this time last year, he or she is entitled to a refund from the bank or credit card company.  When my card details were skimmed I got a phone call from the bank to say a suspicious transaction had been identified in Brazil; I was in Ireland and had never been to Brazil and the bank, correctly, stopped the payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">There are no such protections, however, for retailers.  Businesses do not get reimbursed for merchandise sent to fraudulent customers.  The payment for these products are often flagged after the event and by this time the items will have been shipped and the retailer is usually left out of pocket.  In my case the purchase in Brazil was stopped by the bank but there is no evidence as to whether the criminal activity continued or if the criminal managed to buy other goods.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">I acknowledge that the Garda bureau of fraud investigation does excellent work in Ireland on CNP fraud, offering comprehensive prevention advice.  However, the feedback I have from a large number of retailers in this country is that the bureau is under-resourced and lacks the equipment to follow up fully when crimes of this nature occur.  I understand fully the pressures on An Garda Síochána currently and this is by no means a criticism of the excellent work it does.  It is about assisting the Garda and providing the required tools.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">Fraudsters are well aware of the points of weakness in the current system and frequently change patterns and delivery addresses to avoid detection.  We must strengthen the preventative measures supporting retailers in tackling card fraud.  This does not need to be a significant burden on the State and our already overstretched resources.  Other countries, including the United States, the UK and most of mainland Europe have introduced what is known as address verification systems.  This allows retailers to do a live check to ensure the person using the card knows the address to which the card is registered.  This significantly inconveniences criminal elements looking to conduct on-line transactions as it is not enough to simply have the details of a card, as in most circumstances the card address is not readily available from the card.  Checks of this nature can support retailers without an undue burdening of either State resources or individual consumers.  Items can be still shipped to addresses other than those linked to the card but there are additional checks in place to ensure the transactions are legitimate.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">There is a real opportunity to support retailers through the introduction of a similar address verification system for Irish transactions.  It is not good enough that we do not have it in this country when so many international competitors throughout Europe, the US and our near neighbours in the UK have it.  At a time when the Government is sending out a very strong and important message encouraging businesses to reach out to new markets to grow business, internationalise and export, it is important that we send out a clear message from this House and from the Government that we will do everything possible to support companies, to end fraud and to help firms to be profitable and to create jobs.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health  (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_950">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which I am taking on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter.  It is a fact that much of our daily business is now carried out on-line, whether as a retailer seeking to exploit the vast market that is available on-line or as a consumer seeking best value.  We have quickly come to appreciate the many benefits of doing our business on-line but we have also had to become increasingly alert to the pitfalls against which we must protect ourselves, including the risk of stolen identity to effect payment card fraud on-line.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">Retailers and card issuers will be particularly alert to this form of fraud and the losses to be borne.  That there is neither the presence of the card nor the cardholder, and that a personal identification number is not used, means transactions carried out on-line, generally referred to as card-not-present transactions, clearly present an added risk.  The Minister understands that the Irish Payment Card Services Organisation, IPSO, estimates that such fraud now represents more than 64% of all fraud carried out on Irish payment cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">The Minister is sure the House will appreciate that the issue raised cannot be addressed solely through the apparatus of the criminal justice system.  It also requires businesses and industry to take a proactive role in ensuring that the operation of payment services systems are secure and that best practice in doing business on-line is promoted to the greatest extent possible to ensure greater protection.  The Garda bureau of fraud investigation, GBFI, for its part, regularly offers crime prevention advice with regard to card-not-present fraud as crime trends in this area demand or necessitate, with information provided to alert retailers, industry and the public in general.  In addition, initiatives targeting those involved in this type of criminality are frequently undertaken by GBFI.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">The payment card and counterfeit currency unit, PCCCU, at GBFI is the designated national unit with primary responsibility for the investigation of payment card fraud in all its guises.  Members of the PCCCU work closely with Europol and other European and international law enforcement agencies in targeting groups involved in this type of criminality.  Such exchanges of intelligence assist in the targeting of those engaged in this type of criminal activity across jurisdictions.  Nationally, the PCCCU liaises directly with the industry through IPSO and the Irish Banking Federation.  The PCCCU also works in close association with the national crime prevention office in raising public awareness and delivering crime prevention advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">The GBFI, together with the card payments industry, continues to promote the use of security features as outlined by the Deputy, including authentication systems among on-line retailers as a proven tool to reduce both losses and risks to the retailer.  In the current economic climate, the effect of losses incurred by retailers through on-line card fraud will be further accentuated.  There is an onus on retailers to be proactive in this regard and to ensure they avail of all the security and fraud prevention methods that are available.  Although not obligatory, the industry has provided solutions through a number of security features and authentication systems that are available to the business community.  The idea of a consumer having to provide an address is a very worthwhile security procedure.</p>

            <p eId="para_957">I thank the Minister of State for her comprehensive response which provided a good overview of the excellent cross-agency work that is being done.  While I recognise again that good work is being done by business, the banks and the Garda Síochána, we need to take the next step.  The Minister of State referred to the White Paper on fraud which is being produced.  I would appreciate if she could pass on the feedback I am delivering on behalf of retailers on the issue of the address verification system.  We run the risk of making this issue excessively complicated.  A simple technique used in the address verification system works in a number of other countries, including among our competitors.  I welcome the Minister of State's acknowledgement that any losses experienced by businesses through fraud are even more painful at present because they are fighting for survival and to retain and create jobs.  I ask, therefore, that the Department give extensive consideration to the address verification system.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_958">I agree that we run the risk of making this issue excessively complicated.  We are all aware of certain identifiers that are used, for example, prompts to confirm one's address or the maiden name of one's mother.  These are simple ways of providing protection.  People should note that 64% of fraud now takes place online and they should be extremely careful when using credit cards.  I accept that banks have become much more alert about card and identity theft and take a proactive approach to informing customers about fraud.  This also needs to be appreciated.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaraConway" eId="spk_319">
            <from>Deputy Ciara Conway</from>
            <p eId="para_959">I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, is present to discuss this issue, on which I have spoken previously.  I felt compelled to raise this matter because of the latest report issued by the Health Service Executive which makes very worrying reading.  The report shows that almost 250 people aged under 18 years were waiting more than 12 months for mental health services at the end of last year.  Demand for services have also increased with referrals to child and adolescent mental health services more than 10% higher in 2011 than in the same period a year earlier.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">Under the welcome targets introduced for the child and adolescent mental health teams, 70% of people referred to the service are to be seen within three months.  Unfortunately, however, this target is not being met and while the figures are improving, current outcomes are not good enough.  A cohort of young people aged between 16 and 18 years fall between two stools because they do not come within the remit of child and adolescent services and are sometimes misplaced in adult services.  In some cases, children are detained in adult psychiatric hospitals.  I hope this practice will be brought to a definitive end over the lifetime of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">I do not need to tell the Minister of State that a year is a long time in a child's life.  Children are being left to cope with difficulties that can hold back their normal development and impact significantly on their education, childhood and future well-being.  If they do not receive the services they badly need during this key window in a time of need, it can have serious repercussions for their future development.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">In 2011, Barnardos prepared a children's budget in which it noted that community mental health services were slow to recruit staff.  I ask the Minister of State to explain the reason for this.  In 2010, the child and adolescent mental health service teams had only 41% of the recommended staffing complement.  It is shocking that they have less than half the recommended staff level.  As of November 2011, some 61 teams were in place nationwide and the resources available for the services were inadequate.  The lack of inter-agency co-operation between the child welfare services and juvenile justice system means that highly vulnerable young people continue to slip through the cracks and many opportunities for intervention are missed.  As the Minister of State is aware, the earlier the intervention takes place, the better the outcome and the better the life chances for the child in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">For children living in poverty, access to health care services is hindered by lengthy delays and insufficient resources.  Many children wait up to one year for crucial services such as speech and language therapy and developmental checks.  I am saddened that child and adolescent mental health services have joined this list.  My former colleagues in Barnardos have highlighted circumstances in which children presenting with suicidal thoughts were placed on waiting lists for an appointment with a member of the local mental health team for up to two years.  Two days or two weeks can be an eternity for someone in such circumstances, especially a child or young person.  A significant improvement is required in this area.  This is especially true when one considers that the suicide rate in Ireland for those aged between 15 and 24 years is the fourth highest in Europe.  We must all be cognisant of this.</p>

          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_320" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health">
            <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_964">I recently met Dr. Brendan Doody, the director of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  I was highly impressed by Dr. Doody and do not have any reason to doubt the information he provides.  He gathers information on mental health that is not gathered by anyone else.  Despite the fact that our child and adolescent mental health service is new, he has gathered information on the service which we do not have for the adult mental health services that have been in place since God was a boy.  He receives this information every month.  If only we had similar information in areas such as disability, Travellers and so forth as we would have an incredible service and would know where to direct funding.  This has been a difficulty in the delivery of services in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">I thank Deputy Conway for raising this issue in which she has shown a strong interest.  Child and adolescent mental health services need focus.  Against a backdrop of reducing resources and increased demand for services, reflected in an increase in child and adolescent psychiatric referrals of almost 10%, the Health Service Executive succeeded in reducing the child and adolescent waiting list by more than 21% in 2011.  This clearly highlights the fact that in mental health we are facing the challenges presented and we can and will continue to make improvements and do more with less.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">Key to the development of child and adolescent mental health services is the establishment of multidisciplinary teams, of which 61 are currently in place.  In that regard, I was pleased to announce a special allocation of €35 million for mental health as part of budget 2012 in line with the programme for Government commitments.  Funding from this special allocation will be used primarily to strengthen community mental health teams in both adult and children's mental health services by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.  Approximately 400 additional staff will be recruited to support these initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">The Deputy drew attention to the 241 children who have been waiting for more than 12 months for an appointment at the end of 2011.  I note this is a reduction of almost 29% on the number waiting at the end of 2010.  I assure the House that all referrals received by the child and adolescent mental health service are screened and those deemed urgent are seen as a priority, while those deemed to be routine are placed on a waiting list.  I am anxious that children are seen as quickly as possible.  For this reason, the national service plan 2012 includes targets that 70% of all new and re-referred cases will be offered a first appointment and seen within three months and no child will wait longer than 12 months for an appointment.  I am confident that with the additional resources provided to the child and adolescent service from the special allocation of €35 million, these targets can be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">As Minister of State with responsibility for mental health, I am committed to ensuring the implementation of A Vision for Change.  In this context, I am particularly keen to advance service provision for young people.  The data shows the HSE made considerable progress in the delivery of child and adolescent mental health services in 2011.  I will do all I can to ensure this momentum is maintained in the current year.</p>

            <from>Deputy Ciara Conway</from>
            <p eId="para_969">I thank the Minister of State for her response.  We need to see joined up thinking in trying to tackle this problem, because it is not something that rests solely at her door.  We need to see greater integration of services between the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills, in order to meet the psychological and emotional needs of our children.  This is particularly the case for the most vulnerable group in the 16 to 18 year old bracket.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">I welcome the advances that have been made in tackling the waiting times for young people with mental health difficulties.  I congratulate the Minister of State, in these very harsh economic times, in being able to secure €35 million for the progression and the further investment in what is a vital component of our health system, namely, the mental health services.  I thank her for her response and I look forward to working with her to advance further the needs of our most vulnerable people.</p>

            <p eId="para_971">One of the most startling things we have managed to do is to ring fence that money.  However, the money in itself would have been useless if we did not manage to get the 414 posts as well.  That is what is going to be important.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">We are about to reach our target this year in respect of the increase in bed capacity for child and adolescent services, with the opening of eight new beds in Cork, Galway and Dublin, and the 40% decrease in admissions of children to the adult psychiatric services.  The compound distress of having one's child admitted to an adult psychiatric unit must be unbearable.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">Every single multidisciplinary team will now have one person from each profession.  That will be crucially important because until now, I kept hearing that we had 126 multidisciplinary teams or 61 multidisciplinary teams in respect of child and adolescent services, but when we dug deep, we found that they might consist of a psychiatrist and a psychiatric nurse.  Having one of each profession in that multidisciplinary team will have the type of effect that we all want.  I thank the Deputy for raising this.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_974">At the outset I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important matter.  I also thank the Minister for Finance for coming into the Chamber to reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_975">It is fair to say the Minister caught us all unawares last night with his statement in the House, giving us a progress report on the Government's efforts to renegotiate the planned repayment of €3.1 billion at the end of this month in respect of the IBRC promissory note.  I hope he takes the opportunity today to clarify the status of that matter right now.  I am aware that it was considered by the governing council of the ECB at its meeting this morning.  No statement was issued at the conclusion of that meeting and I understand that technical talks are to resume again.  Perhaps the Minister might update the House on where the matter stands today, following that particular governing council meeting.  Can the Minister say whether he is confident at this stage that a deal can be concluded in advance of the repayment date at the end of the month?</p>
            <p eId="para_976">The outline of the deal that he described last night is certainly promising.  It is a sign of a breakthrough and it is the first indication of some level of flexibility on the part of the European Central Bank on restructuring this promissory note.  Its real value is if it is an interim step towards an overall settlement which will ultimately result in a reduction of the debt burden facing the Irish people in respect of legacy bank debt.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">Can the Minister clarify some details of what he outlined to the House last night?  How would the process work if such a deal is finalised?  What he suggested appeared to relate solely to the repayment due at the end of March 2012.  Can he confirm if that proposal represents a template for the overall deal he is hoping to achieve?  In other words, will the repayment due at the end of March 2013 fall due for repayment under a Government bond in 2026, the 2014 payment in 2027 and so on?  Or is the deal that he outlined last night merely an interim measure, pending the overall deal that he is trying to negotiate?  Can he take us through the mechanics of how that would work?  The bond he is issuing to IBRC under this proposal will presumably attract an interest rate.  Will that be comparable to the interest rate currently being quoted on the secondary markets, or will it be an interest rate on a par with what Ireland is currently being charged as a programme country?  I assume the cash outflows under such an arrangement would be that the full €47 billion would still be paid, but also that there would be an interest payment in respect of the Government bonds he is proposing to issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">Most people watching will be interested to know the impact this deal, if successful, will have on future budgets, on the general Government deficit and on general Government debt levels for Ireland.  The interest payments which were due from next year onwards were to be factored into the general Government deficit.  If this deal is secured, how much easier does it make the achievement of the fiscal targets in 2013 and beyond?  I would be grateful if the Minister could address those points.</p>

            <p eId="para_979">During the course of 2009 and 2010, it was determined that Anglo Irish Bank Corporation Limited and Irish Nationwide Building Society, now together known as Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, required significant additional capital.  Of this capital, a total of €4.1 billion was provided in the form of equity, or special investment shares for INBS, and a total of €30.6 billion in the form of capital contributions.  The consideration provided by the State for the equity was cash and for the capital contribution was promissory notes.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">The promissory notes are effectively an IOU to Anglo Irish Bank and INBS.  As there was a debt from the State to the institutions, there was an associated interest charge.  This interest rate was set by reference to Government yields at the date that each tranche of the promissory notes were issued.  The interest rate had to be referenced from Government yields to ensure the promissory notes were booked at full value as an asset on the IBRC balance sheet, without the need for additional capital.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">When the final capital contribution was provided on 31 December 2010, an interest holiday was inserted into each of the promissory notes which meant that between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2012, no interest was payable.  Absent the interest holiday, the weighted average interest rate on these promissory notes would have been 5.8%.  However, as a result of the insertion of the interest holiday, the weighted average interest rate from 1 January 2013 is around 8%.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The Government has been committed to reviewing the arrangements that were put in place to capitalise IBRC.  The purpose of this review is to determine if there was a way to reduce the overall cost to the State.  The troika has been engaged in a process with Irish officials to produce a common paper which will consider all options for re-engineering the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate payable and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">In tandem with this review, the troika has opened a discussion on how best the Irish banking system and the State can benefit from having further improvements made to certain elements of the banking sector.  The overall purpose would be to enhance the position of banks in which the State has a major investment.  A number of approaches are under consideration, but it must be emphasised that nothing is agreed at this point.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">As already indicated, I have met with Commissioner Rehn and with Mr. Mario Draghi, President of the European Central bank, in this regard.  The matter has also been discussed at every opportunity and at various levels in the European arena.  As soon as the technical discussions are concluded and the joint paper is available, a more formal and structured approach will be adopted to ensure political support.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">The discussions with the European authorities on the general issue continue but we are now negotiating with the EU authorities on the basis that the €3.06 billion instalment due from the Minister to IBRC on 31 March 2012 could be settled by the delivery of a long-term Irish Government bond of equivalent fair value.  This settlement process does not involve the variation of any of the terms of the existing promissory notes.  The key benefit of these proposals would be to reduce by €3.06 billion the 2012 cash outflow from the State through settling with the delivery of a long-term Government bond.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">While this development in relation to the March payment would be positive, we must keep our eye on the greater benefits that would derive from the re-engineering of the promissory note and the potential improvements for the continuing banking sector which could also stem from the ongoing technical discussions.  It is for these reasons that we must look at the recent developments as an initial step to facilitate a project where, if we are successful, it would be in the medium term rather than immediately.</p>

            <p eId="para_988">I thank the Minister for his reply and I understand he feels somewhat constrained in putting further information into the public domain but there are certain things he can confirm.  Can he confirm that the deal, which he outlined last night, is in effect a stepping stone towards an overall deal rather than a deal on a stand-alone basis, in other words, that he is trying to park the 2012 payment, pending a conclusion of the overall discussions on the redesign of the promissory note?  He could at least confirm that much.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">Following the governing council meeting today - I expect the Minister had hoped it would have signed off on this deal but it did not - is he still confident a deal can be finalised before the end of the month to avoid the repayment of the €3.06 billion during that timeframe?  Can the Minister give us any sense of the shape of the overall deal he is trying to negotiate?  Is it the case that he is seeking to re-finance the promissory note liability through the issuance of long-term Government bonds, which will yield some short-term cashflow benefits but will not reduce the overall level of debt burden, or has he put the question of reducing the outstanding level of debt on the table with the ECB and, if so, what has been the outcome?</p>
            <p eId="para_990">The Minister can take this opportunity to update the House and inform the Irish people as to whether he is confident at this point that the payment due at the end of March of €3.06 billion can be avoided?  Clearly, progress has been made and I welcome that.  I hope the Minister can get it over the line because it would give us some essential breathing space to conclude a more comprehensive deal to reduce the burden of bank debt this country is currently carrying.  I wish him well in that regard but he can take this opportunity to give us further details.</p>

At the conclusion of these talks I will come back to the House and give the Deputy all the details to which he is entitled as a finance spokesperson of an Opposition party.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">I can confirm that the principal agenda item is to negotiate an overall settlement to have an alternative to the promissory note, which would be less onerous on the Irish taxpayer, and that work is proceeding.  What commenced as an Irish request is now being converted into a euro-IMF position paper but of course the decision will be political.  As I said in my script, when we get the common agreed paper, we will have to move on and get political support behind it and we will have a more structured approach, through diplomatic channels, to getting that political support.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">While what is happening at the end of the month is important, it is not the main game.  The terms of it will not necessarily influence the design of what we are aiming for.  In other words, it is not a template, as the Deputy remarked.  Beyond that, I cannot help the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs  (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_1003">The referendum on children's rights is a programme for Government priority.  The Government recently endorsed the holding of the referendum on a stand-alone basis during the course of 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">Since taking office, both officials of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and I have had a considerable number of meetings and communications  with the Attorney General and her officials to progress this commitment.  A draft wording is being prepared by the Office of the Attorney General in co-operation with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We are jointly focused on ensuring the proposed referendum reflects the deliberations and conclusions of the joint committee and the commitment in the programme for Government.  The Government is satisfied that the nature of the referendum is such that it will be a stand-alone matter, to allow for a full debate on the issue and in order that the people clearly understand the proposition being put in the proposed amendment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">The precise timing of the referendum during 2012 is the subject of further consideration by the Government.  However, as I have previously stated, it is its intention that the referendum will be held this year.  It is my intention, in conjunction with a proposal for a constitutional amendment, to also make available the proposed legislative amendments to the adoption provisions which would be introduced based on the successful outcome of the referendum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">I have sought to consult key interests as the work on the proposed amendment is finalised.  This has included the party spokesmen on children.  I will continue to consult as a detailed wording emerges.  It is my hope, to the greatest extent possible, that a broad-based consensus will be forthcoming to support the incorporation of children's rights within the Constitution.  It is important that there be clear and reliable information available on the current position of children as reflected in the Constitution and the law and the public's understanding of children's rights.  My Department is examining how such information can be captured.  I look forward to working with Members of the Oireachtas in explaining these issues as part of an important campaign on how as a country we provide for the recognition and protection of children's rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_1007">The main purpose of my question is to seek clarity on the plans and timeline for the children's referendum.  There has been considerable confusion in the last couple of weeks about whether the commitment given in mid-February that the referendum would take place in 2012 still remains in place.  Did the Minister bring this to the Cabinet to seek confirmation and has the Cabinet agreed that the referendum will take place in 2012?  Last week on the Order of Business the Taoiseach refused to commit to holding it in 2012.  He stated no broad timeframe had been agreed to by the Government.  We need clarity on this issue.  The date has been bandied about and commitments were given that were subsequently rolled back on.  This is an important referendum that will be key in enshrining the rights of children in the Constitution and ensuring we will have in place a robust system for child protection.  Has the Minister brought this issue to the Cabinet and has it agreed on it?  I can assure her of our support in the matter.</p>

          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_337" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1008">This issue has been discussed for a long time.  A referendum was first promised by a former Taoiseach on 3 November 2006 at the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis; therefore, there were five years during which Fianna Fáil could have brought it forward.  The Government recently endorsed the holding of the referendum on a stand-alone basis during the course of 2012.  The precise timing depends on a number of factors - there are other referendums to be considered and as such, the Cabinet has not made a decision on the precise timing of the referendum.  The Taoiseach spoke about various items of legislation, the building blocks for the referendum that must be in place, including the Children First legislation, on which a lot of work has been done, and the adoption legislation.  When I entered office, I found work had not been done on that legislation.  I want to ensure it is available when the issue is put to the people in a referendum, as it is important the people understand precisely the implications of what they are supporting.  Equally, the withholding of information and vetting legislation are building blocks in the architecture of child protection measures and important steps as we move towards holding the referendum.  It is important the public understands the current laws for children and how they will be changed after a constitutional referendum.</p>

            <from>Deputy Charlie McConalogue</from>
            <p eId="para_1009">The Minister points out a lot of work had been done and that Fianna Fáil committed to doing this.  She should acknowledge that the all-party Oireachtas committee published a final report and suggested a draft wording for a referendum in 2010.  When she was in opposition, she pushed hard to have a date set and has given commitments up until now.  It is important that we get this right, which will be difficult.  However, when the Minister and her party make such a big issue of selecting new dates, they should not be surprised when they are asked if they are going to stick to them.  She says the Cabinet has not finalised the date but that it is committed to holding the referendum in 2012.  Will she give an assurance that the adoption legislation required will be finalised before the summer recess?</p>

            <p eId="para_1010">I thank the Deputy for his comments on his approach to the holding of the referendum.  I acknowledge the work done by Mary O'Rourke as Chairman of the committee during the 64 meetings it held on the issue.  There is a huge body of work in which we all took part.  We are trying to draft a wording which will be as close as possible to the committee's wording.  As Deputy Ó Caoláin was also a member of the committee, he knows the work that was done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1011">The adoption legislation had to be started from scratch, but a lot of work has been done on it.  I do not have a precise date for the introduction of that legislation which is different from the tracing legislation, on which we are also working.  This legislation will deal primarily with the impact on adoption, the voluntary placement of children for adoption and the time period involved if children of married parents become eligible for adoption and the conditions that would apply in such circumstances.  I am not in a position to say when the legislation will be published, but there is a huge amount of work being done.  I will be in a better position to say in a few weeks time when it will be published.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_1014">The HSE compiles a monthly census of employment in the public health and social care sector.  The latest data available is in respect of January 2012.  This shows that the total number of social workers employed in the HSE and in directly funded agencies was 2,435 whole time equivalents, WTEs.  The impact of recent retirements will be more fully reflected in future monthly employment returns.  The latest information from the HSE in respect of the number of social work staff who retired in February indicates that 31 social work staff retired.  That is the most up-to-date figure, not the 45 mentioned in the Deputy's question.  It refers to the end of January, so the figure I gave does not necessarily mean there were 31.  Clearly, there is a great deal of movement at present in terms of recruitment of new social workers as well as the retirement of other social workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">The HSE is actively reviewing the impact of recent retirements at national and regional level.  The national director of children and family services, Gordon Jeyes, will apply his discretion over the course of the year to the filling of vacancies, having regard to identified need and subject to services being delivered within available resources.  The HSE has in place an agreed service plan for 2012 and the challenge is to ensure full delivery of the range of commitments set out in that plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">I am very much aware of the financial and service challenges facing the HSE in 2012.  The Deputy will be aware of the budgetary challenges we had to meet last year.  The challenges are such as to require acceleration of the reform programme across child and family services, leading to the establishment of a new and dedicated children and family support agency, to which the Government is fully committed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">The Government has made additional budgeting provision of €19 million for child welfare and protection services compared to the funding made available last year.  This compares to a reduction of €14 million which was made in the HSE's 2011 national service plan which was approved in December 2010.  The additional funding made available for 2012 provides further impetus to the comprehensive reform of service delivery which is under way and which is aimed at generating the best possible outcomes for vulnerable children and families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">My Department will be working very closely with the HSE throughout the year to ensure the priorities set out in the HSE national service plan are implemented where they relate to children and family services.  We have set an ambitious programme of work, one which is designed to strengthen significantly the policy, legislative and practice framework.  Our shared goal is the delivery of appropriate, effective and consistent services, notwithstanding the very challenging and demanding circumstances in which these services are delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1020">I do not wish to be critical but the information is not as up to date as I hoped.  It is now the end of March and the key date was 29 February in the context of the departure of staff under the incentivised pension arrangements or however one wishes to describe it.  The figure is 31 and relates only to the end of January.  My question suggests, from the information I have gleaned, that there were 45 departures in February and not just up to February.  Does the Minister understand it to mean up to February?</p>

            <p eId="para_1021">Yes, 31 had retired by the end of February.  I will clarify it for the Deputy.  The figures are for the period up to the end of January.  Of the 31, some might well have retired before February.  Those figures are still being compiled.  The Deputy should accept that there is a fair amount of movement at present.  I will come back to him as soon as I have the full figures.  The figure is 31 at present.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_344">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_1022">Yes.  We will not pull this from both ends like a Christmas cracker.  I would appreciate if the Minister reverted back to us with clarification as soon as possible, not just for myself but for my colleague Deputies who are directly interested in this.  It is very important.  The core point of this and previous questions on this issue is a concern about the number of social workers, particularly when they are needed more than at any time in our political experience.  I am deeply concerned.  As a Deputy at the coalface people are presenting as never before, not even during the worst times of the 1980s.  Today there is a huge rise in the real need and social workers have a crucial role to play in that.  I am deeply concerned that we are not in a position to respond properly to the problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">There is a high number of retirements.  I hear the Minister for Health respond that they are in a certain age cohort but the fact is that they are not being replaced.  These are positions lost.  They represent hands and heads that are no longer within the service.  How will this impact on the establishment of the new family support agency?  One would expect there would be increased provision, commensurate with the work and undertaking of that agency.  Are there any plans or contingency plans for coping as we move towards the establishment of that new body?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_345" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1024">I wish to make a number of points.  A total of 262 extra social workers were recruited last year and the year before.  It is, effectively, a 25% increase in the number of social workers dealing with child care, protection and welfare.  If 25% more social workers were recruited in the child protection area prior to the retirements, it is important to acknowledge that.  One can make the assumption, given the work rate of social workers, that even with the increased demand that clearly exists there is increased capacity to respond.</p>
            <p eId="para_1025">The Deputy says these people will not be replaced, but that is not correct.  There is no moratorium on recruitment for social work positions.  Gordon Jeyes has the authority to replace these positions as resources allow.  Of course, the management of resources will be a key issue over the year given the various demands on the services.  Where he sees the need to replace positions where vacancies occur, he has the authority to do that and to keep the teams at the right level to ensure the needs of the families presenting, and particularly the children who might be at risk, can be met and that those cases can be allocated.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_346">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_1026">I am aware of the figures the Minister shared previously regarding the extra number recruited.  However, the real comparison that must be made at this point is between the level of social work numbers, WTEs, as against the number in previous years.  Is there a 25% increase in the actual numbers altogether, apart from the recruitment, given the departures and retirements up to 29 February?  What is the real position now in the last week of March?  These are valid and reasonable questions.  Gordon Jeyes might have the authority to replace workers, but only within the confines of the budget provided.  It is not the case that he can simply add numbers.  He must thereby subtract numbers in some other way.</p>

          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_347" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1027">The number of social workers has increased in each of the years 2009 to 2010, inclusive.  The other point is that while obviously numbers are important, how one organises the services is equally important.  There is a reform programme under way.  I can give an example.  Some of the social workers who previously worked in adoption, an area where there is a changing scenario, will be reallocated to work in areas where there is a higher priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">The other point is that we managed to achieve an extra €19 million for the area of child welfare and protection.  There was a reduction of €14 million in the previous year.  Despite the difficult financial situation there has been an increase of €19 million for those services.  In terms of the director having an opportunity to use those finances to reach out in an appropriate way, perhaps through family support services, this must be taken into account as well as the numbers.  The numbers are important and they have increased.  I will refer back to the Deputy with the precise figures.  The number for those who have retired is down from 45 to 31 and there has also been the recruitment of an extra 25% in the child and family area.  There are positive developments in this area, and it is important not to mislead the House by not pointing to some of the positive actions that have been taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_1030">Prior to 1952, there was no statutory regime for adoption as we now understand it.  Children were placed in foster care under the Children Act 1908 on an informal basis and may also have been placed privately.  Fostering and adoption were not legally differentiated, which led to a number of long-term foster care placements becoming what are now called <i>de facto</i> adoptions.  Records relating to these cases are likely to be held in a variety of institutions, including the precursors to health boards and a variety of other private, community and religious institutions involved in providing such services at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">It is anticipated that records relating to some of these <i>de facto</i> adoptions were retained by those bodies on the introduction of the statutory regimes for both adoption and fostering, which came into effect in 1953.  Therefore, it is possible that some of these records are retained by the HSE, former adoption societies or newly accredited bodies under the Adoption Act 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">From the information available to me, it is likely that during the period prior to the introduction of the Adoption Act 1952, private arrangements were entered into where the adoption or fostering arrangement was not recorded and, in fact, some such births were falsely registered in which the "adoptive" parents were registered as the biological parents of the child on the birth certificate.  In this case, there may be no records of such arrangements and no way of identifying the possible existence of such records.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">There are no provisions regarding the retention and preservation of such records in current legislation and the Adoption Authority has no remit in respect of such matters.  Notwithstanding the legal and practical difference between such records and those relating to adoptions under the Adoption Acts, I am extremely conscious that these differences are of limited significance to the individuals involved whose concern is with their personal identity.  Therefore, it is a matter which I am actively considering in the context of more general provisions in respect of the adoption (information and tracing) legislation which is currently being developed in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">I will deal with the post-1952 situation in a supplementary reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_1035">I thank the Minister for her reply.  As she outlined, this is a hugely important issue for thousands of people, many of whom, as has been acknowledged, were falsely registered or not registered.  Meanwhile, records are dotted all over the State which many people cannot access.  What steps can the Minister take to safeguard those records?  That is the essential question.  The Minister herself has admitted that the State has failed these people, but we must see what we can do about it now.  For example, I am aware of a record that exists within a 5 km radius of this House which would give indispensable proof to a person who is trying to identify her mother and therefore establish with certainty her own identity.  She cannot get those records, however, because they are privately owned and she is fearful for their safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">There is an onus on the Government to come up with proposals to deal with this situation, if not on a voluntary basis then to seize these records where they exist.  This should be done because it was the State which let these people down originally.</p>

            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1037">The Deputy quoted a figure of thousands pre-1952, but we must be careful of the numbers involved.  The Adoption Board had 99 people coming forward who believed they were adopted, yet records could not be found.  While that is the number of people who have come forward, I take the point that there may well be others who have not made themselves known to the Adoption Authority.  Some 50% of those were pre-1952, while the other half were post-1952.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">I want to assure the Deputy that the Adoption Act 2010 provides for the safeguarding of records and files held by each accredited body.  In addition, each accredited body shall record and preserve all information supplied which relates to the child, including family and medical histories.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">Adoption records held by all the former adoption societies which have not sought registration under the Adoption Act 2010 are in the process of being transferred to an accredited body or the HSE in order to provide for their safeguarding in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  I do not know if that is the situation that applies to the particular case mentioned by the Deputy.  If it could be helpful, I would be happy to respond to a particular case if the Deputy wishes to bring it to my attention.  Many records of private institutions which did not seek to be re-registered, will be transferred, kept in a safe place and will be accessible.  The HSE has been co-operating fully with all such requests for the transfer of records.  The Adoption Authority has oversight of those matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">There is a separate question of illegal birth registration, which is a different subject.</p>

            <p eId="para_1041">The problem is that not all bodies are accredited and we do not know about many of the files that are out there.  I am also aware of consistent backlogs with the HSE's cumbersome approach to try to amalgamate these records and bring them under one roof.  We must go out of our way, using either the voluntary route or by legally compelling the centralisation of these records.  They should be lodged, photocopied and kept in the National Archives so that they can be accessed by people from all over the world.  We are a long way from that but I will probably have to resubmit the question for further discussion at a future date.</p>

            <p eId="para_1042">I agree with the Deputy abut the importance of this issue.

            <p eId="para_1043">I want to make it clear, however, that if there are bodies out there holding private information on adoption, that material can be transferred to the HSE which will take charge of it.  The HSE will preserve it and the Adoption Authority will have oversight.  Those records will be kept in a safe place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">If nobody comes forward who has those records, clearly that is a difficulty.  It may be that in the forthcoming tracing legislation we can find a way of addressing some of those aspects.

          <summary eId="sum_78">4.Deputy Charlie McConalogue asked the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs when she will publish the Health Service Executives National Child Audit Review; and if she will make a statement on the matter. [16115/12]</summary>
          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_353" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1045">The HSE, which has statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection, is in the process of finalising a national audit of child protection policies, procedures and practices in each Catholic diocese.  There are essentially two elements to the audit: first, a retrospective aspect which examines how each diocese responded to allegations of child sexual abuse in the past and, second, a forward-looking aspect which examines how each diocese is prepared in terms of the policies and procedures currently in place both to handle allegations of child sexual abuse and to prevent the possibility of any child being sexually abused in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">I am advised by the HSE that the report of this audit is at an advanced stage and that it expects to submit the report to me in June.  I am concerned that the audit has taken considerably longer to complete than originally envisaged although I am assured by the HSE's national director, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, that the matter is a high priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">The original audit, which was requested by the then Government in 2005 on foot of the Ferns report, covered a period up to mid 2010.  However, the HSE considered that in finalising the audit at the end of last year with a view to publication, it was important to have the most up to date position for each diocese.  Consequently, dioceses were given an opportunity to submit updated information.  A very good response has been received with significant new material presented in January and February this year.  I understand that this will require rewriting of the report, including potentially a redrafting of certain findings in order to incorporate properly this new, detailed information in the interests of producing a most comprehensive, up to date and relevant report.  I wanted to facilitate that short extra period so the additional information received from the dioceses can be included.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">The HSE's legal advice is that it will be important to provide an opportunity for relevant dioceses to make a final comment on the factual accuracy of material and findings where significant redrafting is likely.  The revised timetable indicated by the national director reflects the work involved in incorporating the most up to date material and giving individual dioceses an opportunity to comment on the factual accuracy of relevant sections.  The need for follow-up action will be informed by the findings of the national audit and it is my intention to publish the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">The national director is also at my request engaging directly with the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church on a programme of action designed to ensure the Catholic Church is responding properly and comprehensively to all child protection concerns and that it has in place the necessary safeguarding structures and practices to protect fully children who come into contact with the church.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">The Government is committed to strengthening the arrangements for the reporting of concerns of abuse by putting the Children First National Guidance on a statutory basis.  The necessary legislation is being worked on by my Department as a priority.  This legislation will not only bring forward statutory requirements on organisations and individuals to report, but it will also support all of civil society in understanding what to do when they have concerns about a child.  The roll-out of Children First will require all sectors and organisations working with children, including the faith sector, to put in place and demonstrate that they have robust safeguarding arrangements.  I very much welcome the work undertaken to date by the national board to strengthen child protection practices in the Catholic Church in line with this objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">Reports such as those published over the last number of years by various State-commissioned inquiries in respect of the dioceses of Ferns, Cloyne, Dublin and the report of the Ryan commission, serve to remind us all that the abuse of a child is a crime which is to be abhorred and that those involved must be subject to the full rigour of the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">We must also recognise that child abuse takes many forms and occurs in many settings.  Anyone with child abuse concerns or information should not hesitate to come forward and assist the HSE and An Garda Síochána in their respective roles in carrying out their work to protect children.  In this context, I want to acknowledge those victims of clerical abuse who have shown great courage in coming forward to the authorities.  I recognise that this has been a very painful experience for many individuals who have had to battle to have their experiences heard and believed and to have their suffering recognised.</p>

            <p eId="para_1054">I thank the Minister for her reply.  I am disappointed that the publication of this report is continually being pushed back.  A previous response from the Minister concerned the pushing back of a date for the children's referendum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">I am disappointed that the Minister is unable to commit to a clear timeline for the introduction of adoption legislation.  How can she be so definite about a referendum date, over which she does not have control, when she cannot give a specific commitment with regard to when the adoption legislation will be produced?</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">Last summer the Minister told us that the HSE national child protection audit report would be ready by September.  During the winter she told us it would be ready by the spring.  Now she is telling us it will be ready by the summer.  What communication did she have with the HSE when giving these assurances?  Was the HSE able to say why the date of publication of the report was continually being pushed back?  When the report of the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church on the Diocese of Raphoe was published, the Minister refused to consider any type of independent investigation, pending publication of the audit report, the date for which which we are now seeing being pushed back.  Much emphasis has been placed on the voice of the child.  However, we are not acknowledging the voices of the many children who were failed by the State and the church.  The Minister is waiting for the report before providing a forum to acknowledge their voices and experiences.  This delay is not acceptable.  What conversation did the Minister have with the HSE before she gave these commitments?  Why was the possibility of delay not highlighted to her at that stage?</p>

            <p eId="para_1057">The delay is a reflection of the amount of work being done by the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church and the HSE.  The volume of material from the dioceses is as I have outlined.  There has been a very good response, which I welcome, and a lot of new material has been presented.  It was presented in January and February in response to further work the HSE was doing.  It was on that basis that the board asked for extra time.</p>

            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1065">As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I have statutory responsibility for the child welfare and protection services.  My colleague, the Minister for Health, in conjunction with the Minister for State with responsibility for disability, equality and mental health services and older people, has responsibility for mental health and disability services.  I work closely with both, as I do with all members of the Government on children's issues.  The question on the detailed service information sought relating to disability and mental health servcies would be most appropriately addressed to the Minister with direct responsibility for these services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, was in the House earlier this afternoon to reply to specific questions relating to services within her remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">The HSE has adopted a planned approach at national, regional and local level to the management of departures as a result of staff retiring.  We had a discussion about the social work side earlier.  The overall situation is set out in the national and regional service plans for 2012.  The HSE's overarching aim is to protect critical front-line essential services and use a range of measures to manage the staffing situation, which includes using the provisions of the Croke Park agreement and delivering greater productivity through the reform of service delivery.  Where critical gaps in services cannot be filled through redeployment, reconfiguration or reorganisation of services, some €16 million has been provided in the national service plan for the filling of priority vacancies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1067">More generally, my Department works with other Departments to harmonise and co-ordinate policies relating to children.  During the current year this will be achieved through the development of a children and young people's policy framework and an early years strategy.  Both policies will address health outcomes for children and the co-ordination of services to promote children's health and well-being.  This is the first time we will have had a national policy for the early years and we will look at the range of services we need to deliver to that age group and their co-ordination.  At a policy level, this will involve working across Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1068">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1069">My Department will be working with the Department of Health to address these issues, with a particular focus on those children with the greatest needs, including disabilities and mental health problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">Child protection teams are based geographically in the local health area office.  During 2010 and 2011, 260 additional social workers were recruited and assigned across the country to child protection teams and children in care teams.  The latest data available from the HSE show that in January 2012 the total number of social workers employed in children and family services providing services for children at risk and in care was 1,220 whole-time equivalents.  It is important to stress that there is no moratorium on filling social work posts within the overall public sector numbers.  The national director of children and family services will apply his discretion over the course of the year to the filling of vacancies, subject to meeting overall employment targets and on the basis that services are being delivered within available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">The Deputy refers to cases being recorded on at risk registers.  He may be referring  to the establishment by the HSE of a national child protection register as part of the child protection notification system which records children where, following an assessment and a case conference, the view is that there is a child protection risk.  I have been assured that all referrals of child welfare and protection cases are assessed by the duty or in-take team.  Those cases identified as the most serious or urgent are allocated immediately to a social worker.  Other referrals may benefit from referral to a family support service, while some cases may be referred to other services.  The number of referrals to the team will always be significantly greater than those in the child protection notification system, as the majority of referrals are not assessed as involving a child protection risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">I am advised by the HSE that there was a total of 29,277 child protection and welfare reports to it in 2010.  A total of 16,452 of these reports related to concerns about a child's welfare, while 12,825 were related to child protection concerns, that is, physical, sexual, emotional abuse and neglect.  Of the 12,825 cases related to child protection concerns, 1,556 were confirmed as abuse cases and notified to the child protection notification management team.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">The standardised business process to ensure consistent definitions for the purposes of information reporting is being worked out across all 32 LHOs in the HSE.  I anticipate that the information available in 2012 will be of a higher standard.  Since taking office last year I have been dissatisfied with the quality and accuracy of information available from the HSE on child protection, as well as the HSE's capacity to provide timely and meaningful information.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that significant progress is now being made by the HSE to remedy this.  A major information technology project, the national child care information system, NCCIS, has now gone to tender.  The NCCIS will be the central system supporting social work services.  As a social work case management system, it will be used to record and store the case history of every child and other clients of the service.  Management information will be derived automatically from it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">The aim of the NCCIS project is to identify and procure an easy to use technology solution to support this type of case recording and automatically provide management information.  A first step was to develop agreed and consistent definitions and business processes across all social work offices.  In this regard, a national standardised business process has been rolled out nationally.  This will ensure the definitions used are consistent, for example, to ensure the number of recorded  referrals relates to  individual children, not families.  I am confident that the process being led by Mr. Gordon Jeyes, the HSE national director of children and family services, will deliver the information needed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_1075">As the Minister acknowledged, my original question was related not only to child protection teams, I also asked about child mental health teams, early intervention teams and disability teams, as well as the staff shortages in these areas.  It is not acceptable for the Minister to say, in a bureaucratic way, that they are within the remit of another Minister.  She is Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, not just Minister for child protection teams or social workers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">The Government talks about the need for joined-up thinking and co-ordination and its commitment to child protection.  In her press release last Tuesday the Minister said there must be "robust safeguarding arrangements within all organisations working with children".  Therefore, there must be joined-up thinking and co-ordination.  We should be able to get an answer from the Minister on how the various services working with children are staffed, whether there are staff shortages and the problems they might cause.  The Irish Medical Organisation has reported massive shortages in child mental health teams.  For example, one team lost one third of its staff in the last year owing to retirements, staff going on maternity leave and redeployments.  It now has eight members of staff, instead of the 38 recommended in A Vision for Change and can do only emergency work.  It is part of the Minister's responsibility to say this is unacceptable.  Children are being put at risk as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">I welcome the Government's commitment to publish the Children First guidelines, but what is meant by "shortly"?  Publication was promised before Easter.  Will publication be matched by the provision of resources?  How can we seriously talk about child protection if we have child mental health teams with eight staff instead of the necessary 38?  That is not child protection.</p>

            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1078">When we talk about Children First, it is important to be aware that a cross-departmental group is working on the issue.  The Deputy is right when he says ensuring the safety of children involves cross-departmental work.  We have a cross-departmental group working with the Garda and others are represented in the group which is looking at implementation of Children First.  We must go right down through the Departments of Health and Education and Skills to ensure the guidelines are being implemented and deal with any issues that might come up, whether in schools or elsewhere.  Only yesterday I had a meeting with the Irish National Teachers Organisation to discuss how the guidelines were being worked through in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_1079">On Deputy Boyd Barrett's point on mental health, I am most concerned that young children and teenagers would have access to mental health teams.  I discussed the matter recently with the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, who assures me that there is access for those aged up to 18 years in child and adolescent mental health teams throughout the country.  I have outlined the situation on shortages.  The aim is to concentrate on critical, essential, front-line services.  A total of €16 million has been allocated for that purpose.  In that context it is important to note that €35 million has been ring-fenced by the Government for the development of those mental health teams, including the child and adolescent mental health teams.  The Minister of State, Deputy Lynch, with whom I liaise and work on the issues, indicated that 20 extra beds have become available for inpatient use for young people.  There is progress in the area.</p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett</from>
            <p eId="para_1080">In so far as there is any progress, I welcome it.  Surely the whole point of the Ministry becoming a senior one is that it must have an overview of child protection.  In a certain sense the Minister should not respect ministerial demarcations because otherwise one could ask what is the point.  Talk of €16 million for priority cases and front-line services does not address the point that is being raised by the IMO, namely, that there are chronic shortages of staff for child mental health teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_1081">The one example I have given the Minister is of a situation where there are only eight staff where A Vision for Change suggests 38 are necessary.  That is a chronic shortage.  It is difficult to see how children and teenagers who require those services are getting them.  In fact, we are being told the services are only taking emergency cases.  This is a real problem.  The Ministry must have an overview and must blow the whistle.  Otherwise, all the commitments in the world in Children First mean very little.</p>

            <p eId="para_1082">I accept Deputy Boyd Barrett's point on working with other Departments.  I assure him that I am doing that.  I am taking an overview.  The policy overview on these issues is extremely important.  That is why we are having the interdepartmental meetings on mental health as well as on how Children First, for example, is being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">Deputy Boyd Barrett asked me also about child protection teams.  I have already indicated - as I am sure the Deputy heard - that an extra 25% of social workers were recruited.  An extra €19 million has been allocated.  That must mean better services for children.  There is no question about that, given the 25% increase in social workers working with families coming to the HSE, for example, and an extra €19 million being put into services.  I agree that demand exists and that families have serious issues that require a prompt response.  I am working cross-departmentally on the issues raised by the Deputy and I will continue to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">A new national children's strategy is being developed this year.  It will look at children from birth right through to the age of 18.  I accept that any development of a national children's policy must look at issues such as how we deliver mental health services, disability issues and other areas.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett correctly pointed out, there has been a need for co-ordination on these areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1088">The Chatterbox service, which facilitates early intervention in the area of speech therapy, is a successful collaborative social inclusion project between the Health Service Executive and the Cavan and Monaghan child care committees.  The service was first introduced in 2004 and is funded under the health inequalities fund.  It is proving to be an excellent early intervention tool, with a true partnership approach between the agencies involved.  On a recent visit to the service I was pleased to see how effective it is.  I said at the time to Deputy Ó Caoláin that it was a model that should be followed elsewhere.  The issue links into the previous question on providing integrated services to young children in need of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1089">Social inclusion services improve access to mainstream services, target services to needy groups, address inequalities and enhance the participation and involvement of socially excluded groups.  The service is a primary health care project and is funded by the HSE.  While I am very supportive of the initiative, responsibility for and funding of primary care services lies with my colleague, the Minister for Health.  I continue to fund the child care committees.  The committee in this instance has done an excellent job in terms of its role in supporting the implementation of the three national child care schemes and child care services generally, and has been involved in some of the initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">In addition to the Chatterbox service in Cavan and Monaghan, pilot initiatives have been undertaken in other parts of the country to provide speech and language supports within child care settings.  For example, the early years programme delivered by the Childhood Development Initiative in west Tallaght incorporates a speech and language service.  This service offers support to children and training and support to parents and preschool staff.  This speech and language service is being independently evaluated and the results will be available later this year.  The development of the early years strategy will provide an opportunity to examine how we provide services and supports to children from birth to six years old.  In that context we will have an opportunity to examine the type of service to which the question refers.  We should examine initiatives such as these and they should inform national policy.  They should also inform priorities for supporting children's development.</p>

I do so today to gently urge the Minister to follow up on her positive response to what she witnessed on that day.  It is important we try to emulate the example of the success of the Chatterbox service.  The county child care committees are an appropriate vehicle for engaging with the greater number of preschool children today.  They cater for approximately 95% of preschool starters.</p>

We do not expect the Minister to have a roll-out in train at this early stage following her visit but has she been able in the period since to engage within her Department to look at the concept to see how it could be done and whether it would be possible to find funding to roll out the approach across the board?  Is it possible to ring-fence funding in that regard?</p>

            <p eId="para_1094">I knew Deputy Ó Caoláin would not delay in bringing the matter to my attention in the Dáil.  I was very impressed with the service when I visited it on 17 February.  I have spoken on the service since in the Seanad.  As the Deputy is aware, county child care committees exist in every county.  I spoke to the child care committee after I saw the service and suggested that the initiative which it had begun could be replicated and deserved to be.  One way of taking it forward would be through the national child care committee system.  I have initiated a new programme on county child care committees, namely, that they should work together at national level and begin to identify priorities at a national level as well as at a county level.  This service is an example of an initiative which is all about getting services to families in an easier way for them.  The service could be followed.  I am awaiting evaluation reports from the community development initiatives which will also look at how well that type of service is working.  Instead of parents having to go to appointments in a clinic, the services would be brought to them in a location where they are likely to be with their young children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1095">Would it be worthwhile as a first step to circulate for the information of other county child care committees, the tools employed and the concept itself in order to inform?  It is only through the dissemination of information and the sharing of best practice ideas that we will germinate sufficient enthusiasm and realisation that there are other ways of doing things and that there is something that can be emulated in terms of the Monaghan county child care committee experience.  The Minister's visit was very much appreciated.  It would be important to take early steps to indicate good intent in terms of bringing the project to the widest possible attention, and I would encourage the Minister to so do.</p>

            <p eId="para_1096">I suggested to the Cavan and Monaghan child care committees that they circulate it and perhaps begin to have that discussion.  If there is any way my Department can facilitate that, I would be happy for it to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">As I stated, I was impressed with the project.  It is similar to the CDI project in Tallaght from which I am awaiting results.  I would be confident that this is the kind of initiative that will be replicated.  Certainly, I will be including it in my early years strategy as a model of good practice, as Deputy Ó Caoláin stated.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">All of the evidence shows that if we reach out to children at an early age when they have a speech disability or any other disability such as an emotional or cognitive disability, in many cases the disability reduces and is dealt with more effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">I am pleased that Deputy Ó Caoláin raised in the House what is happening in this initiative in Cavan-Monaghan.  It is one that certainly can be replicated.

            <p eId="para_1100">Taking up from the points Deputy Ó Caoláin made, the importance of providing these services to children at a fairly young age cannot be over-emphasised.  I would ask the Minister to look also at the crossover between children going from early years to primary school, in particular, in terms of ensuring those with speech and language difficulties get the services they require.  If their needs can be addressed at that age, it has innumerable benefits down the road.  It can ensure a child can catch up and be in a position to keep pace with his or her education as he or she goes on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">I ask the Minister to intervene in a particular case on which I am working in Drumfries national school in County Donegal where they are trying to set up a new class for a number of children who require speech and language assistance but are encountering difficulties because of the lack of speech and language therapists within the HSE in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1108">Deputy McConalogue makes a good point on the transition point between early childhood services and primary school.  That is something we need to manage.  There is scope.  I discussed this issue with the INTO when I met its representatives yesterday.  They stated that in many instances, the preschool year is a considerable help because intervention is occurring at an earlier stage for children who need it, and those children are better prepared when they come attend primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">There is scope for shared speech and language therapists posts in a collaborative approach with a local service provider, whether it is with a school, as in the instance Deputy McConalogue suggests, or with a community initiative.  There have been difficulties in recent years due to the lack of numbers of speech therapists but, in principle, the initiative Deputy McConalogue describes and the one we discussed are important.  If Deputy McConalogue wishes to communicate directly on the case he mentioned, I will certainly follow it up.</p>

            <p eId="para_1111">The HSE provided for the recruitment of an additional 62 social workers in 2011.  The recruitment process is being managed by the HSE national recruitment service.  The executive indicated in December 2011 that all of these posts had been either filled or accepted.  I am advised by the HSE that 51 individuals have taken up duty with the remainder expected to come on stream in the coming weeks.  Obviously, individuals must serve out notice in jobs they hold already.  My Department will continue to monitor the position closely in terms of recruitment of additional personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">The additional social workers are being targeted at priority areas of the service having regard to an overall assessment of workload undertaken by the national director and his team.  The recruitment of the additional social workers is one element of a wider change agenda within the HSE, through which we can deliver better outcomes for children and families.  This reform agenda will lead to the establishment of a new child and family support agency which will provide a dedicated focus on child protection and support families in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">The latest information from the HSE indicates that 31 social work staff retired in February.  While this number is relatively low in the overall context, it will, none the less, require a considered management response by the HSE.  In this context, the national director of children and families services, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, will apply his discretion over the course of the year to the filling of vacancies, subject to this not compromising the achievement of employment targets and subject to services being provided within available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1114">I am conscious, as Members would be, of the financial and service challenges facing the HSE in 2012.  This is the case across all care groups.  These challenges are such as to require an acceleration of the reform programme which is a central element of the wider programme of reform for child and family services, including the establishment of a new and dedicated children and family support agency to which the Government is fully committed.</p>

Our shared goal is the delivery of appropriate, effective and consistent services, notwithstanding the challenging and demanding circumstances in which these services are delivered.</p>

            <p eId="para_1117">The position of social worker is crucial to the child protection system.  That is why, as a result of the Ryan report, 270 additional social workers were to be recruited, according to the recommendations of the report, in addition to the back-filling of existing posts in the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1118">The Minister stated that 31 retired in February alone.  Are we to take it that the other 14 who she mentioned in the context of the previous figure of 45 will now not be retiring and have not taken up the early retirement option?  I dispute the Minister's categorisation of social worker posts.  From an initial tally, I was looking at a figure of approximately 70 for the number of retirements from social worker posts of different categories of child protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">The Minister mentioned that an additional 25% of social workers were recruited in recent years in the area of child protection.  However, little of this has taken place since she entered Government.  In fact, according to the Minister's figures, last year there were only ten additional social workers in posts at the end of year.  We now see that 51 of the 62 who were to be hired last year are in posts and, alongside that, the Minister stated that 31 retired in February.  We are moving from the previous policy of ring-fencing the number of social workers required for the system to divesting responsibility for that to the discretion of the HSE.  It is a backward step.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">The Minister should set a target for the number of social workers needed in the system in line with the policy followed to date.  It is necessary if we are to ensure the remaining gaps in the child protection system are addressed.</p>

On all four occasions and on both counts he was wrong.  The 60-62 in fact were recruited and the total number of child and family social workers increased by 37 in 2011.  Those are the facts.</p>

He will make those decisions.  The situation is that 51 of the 62 additional posts recommended by the Ryan report are in place and there are 31 retirements.

I hope that, with all Deputies co-operating, it will be an innovative and dynamic blueprint for the future development of Ireland's early years sector aimed at providing a coherent approach to seeking to improve the lives of children from birth to age six.  One of the issues of policy which I have identified for consideration in the preparation of the new strategy is the development of the childminding sector as a fully integrated component of early childhood care and education, in particular for the under-one age group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1131">At present, preschool services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.  Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the preschool inspectorate of the HSE and are subject to regular inspection and report by the inspectorate.  Services covered by the regulations include full-time, part-time and sessional services, as well as childminders taking care of more than three preschool children from different families in the childminder's home.  Childminders taking care of not more than three preschool children from different families are not covered by the regulations, recognising parental choice to place children with friends and neighbours, and the challenges of the excessive regulation of the more informal arrangements chosen by parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1132">The national guidelines for childminders, compiled by the National Childcare Co-ordinating Committee, which oversees the development of an integrated child care infrastructure throughout the country, provide guidance to childminders on good practice and assist them to decide whether they are subject to the regulations, as well as providing other useful information on the role of the childminder in the provision of child care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1133">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_1134">The 2006 regulations replaced the earlier regulations, introduced in 1996, and made a number of improvements to the regulatory environment, including the introduction of a requirement for all staff and students working in a preschool service to have been vetted by the Garda.  The main focus of the child care regulations is to ensure that services adhere to appropriate standards of health and safety.  The 2006 regulations also refer specifically to the educational development and well-being of children and the need for services to ensure appropriate age related activities and material are in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">As is the case with all regulatory requirements, the child care regulations set the minimum standards with which services are legally required to comply.  However, my Department is proactive in promoting and developing the highest standards of care and education throughout the sector, given the important role these services play in this crucial phase of children's lives.  In December 2010, national quality standards for preschool services were published by the then Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  These provide a framework within which services are encouraged to work towards best practice and a child-centred approach in their provision of early childhood care and education to preschool children.  In addition, almost every preschool service in the State is now participating in the free preschool year in early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme, which is implemented by my Department.  The ECCE programme introduced significant new requirements to ensure quality provision in preschool services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">All preschool leaders are required to hold an accredited major qualification in early childhood care and education.  In addition, a higher capitation rate is in place for services which employ more highly qualified staff.  This is acting as an incentive to service providers to improve the quality of their services and increasingly higher numbers of services participating in the ECCE programme are qualifying for the higher capitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">A further aspect of the ECCE programme is the fact that it requires services to implement Síolta, the early education framework developed by the Department of Education and Skills.  The programme also encourages services to implement Aistear, the early education curriculum for children from birth to age six.  My Department will continue to review and monitor the regulatory environment for preschool services as well as supporting quality developments within the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_1138">There are 73,000 families with preschool children relying on child care providers to enable them to work.  However, the regulation and administration of the current regulations is patchy in many instances.  It is from talking to people working within the system that one hears of the limited ability of the HSE to inspect childminders who should notify to the HSE but do not.  This is an issue the Minister needs to examine further in regard to-----</p>

            <p eId="para_1140">Does the Minister intend to introduce additional regulations to enhance the ability of the HSE to check an inspect childminding operations which have not been notified?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_394" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1141">Obviously, inspection of childminding facilities is critical and very clear rules are laid down in that regard.  If the Deputy has information about any service which is not being inspected and which has been brought to his attention, I advise him to contact the HSE or my Department.  We have very vigilant oversight.  When I visit centres throughout the country, I hear of the ongoing challenges in regard to inspection, which the centres are happy to meet.  There is a very proactive inspectorate.  However, if there are services operating outside of that of which the Deputy is aware, he should bring them to the attention of the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">One of the initiatives I would like to see in regard to childminding is more contact between childminders, who are often somewhat isolated, and local services.  There is scope for work between the two.  The child care committees are also working very proactively with the National Childminding Association of Ireland, which I have met on a number of occasions.  Just last month, I launched a childminding development grant scheme, which has been welcomed by everyone in the sector and which seeks to encourage people to discuss standards and training and to access educational support.  A lot is happening in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">The regulations are very important and a particular point is that staff must be vetted by the Garda.  When the Government came into office, vetting was taking 13 weeks but it is now taking an average of two weeks.  There has been a huge initiative in regard to vetting and dealing with the chronic delays which have been a feature in recent years.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_395" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1145">Child and adolescent mental health services are the direct responsibility of my colleague, the Minister for Health, in conjunction with the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, equality, mental health and older people.  I work very closely with both Ministers, as I do with all Government colleagues, in regard to children's matters.  Nevertheless, specific responsibility in regard to child and adolescent mental health services resides with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  I am aware that €35 million extra funding has been made available for mental health and that child and adolescent mental health services are a priority area for investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1146">Key to the development of child and adolescent mental health services is the establishment of multidisciplinary community-based teams, of which 61 are in place.  Special funding allocated to the HSE in 2012 will in part be used to strengthen these community child and adolescent mental health teams by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.</p>
            <p eId="para_1147">In the context of the establishment of the new agency, consideration has been given to the interface with specialist health services to improve the experience of children and families.  In this regard, the task force on the child and family support agency recently met the HSE's assistant national director for mental health and the national clinical director for child and adolescent mental health services.  I understand they had a broad-ranging discussion on the development and the interface between the child and family support agency and these services.  The national children and young people policy framework being developed by my Department in association with other Departments will complement this effort.  As part of this process, we will outline the interaction that must take place to ensure children have access to services.  The framework will be published this year and cover a five year period.  It will address the issue of priorities across children's services and the need for linkage to ensure services are delivered in a joined-up fashion, much as we discussed earlier in regard to speech and language services.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_1148">The focus of my question was the need to enhance interdepartmental approaches.  While I recognise that the bulk of this issue falls under the aegis of the Department of Health, we have made the point across the Chamber - it has been accepted by the Minister - that there is an onus on her to take the lead in ensuring best practice is followed.  It should not simply be left to the Department of Health.  It is very important that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is a lead player in all of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1149">Although it does not come directly within the Minister's remit, I draw her attention to the several capital works proposed in increasing the number of inpatient beds across the State for child and adolescent psychiatric care.  I understand the current complement is made up by 12 beds in Dublin, 12 in Cork and 12 in Galway.  It has been signalled that a further 16 beds will be commissioned in the course of this year, including a number in Cork and Galway.  There is also work signalled at two sites in the greater Dublin area, at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, and St. Loman's Hospital, Palmerstown.  Does the Minister have an update on these developments?  If work on either of them has commenced, what stage has it reached?</p>
            <p eId="para_1150">In regard to child and adolescent mental care services, I have pointed out on several occasions that north of a line running from Dublin to Galway, there is no inpatient care support available.  Does the Minister agree that this is one of several areas in which there is potential for co-operation, including cross-Border co-operation, in the provision of services?  There are several appropriate locations where such co-operation could be facilitated, not least in my constituency which has been very much to the fore in developing mental health services.  Great credit must be given to those at the coalface in the provision of this care.  We are strategically located in terms of co-operation and working together on a cross-Border basis.  I appeal to the Minister to consider this in the context of meeting future needs.</p>

          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_397" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1151">On the development of inpatient facilities, psychiatric bed capacity for children and adolescents has increased from 12 in 2007 to 44 at present, comprising 12 beds in Dublin, 12 in Cork and 20 in Galway, with a further eight beds planned to be commissioned in Cork during 2012.  Additional beds will also be provided in the Dublin region.  Work has already begun on the second phase of the child and adolescent unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, which will increase capacity from six to 12 beds.  In addition, the Health Service Executive's service plan for 2012 commits to the development of an eight bed inpatient facility for adolescents at St. Loman's Hospital, Palmerstown.  A new child and adolescent day hospital will also open in Dublin shortly.  It is envisaged that the provision of improved community-based services, coupled with the increase in bed capacity, will bring an end to the practice of placing children and adolescents in adult psychiatric facilities which is completely unacceptable in this day and age.</p>

            <p eId="para_1152">As I said, north of a line running from Dublin to Galway there are many services that tick the relevant boxes but nothing is available in terms of providing inpatient care.  I ask the Minister to address this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1153">In regard to child and adolescent psychiatric services in the north Dublin region, the Minister will be aware that there are only six beds at St. Vincent's Hospital and very little support is available for 16 and 17 year olds.  I have contacted her about several families in difficulty and she has responded positively.  While I welcome her reference to six additional beds, nonetheless there remains a significant lacuna in this area.  On the multifaceted care teams she has indicated are being established, there was a recommendation from the Mental Health Commission that 15 to 25 year olds be catered for within that provision.  Will that type of service be provided, with psychiatrists who look after adults and those who specialise in the treatment of children working together?</p>
            <p eId="para_1154">Does the Minister propose to take any action to deal with the issue of eating disorders?  A recent Scottish study shows that up to one quarter of children in the mid-teenage years, both boys and girls, suffer from eating disorders.  Is tackling this issue a priority for the Minister?</p>

            <from>Deputy Frances Fitzgerald</from>
            <p eId="para_1155">My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, is addressing many of the issues raised by the Deputies.  I am also liaising with her in the context of my concern and interest in these issues.  According to the HSE, one in ten Irish children and adolescents suffers from a mental health issue.  As such, it is extremely important that resources are available to meet their needs.  There is a variety of ways by which this can be done.  It is not simply about the mental health care teams, it is also about other services working with the young people concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1156">In regard to the services available in Deputy Broughan's area and Deputy Ó Caoláin's observation about the potential for cross-Border co-operation, decisions have been made on the provision of beds, as I have indicated.  We are working from a very low base in these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1157">I can only agree with Deputy Broughan on the issue of eating disorders.  It is a source of serious concern that some 25% of three year olds have obesity issues.  Service provision is a slightly different issue, although it is related to the broader issue in some ways.  A number of new beds have been made available.  I do not have the precise figures, but I will be happy to correspond with the Deputy in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_1164">The Child and Family Support Agency is at the heart of the Government's reform of child and family services.  The establishment of a single agency incorporating key children's services will provide a focus for the major reforms already underway.  This reform programme contains a number of critical elements:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1165">The continued and urgent implementation of a comprehensive change programme to improve the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1166">The introduction of legislation to place Children First on a statutory basis;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1167">The establishment for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and family services, providing transparency and accountability for the use of resources to meet national priorities;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1168">The development of legislation to be brought before the Oireachtas later this year to provide for the operation of the new Agency from early 2013;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1169">The transition of existing HSE child protection and welfare and services into the new Agency;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1170">The merger of the existing Family Support Agency with a budget of over €26 million into the Child and Family Support Agency;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1171">Consideration of the potential for further rationalisation of services for children under the new Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">The Deputy will be aware of the comprehensive change programme currently being implemented under the leadership of Mr. Gordon Jeyes, as National Director of Child and Family Services.  Mr. Jeyes was employed last year following an international, open recruitment process.  The change programme underway is addressing the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services.  This change process will continue into the new Child and Family Support Agency where Gordon Jeyes will be the first Chief Executive.  An open recruitment process is underway for a number of key senior positions for the Agency.  I hope that this process delivers a very strong team to work with Gordon in leading the improvement of children's services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1173">Enhanced accountability is an important feature of the reforms.  This greater transparency is already evident in the provision for the first time of a dedicated budget of €550 million for Children and Family Services in 2012.  This will bring greater transparency and control to budgetary management and pave the way for the establishment of the new Agency in 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_1174">The Task Force on the establishment of the Agency that I established has undertaken a considerable body of work in preparation for the new Agency.  I  met with the Task Force at their twelfth meeting held last month for an update on this work, which is also being advanced through two sub-groups.  In the coming weeks I expect to receive the advice of the Task Force on a number of key issues which are critical to my decisions on legislative proposals regarding the new Agency and in particular, a vision for the Agency, governance arrangements and appropriate services for inclusion in the Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1175">As I have just outlined, extensive work is underway in my Department, in the HSE, and through the Task Force I set up last September to prepare for the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency.  The preparations are designed to allow for the Agency to assume full statutory responsibility for services for children and families early in 2013.</p>

            <p eId="para_1179">I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 42 and 52 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1180">The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) inspects Special Care Units annually under Section 69 of the Child Care Act 1991. HIQA  undertook a full unannounced inspection of Ballydowd Special Care Unit on 3rd and 4th November 2011, as part of their annual inspection programme.  The report of the findings from this inspection were published on 6th March last.</p>
            <p eId="para_1181">Inspectors found that there was a marked improvement in the standard of care in the unit since the last round of inspections in 2010. The main areas of improvement were in management, the delivery of care to the children and the overall presentation of the unit. The whole campus had been repainted and brought to a good overall standard.  The safety concerns raised due to ongoing building works at the time had been well managed and risk assessed. The management of the unit had been strengthened by the introduction of good systems of accountability and clear lines of responsibility, which impacted positively on the day to day operations of the unit and the overall delivery of care to the children, staff practices and accountability.  At the time of the inspection, a clinical team of child and adolescent psychiatry, child psychology and social work were available to the children in Ballydowd. Additionally, the inspectors also found that there were sufficient staffing to provide for optimal care for the children. Inspectors noted that all the children had an allocated social worker and were visited by social workers regularly.  It was noted that social workers visited the children, met them privately and had access to their unit and bedrooms.  Visits made by the children's Social Workers met the statutory requirements.   Inspectors raised concerns  regarding the impact of the building works on the space available to the children and the challenges posed by one child's complex needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1182">HIQA inspected the unit against 40 standards and reported that 26 of these standards were met in full, 12 were partially met and 2 were not met. By way of comparison, in a July 2010 inspection, 6 out of 39 standards were met and 15 were not met. This clearly illustrates a marked improvement in findings during the most recent inspection. The 2 standards that were not met were in relation to "single separation" and "location and design".</p>
            <p eId="para_1183">It is very important that the facts of the care of one child in Ballydowd are clarified. There have been assumptions made that the care provided by the clinical and care staff Ballydowd to this young person  fell   below standards. Following this child's placement  in Ballydowd, it became apparent that the child's full range of complex and demanding needs and behaviours could not be met in a Special Care Unit. Following a risk assessment by the clinical team and the acting director of the unit this child was cared for singly on their own in part of a Unit, whilst awaiting a specialist placement outside the country. This decision was approved by the clinical team,  in conjunction with the placing social worker and team manager. The child had access to other children for limited periods, short periods in school and staff took the child on a range of outings.  The decision on how to care for the child was reviewed by the clinical team on a weekly basis. There was no secrecy involved in the care programme for the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1184">Inspectors expressed concerns in relation to this child on two matters. The first was the   manner of recording the child being cared for  in a separate part of the Unit. Inspectors considered the placement should have been recorded on a daily basis as a single separation.  The HSE had taken the  view that the child's placement was a single placement, and they would record as a single separation if the child was sent to his bedroom to be alone for a period. The second concern was  the length of time the child was waiting for the specialist placement oversees. As this placement was outside this jurisdiction, and has many demands on its services, the  social worker had limited influence to bring forward the child's date of admission. However  I am glad to be able to say that   shortly after the inspection, the child moved overseas to this  specialist placement appropriate to his complex needs and continues to reside there.</p>
            <p eId="para_1185">There was no concern that a shortage of staff in the Unit  influenced or impacted on the care of this child.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">I welcome the findings of this report and the fact there are significant improvements since the inspections in 2010. My Department will continue to monitor the delivery special care services.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_1189">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 51 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1190">The primary legislation governing child care policy is the Child Care Act, 1991. Under this Act the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. Thus if a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care. In such circumstances children can be taken into care on a voluntary basis (on agreement with the parents) or under a various Court Orders under the Child Care Act, 1991.</p>
            <p eId="para_1191">Where a child is coming into care the allocated social worker undertakes a full assessment of need, and on this basis the statutory care plan is developed. This assessment will call on a full range of professionals where required to set out a comprehensive statement of the child's needs. The care plan also determines the support and interventions needed with regard to the family situation where it is planned that a child will return home.  The care plan directs the placement most appropriate to the needs of the child and for the majority of children, over 90%, the child is placed in family foster care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1192">The HSE's published figures for December 2011 show there were 453 children placed across all forms of residential care. National and operational policy is that children of 12 years and under are placed in family placements where at all possible. Over 90% of children in residential care are 13 years and older, and the majority are placed in open children's residential centres in communities across the country. Typically between 3 and 5 young people live in the centre and are cared for by a qualified team of staff, attend at school and other activities similar to their peers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1193">The HSE provides care for children in their teenage years whose needs are such that they required additional support in High Support Units, in single residential placements and in Special Care Units. Additional support is provided in High Support Units and Single Placements to children over the age of 12 who are in need of specialised intervention. There are two Units with a national catchment area and management team and a number of specific smaller local Units.  These units are open, the child is not detained. Typically, the Unit has a school/educational facility on site, a higher ratio of staff and support from psychologist, psychiatrist and other therapeutic interventions. High support units aim to assist young people in developing internal control of behaviour, to enhance self-esteem, facilitate personal abilities and strengths, and to build a capacity for constructive choice, resilience and responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1194">The HSE commissioned an external review of alternative care services and this report is currently being finalised. I intend to carefully review the findings and recommendations of this review to ensure that the services on offer to our most vulnerable and needy children are of a high quality and are accessible. The HSE is already tracking those children in their care who are at risk, including looking at children with placement breakdown patterns, and this and other information gleaned from HSE audits and reviews and external inspections will inform future policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1195">The development of the new Children and Family Support Agency is central to the reforms outlined in the Government's change programme to improve the quality and consistency of child welfare and protection services.  The Taskforce appointed by me in September 2011 has undertaken a considerable body of work in preparation for the new Agency and I expect to receive the advice from the Task Force on the vision, governance and scope of services for the new Agency. These recommendations will be an important input into the development of detailed legislation to provide for the Agency and any future policy.</p>

The operation of  Hotline is now a matter for the ISPCC who have made an application for funding to the European Commission and a decision on this application is pending. The ISPCC are currently finalising the project plan for the Hotline and will liaise with the Project Team on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1201">In the coming months the Project Team will  work to ensure that the Hotline becomes operational as soon as possible and operates in a way that supports and augments existing arrangements to secure child protection.</p>

            <p eId="para_1203">My Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector. These include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund (Rounds 1 and 2) and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, European Youth in Action Programme (administered by Léargas — The Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce — the President's Award. These programmes support the delivery of youth services to some 500,000 young people by approximately 1,100 youth work personnel and a volunteer base which is estimated to be of the order of 60,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1204">The main objectives of my Department are to develop and implement coherent, coordinated and relevant youth policies and strategies to support the youth sector in providing effective non-formal education and developmental opportunities for young people through which they can enhance and develop their personal and social skills and competencies. Funding of some €56.806m for current expenditure and €1.5m for capital expenditure is available from my Department in 2012 to support the provision of youth services and programmes. In determining funding allocations for 2012, as in previous years, the emphasis has been on maintaining front line youth services. The €1.5m capital provision is a new allocation and will support the development of infrastructure for the delivery of youth services, in particular youth cafés which provide recreational outlets in an alcohol free environment. In line with overall requirements to achieve public expenditure swings the current funding allocation for youth services available to my Department was reduced this year. Notwithstanding this overall reduction, I successfully maintained the funding provision for the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme which is important in encouraging a network of volunteer led youth clubs across the county.   As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am committed to the development of a new youth policy framework which my Department is currently progressing. Through this work a clear policy framework will emerge that will aim to enhance the development, participation and support of young people. I intend that the policy framework will also facilitate and promote co-ordination and coherence across departments and front line youth services and will set out the priorities, rationale and criteria for future funding programmes. This will ensure that the funding available in future years will be used as effectively as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_1206">The Government is committed to fundamental reform and transformation of the delivery of our family support, child welfare and child protection services.  A number of significant structural and legislative changes are key to effecting such reform.  This includes the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency with dedicated responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services, separate from the HSE and reporting directly to my Department through its Chief Executive. The new Agency will take over the existing change programme for child welfare and protection services which is being overseen by the HSE's National Director, Mr Gordon Jeyes. The Government's reform programme for these services also includes the external inspection of child protection services by HIQA. Draft standards to be inspected against have just been published by HIQA and following consultation on these standards, inspections will commence later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1207">The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, published  in 2011,  provides greater clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect.  The revised Guidance stresses that the responsibility for child protection lies across all  organisations and, whilst the HSE and the Gardai have particular roles in assessment and prosecution of allegations, working across sectors is essential to good outcomes.  The  HSE  subsequently launched their Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook, a practice based publication aimed primarily at social workers, although it may be informative to others working in child protection. The HSE, as the body with statutory responsibility for the welfare of children, has a key role in terms of providing training, advice and information on the operation of Children First.  The consistent implementation of the Children First Guidance across all sectors working with children is a high priority for Government. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs is taking a lead role in implementation issues. An Interdepartmental Group has been established at which both the HSE and An Garda Siochana are represented. The purpose of the Group is to promote the importance of Children First compliance across Government and to ensure consistency of approach. The Group will provide support to Departments and sectors in bringing forward plans for implementation within each sector. This Department will develop appropriate reporting mechanisms for other Government Departments in respect of the implementation of Children First within each sector and the assurance arrangements to monitor implementation and compliance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1208">The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First. My Department has been working intensively to ensure the policy that is being developed will serve to protect children. I have consulted with a high level group of experts in the field, and reviewed legislation and practice internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1209">The policy framework to implement the decision by Government to put ‘Children First' on a statutory footing has been developed and draft heads have been provided to the Attorney General's office for her advices this week. Subject to her advice it is my intention to bring the General Scheme of the Bill  to the Oireachtas Committee for Health and Children for its consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1210">The framework  focusses on the promotion and wellbeing of children generally; the provision of safe services for children; cooperation amongst professionals and organisations where children are at risk of neglect and abuse and making key individuals responsible for  reporting child abuse that is  known to them. The latter objective is aimed at removing ambivalence, reluctance or refusal by people and organisations in positions of trust and authority to report child abuse and cooperate with the relevant authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1211">I intend that the legislation will reflect a broad based approach to compliance with obligations extending beyond reporting to one of safeguarding children at risk. The objective will be to ensure the greater protection of children by underpinning safe practices in organisations that provide care, education and other services to children.</p>

Children in residential care are placed in open residential centres run by either the HSE or private/voluntary providers in communities across the country.

In the interests of privacy and safety, it would not be appropriate to list the names of the residential centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_1214">The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is an independent agency responsible for driving quality, safety and accountability in residential services for children, older people and people with disabilities in Ireland.

HIQA inspects children's residential centres under Section 69 of the Child Care Act, 1991.</p>
            <p eId="para_1215">I am advised by HIQA that there are 65 Health Service Executive (HSE) run residential centres in operation as at 16th March 2012.

Centres in the non-statutory sector open and close according to the demand for places from the HSE and I have requested up to date information from the HSE in relation to the number of non-statutory residential centres for children and I will forward this information once received.</p>

            <p eId="para_1231">The HSE compiles a monthly census of employment in the public health and social care sector.  This shows that the total number of social workers employed in the HSE and in directly funded agencies at the end of 2011 was 2,442 whole time equivalents (WTEs).  This is an increase of 252 WTEs from the position at end 2009 and reflects the recruitment which has taken place following the publication of the Implementation Plan in response to the findings of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.  The recruitment of additional child protection social work staff under the implementation plan in late 2011/early 2012 is not fully reflected in this figure.  Further recruitment of social work staff as part of a new multi-disciplinary team for children in care and detention is also planned in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1232">With regard to end year social worker employment levels, the National Director of Children and Families Services, Gordon Jeyes, will apply his discretion over the course of the year to the filling of vacancies, having regard to identified priorities, the overall level of resources available and subject to meeting employment targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1233">The Service Plan for 2012 sets out a range of reforms and performance measures to guide the improvement of child welfare and protection services.  Priorities include:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1234">Delivery of consistent family support services and development of a national protocol on supervision orders;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1235">Improving the collection of accurate data on services and on children in care, including procurement of the National Child Care Information System;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1236">Establishing a national Child Protection Register;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1237">Developing consistent risk assessment and measurement tools;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1238">A greater focus on quality assurance and auditing of workloads;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1239">Preparing and implementing a Workforce Development Plan for child and family services;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1240">Continuing the implementation of National Standards for Pre-School Services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1241">I am very much aware of the financial and service challenges facing the HSE in 2012.  The challenges are such as to require acceleration of the reform programme across child and family services, leading to the establishment of a new and dedicated Children and Family Support Agency, to which the Government is fully committed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1242">The Government has made additional budgeting provision for these services compared to the funding made available last year.  This provides a further impetus to the comprehensive reform of service delivery which is under way and which is aimed at generating the best possible outcomes for vulnerable children and families.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">My Department will be working very closely with the HSE throughout the year to ensure that the priorities set out in the HSE National Service Plan are implemented where they relate to children and family services.  We have set an ambitious programme of work, one which is designed to significantly strengthen the policy, legislative and practice framework.  Our shared goal is the delivery of appropriate, effective and consistent services, notwithstanding the very challenging and demanding circumstances in which these services are delivered.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_1245">I am aware that children and teenagers are susceptible to bullying which can emanate from a variety of sources.  An unacceptably high proportion of children have been the subject of some form of bullying, and we know that there have in some cases been tragic consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1246">According to the 2008 survey "Growing Up In Ireland" the most common form of bullying identified by children who were victims was verbal bullying, followed by exclusion and physical bullying.  Bullying by written messages and electronic means was less prominent at the time, but we are all aware that our children are very susceptible to the use of electronic media for bullying purposes, as use of this media, particularly for social networking, continues to grow.</p>
            <p eId="para_1247">The Office for Internet Safety was established by the Government to take a lead responsibility for internet safety in Ireland, particularly as it relates to children.  It was instrumental in publishing ‘A Guide to Cyber Bullying' at the end of 2008.  The Office advises never to have a personal conversation with a stranger, whether it's by email, a chatroom, a social networking website or instant messenger.  The National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) developed the website ‘ <i>www.webwise.ie</i>’<i>http://www.webwise.ie/</i> which provides information and resources to teachers, parents and students to help ensure that children’s online experiences are positive and safe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1248">This year's Safer Internet Day took place in February.  It is organised by the European Internet Safety Network, with the aim of promoting safer and more responsible use of online technology and mobile phones, especially amongst children and young people across the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1249">The ISPCC urges parents of children who spend a lot of unsupervised time on the internet to become better informed about online safety and to communicate with their children around the rules and boundaries of internet usage.  It is worrying that many secondary aged children do not use any privacy settings on their social network profile; clearly indicating that many young people are not taking necessary and available steps to ensure their information is kept private.  Internet usage, also possible now on many portable devices, is set to become even more popular, so vigilance is required.  In order to combat bullying simple steps can be taken such as saving the evidence, telling a parent, and crucially not responding to the bullying behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1250">In relation to bullying in schools the Department of Education and Skills deals with regulations and guidelines on this issue.  It is my understanding that the individual Board of Management of the school is the body responsible for the governance of the school, including responsibility for implementing effective policies to counter bullying.  Any complaint of bullying should in the first instance be made to the Chairperson of the Board of Management.  The Department of Education and Skills may subsequently become involved should it be necessary to review the handling of the complaint by the Board of Management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1251">My Department provided funding in 2010 towards "Addressing Homophobia — Guidelines for the Youth Sector In Ireland", developed by the BeLonG To Youth Services.  This is an important resource to help raise awareness of homophobia and to support the youth sector in preventing and addressing homophobic bullying.</p>

            <p eId="para_1253">Child and adolescent mental health services are the direct responsibility of my colleague the Minister for Health, in conjunction with the Minister of State with Responsibility for Disability, Equality, Mental Health and Older People.  I work very closely with both Ministers, as I do with all Government colleagues, in relation to children's matters.  Nevertheless, as stated, specific responsibility in relation to child and adolescent mental health services resides with the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive.  I am aware that €35m extra funding has been made available for mental health and that child and adolescent mental health services are a priority area for investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1254">Key to the development of Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services is the establishment of multidisciplinary community based teams, of which 61 are currently in place.  Special funding allocated to the HSE in 2012 will in part be used to strengthen these Community Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams by ensuring, at a minimum, that at least one of each mental health professional discipline is represented on every team.</p>
            <p eId="para_1255">In the context of the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency consideration has been given to the interface with specialist health services to improve the experience of children and families.  In this regard, the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency recently met with the HSE's Assistant National Director for Mental Health and the National Child and Adolescents Mental Health Services Advisor.</p>
            <p eId="para_1256">Finally, my Department is developing a National Children and Young People's Policy Framework in association with other Government Departments.  This Framework will be published this year and will cover a five year period.  It will address the issue of priorities across children's services and the need for linkage to ensure services are delivered in a joined-up fashion.</p>

            <p eId="para_1258">Under the Child Care Act, 1991, the Health Service Executive (HSE) is responsible for the care and protection of separated children seeking asylum until they reach 18 years of age.  Their immediate and ongoing needs as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in accordance with the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991.  The issue of trafficking legislation is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1259">Where children are identified by An Garda Síochána at a point of entry, their circumstances are investigated and if there are any concerns about the welfare of the child, they are placed into the care of the HSE.  The hostel accommodation arrangements that previously operated have been discontinued and children are now placed in fostering arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1260">The HSE is aware that separated children seeking asylum who go missing from care may be at risk of being trafficked.  The HSE and the Gardaí National Immigrant Bureau have worked closely since 2008 in this regard and have in place a Joint National Protocol on Children who go missing from care.  Joint meetings between their respective management have been held to identify risk, share information and work co-operatively in respect to this group of children.  The parties to the meetings have included Local Garda Inspectors, Garda National Immigration Bureau Inspectors, Social Workers engaged in the provision of after hours services and separated children seeking asylum teams.</p>
            <p eId="para_1261">Additional steps taken to address risk issues in relation to separated children include</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1262">collaborative interviewing at points of entry between the Gardaí and social workers.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1263">planned surveillance of those at risk of going missing from the point of entry to the initial period in placement and a range of other activities undertaken by An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">HSE management and staff have also been closely involved in collaboration with the Department of Justice and Equality in the development of the National Action Plan on Anti-Human Trafficking and every effort is being made to fulfil commitments to combat trafficking as outlined in this Plan.  My Department and the HSE are also represented on the High Level Group on Combatting Trafficking in Human Beings, which is chaired by the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">Separately the revised <i>Children First </i>National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children provides complementary guidance and deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child safety concerns more generally.  It emphasises the need to safeguard and to protect children, particularly vulnerable children.  It specifically highlights the roles and responsibilities of the HSE and An Garda Síochána, as the two agencies with statutory responsibility for child protection and forms an integral part of their existing operations and practice.  Where the HSE has identified a concern regarding child trafficking, this is referred to the Gardaí and the two statutory organisations work closely together to ensure the safety of the child.</p>

            <p eId="para_1268">Adoptions between Ireland and India must comply with the terms and conditions of the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption.  The Hague Convention is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process.  It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) performs the function of a Central Authority under the Adoption Act, 2010, in accordance with the Convention.  In choosing to deal primarily with Hague countries, the AAI has the mechanism to work collaboratively with equivalent structures in that country.  Each Central Authority has the responsibility to oversee standards in respect of those parts of the process taking place within their respective jurisdictions.  This mutual arrangement is designed to give the AAI, the Government and, most importantly, those involved in the adoption process assurance as to the standards being set and the oversight of the system.</p>

         if she will make a legislative change to address the anomaly in the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 which does not cover four and five year olds currently enrolled in primary schools; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs" eId="spk_418">
            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_1271">The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework to promote regular school attendance and tackle the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1272">All children between the ages of 6 and 16 years or until completion of 3 years post-primary education, whichever is the later, are required to attend school regularly.  Under the Act, it is the parent who is legally obliged to ensure this regular school attendance. Alternatively, where a parent chooses to educate their child in a place other than a recognised school the parent must apply to have the child registered with the Board as being in receipt of certain minimum education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1273">This legal obligation on parents and the Board's associated powers of enforcement do not extend to children under six years of age. This legislative matter is currently being examined by my Department in accordance with our mandate to align policies, legislation and resources in order to achieve better outcomes for children. The potential implications of any legislative change require careful consideration from a number of perspectives to ensure no unintended consequences arise in the provision of early childhood care and education or elsewhere in the school system. My officials will work closely with colleagues in the Department of Education and Skills and the NEWB on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1274">However, it is also essential to recognise that there is no legislative impediment to the proactive approach to early intervention currently being adopted by the Board in the event of a school attendance difficulty for children of all ages. In addition, the Deputy may also wish to note that numerous provisions of the Act do in fact cover four and five year olds currently enrolled in a primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1275">In the first instance, schools are required to record and monitor absences for all students enrolled in the school, regardless of age. Schools must report patterns of non-attendance or concerns about the educational welfare of individual students including those aged under 6 to the designated Education Welfare Officer. The Education Welfare Officer will then work with the family, the school and other services where appropriate to improve attendance and participation in school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1276">Furthermore, the Board advises that where requested, Education Welfare Officers provide advice and support to parents whose children (up to the age of 18) experience difficulty in securing a school placement or in expulsion situations. In this respect it is significant that the powers of the Education Welfare Officer to appeal school decisions regarding enrolment, expulsion and suspension also apply to under 6s.  Similarly, where it is known that a child — who is under six and enrolled in primary school — is a member of a family with established difficulties and has siblings that the Board is already working with, Education Welfare Officers will engage proactively with this child as part of the overall actions undertaken to address the particular family's complex needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1277">Since mid-2009, the Board has an expanded remit which includes responsibility for the Home School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme in DEIS schools in addition to the national Education Welfare Service.  Consequently, at local level these programmes will also seek to engage with families prior to children commencing mainstream education and throughout, irrespective of age. Both these programmes are highly targeted and will prioritise children and families requiring additional supports.</p>

The latest data available from the HSE shows that in January 2012 the total number of social workers employed in Children and Family Services providing services to children at risk and in care was 1,220 whole time equivalents.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">It is important to stress that there is no moratorium on filling social work posts within the overall public sector numbers. The National Director of Children and Families Services will apply his discretion over the course of the year to the filling of vacancies, subject to meeting overall employment targets and on the basis that services are being delivered within available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">
              <i>Child Protection Referrals</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_1283">The Deputy refers to cases being recorded on ‘risk registers'. The Deputy may be referring  to the establishment by the HSE of a ‘National Child Protection Register' as part of their Child Protection Notification System. The Child Protection Notification System records children where, following an assessment and case conference, the view is that there is a child protection risk. I have been assured that all referrals of child welfare and protection are assessed by the duty or intake team. Those cases that are identified as most serious or urgent are allocated immediately to a social worker. Other referrals may benefit from a family support service, while some cases may be referred to other services. The number of referrals to the team will always be significantly greater than those on the Child Protection Notification System as the majority of referrals are not assessed as involving a child protection risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_1284">
              <i>HSE Information Management</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_1285">Since taking office last year, I have been dissatisfied with the quality and accuracy of information available from the HSE in relation to child protection as well as the HSE's capacity to provide timely and  meaningful information. I am pleased to inform you that significant progress is now being made by the HSE to remedy this situation. A major information technology project, the National Child Care Information System, the NCCIS, has now gone to tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">The NCCIS will be the central system supporting Social Work services. As a social work case management system, it will be used to record and store the case history of every child and other clients of the service. Management information will be derived automatically from the case management system. The aim of the NCCIS project is to identify and procure an easy to use technology solution to support this type of case recording and to automatically provide management information. A first step was to develop agreed and consistent definitions and business processes across all social work offices. In this regard, a national standardised business process has been rolled out nationally. This will ensure that definitions used are consistent, for example to ensure the number of recorded  referrals relates to  individual children and not families. I am confident that the process being led by Gordon Jeyes, the HSE National Director of Children and Families Services will deliver the information needed.</p>

            <p eId="para_1338">The Health Information and Quality Authority may set standards and undertake investigations of pre-school services funded by the Health Service Executive under sections 38 and 39 of the Health Act 2004.  However, the overwhelming majority of pre-school facilities in the State are either community-run or commercial facilities, and do not fall within the remit of the Authority.  These services are regulated under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006, as provided for under Part VII of the Child Care Act 1991.</p>
            <p eId="para_1339">Services providing care for children who have not yet commenced primary school are required to notify their service to the Pre-School Inspectorate of the Health Service Executive (HSE) and are subject to inspection and report by the Inspectorate on a regular basis.  In December 2010, National Quality Standards for Pre-School Services were published by the then Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  These Standards provide a framework within which services are encouraged to work towards best practice and a child-centred approach in their provision of early childhood care and education to pre-school children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1340">My Department will continue to review and monitor the regulatory environment for pre-school services as well as supporting quality developments within the sector.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" as="#Minister_for_Children_and_Youth_Affairs" eId="spk_425">
            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_1342">One of the key objectives of my Department is to collaborate with stakeholders in monitoring and promoting the physical wellbeing of children and young people and reducing inequalities.  The Government has prioritised action to tackle childhood obesity. This requires a cross-departmental, cross-agency and multi-faceted response, from all relevant Government Departments and Agencies, including my own.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">The Department of Health has established Special Action Group on Obesity, which includes a range of relevant stakeholders, including an Official my Department. This Group focuses on a specific range of measures including Healthy Eating Guidelines, restricting the marketing of food and drink high in fat, sugar or salt to children, nutritional labelling, calorie posting on restaurant menus, the detection and treatment of obesity and the promotion of physical exercise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">My Department has a key leadership role to play in the latter through overseeing the implementation of the national play and recreation polices. Over the past few years, significant investments have been made in play and recreational facilities and a number of important initiatives have also been launched. Among these are National Recreation Week and National Play Day, both of which are aimed at promoting play and recreation and encouraging children and young people to lead less sedentary lifestyles. More recently, a Local Authority Play and Recreation Network was established. This Network brings together (for the first time) relevant staff from the local authority sector who are involved in the provision of play and recreation services to local communities. A key initial aim of this Network will be to examine the most effective means of promoting existing facilities to the public. While the prevention of obesity is not the sole focus of the Network, inevitably its work feeds in to the national policy agenda in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">Other cross-agency or cross-government initiatives include the HSE's ‘Little Steps' Campaign and ‘Get Ireland Active' website, the Department of Education and Skills ‘Active School Flag Campaign' and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine ‘Food Dude Programme'. I also understand the Department of Environment, Communities and Local Government are giving active consideration to including policies on promoting healthier and more child-friendly communities, including regulating the proliferation of fast-food outlets, as part of new national planning guidance to be published next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346">Alone no single initiative can tackle the issue of childhood obesity, but combined, they should make a difference. My Department has also published important research on overweight and obesity among children in Ireland. This research, which is drawn from Growing Up in Ireland, the National Longitudinal Study of Children can provide further guidance on where we should continue to focus our efforts.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_1349">I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 41 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">My Department is aware of the various recommendations from the universal periodic review process and specifically in relation to this matter where the State has agreed to ‘examine' the issue of prohibiting Corporal Punishment in the home setting. As the Deputy will be aware, recent research on ‘parental styles and disciplines' indicated that the practice of corporal punishment in Ireland has declined significantly in recent years with almost 90% of parents now opting for alternative means of discipline.  In addition recent research from the longitudinal study of children in Ireland shows that the great majority of parents do not use smacking as a form of discipline. The most frequently used method of discipline was discussing/explaining why the behaviour was wrong and this discipline strategy was used by almost ninety percent of mothers (88%).  Less than one percent (0.5%) of mothers reporting smacking their children "regularly or always".</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">One important approach is to support parents with  advice and guidance.  I am aware that a very wide range of parenting courses are available across the State at the present time which are delivered by various groups. Many of these courses address the issue of using alternative means of discipline and may have played a part in contributing to the significant decline in the prevalence of corporal punishment in the home setting in recent years. A review of these courses (many of which are in receipt of public funding) with a view to ensuring their effectiveness and standardising their content is a first step. The focus should be on supporting  an understanding of the best forms of discipline to underpin positive parenting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">Such positive parenting initiatives are already the subject of evaluation by my Department under the Prevention and Early Intervention and related innovative practice projects.  These evaluations will aid my understanding and support policy and funding decisions by my Department, the HSE Child and Family Services and other agencies into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_1353">I should also emphasise that Section 246 of the Children's Act 2001 already provides very clear legal deterrents to the use of excessive physical discipline within the home setting or otherwise.  Section 246(i) states as follows: <i>246.—(1) It shall be an offence for any person who has the custody, charge or care of a child wilfully to assault, ill-treat, neglect, abandon or expose the child, or cause or procure or allow the child to be assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, abandoned or exposed, in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to the child’s health or seriously to affect his or her well-being.</i>
                        </p>
            <p eId="para_1354">A common law defence of reasonable chastisement does apply but this has not prevented the Irish courts from handing down severe sentences in cases where parents have been accused and convicted of assault or use of excessive or unreasonable force. The practice of corporal punishment has been specifically prohibited in all professional care settings in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1355">There are no immediate planes to amend section 246 but this has not been ruled out.  This is one of the options open to me in examining this complex issue and it will be considered along with a range of other options in this regard in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_1358">I propose to take Questions Nos. 37 and 43 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">In July 2011, I launched the revised Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children. The Guidance deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child safety concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_1360">The revised guidance replaces the original version of Children First which was first published in 1999. The HSE as the statutory body responsible for promoting the welfare of children has in place a network of personnel to provide training, information and advice on the implementation of Children First. The HSE is currently providing a programme of information and training on the new Guidance across the country.  This includes the publication of its Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook which will facilitate implementation of the Children First Guidance and provide for greater consistency in child protection practice throughout the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1361">The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First. My Department has been working intensively to ensure the policy that is being developed will serve to protect children. I have consulted with a high level group of experts in the field, and reviewed legislation and practice internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">The policy framework to implement the decision by Government to put ‘Children First' on a statutory footing has been developed and draft heads have been provided to the Attorney General's office for her advices this week. Subject to her advice it is my intention to bring the General Scheme of the Bill  to the Oireachtas Committee for Health and Children for its consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">The framework  focusses on the promotion and wellbeing of children generally; the provision of safe services for children; cooperation amongst professionals and organisations where children are at risk of neglect and abuse and making key individuals responsible for  reporting child abuse, in line with thresholds, that is  known to them. The latter objective is aimed at removing ambivalence, reluctance or refusal by people and organisations in positions of trust and authority to report child abuse and cooperate with the relevant authorities. Work on developing the Heads of Bill is also underway.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">The policy  also takes account of  the other complementary legislative proposals to strengthen child protection, namely, the National Vetting Bureau Bill and the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Intellectually Disabled Persons) Bill. I have also taken the opportunity to consult informally with a number of experts in relation to the development of the policy in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">I intend that the legislation will reflect a broad based approach to compliance with obligations extending beyond reporting to one of safeguarding children at risk. The objective will be to ensure the greater protection of children by underpinning safe practices in organisations that provide care, education and other services to children.</p>

            <p eId="para_1369">Special care involves the detention of a child under a high court order, for his or her own welfare and protection in a special care unit with on site educational and therapeutic supports. A special care unit provides secure residential service to children and young people whose behaviour is deemed to pose a risk to themselves or others and are in need of specialised targeted intervention.  The detention of a child in a special care unit is considered as a last resort, for as short a time as possible, and when other forms of residential or community care are considered to be unsuitable. There are three designated special care units in the country — Ballydowd Young Peoples Centre (Dublin), Gleann Alainn (Cork) and Coovagh House (Limerick), which are operated by the HSE under a single national governance arrangement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1370">The HSE National High Support and Special Care Services Service Improvement Plan 2011-2014 outlines the proposed improvements in the management, development, provision  and delivery of national high support and special care services.  A number of key objectives from this Plan have been prioritised in the 2012 Business Plan. The service will seek to support and enhance social care and clinical governance, while sustaining the overall corporate administrative and operational governance. The Service also proposes to support and enhance the development of the integrated model of care, the enhanced outreach programme and the admissions and discharges policy and procedure project. These measures aim to ensure sustainable improvements during 2012. It is recognised that there will be challenges in sustaining improvements and developing new initiatives and change programmes within allocated resources. My officials liaise on an ongoing basis with Mr Gordon Jeyes and his team on this specific issue.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_1374">Under the Child Care Act, 1991(as amended) the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a statutory duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection. If a child is in need of care and protection and is unlikely to receive it at home, the HSE has a duty to ensure they receive appropriate care. The majority of children in care are in foster care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">There are a number of different types of foster care:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1376"><i>Relative foster care</i>   is when another family member, e.g. a grandparent, aunt, uncle, adult sister/brother, or family friend becomes the foster parent of the child. In this situation, the relative foster carer is assessed by the HSE.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1377"><i>Day foster care</i>   is an alternative form of care, which provides a support system in the community. The child is spared the upset of separation from their family, can go home each evening, yet benefit from the additional care offered in the foster home. There is minimal disruption to family life, while the parents can obtain practical help, advice and support from the foster parents.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1378"><i>Short term foster care</i>   provides temporary care for a child separated from their birth family. Being short term the child will, after a period, move back to their family or move on to a long term family or an adoptive family.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1379"><i>Long term foster care</i>   is needed for children who are unlikely to be able to live with their birth family, and who, for a variety of reasons cannot be adopted. Many children in long term care become so much part of their foster family that they continue to live with them until their independence, just as the birth children of the foster family do.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1380"><i>Respite foster care</i>   is provided by some foster carers to provide a break for a child’s family or another foster family.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1381"><i>Emergency foster care</i>   is provided for children who need care in a crisis situation with no advance notice. The children may be coming into care from their own home or from another placement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">There are also foster carers for children with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">
              <i>General Foster Care</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_1384">Anyone interested in becoming a foster carer applies to the fostering team in their local social work department. Prospective foster carers or applicants undergo an assessment and training process to establish their suitability and competence as future foster carers. The assessment procedure is carried out by a social worker from the fostering team and will include Garda vetting, a medical assessment, personal interviews in the applicant's home and if the applicant(s) have children, the social worker will also talk to them about being part of a foster family.  Garda vetting includes adult children and extended family members residing in the home.   The applicant(s) will also be asked to provide references who will be interviewed by the social worker as part of the assessment process.   The social worker will prepare a report based on discussions with the applicant(s), their family, the referees and the medical report. This report will be shared with the applicant(s) and the applicant(s) views will be represented. This report  is then presented to the foster care committee (or Foster Care panel)  for approval, including a recommendation as to the age of the child and type of foster care suitable to the applicant(s). It should be noted that some foster carers may have gone through the assessment and training stage with a recommendation for approval but the application may not have been  formally approved by the foster care committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">
              <i>Relative Foster Care</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_1386">When a child is being placed in foster care, the suitability of a placement with relatives is explored in the first instance. Where the HSE is satisfied that an immediate placement with relatives is in the interests of the child,  such placement may occur before full approval of the committee is in place. Such emergency placements are provided for in the regulations. Prior to placement, the  relative is assessed by a principal social worker, including early garda vetting. This is followed by a full assessment and approval by the foster care committee as outlined above.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">The Health Service Executive (HSE) compiles and publishes monthly performance reports which include statistics in relation to children in foster care.  Information in relation to the number of foster carers is published on a quarterly basis and the HSE reported that there were 3,769 foster carers, of whom 3,138 were approved by the Foster Care panel under Part III of the Child Care (Placement of Children in Foster Care) regulations, 1995, at the end of December 2011.  Data for Galway is not included in these figures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">I am informed by the HSE that  85.6% of the unapproved foster carers (540 foster carers) were relatives of the young people in foster care. In these cases, an initial assessment is completed, followed by the full assessment and approval process as above.</p>

            <p eId="para_1397">My Department is leading an initiative to develop and implement a planning model for local interagency working to improve outcomes for children.  This is known as the <i>Working Together for Children </i>initiative.  The purpose of this initiative is to work towards better developmental outcomes for children through more effective integration of policies and services in particular through the Children’s Services Committees at local level.  </p>
            <p eId="para_1398">Children's Services Committees bring together a diverse group of agencies in local county areas to engage in joint planning of services for children.  These include representatives from the HSE, local authorities, An Garda Síochána, VECs, National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, Irish Primary Principals Network, NEWB, and other organisations who provide services to children and young people.

            <p eId="para_1399">My Department has developed a number of guidance supports for the Children's Services Committees to assist in their development.  These include a toolkit which provides advice on the composition of a committee, membership, roles and information and guidance on how to develop a children and young people's plan for their area.  A Governance Framework deals with matters such as national and local governance structures and reporting arrangements.</p>

         the action she has taken to date and the action she plans to take in order to address the difficulties that prospective parents currently engaged in the international adoption process are encountering with the Adoption Authority of Ireland due to both the level of applications received by the authority and the fact that the board of the AAI sits only every second week; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1402">The Adoption Act, 2010, which was commenced on 1st November 2010, coincided with Ireland's formal ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. The purpose of the Adoption Act, 2010, is to improve standards in both domestic and intercountry adoption.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">The Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI) is an independent statutory body charged with implementing the Adoption Act, 2010. The Authority has responsibility for the direct operational implementation of legislation and Government policy. It has a quasi-judicial role and is independent in its decision-making functions. In this regard the Authority's functions encompass a wide range of responsibilities including:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1404">the issuing of declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt under Section 40 of the Act, following the examination of all relevant supporting materials;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1405">the issuing of transitional declarations of eligibility and suitability to adopt, under Section 63 of the Act, to applicants who had initiated the adoption process under previous legislation whose adoption was not effected but still in progress on the day of commencement of the new Act;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1406">the recognition of intercountry adoptions effected outside the State, having regard to the circumstances pertaining in each individual case, under Section 57 of the Act;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1407">the conversion and recognition of certain Hague Convention adoptions that do not have the effect of terminating a pre-existing legal parent-child relationship under Section 68 and 69 of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">In addition to the above the Authority has responsibility for the management of the various stages of the intercountry adoption process including the forwarding of applicant adoption packs under Article 15 of the Hague Convention,  the receipt of the proposed match under Article 16 and the approval of the match under Article 17 (which provides that a child may be placed with the prospective adoptive parents). The issuing of an Article 23 certificate by the country of origin is the confirmation process between contracting States that the adoption has been made in accordance with the Hague convention. The AAI has no role in this process but relies on the certificate as part of the recognition process under Hague.</p>
            <p eId="para_1409">In considering matters relating to intercountry adoption the Authority must satisfy itself that the adoption complies with the terms and conditions of the 1993 Hague Convention, which is a co-operative agreement drawn up to allow countries to mutually support one another in protecting the best interests of children in the intercountry adoption process. It is designed in such a way as to allow for mirrored mechanisms and structures to mutually assure countries of the safety and standard of intercountry adoptions in those countries.  The AAI has been extremely proactive in developing relationships with their counterparts around the world and this will continue. The building of such relationships will help to bring greater clarity to the intercountry adoption process generally, including the timescales involved for adopting from different countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1410">It is a matter for the Authority to determine how best to structure its operations to perform its functions. The Adoption Act, 2010, states that the "Authority shall hold as many meetings as are necessary for performing its functions but shall hold at least 12 meetings a year."  The Board currently meets fortnightly. This meeting schedule place an onerous workload on the Board members of the AAI and the Board meets more frequently than almost any other State Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">My Department is currently reviewing the staffing levels of the AAI in the context of the Employment Control Framework for the public sector and the recent public service retirements. A new CEO has recently been appointed to the Authority and this appointment is key to progressing very important issues regarding the overall resourcing of the Authority. It should be noted in this context that the AAI has been allocated €3.3m in State funding this year in recognition of the new responsibilities set out in the Adoption Act, 2010. This is an increase of some 35% of the level of funding provided in 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_1413">Under the Child Care Act 1991 children should, in the first instance, be supported to remain with their families. Children should only be taken into care where the HSE has identified abuse or the risk of abuse, including neglect that cannot be prevented or resolved without the child being received into care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1414">The HSE has informed me that in 2010 1,251 children were admitted to care due to various factors resulting in a parental inability to cope. In the main these children are received into care on the voluntary request of their parent/s.</p>
            <p eId="para_1415">The various factors which can result in parental inability to cope include: physical or mental health problems, disability,  drug or alcohol addiction  problems, and in some cases financial difficulties. However, a parental inability to cope financially is on its own not a reason for a child to come into care. Family support services work with parents where there are difficulties with budget management to support them provide a stable family situation for their children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1416">My officials met with the Department of Social Protection in September of last year,  at which this matter was discussed across a broader agenda.  It was agreed that there should be no case in which children enter the care system due to financial need rather than cases of  neglect, abuse or the risk of abuse.  If any such cases are identified by the HSE, my officials will work with the Department of Social Protection and the HSE to ensure that children are only received into care on the basis of risk to their safety and welfare that cannot be alleviated by financial support alone.</p>

            <p eId="para_1418">Since taking office, both myself and officials of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs have had a very considerable number of meetings and communications  with the Attorney General and her officials to progress this commitment.  A draft wording is being prepared by the Office of the Attorney General in co-operation with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. We are jointly focused on ensuring that the proposed Referendum reflects the deliberations and conclusions of the Joint Committee and the commitment in the Programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">The Referendum on Children's Rights is a Programme for Government priority. The Government is satisfied that the nature of this referendum is such that it will be a stand-alone matter, to allow for a full debate on the issue and so that people clearly understand the facts. The referendum wording will be along the lines of that proposed by the All-Party Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children (JCCAC). From the outset of deliberations in relation to the constitutional amendment on children's rights the need for all party consensus on this topic was highlighted. As a member of the JCCAC I can attest to the level of all party co-operation afforded the then Government in the work of the Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">It is my intention to consult with parties by way of briefings as the output of the deliberations emerges.   I also envisage that the issue will be considered by the Joint Committee on Health, Children and Youth Affairs. It is my intention to seek approval from Government for the proposed wording, with a view to holding the referendum this year.  A decision on the holding of the referendum on children's rights will be mindful of the need to have a referendum in relation to the fiscal compact and that a referendum in relation to the abolition of the Seanad is also a Government commitment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1422">The Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) was established under the Health Act, 2007 and replaced the Social Services Inspectorate. HIQA is an independent authority responsible for driving quality, safety and accountability in residential services for children, older people and people with disabilities in Ireland.  HIQA develops standards, monitors compliance with standards and carries out investigations where they believe there are reasonable grounds to do so.  HIQA inspects children's residential centres, special care units and foster care settings against the National Standards for Children's Residential Centres, National Standards for Special Care Units and the National Standards for Foster Care. HIQA publishes their inspection reports on their website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">In July 2010, the Government decided to prioritise the inspection of child protection by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). These inspections will be undertaken against standards to be developed by HIQA as provided for under  Section 8 of the Health Act 2007. HIQA commenced work on drafting National Standards for the Protection and Welfare of Children  and convened a Standards Advisory Group to advise on their development. The Advisory Group, which comprises a wide representation of people from the health and social care sector met several times and continues to advise HIQA on the draft standards.   My department has also been involved in advising HIQA.  I understand that HIQA is to commence the public consultation on the draft standards today.  The draft standards will then be amended based on feedback received from the consultation process and the final draft standards will be forwarded to me for approval.  It is expected that the first inspections by HIQA based on the standards for child protection will take place by the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1425">Under the Child Care Act, 1991, the Health Service Executive has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection. The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. The vast majority  of children in care are in foster care and residential care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">Some children have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties, in some cases as a result of injury,  accident or disability  or in others due to their childhood experiences. The care needs of these children are generally met by directly provided services or services commissioned by the HSE within Ireland. From time to time the HSE places children in single residential placements with specialised therapeutic inputs from child psychiatry and psychology to meet the needs of the children. There are  three  designated special care units in the country: Ballydowd in Dublin, Glenn Álainn in Cork and Coovagh House in Limerick where children are detained on order of the high court for their own safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">In addition, there are two designated national High Support Units at Crannog Nua, Portrane in north County Dublin and Rath na nÓg in Castleblayney, Co. Monaghan.  These units provide, through on site education, higher staff ratios and therapeutic inputs  an individualised programme of support for children and young people with exceptional needs through the provision of a time-limited, therapeutic intervention in a secure or non-secure environment as appropriate. The HSE has developed a business plan for the delivery of a national Special Care Services with a particular focus on improving governance and development and innovation. The business plan highlights the importance of improving the model of service delivery to develop a service that can cater for the needs of these most vulnerable and challenging children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">For  a small number of children, the HSE is on occasion,  required to make arrangements for the placement of children in care and treatment  facilities outside of the State, primarily in the UK, to allow for access to an individually tailored mix of psychiatric treatment, care and therapeutic services not available in this country. This is done on as infrequent a basis as possible and only where such placement is considered to be in the best interest of the child.  I should emphasise that the referral of persons abroad for specialised therapeutic interventions is an established feature within our health and social care system and decisions in each case are made in the best interests of the individual.  The level of requirement for these services is closely monitored by the National Director and my officials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">I am advised by the HSE that there were 4 young people detained in secure accommodation in Scotland, 1 in secure accommodation in England, and 2 in a Mental Health facility in England as of 13 March 2012.  It is considered that it would be inappropriate to provide further details regarding  the names and locations of these placements. The HSE ensure that these placements are suitable and the child's social worker visits regularly, and makes arrangements for family or carers of the child to also visit. The units in which the children are placed are inspected and  regulated by their national authorities and the HSE is attentive to the standards of care delivered in these specialised units.</p>

            <p eId="para_1431">The Government currently supports the provision of early childhood care and education through three support programmes, the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme.  These programmes are implemented by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">The ECCE programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.  Almost every pre-school service in the State is participating in the programme, ensuring it is available to children in all areas.  About 66,000 children, that is approximately 95% of the eligible cohort, are availing of the free pre-school provision at this time. In line with the Programme for Government, my Department has made a significant commitment to maintaining the universal free pre-school year and to developing early childhood care and education as resources allow.  In this context the funding for the pre-school year has been increased from €166 million in 2011 to €175.8 million in 2012 to cater for changing demographics, and provide for the increased number of children in the relevant age cohort.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">It is also my objective to incrementally develop the ECCE programme over the term of this Government as resources permit. A key element of this is the implementation of the Workforce Development Plan by the Early Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located in my Department.  The Workforce Development Plan identified different distinct groups including new entrants to the workforce who wish to become appropriately qualified for specific occupational roles and responsibilities, and unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who want to achieve a Level 5 award. For new entrants to the workforce the publication of Common Award Standards at NFQ Levels 4, 5 and 6 is a welcome development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">Programmes of learning developed to meet these new award standards will incorporate national practice frameworks and will reflect national policy objectives, thereby ensuring that graduates of these programmes are fully prepared to enter the workforce.  Training providers have begun to develop new programmes to meet these award standards and, subject to validation by FETAC, the first of these, the FETAC Level 5 Major Award in Early Childhood Care and Education, will come on stream shortly through the VECs.  For unqualified practitioners in the current workforce who want to achieve a Level 5 Award, my Department part-subsidises an on-line course which was developed by one of the Voluntary Childcare Organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">Officials from my Department worked closely with the Department of Education and Skills in the development of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy, and I welcome the recognition of the role of early childhood care and education. The Strategy was formally launched by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, last year. My Department is committed to incentivising the early years sector to acquire additional skills in oral language competency development for young children once this minimum qualification requirements of the ECCE programme have been met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">The CCS programme supports community-based childcare services by enabling them to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families. These not-for-profit facilities provide childcare at cost price with reductions to qualifying parents based on the level of subvention they are entitled to under the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">The CETS programme was introduced in September 2010.  Under the CETS programme, funding is provided by my Department to participating childcare services in return for the provision of free childcare places to qualifying students and trainees.  The eligibility criteria under which students and trainees qualify under the programme is determined by FÁS and the VECs.    Approximately 2,800 full time equivalent childcare places are currently funded under the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">I am pleased that all three support programmes are being retained despite the ongoing need to reduce Government expenditure. While there has been some revision to payment rates and subvention levels I am satisfied that the programmes are being implemented in a way which generates efficiencies and improvements in outcomes, within available resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">In December 2011, the Government announced a new Capital Funding Programme for childcare facilities.  This grant will provide capital funding of €6m this year to both community and private childcare providers currently participating in one or more of the childcare programmes The capital grant, which provides funding of up to €50,000 for maintenance works, is designed to ensure that childcare facilities are in a position to continue in the future to deliver quality care and education as required under the programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">Future developments relating to early years care and education will be considered during preparation of the new National Early Years Strategy 2012.  This Strategy will be developed during 2012 and will cover a range of issues affecting children in their first years of life.</p>

            <p eId="para_1442">The Report into the Roscommon case was published by the HSE on 27th October 2010. Since its publication the HSE has given assurances that practice in assessing and responding to child welfare and protection concerns is being applied to the necessary standard across all regions. The HSE has already stated that it is committed to learning from this and other reports to ensure that services are strengthened to help protect children to the greatest extent possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1443">One of the Recommendations from the Inquiry was for a National Audit of Neglect Cases to be completed, commencing with Roscommon. The HSE in order to progress this recommendation had engaged the services of an external consultant to assist the HSE to devise a method of audit that would be applied nationally.  The consultant has completed a Review of Practice and Audit of the Management of Cases of Neglect in Roscommon which commenced in September 2010, and has highlighted both strengths and challenges.  Positive outcomes included:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1444">Well established multidisciplinary arrangements and organisational structures which facilitated teamwork and communication,</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1445">Initial assessments routinely completed,</p>

            <p eId="para_1447">The Review found that in a majority of the cases, staff and managers displayed a commitment to early assessment of need and provided a range of supports to assist children and families, resulting in improved parenting capacity and better outcomes for children.   The Review concluded that the challenges involved are similar throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom including the need for more authoritative social work, senior managers reviewing and auditing files, national supervision policy implementation and establishing thresholds for legal intervention in cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1448">A Review of Progress following Audit was undertaken after three months and again this had many positive outcomes.  Achievements included:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1449">The recommendations of the Inquiry Report and the Review of Practice and Management of Neglect are being implemented via an Interdisciplinary Child Care Steering group.</p>

            <p eId="para_1454">As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children's outcomes is my primary objective. Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are priorities to enhance children's opportunities for social and educational development, to support parents and to help to break the inter-generational cycle of disadvantage. The network of 107 family resource centres that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department have an important role in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">This year some 66,000 children throughout the country will benefit from the free preschool year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme, while some 26,000 children, in low income households, will benefit under the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme, which provides places in a range of childcare settings in local communities.  Under the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, a further 2,800 places are available for children of parents in training programmes. In 2012, some €230 million in all will be provided by my Department for these schemes designed to support young children's social and educational development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">My Department also supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services, including programmes for young people living in disadvantaged communities.  In 2012, funding of €56.6 million will be invested in provision for youth. The programmes are delivered by the voluntary youth work sector. They include ‘out of school' projects in non formal education settings and projects which aim to divert ‘at risk' young people in disadvantaged areas from the dangers of substance misuse, as well as the provision of community centres, youth facilities and sports clubs which are used by some 535,000 young people throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">The National Educational Welfare Board, under the remit of my Department, as part of its responsibilities is charged with developing the School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme to address the needs of children who may experience difficulties in fully participating in education.  These programmes and the results of pilot projects to enhance children's development in Tallaght, Northside and Ballymun, which are jointly funded by my Department with a philanthropic organisation, will inform the Government's plans to develop a new area based approach to child poverty.  My priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Agency.</p>

The Troika have agreed to engage in a process with Irish Officials to produce a common paper which will consider all options for restructuring the notes in terms of the source of funding, the duration of the notes, the interest rate etc. In tandem with this review, the European authorities have opened a discussion on how best the Irish banking system and the Irish State can benefit from having further improvements to certain elements of the banking sector.

            <p eId="para_1472">On 23 November 2011, the European Commission published a Green Paper on Stability Bonds which set out three main options: the full substitution by Stability Bond issuance of national issuance, with joint and several guarantees; the partial substitution by Stability Bond issuance of national issuance, with joint and several guarantees; and the partial substitution by Stability Bond issuance of national issuance, with several but not joint guarantees.  The objective of the Green Paper is to have a broad debate on the issues raised.  The paper sets out the likely effects of each of these approaches on Member States' funding costs, European financial integration, financial market stability and the global attractiveness of EU financial markets.  It also considers the risks of moral hazard posed by each approach, as well as its implications with regard to Treaty change.  Stability Bonds are seen by some as a potentially highly effective long-term response to the sovereign debt crisis; however there are those that are concerned that Stability Bonds would remove the market incentive for fiscal discipline and encourage moral hazard.  The Commission has emphasised the fact that any move towards introducing Stability Bonds would only be feasible and desirable if there were a simultaneous strengthening of budgetary discipline.  The extent of this strengthening needs to correspond to the ambition of the approach chosen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">Following ECOFIN on 30 November 2011 the European Commission said it would carry out further analysis on this issue and revert in due course to Council.  This is very much the start of a process.  Some of the options identified in the Green Paper would require Treaty changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">This is a very complex issue that requires ongoing in-depth analysis of all the implications.  Ireland will play a full and constructive part in this process.</p>

This automatic correction mechanism is to be based on a common set of principles to be proposed by the European Commission, concerning in particular the nature, size and time-frame of the corrective action to be undertaken.  The automatic correction is to be triggered in the event of a significant observed deviation from the country-specific medium-term budgetary objective (MTBO) or the adjustment path towards this MTBO.  The Commission has not yet come forward with a set of detailed principles in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">The Deputy will be aware that the fiscal compact contained in this Treaty requires contracting parties to <i>inter alia </i>apply fiscal rules governing balanced budgets over the economic cycle and the pace of reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio in the event that this exceeds 60 per cent.

I am advised that where property collateral is disposed of, the proceeds are generally applied to reduce the outstanding loan balances and no profit is booked in the accounts in respect of the disposal of such collateral, except in cases where cash in excess of the total amount paid by NAMA for a borrower's overall loans has been recovered.  Up to Q3 2011 NAMA had also sold a number of loans to third parties and where a loan is sold to a third party, a gain/loss on the disposal of the loan is also booked.  I am informed that a gain of €132m has been booked in its accounts that reflects profits on the disposal of loans and excess cash recovered on the disposal of property collateral up to end Q3 of 2011.</p>

            <p eId="para_1499">I am advised by NAMA that the decision as to whether to work with a debtor or to appoint a receiver is primarily determined by NAMA's assessment, in line with its commercial mandate, of how it can best optimise debt recovery for any particular debtor.  If it decides that debt recovery is best achieved by working with the debtor, it is NAMA's practice to allow debtor companies to retain certain overhead costs from rental or other income produced by their assets where this is necessary for the company's operations.  In a minority of cases, where assets are under development and not yet producing income, funds are advanced to debtors to cover essential overheads pending the completion of the projects involved.  Overhead costs typically fall into two categories: Costs associated with the repair and maintenance of properties, insurance premia, local authority rates and professional fees.  These are essential costs which would be incurred regardless of whether the assets were being managed by debtors or receivers.  Overhead costs also include an allowance for the debtor's remuneration package and the salaries of staff employed by the debtor to manage the assets.  The alternative in these cases is to appoint receivers and I am informed by NAMA that receiver costs tend to be substantially higher than debtor and associated staff salary costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">These overhead payments are a necessary and cost-effective means of preserving and enhancing asset values.  In the cases involved, NAMA concluded that working with debtors was a less costly option than enforcement and the employment of external asset managers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">The level of overhead is only agreed following a thorough and rigorous evaluation of the debtor's business plan by NAMA.  Each cost element is reduced to the minimum.  The level of overhead sanctioned by NAMA typically represents a very significant reduction on the level which prevailed prior to NAMA acquisition of the loans: typically, reductions of 50% to 75% in overhead costs have been imposed by NAMA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">NAMA has collated data on approved overhead costs where agreement had been reached by 31 December 2010 relating to 41 debtors who managed a total PAR debt of €18.6 billion or 25% of the total NAMA portfolio.  Approved overheads for the 41 debtors was €55 million.  This represents less than 0.3% of the PAR debt involved.  Of the €55m in overhead costs, I am informed by NAMA that the bulk of the costs related to essential costs associated with maintaining and preserving the assets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">NAMA is currently collating data on all debtor overhead costs that it has approved and intends to publish this analysis at a later stage.</p>

I have also been informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it has come to their attention that occasions have arisen where relief of the residual VRT was allowed to qualifying individuals on the purchase of used vehicles in the State where no VRT was paid in the first instance, e.g. on the purchase of a used vehicle by a qualifying individual where the relief was granted to an earlier owner of the vehicle who had previously qualified for the relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">Consequently procedures were put in place to ensure that relief for the payment of VRT and VAT will only be allowed to qualifying persons or organisations in situations where the person or organisation has borne or paid VAT, VRT or residual VRT in respect of a vehicle or in respect of the adaptation of a vehicle.  If the VRT on a vehicle has been fully refunded at an earlier date under the scheme, there is no residual VRT available to be refunded on a subsequent sale to a second qualifying person and this should be reflected in the price of vehicle at the time of resale.</p>

         the options that are available to a retired person with an approved minimum retirement fund who wished to transfer it to an approved retirement fund; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Michael Noonan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1511">Approved Minimum Retirement Funds (AMRFs) are part of the Approved Retirement Fund (ARF) regime introduced in 1999.  The ARF regime gives a considerable degree of control, flexibility and personal choice to certain categories of individuals in relation to the drawing down of benefits from their pension plans.  These choices include the options to purchase an annuity, to receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate), or to invest in an ARF or an AMRF, subject to certain conditions.  Access to these flexible options was extended to all main benefits from retirement benefit schemes (other than Defined Benefit arrangements) in the 2011 budget and in the Finance Act 2011.  The changes made in 2011 have particular relevance for ordinary members of occupational defined contribution pension schemes in respect of the main benefits from such schemes, as up to the passing of Finance Act 2011, the only option available to them in respect of those benefits had been the purchase of a retirement annuity after taking the tax-free lump sum.  These individuals now have the choices referred to above depending on their particular circumstances.  It should be borne in mind that the option to invest in an ARF or AMRF as opposed to purchasing an annuity may not be appropriate for everyone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">Under the regime, the options to invest in an ARF, or receive the balance of the pension fund in cash (subject to tax, as appropriate) are subject to conditions.  The conditions include the requirements that the individual be over 75 years of age or, if younger, that the individual has a guaranteed level of pension income (specified income) actually in payment for life at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option is exercised.  The Finance Act 2011 increased the guaranteed level of pension income required from the previous fixed amount of €12,700 introduced in 1999, to a variable amount equal to 1.5 times the maximum annual rate of the State Pension (Contributory) bringing the "specified income" limit to €18,000 per annum at present.  The purpose of the specified income limit is to ensure, before an individual has unfettered access to their remaining retirement funds via an ARF for example, that they have the security of an adequate guaranteed income throughout their retirement.  The change to the specified income limit introduced in Finance Act 2011 was strongly signalled in the National Pensions Framework, which was published in March 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1513">Where the minimum specified income test is not met, and an individual does not wish to purchase an annuity, then an AMRF must be chosen into which a "set aside" amount must be invested from the pension fund equal to 10 times the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory) —€119,800 at present — or the remainder of the pension fund, after taking the tax-free lump sum, if less.  Prior to the introduction of the Finance Act 2011, the "set aside" amount was fixed at the first €63,500 of the pension fund or the remainder of the fund after the tax-free lump sum, if less than that amount.  The purpose of an AMRF is to ensure a capital or income "safety net" for individuals with pension income below the specified income limit throughout the period of their retirement.  The funds in an AMRF can be used by the owner at any time to purchase an annuity.  On death of the AMRF owner, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF and any remaining funds may be passed on in a tax efficient way to a surviving spouse and/or children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1514">Prior to the introduction of the Finance Act 2011, if the minimum specified income test was not met at the time the option to effect the ARF or cash option was exercised and the individual placed a "set aside" amount in an AMRF, that capital sum was effectively "locked in" and could not be accessed by the individual, other than to purchase an annuity, until he or she reached 75 years of age (at which point the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF), although any income generated by the fund could be drawn down subject to tax.  This was the position even if the minimum specified income test was met after retirement.  The Finance Act 2011 changed this rule so that where the minimum specified income test is met at any time after retirement and before the age of 75, the AMRF automatically becomes an ARF with full access to the funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1515">As a transitional measure, the Finance Act 2011 allows the previous lower guaranteed income requirement of €12,700 per annum to continue to apply for a period of three years from the date that Act was signed into law (6 February 2011) for individuals who had retired before that date and who already had an AMRF, as well as for individuals who availed of the deferred annuity purchase option, had exercised the ARF (or cash) option within a month of the date of passing of the Finance Act 2011 and who in exercising that option had transferred the requisite amount to an AMRF within that one-month period.  This means that if such individuals satisfy the guaranteed income requirement of €12,700 within that three-year period, their AMRF becomes an ARF.  After this three-year period expires, the new higher guaranteed income test will have to be satisfied before the AMRF can become an ARF.  The amount of guaranteed income required to meet the test will change in line with any future change in the maximum annual rate of State Pension (Contributory).</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">Where individuals do not meet the new specified income test and choose not to take the AMRF option, they can of course purchase an annuity.  Depending on the particular scheme rules, the annuity can be designed to include features that best suit the individual's particular needs, in terms of how long the annuity payments may be guaranteed after death, whether they revert to a dependant after death and whether they remain at the same level or increase during payment.  The changes that were made in the 2011 budget and the Finance Act 2011 seek to ensure those in pension arrangements to whom the flexible ARF options on retirement have been extended will have choices which best suit their particular circumstances.  In making the changes, there was a concern to ensure that the parameters and rules governing the extension are set in a way that avoids an increase in the risk of income poverty in old age.  The deferred annuity purchase option was introduced with effect from 4 December 2008 for members of defined contribution occupational pension schemes and allowed them to defer the purchase of an annuity for an initial period of two years, in light of the fact that pension funds had been adversely affected by the falls in equity markets and the more general falls in asset values.  The deferral option was operated administratively by the Revenue Commissioners.  The period of deferral was subsequently extended to 6 March 2011 — one month beyond the passing into law of the Finance Act 2011.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
         if, given that Bank of Ireland‘s annual report shows that it has €417 million of outstanding subordinated debt liabilities, the holders of these €417 million subordinated debt liabilities represent subordinated note holders who gambled that he would not go through with using the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 against note holders who did not participate in the subordinated buyback in July 2011; his views that this means that the taxpayer injected €291 million more into Bank of Ireland than would have been necessary had he used the powers available to him to force those who did not voluntarily participate in the nominal 70% haircut into participating.

            <p eId="para_1528">Bank of Ireland's (the "Bank") Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2011, states that the outstanding subordinated liabilities in issue amount to €417 million.  Adjusting for fair value accounting (€8 million) and excluding preference stock (€39 million) which is not a debt instrument, results in an outstanding unguaranteed subordinated debt amount of €370 million.  As previously noted to the Deputy, it is not for the Minister to comment of the investment decisions made by the holders of subordinated debt in the Bank.  The powers granted pursuant to CISA continue to be in effect and will be used in the future if necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">With regard to achieving burden sharing with subordinated bondholders in all of the banks including the Bank, I draw the deputy's attention to the fact that total capital generated from burden sharing with bond holders since 2008 is in excess of €15 billion. In relation to the Bank's €4.2 billion regulatory core tier 1 capital requirement arising as a result of the 2011 Prudential Capital Assessment Review ("PCAR 2011"), the net cost to the State was €0.2 billion which was sized to maintain a minimum 15% shareholding in the Bank and is less than 5% of €4.2 billion requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">As a first step to meet the PCAR 2011 €4.2 billion of regulatory core tier 1 capital, the Bank took various burden sharing measures with subordinated debt holders.  This generated ca. €2 billion of capital for the bank.  On 11 July 2011 the bank announced the size of the rights issue which was sized by reference to the remaining capital required for PCAR 2011 less the value of the remaining subordinated debt (€0.5 billion) where it was intended to seek further burden sharing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">As a result of further subordinated liability burden sharing in August and September 2011 the bank's remaining capital required to meet PCAR 2011 reduced to €350 million. As the deputy is aware, I noted on 23 November 2011 that the Bank had to raise this €350 million of core tier 1 capital by 31 December 2011 to satisfy the requirements of PCAR 2011. In that context I considered using the powers available under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act 2010 as amended ("CISA") to apply for a Subordinated Liabilities Order ("SLO") to generate, from subordinated liabilities, the residual capital required by the Bank by 31 December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">On 2 December 2011, the Bank announced that it had raised approximately €350 million of core tier 1 capital, through its tender offer and purchase of capital market securities issued by the Bank.  As previously noted to the Deputy, as a result of the Bank's announcement and the fact that the totality of the outstanding PCAR 2011 capital required by 31 December 2011 had been raised, the grounds for use of the powers under CISA to raise that capital through burden-sharing no longer arose.</p>

            <p eId="para_1534">NAMA presents its financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS").  It is required to do so under EU legislation due to the fact it has listed debt securities. In accordance with IFRS NAMA uses the effective interest rate methodology ("EIR") for the recognition of interest income on its loan portfolio from the date due diligence is completed.  For non-due diligence loans, income is recognised in accordance with the contractual interest received to the date due diligence on the loans is completed.  The acquisition value of the loans was determined in accordance with the NAMA Act and related valuation regulations.  As part of the valuation process the loans acquired were independently valued in accordance with a collateral based valuation model and there was an independent valuation of the property or collateral securing the loan.  The valuation date for the value of all property assets in this collateral based model was 30 November 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1535">NAMA determined the effective interest rate for the loans it acquired using this collateral based valuation model which projects the property related cash flows and the realisation of the property collateral.  The model assumes the realisation of the property using its value at the end of November 2009, as adjusted to reflect its long-term economic value where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS"), NAMA has set the effective interest rate for the loans it has acquired based on the expected cash flows over the life of those loans determined at the acquisition of those loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">NAMA has informed me that the effective interest rate methodology does not require NAMA to forecast a terminal value for property securing its loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">The ongoing recoverability of income recognised in accordance with the effective interest rate methodology, is reviewed as part of NAMA's detailed annual impairment review.  To the extent that following the acquisition of the loans, there is a change in the timing or amount of NAMA's expected cash flows, whether it is favourable or unfavourable, IFRS requires that NAMA adjust the carrying value of the loan and recognise an impairment charge or gain in its accounts.  NAMA is currently carrying out its detailed annual impairment review for the 2011 year-end.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">NAMA intends to introduce a semi-annual calendar accounting impairment review of its loan portfolio commencing 30 June 2012.</p>

In that context, it was not possible to advance all applications for capital funding concurrently and the project for the school referred to by the Deputy was not included in the five year plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">My Department is aware that the school referred to by the Deputy is currently located in rented accommodation and that a new school is required to meet its long term needs.

            <p eId="para_1590">The school referred to by the Deputy is a private ABA centre which is not funded by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1591">My Department's policy is focused on ensuring that all children including those with autism can have access to an education appropriate to their needs, preferably in school settings through the primary and post primary school network. This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers who may draw from a range of autism-specific interventions, including ABA, special needs assistants, and the appropriate school curriculum with the option where possible of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. As each child with autism is unique it is important that children have access to a range of interventions so their broader needs can be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated. Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school. These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios. Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">The Deputy may be aware that my Department previously funded 13 centres through an ABA pilot scheme. All of the centres which participated in this scheme have been granted recognition as special schools for children with autism and operate in line with my Department's policy. The pilot scheme was established in the absence of the  network of school-based special classes for children with autism which is now available. The establishment of this network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country has been a key educational priority in recent years. There are now in excess of 450 special classes for children with autism attached to mainstream and special schools.</p>

         if he will provide a breakdown of funding of projects in drugs task force areas, as set out in B8, Vote 26 — Education and Skills, in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2012; the criteria used to allocate funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1630">There are six projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas which receive allocations from subhead B8 of my Department's Vote.  Four of the projects are administered by the VECs in Dublin City, Dublin County (2) and Dun Laoghaire; my Department also provides each VEC with an allocation towards administration costs.  The remaining two projects are administered directly by my Department.  The following table shows details of the allocations provided to the six projects in 2011 and 2012.  A review of the six projects was carried out in 2011.  As a result of the review, four of the projects have received allocations in 2012 similar to their allocations in 2011.  Two of the projects have had their 2011 allocations reduced by 10%.  These projects involve outside facilitators delivering the substance use aspect of the Social, Personal and Health Education curriculum in schools.  Following the review, it was considered that, in line with best practice guidelines issued to schools by my Department, the classroom teacher is the best placed professional to work consistently with students on the SPHE programme.</p>

         the way a certificate of trade competence could be practically fast-tracked and made affordable for persons who have worked in one of the construction related trades such as carpentry, painting and decorating, tiling, plastering, bricklaying and so on, for many years but who have not attained any papers to demonstrate their experience and capacity for the purposes of seeking work outside the State.

            <p eId="para_1668">I understand that an individual with trade related work experience wishing to validate their competence can do so through the FAS Apprenticeship system as follows: 1. Register as an apprentice.  To become an apprentice an individual must secure employment with a FÁS approved employer who will then register them as an apprentice with FÁS.  FÁS will not register an individual unless the application is made through a FÁS approved employer.  2. Apply for Recognition of Prior Learning.  A registered apprentice can apply to FÁS for recognition of trade related work experience and may be granted exemptions from some of the 7 phases of their apprenticeship.  They must submit a portfolio of evidence outlining their work history and experience for review by a Subject Matter Expert who will advise FÁS if exemptions should be awarded or not and by how much the 4 year period of apprenticeship should be reduced.  3 Practical/Theory test.  As part of the review of the application, the apprentice may be required to undergo a practical and/or theory test to assess their competence. 4. Complete Phases 6 and 7 of the apprenticeship FÁS does not award full exemptions from the apprenticeship programme.  The maximum exemption an apprentice can be awarded is from Phases 1 to 5 inclusive.  All exemption applicants will be required to complete Phases 6 (10 weeks off-the-job in college) and Phase 7 (12 weeks on-the-job with employer) of their apprenticeship as a minimum.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">I am informed that FÁS currently does not charge a fee to process apprenticeship phase exemption applications.  For further information about apprenticeships, individuals should contact their local FÁS Services to Business Office.</p>

Access to some records was granted while access to others was refused and certain provisions of the Act were relied upon in that respect.

            <p eId="para_1673">The Deputy will be aware of the demographic challenges that we are facing.  Total enrolment in both primary and post-primary schools is expected to grow by almost 70,000 between now and 2018 — over 45,000 at primary level and 25,000 at post primary — and will continue to grow up to at least 2024 at post-primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">As such enrolment increases are not uniformly distributed nationally, my Department has carried out a study of the country using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection in addition to recent schools' enrolment data to identify the areas it is projected that there will be significant enrolment increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">The Deputy may be aware that currently all applications received nationally for large scale capital funding are assessed against published prioritisation criteria which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  Under the criteria, each project is assigned an appropriate Band Rating which reflects the type of works required and the urgency attaching to them.  Details of the criteria concerned are published on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">However for purposes of the 5 Year Plan, new school building projects as well as major extensions have been identified and prioritised on the basis of meeting demographic needs in areas where such needs have been identified. Other criteria that were taken into account included factors such as whether projects, already in the Department's architectural process, were technically ready to proceed to tender and construction in the duration of the Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">I also wish to advise the Deputy that where an immediate enrolment need in an area has been identified e.g. the appointment of an additional teacher and where school's existing accommodation cannot provide for this growth, the Department will be prepared to consider applications by schools for capital funding for additional classrooms mainly on a devolved basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1680">For the Deputy's convenience, a list of all major capital projects and their current status for Co. Donegal schools follows for ease of reference.  In view of the need to ensure that every child has access to a school place, the delivery of major school projects required to meet demographic demand will be the main focus for capital investment in the coming years.  It is not possible, therefore, to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the projects at application stage at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">The Deputy may also be aware that five Donegal schools have been invited to take part in the Prefab Replacement Programme which I announced recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">In addition, many Donegal schools have received devolved funding to provide additional accommodation and/or replace existing accommodation in recent years. This information is not readily available but should the Deputy have a query in relation to a specific school or schools, he should contact the Department for further information.</p>

            <p eId="para_2134">In order to facilitate the public service wide review of allowances, Departments were required to submit information, including costs, on the allowances and premium payments specific to their Department or sector, and where a Department considered it necessary to retain an allowance or a premium payment, a thorough and considered business case, before 31 January 2012.  Pending completion of the review, sanction/delegated sanction for the payment of an allowance or premium payment for which a business case has not been approved by this Department to any beneficiary was withdrawn from 31 January 2012 until further notice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2135">I intend to bring proposals to Government shortly in relation to the findings of the review.  Urgent business case requests are being processed in so far as is possible in order to ensure that the work of the public service is not unduly disrupted during the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_2277">Workers at the Lagan Brick factory in Kingscourt, Co. Cavan have been involved in a protest outside the company's premises in a dispute over the decision by the company to close its operation on 15 December last with the loss of 29 jobs.  The union wanted to retain maximum employment at the plant and secure satisfactory redundancy terms for any workers that lose their jobs.  Subsequently, representatives of the company and the trade union SIPTU attended conciliation talks at the Labour Relations Commission on 10th and 16th January. These talks were reconvened on 6 February following consideration by both sides of an examination of the trading position of the company undertaken by an independent expert.</p>
            <p eId="para_2278">Following the 6th of February hearing, SIPTU stated that it would be seeking the intervention of the Labour Court in this dispute following the failure to reach agreement in the talks at the LRC.  However, I understand that Lagan Brick subsequently issued a statement to the effect that the company did not intend to pursue further negotiation with worker representatives in this matter.  I understand that, in a ballot conducted on Thursday 1st March, SIPTU members in Lagan Brick voted almost unanimously to take strike action in response to the company's decision not to attend the Labour Court, and that seven days' notice of strike action was served on Lagan Brick by SIPTU on 2nd March.  Official strike action began at Kingscourt on 10 March and SIPTU intends to continue the action until a satisfactory conclusion is reached.</p>
            <p eId="para_2279">I regret that the company has decided against pursuing a negotiated settlement and has declined to attend a Labour Court hearing, contrary to good industrial relations practice in that regard.  In my view, the experience and expertise of the Labour Court offers the most appropriate and effective avenue for resolving such issues.  I would urge the parties involved in this dispute to work together to break the current impasse by utilising the established machinery for dispute resolution, who are available to assist at short notice.</p>

            <p eId="para_2311">The person concerned was refused Disability Allowance by the Deciding Officer following an assessment by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that she was medically unsuitable for Disability Allowance.  An appeal was opened and in the context of that appeal, her case was reviewed by a second Medical Assessor who also expressed the opinion that she was unsuitable for Disability Allowance.  I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all the evidence, disallowed the appeal of the person concerned by way of summary decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2312">Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.  Following the submission of additional evidence the Appeals Officer has reviewed the case and has decided to set aside his decision and re-open the appeal by way of an oral hearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2313">There has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 2010 and 2011 when the intake rose to 32,432 and 31,241 respectively.  This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person's oral hearing will be heard, but she will be informed when arrangements have been made.  The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.</p>

        <b> Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
         her plans to extend the homemaker’s scheme to include persons whose youngest child is over 12 years in 1994 because these women are currently entitled to nothing.

          <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_503">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Joan Burton)</from>
            <p eId="para_2322">The homemaker's scheme was introduced in 1994 to make qualification for State pension (contributory) (SPT) easier for those who take time out of the workforce for caring duties.  The scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children under 12 years of age or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2323">The scheme will not, of itself, qualify a person for a pension.  The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, pay a minimum of 260 contributions at the correct rate and achieve a yearly average of at least 10 contributions on their record from the time they enter insurance until they reach pension age, must also be satisfied.  From April 2012, 520 contributions (10 years) will be required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2324">As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.  There are currently six people of working age for every pensioner and this ratio is expected to decrease to approximately two to one by 2050.  In addition, those aged over 65 will account for a greater proportion of the population while the proportion who are of working age is expected to decline.  With increases in life expectancy, more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  The period for which an average pension will be paid will be greater than the period for which a pension is paid at present.   This has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2325">For this reason, and in the context of the current fiscal crisis, there are no plans to extend the homemakers scheme as outlined by the Deputy.   I am, however, currently considering the introduction of a system of homemaker's credits to replace the current disregard from 2012 and allow backdating to 1994 for the purpose of the averaging system that will continue until the total contributions system is introduced in 2020.  This means that people reaching pension age could have credits rather than disregards applied to their records to cover periods of care since 1994 (up to a maximum of 20 years).</p>
            <p eId="para_2326">People who do not qualify for the homemakers scheme as they had caring duties prior to the introduction of the scheme in 1994 may qualify for a reduced rate of SPC  as a yearly average of only 10 along with 10 years' paid contributions over a working career is sufficient to qualify for a minimum SPT.  Alternatively, they may qualify, depending on their means, for a higher rate of State Pension (Non-Contributory).</p>

            <p eId="para_2328">The average time taken to award new Family Income Supplement (FIS) claims in 2009 was 8 weeks, in 2010 was 10 weeks and in 2011 was 17 weeks. The average time taken to award renewal FIS claims in 2009 was 8 weeks, in 2010 it was 10 weeks and in 2011 it was 18 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2329">The average time taken in January 2012 to award a new FIS claim was 19 weeks and to award a renewal FIS claim was 20 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2330">The increase in average time taken to award new and renewal FIS claims is mainly due to an increase in the number of applications received over the period.  Total claim intake rose from 46,542 in 2009 to 48,110 in 2010 and rose again in 2011 to 51,214 — a total of 10% over the period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2331">The Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS in light of the current waiting times:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2332">Existing processes and procedures are reviewed on an ongoing basis with the explicit objective of reducing delays in claim processing;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2333">The ongoing staffing requirement is being kept under review in light of the continued strong claim intake;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2334">Additional temporary staff have been recruited to help reduce the backlog;</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2335">Overtime working is being applied where feasible;</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">These measures are aimed at reducing the number of claims on hand and the average waiting time for a decision.  The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by the Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2338">Figures in regard to the average length of time taken to process appeals, broken down by scheme, and  by type of decision are given in the tables which follow this reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">In an effort to reduce the processing times, the Department appointed 12 additional Appeals Officers during 2010 and 2011.   In addition, a further 10 Appeals Officers, formerly employed by the Community Welfare Services (CWS) of the Health Services Executive joined the Office in October 2011as part of the integration of the CWS appeals services into the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  This brought the total number of Appeals Officers to 39.</p>
            <p eId="para_2340">The processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period, including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2341">I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.</p>

         her views on whether the rent supplement limits currently being applied are considerably below the market rents for accommodation in the Dublin 5 and Dublin 13 areas.

            <p eId="para_2683">The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term income support to eligible tenants living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  Since 2005 rent supplement expenditure has increased from €369 million to a provisional outturn of €503 million in 2011.  The number of persons claiming the allowance increased from almost 60,200 persons in 2005 to over 96,800 as at end 2011, a 61% increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_2684">The new maximum rent limits were set after an analysis of the most up to date market data available.  The emphasis of the rent limit review was to ensure that maximum value for money for tenants and the taxpayer was achieved whilst at the same time ensuring that people on rent supplement are not priced out of the market for good quality private rented accommodation.  As the Department currently funds approximately 40% of the private rented sector it is essential that State support for rents are kept under review, reflect current market conditions and do not distort the market in a way that could increase rent prices for others such as low paid workers and students.  Where a claim is under review and the rent is above the new maximum limit the customer is being asked to contact the landlord to renegotiate the rent.  Where a landlord does not agree to reduce the rent to the new rates departmental officials will discuss the options open to the tenant up to and including seeking alternative accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2685">The Department is monitoring the impact of the implementation of these new limits.  Although the new limits have only been in place for just over two months the current trends would suggest that the market is adjusting and the level of accommodation available at these limits is increasing.</p>

            <p eId="para_2692">Every claim for rent supplement is determined having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant.  Any person seeking a rent supplement must first satisfy the Department's representative that they have a housing need that they are unable to meet from their own resources.  In addition, the Department must be satisfied that the residence is reasonably suited to the residential and other needs of the claimant.  The Department must also be satisfied that the rent payable is reasonable having regard to the nature, character and location of the residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2693">In a case where parents have joint custody of a child, the needs of both parents to have adequate accommodation to look after the child are taken into account when an application for a rent supplement is being determined.

            <p eId="para_2695">Notification of a proposal to designate The River Nanny Estuary and Shore Special Protection Area (SPA) was publicly advertised by my Department in January 2008.  The designation process permits landowners and others to appeal the inclusion of specific areas within Special Protection Areas.  The inclusion of an area at the southern end of the SPA was the subject of such an appeal.  Consideration of appeals is confined strictly to their ornithological merits.  A review by my officials of available bird-usage data for the site justifies a revision of the boundary to exclude from the SPA part of the land that was subject to the appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_2696">The designation process for this SPA will be concluded with the making of a Statutory Instrument for the site which will be  publicly notified in due course.

The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for RTÉ to rollout a digital TV network to the same extent as the analogue TV network.

            <p eId="para_2699">RTÉ has developed a website providing information on the Saorview service including coverage information and this is available on its website <i>www.saorview.ie.</i>  In addition, RTÉ has developed a new “free-to-air” satellite service unique to Ireland to ensure the RTÉ TV services are available to the remaining 2% of the population.  RTÉ is not obliged to provide a satellite service and is doing so on its own initiative.  It is my understanding that, with this satellite service, Ireland will have a national TV network covering 100% of the population for the first time.</p>

Planning delays slowed down a number of expected grid reinforcement dates and through no fault of their own, project developers were not in a position to build out their projects in the original timeframes envisaged.

            <p eId="para_2710">Electric Ireland operated a voluntary microgeneration scheme for domestic consumers with an upper limit of 11kv in size which closed for new applicants at the end of February.  The scheme operated at a rate of 19 cent per kilowatt hour for Electric Ireland customers.  This is above the wholesale rate of around 7 cent per kilowatt hour.  Despite being asked to consider introducing such a scheme by the Commission for Energy Regulation, no other electricity supply company was prepared to introduce a microgeneration scheme.  Given that the electricity market is now fully liberalised it was up to the individual supply companies to introduce a scheme of this kind.</p>
            <p eId="para_2711">The Programme for Government commits to consideration of a feed in tariff for micro-generators producing electricity for their own homes, farms and businesses and selling surplus electricity to the grid.  The programme also states that the tariff will not be significantly above the single energy market price for electricity.  Any increased electricity costs arising from extending such a scheme to PSO supports would have to be borne by all electricity consumers to fund it and typically microgeneration tends to require significantly higher tariffs than large scale generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2712">The latest figures from ESB Networks are that 588 import/export meters have been installed, which are required for microgeneration.  Electric Ireland has advised that they have 448 customers in receipt of payments under their domestic microgeneration scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2720">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge by 31 March 2012, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  Interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2721">The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 provides for a number of exemptions and waivers from payment of the household charge.  The exemptions from payment of the household charge are—</p>

            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2727">Residential property which an owner has vacated due to long-term mental or physical infirmity (e.g. elderly person that has moved into a nursing home).</p>

            <p eId="para_2930">Local Garda management has put in place a number of policing initiatives to prevent and disrupt anti-social behaviour, including the sale, distribution and use of drugs in the locality. The use of such initiatives has been acknowledged by the business community in the area as resulting in a reduction in this type of behaviour. An Garda Síochána liaises with the relevant authorities at local drug treatment centres and with the transport services providers to reduce the opportunity for such offences occurring. There is also ongoing liaison through the Community Policing Unit with local residents and the local business community.</p>
            <p eId="para_2931">The provisions of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Acts are also fully utilised by members of An Garda Síochána to address public disorder and other anti-social behaviour, including unlawful begging.</p>
            <p eId="para_2932">I am further informed that any incidents resulting in suspected child abuse or neglect are dealt with under the protocols currently in place between An Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive (HSE), the provisions of which are strictly adhered to, with ongoing liaison between Garda management in the relevant Divisions and local management within the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_2933">The areas referred to are also subject to regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes units, including the Community Policing and Garda Mountain Bike Units, local Detective and Drug Unit personnel, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_2934">Local Garda management closely monitors such patrols, and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in these areas to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public. Garda management is satisfied that a full and comprehensive policing service is being delivered to the communities in the locality and that current structures in place meet the requirements of the delivery of an effective and efficient policing service to those concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_2935">Insofar as broader crime questions are concerned, I can further inform the Deputy that I intend to build on existing work in order to put in place a National Anti-Crime Strategy, arising from the White Paper on Crime consultation process. This will provide a strategic framework for all of the measures in place to tackle crime, including prevention, intervention and enforcement measures, as well as measures to support victims. My intention is to publish this Strategy later this year and that it will help to guide our work to tackle crime into the future.</p>

However, what I can advise the Deputy is that for use by the RDF, the Department has 10 permanent rentals and 30 part time rentals in place including part time use of parish and community halls as well as some commercial premises.

            <p eId="para_2959">The Raphoe Office is now one of 16 enhanced regional offices delivering schemes and services across the country.  These offices provide an integrated service across the veterinary, AES, Single Payment Scheme and Forestry business units.</p>
            <p eId="para_2960">A management review of local offices in 2009 reported that with improved business processes, the Raphoe office could satisfactorily provide these services with some less administrative staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_2961">Up until now, there were no options available to my Department to redeploy surplus staff in or around Raphoe and, as a temporary measure, other work unrelated to the normal work of a Regional Office was sent to Raphoe to ensure all staff were fully occupied.  The possibility has now arisen to redeploy a number of the surplus staff to other locations and my Department is pursuing that possibility in accordance with the terms set out in the Croke Park Agreement.</p>

            <from>Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)</from>
            <p eId="para_2971">I propose to take Questions Nos. 186 and 193 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2972">The Children First National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children, published in 2011, provides greater clarity and guidance for individuals and organisations in identifying and responding appropriately to child abuse and neglect.  It also sets out what organisations that care for or work with children should do to ensure they are safe whilst in the organisation. The HSE Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook is a practice based publication aimed primarily at social workers, although it may be informative to others working in child protection.  The HSE, as the body with statutory responsibility for the welfare of children, has a key role in terms of providing training, advice and information to external organisations on the operation of Children First.</p>
            <p eId="para_2973">Both the Children First Guidance and the HSE Practice Handbook recognises the respective responsibilities of the HSE and An Garda Síochána in the assessment and investigation of allegations of child abuse and/or neglect and the importance that all personnel in both services work closely and collaboratively to ensure the protection and welfare of children, which is of paramount importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2974">The Government has committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First. My Department has been working intensively to ensure the policy that is being developed will serve to protect children. I have consulted with a high level group of experts in the field, and reviewed legislation and practice internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2975">The policy framework to implement the decision by Government to put "Children First" on a statutory footing has been developed and draft heads have been provided to the Attorney General's office for her advices this week.  Subject to her advice it is my intention to bring the General Scheme of the Bill  to the Oireachtas Committee for Health and Children for its consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2976">The policy  also takes account of  the other complementary legislative proposals to strengthen child protection, namely, the National Vetting Bureau Bill and the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes Against Children and Intellectually Disabled Persons) Bill. I have also taken the opportunity to consult informally with a number of experts in relation to the development of the policy in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2977">The framework focuses on the promotion and well-being of children generally; the provision of safe services for children; cooperation amongst professionals and organisations where children are at risk of neglect and abuse and making key individuals responsible for  reporting child abuse, in line with thresholds, that is  known to them.  The latter objective is aimed at removing ambivalence, reluctance or refusal by people and organisations in positions of trust and authority to report child abuse and cooperate with the relevant authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2978">I intend that the legislation will reflect a broad based approach to compliance with obligations extending beyond reporting to one of safeguarding children at risk.  The objective will be to ensure the greater protection of children by underpinning safe practices in organisations that provide care, education and other services to children. The Government is also committed to a significant programme of reform of our family support, child welfare and child protection services.  This is intended to achieve national consistency with services across the country delivered according to national standards which will be externally evaluated.  This reform will lead to a new Child and Family Support Agency which will provide the dedicated focus on family support, welfare and child protection. The implementation of these reforms will allow for the best possible services to be delivered within the resources available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2979">I have also received a copy of HIQA's draft Standards for Child Welfare and Protection which are published today for an eight week public consultation, following which they will be sent to me for my approval. The standards focus on how the HSE Child and Family Services carry out their responsibilities for child welfare and protection under the Child Care Act, 1991.  Inspections will commence against these standards later in the year.  As an indication of this government's priority  to improve child welfare and protection services, HIQA have been allocated additional inspection posts to carry out this important work.  These posts are currently being filled, and inspectors are undergoing an induction and training programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2984">I am aware that children and young people are susceptible to bullying which can emanate from a variety of sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2985">My Department funds, in association with the Department of Social Protection and the Central Statistics Office the National Longitudinal Study of Children "Growing up in Ireland".  In 2009 the study published its report on the lives of 9 year olds in which it found that bullying and victimisation represent a worrying aspect of a substantial proportion of children's experiences with their peers. Research suggests that bullying is quite pervasive in Irish schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2986">Most commonly children reported that they had been verbally bullied, followed by exclusion and physical bullying. Bullying via written messages and electronic means was less prominent. Boys and girls experienced similar rates of victimisation with boys more likely to experience physical and verbal bullying, while girls were more likely to have experienced exclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2987">Children First, the National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children identifies that bullying in schools is a particular problem and offers some guidance on the issue. It highlights the need for school management boards to have a policy in place to deal with bullying, and to ensure that the teachers are aware of this policy and of procedural guidelines to deal with it.</p>
            <p eId="para_2988">Serious instances of bullying behaviour, whether by other children or by adults should be reported to the HSE Children and Family Services in accordance with the procedures outlined in Children First.</p>

            <p eId="para_2991">I propose to take Questions Nos. 189 and 192 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2992">The Youth Affairs Unit of my Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.  Funding of some €56.626m is available in 2012 to support the provision of youth services and programmes to young people throughout the country including those from disadvantaged communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2993">The main objectives of the Youth Affairs area are to develop and implement coherent, coordinated and relevant youth policies and strategies to support the youth sector in providing effective non-formal education and developmental opportunities for young people through which they can enhance and develop their personal and social skills and competencies. My Department is currently developing a new youth policy framework and it is my intention that this framework will facilitate and promote co-ordination and cohesion across Departments and services throughout the country which will enable the most effective use of the resources available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2994">My Department is also developing a new strategy for children and young people.  It will build on <i>Our Children — Their Lives, </i>  Ireland’s first children’s strategy which was published in 2000 and it will cover the period from 2012 to 2017.The new children and young people’s policy framework is being developed in a holistic way to comprehend the continuum of the life-course from infancy, through early and middle childhood, to adolescence through to early adulthood, in keeping with my Department’s responsibilities for children and young people. It will be the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2995">The views of a wide range of interests including children themselves will shape the development of the children and young people's policy framework over the next six months. It will be informed by the results of a consultation, in 2011, in which almost 67,000 children and young people throughout the country participated; the advice of the National Children's Advisory Council which comprises representatives of a range of organisations, both statutory and non-statutory, that work with children and young people; and the views of  the National Children's Strategy Implementation Group which includes nominees of Government departments and state agencies that develop policies and deliver services for children and young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_3005">I have received a copy of the recent Report to which the Deputy refers and I have asked the Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health to examine it.</p>
            <p eId="para_3006">The Forum on Fluoridation, which reported in 2002, advised that the fluoridation of piped public water supplies should continue as a public health measure. One of the recommendations of the Forum was to amend the Regulations regarding fluoridation of public water supplies to redefine the optimal level of fluoride in drinking water from 0.8 to 1.0 parts per million (ppm) to between 0.6 and 0.8 ppm. Regulations were introduced in 2007 to give legal effect to this change.</p>
            <p eId="para_3007">The Irish Expert Body on Fluorides and Health advises that the balance of scientific evidence worldwide confirms that water fluoridation, at the optimal level, does not cause any ill effects and continues to be safe and effective in protecting the oral health of all age groups. The report of the EU Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER), published in June 2011, has not made any findings of negative health or environmental effects concerning fluoridation of water. There are no plans to discontinue the policy of fluoridation of public water supplies, which continues to make an effective contribution to oral health in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_3009">I am determined to address the issues which cause unacceptable delays in patients receiving treatment in our hospitals. In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.  The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.</p>
            <p eId="para_3010">As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or day-case surgery.</p>

            <p eId="para_3062">The National Service Plan was based on an assumption that 3,000 whole-time-equivalent staff or some 3,500 people would leave following the ending of the "grace period" which is not an early retirement scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3063">As set out in the National Service Plan, the estimated additional cost of these retirements comprised:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3064">An increase of €44m for lump sum costs.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3065">Additional cost of funding pensions of €68m.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3066">Estimated loss of salary contributions for superannuation and the pension levy amounting to €18.9m.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3067">A provision of €16m has been built in to a replacement factor for critical posts.  The number of posts which can be supported by this funding depends on the salaries of those being appointed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3068">Whilst additional funding was provided through the Estimate process for the once-off additional cost of the lump sums, the other costs will be met by the HSE from the consequent payroll savings of those leaving.  The figures in the Estimates assumed that the net saving to the Exchequer would amount to €57m.</p>
            <p eId="para_3069">The latest figures available from the HSE indicate that some 4,500 personnel retired between September 2011 and February 2012.  Once the data on actual lump sums and pensions is available, the HSE will be in a position to run a new cost estimate associated with this level of retirements.   It is possible that there may be a growth in costs although some of these lump sums will have already been paid in 2011.  The Executive still has to determine how many of the retirees were actually on the payroll on retirement as this will have a consequent effect on the payroll savings associated with the retirements.  In addition, staff with premium pay or allowances, are entitled to the ‘best 3 years out of the last 10' to be reckoned for pension purposes, which requires 10 years payroll records to be examined for each person.  In a recent sample of 413 retirees, 87% had premium pay or allowances.  In this context it may be some time before the HSE can accurately determine the full financial impact of the retirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_3070">Planning for the impact of the end of the "grace period" began last autumn. Contingency plans have been developed locally for hospital and community services, reflecting risk assessments undertaken by each hospital/community manager. These have been reviewed at regional and national levels to ensure appropriate measures are in place across all services, with the focus on protecting and maintaining critical front-line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3071">In order to achieve this, it is essential that changes in work practices and in how services are organised are pursued in the first instance. These include staff redeployment, streamlining of management structures, changing business processes and integrating services, as well as rostering and skill-mix changes. Some recruitment of new staff is also taking place to ensure that key specialist services are maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_3079">The National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) was requested by the HSE National Directorate of Clinical Strategy and Programmes in 2011 to commence the planning and development of a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme. The NCSS has experience in developing population health based screening programmes and manages the BreastCheck and CervicalCheck programmes. The screening model proposed by the NCSS and agreed with the HSE National Directorate of Clinical Strategy and Programmes is one that is largely contract based and reliant on third party service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">The HSE's National Service Plan 2012 commits to continuing the implementation of the national diabetic retinopathy screening programme and will link in the "Red House" scheme, as the HSE has already proposed.  I have asked the NCSS to provide my Department with commencement dates as soon as possible and I remain confident in the HSE's commitment to this programme.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Kathleen Lynch)</from>
            <p eId="para_3096">The Health Service Executive (HSE) is working with the Jack and Jill Foundation to identify and prioritise the needs of each child on a case-by-case basis to ensure that no child is hospitalised for want of adequate home support, provided by either the Foundation or the HSE. In relation to the child referred to by the Deputy in his question the HSE in conjunction with the Brothers of Charity Services has endeavoured to facilitate the family's wishes to meet his needs within the resources available. The HSE wrote to the family on 23 February asking them to clarify how they wished the HSE to proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3097">The Jack and Jill Foundation service is part of a range of services provided to families funded by the HSE and its other contracted service providers for children with life limiting conditions (approximately 1,300 children in total).  Many children availing of services provided by the Jack and Jill Foundation also avail of other specialist hospital based and community based health supports and disability services. The HSE is committed to working with the Jack and Jill Foundation in a spirit of partnership and positive collaboration. The HSE aim is to ensure that all children with life limiting conditions would receive services on an equitable basis and through a standardised approach to be progressed through the children's palliative care steering group. The National Policy, "Palliative Care for Children with Life — Limiting conditions in Ireland" will ensure a national approach to the provision of services for children with life limiting conditions. All services and service providers will be governed by this approach. The implementation of the Policy's key recommendations involves the appointment of Ireland's first Paediatric Palliative Care Consultant and the appointment of 8 outreach nurses to support the care of children in the home. Dr. Karen Ryan has been appointed as the Paediatric Palliative Care Consultant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3098">The HSE has recognised the need to increase the level of consistency and standardisation in the way both early intervention services and services for school-aged children with disabilities are delivered.  The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of existing therapy resources to geographic based teams for children (0-18 years). The project is organised at national, regional and local level and includes representatives from the health and education sectors, service providers (statutory and non-statutory) and parents working together to see how current services can be reorganised. A detailed action plan is being implemented with the following objectives:</p>
            <p eId="para_3099">One clear pathway to services for all children with disabilities according to need.</p>
            <p eId="para_3100">Resources used to the greatest benefit for all children and families.</p>

            <p eId="para_3104">I propose to take Questions Nos. 225 and 226 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3105">Considerable work was undertaken by my Department and the HSE in recent months to manage and plan for the impact of retirements from the health sector in the lead-up to the end of the ‘grace period' on 29 February last. The focus was and continues to be on protecting and maintaining critical front line services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3106">Within the HSE, contingency plans were developed locally for both hospital and community services, reflecting risk assessments undertaken by each hospital/community manager. These have been reviewed on an ongoing basis at regional and national levels to ensure appropriate contingency measures are in place across all services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3107">The HSE National Service Plan 2012 acknowledged that there will be an inevitable and unavoidable reduction in services this year because of the scale of the financial and staffing challenge facing the health service including ‘grace period' retirements. It is, therefore, necessary to be as innovative and flexible as possible in order to mitigate the impact on services of reduced budgets and staffing. The mitigation measures which are in place include the backfilling of certain critical posts. However, the priority is to reform how health services are delivered, in order to ensure a more productive and cost effective health system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3108">The need for dynamic and proactive management of the reduced budgets and staff will remain and will continue throughout the year. In this context, the National Service Plan will, therefore, be subject to ongoing review.</p>
            <p eId="para_3109">The Government has determined that, in line with its commitment to reduce the size of the public service, health sector employment numbers must be reduced by about 2,300 WTE to approximately 102,100 WTE in 2012. The moratorium on recruitment is necessary to achieve this reduction. There are no plans to change this policy.</p>

The HSE has also reported to me that the backlog in processing 2011 applications has been reduced by 77% since January. Regarding developments since the beginning of March, I am pleased to say that, as part of their continuing efforts to resolve difficulties, the HSE has put in place a plan, covering the period March and April, for the resolution of key issues in the medical card scheme's application processing system. This plan is in addition to the review of the centralisation project that is being undertaken by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on behalf of the HSE to develop medium and longer term plans.
