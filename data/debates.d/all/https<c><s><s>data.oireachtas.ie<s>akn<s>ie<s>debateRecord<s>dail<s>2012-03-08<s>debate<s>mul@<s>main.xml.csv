In fact, the majority of workers heard this on Bloomberg TV this morning.  As the Government is the dominant shareholder in the bank, will the Tánaiste confirm that number and tell us when an announcement will be made?  When was he informed of this announcement and what actions has the Government taken since to minimise the number of job losses?  When we add this figure to the 750 redundancies in Bank of Ireland, 950 in Aviva and 950 in Ulster Bank, the losses completely obliterate all of the gains achieved by IDA Ireland this year and all of the gains the Taoiseach highlighted in the quarterly household survey yesterday.  It is clear that we there is a crisis in the financial sector.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I have been informed that the management of AIB will be communicating with its employees this morning to the effect that there will be 2,500 redundancies which it hopes to achieve on a voluntary and early retirement basis.  My first concern is for the employees of AIB because obviously this is upsetting news for all those who work in the bank.  I understand there is a process in place whereby management will be communicating directly with them.  There were meetings early this morning between management and the union representing the bank staff, the IBOA, and between the Department of Finance and the IBOA.Clearly, the announcement of redundancies will have a major impact on those who work in the bank and our immediate concern must be for them.  However, we must also examine - this will be the Government's priority - how to create new jobs in the banking and financial services industry.  In the Government's jobs action plan, announced some weeks ago, we have set a target of 10,000 new jobs in banking and financial services.  We need to work on attracting investment into the banking and financial services industry in order to create these jobs.  In addition, we must consider the fact that there will be a large number of people with banking skills and experience who will be available for such employment.  As Deputies know, the Government has revised its whole approach to what happens when people become redundant, with the introduction of the Pathways to Work system.  What we envisage is that work will be done on how to adapt the skills and experience of those who are losing jobs in the banking system in order that they will be available and ready for new opportunities that will arise in the financial services sector.In response to the Deputy's question, our concern today is for the employees of AIB who are receiving this bad news, but the Government's focus is on what can be done to create new jobs and attract new investment into the financial services sector in order to provide new employment opportunities for those who are losing their jobs in the bank and for those who have lost jobs in other banks.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The news has just been confirmed as the Tánaiste was on his feet.  AIB is stating that if it cannot achieve voluntary redundancies, it will seek enforced redundancies.  When was the Government informed of the figure and what action did it take?  I share the Tánaiste's aspirations that the people concerned will be taken care of, but we have had this information on a crisis in the financial industry since October.  These are skilled personnel.  Unfortunately, the workers on the front line have taken the brunt.  What strategies are in place for them and on what strategies has the Government been working since October?  Why did the people concerned have to hear about the redundancies on Bloomberg TV?  It is completely inappropriate that workers who have given their best should hear about redundancies in this way.  As the chief shareholder in the bank, will the Government stand over enforced redundancies if this has to happen?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Everybody understands that as a result of the restructuring required in the banking sector - on a day like today I do not want to get into where the fault lies for what happened in the sector; that is a matter for another day - there will have to be reductions in the numbers working in Irish banks.  The Deputy mentioned October and since October the Government has been working on what we need to do in order to generate new employment in the banking and financial services sector.  That is why when we drew up the jobs actions plan, we targeted in particular the financial services industry as an area where we need to create additional jobs.  The strategy we are pursuing is one of attracting investment into that sector.  That is why we have been talking so much about the necessity for stability not only in our economy but around the euro and in the eurozone in order that new jobs can be created in that sector here.

That is why we will work with people who have lost and who are losing their jobs.  In the area of education and training, for example, we will examine the needs of the people who are losing their jobs and how the skills and experience they have can be adapted to take up new job opportunities.

Some 210 people have emigrated every single day of this Administration so far.  Some 12,000 were wrapped around the RDS in Dublin in a queue last weekend in a effort to leave this country to obtain work.  We saw thousands of people queueing from early hours in Cork yesterday morning to do the same.  The curse of emigration we saw in the 1950s and 1980s and that ravaged this country is back with a vengeance due to this Government's policies.

The majority of these people feel like they are falling off a cliff.  If one contrasts this desperately sad situation with the back-slapping fest that went on yesterday within Government, it was unbelievable to see.

The strategy involves, first, attracting investment into the country.  That means we have had to restore the country's reputation to get investment back into the country.  We are seeing some signs of new jobs being announced and investment being generated and returning to this country.  That is why we have published a strategy for the creation of the jobs here - the jobs action plan announced by the Government.  That is why later this morning we will announce a further initiative which is aimed at attracting more jobs into this country.  Every single day this Government is working at trying to get investment into the country and jobs generated here.

In the last quarter of last year we saw an increase, for the first time since 2007, in the number of people at work, but we are not going to exaggerate that.  There is a great deal more to do to get the jobs we need in order that people do not have to emigrate and those who have can return.  I assure Deputy Tóibín and the House that this is the Government's focus.  Now that we have stabilised the economic situation and the very difficult set of economic circumstances we inherited a year ago, we are working on recovery for this country and on getting employment and investment back into it.  That is why we need to assure investors that there is stability in Ireland, Europe and the eurozone.

The Government is spending seven times more money on this promissory note than all the money it will spend in the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the county enterprise boards for one year in total.  That shows us directly where the priorities of the Government lie.  It is time the Government started investing in and fixing the real economy.  Does the Tánaiste not agree that the money going into the promissory note would be better spent reducing unemployment, ending emigration, creating competitiveness and tackling disadvantage?  It is time to go beyond the argument that we have no other choice and that it is the fault of the previous Government.

We all know there is a huge and unacceptable level of unemployment in this country and that there is a huge level of emigration of young people in particular from this country.  We have to create jobs and attract investment in Ireland.  I do not want to exaggerate what we have done and what we are doing but since this Government was formed this time last year, almost to the day, the country's economy has returned to growth for the first time in four years, we have seen in the last quarter an increase in the number of people who are at work for the first time since 2007, and we have stabilised the economic situation in the country.  What we now have to do is to move on from that to bring in investment to get jobs created, and we have set out our strategy for that.It is not a case that we are operating in hope.  We have set down a very clear strategy about how we are going to do that.  It is contained in the action plan for jobs that we published.  In respect of people who have lost or are losing work, we have set down a strategy about how we will move people who are out of work back into employment through education and training, job experience and so on through the Pathways to Work initiative.  We have announced repeatedly a range of measure which are aimed at ensuring funding and credit are available to small and medium-sized businesses in order that they can create jobs.One of the biggest difficulties we have had in recent times in regard to attracting investment - I know this to be the case because in the course of my work as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade I talk to people who are contemplating investing in this country - is not uncertainty about the future of the Irish economy but uncertainty about the future of the European economy.  That is why we on this side of the House and in government say that we need to pass the fiscal stability treaty in order that-----

Thank you for restoring order.I would like to raise an important issue, gangland crime, shootings and murders and the destruction and intimidation of entire communities across the country.  In the past 24 hours two men have been shot dead in County Kildare and in recent weeks a young woman was shot in Dublin.  The spiral of violence continues.  There is massive intimidation which occurs under the radar in our communities every day, yet society seems to move to the next issue.  These murders would have caused an outcry 20 years ago.  Why is there this great silence from the Government and the policing establishment today?  Why are disadvantaged communities being left on their own to deal with this issue every single day?  What are the Tánaiste and his Government colleagues going to do to stop gangland killings?  Do we have to wait for the deaths of more innocent people before there is a real response to the issue?  Will the Tánaiste speak out about the huge demand in wealthier parts of the country for drugs that is creating this problem?  What is the Government going to do to prevent such crimes?  Does the Tánaiste think closing Garda stations is going to assist the prevention of crime?

They have to be condemned and rejected by every right thinking person in the country.  That is certainly the view of the Government which is supporting the Garda Síochána in its work in detecting and bringing to justice those responsible for gangland crime.  It is also trying to ensure communities work with and support the Garda in detecting those responsible for such crimes in order that, wherever possible, they can be prevented.I do not agree that the closure of Garda stations is responsible for gangland crime.  In this modern society we need gardaí out in communities working closely with them to ensure they have the necessary information and evidence to charge and bring those responsible before the courts in order that they can be dealt with.  I agree with the Deputy on the shootings reported.  As far as the Government is concerned, it is most certainly not a case of moving on when such appalling murders are committed.  Our priority is to support the Garda Síochána and we call on others to do the same in order that gardaí will be able to do their job and bring those responsible to justice.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I did not say the closing of stations was responsible for gangland crime, rather I said we needed prevention to be part of the strategy, for which we need Garda stations.  There are towns with a populatin of 20,000 to 30,000 who only have access to eight gardaí.  I do not accept we can have an effective policing force in such cases.  We need action on this issue.  We need policing action, but we also need a community response.  Does the Tánaiste accept that part of the solution to the problem of drugs and gangland crime is to deal with groups like the CityWide Drugs Crisis Campaign which has great experience of dealing with the drugs issue in communities?  How many gangland members have been arrested under the new legislation in the past six months?Will the Tánaiste look at issues such as the jailing of the former IFA leader John Dillon over the use of a stupid sign on the side of the road?  The resources of the State are being used to jail a man and waste Garda time, while others are intimidating communities.  I know people on the north side of Dublin who are afraid to speak out because they are under threat from gangs.  Young mothers are coming to me, afraid that their sons are being sucked into gangs, selling drugs and then being intimidated to carry out robberies.  This is what is happening in the real world and I urge the Government to take action.  I urge the Minister for Justice and Equality to wake up and act on the issue, as he is asleep at the wheel.

We will not deal with it by attempting to turn it into a political football.  The Minister for Justice and Equality is very much on top of what is happening in respect of crimes being committed.

The Government is providing support for the Garda.  One of the things we have done - for the first time since the 1920s - is to change the way gardaí are deployed in operations.  We hope this will prove successful.  In this day and age, we need gardaí working with communities in order that they can assemble the evidence needed.  I understand very well what is happening in many communities and the fear some people have in providing information for the Garda.

That is why we are changing the way gardaí are deployed in order that there will be a better police presence on the ground in communities.  Many of the crimes are drug related, which is why the Government's strategy deals with the drugs problem on two levels.  The objectives are to cut off the supply of drugs and support voluntary bodies and drugs task forces to reduce the demand for them.

As the Tánaiste will be aware, the Strasbourg court has ruled that the right to join a trade union includes the right to bargain collectively.  In his party's election manifesto, the Tánaiste committed to introduce legislation to strengthen the rights of workers to engage in collective bargaining, as enshrined by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Indeed, his partners in government, at Lisbon II, stated that they would legislate to bring about collective bargaining also.  When will we see legislation on this issue?

I cannot give Deputy Tóibín a date at this point for when that legislation will be introduced because, as he will be aware, we have already been engaged in a number of pieces of legislation in the area of the protection of workers' rights, such as the minimum wage, the introduction of the legislation on agency workers and the legislation which we committed to introduce following the High Court decision to strike down the joint labour committees, JLC, system.  There is quite an agenda of legislation being pursued to protect the rights of workers and the legislation to give effect to the remaining commitments in the programme for Government will be progressed in due course.

That is clearly a change in policy.  As Tánaiste will be aware, the Minister indicated at the time that he had provided for it, through the raiding of pension funds, to extend to 2013.

There is promised legislation such as the criminal justice (proceeds of crime) Bill, the criminal justice (victims rights) Bill, the criminal justice corruption (consolidation) Bill, the criminal law (human trafficking) (amendment) Bill and the criminal law (sexual offences) Bill, all of which have been promised for some considerable time, I might add, while the main Opposition party was in government.

Shooting a person in a public park or in his or her car or his or her home is a crime.  We do not need more legislation to make it a crime again.  We need to ensure the legislation is enforced and is operating properly.  It is to those ends - the enforcement of the legislation, protection of persons in their homes and support for the Garda - on which the Government is focusing its attention.

If the fiscal compact treaty referendum is held after the summer, I imagine it would be in late September or October.  I doubt, in that scenario, that the Government would hold two separate referendums in the autumn.  Does this mean that despite repeated promises, the children's referendum will once again be delayed by a further year?  Where does the Government's inability to decide on a date for the referendum on the fiscal compact treaty leave the decision regarding a date for the children's rights referendum?

We decided immediately on receiving the advice of the Attorney General that we would hold a referendum.  The Government considered the matter last week and I will bring proposals to Government shortly about the steps that are necessary to hold the referendum.  The referendum on children's rights is separate.  That matter is being progressed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

Has legislation been promised to regard the illicit trade in tobacco as a serious crime?  There were 57 convictions last year for illegal cigarette smuggling and the average fine was only €1,726.  Has legislation been promised to regard this as a serious crime in order judges can be harsher in imposing sentences?

Of course, there are the normal Finance Bills brought forward by the Minister for Finance on the Revenue side.  It is an issue the Deputy can pursue when legislation is brought before the House.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	171	Since I announced the Government's plans for a programme of State assets disposal, there has been a great deal of misinformation circulating about the Government's intentions in this regard and of the impact of any such disposals.From the outset, claims have been made that the Government would be selling off key strategic infrastructural assets in a fire sale and that what it proposed to do was not in the national interest.  I have again heard the traditional criticism that the Government's proposed disposal of State assets is akin to it selling off the family silver.  In reality, what family, if faced with real financial difficulties and a substantial amount of debt, would not consider drawing on whatever assets and investments it had to reduce its vulnerability.  As a nation, we are in such a situation.  Our outgoings continue to exceed greatly our income in the form of taxes and other revenues and, as every Member of the House is aware, we are dependent on funding from the EU-IMF to meet our day-to-day funding needs.  In return, we are required to implement over a specified period a programme of fiscal reform that will bring our budget back into balance, which we will do.  As part of this programme, and as already agreed by the Labour Party and Fine Gael in its negotiated programme for Government, we are also committed to reviewing our portfolio of State assets and to releasing value from some of these assets at this time of national need, but only on the basis that the State achieves fair value from any assets that are to be sold and that doing so does not damage our prospects for recovery and for future economic growth.I have heard Deputies opposite state that the semi-State companies involved have contributed hugely to our economic development in the past.  I agree that they have been significant contributors to our economic development over past decades.  However, that is not a justification for refusing to review the contribution they can make now and into the future nor does it necessarily mean their continuation in State ownership represents the best way forward for them or the State.  Time does not stand still and we cannot be prisoners of the past.  Let us take the example of Bord Gáis.  It has built up a successful electricity generation and supply business and is now a valuable asset within the State's portfolio of assets.  However, from a strategic point of view, the question that must be posed is whether it is necessary or in the best interests of the State to have two significant electricity generation and supply businesses which are in competition with each other in public ownership.Opposition Deputies have also drawn comparisons with the sale of our telecommunications network through the privatisation of Eircom.  The Government is conscious of the fall-out from the Eircom experience and the programme of disposals which I announced have been carefully crafted to ensure that such dangers are avoided this time and that the mistakes made in regard to previous privatisations, which are evident to every Member of this House, are not repeated.  In this regard, I have already made it crystal clear that the Government has no intention of selling off strategic infrastructural assets.  We have agreed to sell BGE's energy business.  Its gas transmission and distribution systems, including the two gas interconnectors, are not for sale.  We have agreed to sell some of ESB's non-strategic power generation capacity in order to reduce ESB's market dominance.  This is part of the strategy of keeping the ESB as a vertically integrated company in State ownership, otherwise it would be under threat.  This also provides ESB with alternative generating capacity at a time of critical mass and provides for greater competition in the electricity market into the future.  We have agreed to consider the sale of some of Coillte's assets.  As I pointed out when I made the announcement on the sale of State assets, the decision in respect the sale of Coillte assets is different.  Evaluation of decisions in this regard is ongoing.  The evaluation is likely to focus primarily on the harvesting rights of Coillte forests, in other words, on the trees themselves, but the land on which the forests are grown will remain in State ownership, which is very important.  Moreover, the Government is only agreeable to dispose of the State's remaining stake in Aer Lingus because the remaining 25% shareholding is no longer a strategic asset.  This is because, as Deputies would admit were they being honest, it does not enable the Government to determine Aer Lingus policy on commercial decisions such as the use of the company's Heathrow slots.Some Deputies have suggested that rather than sell off these semi-State assets, the Government should actually invest further in these assets in areas such as wind and wave energy, in which there is potential to create significant numbers of new jobs in what are described as the emerging technological areas.  Other Deputies have suggested the Government should go ahead with the sales but simply should keep all of the money raised for reinvestment, rather than using any of it to reduce the overall level of debt.  However, as the Deputies opposite are aware, these suggestions are not realistic.  Where would the Government get the funds to invest further in these assets when it does not have access to the financial markets but is wholly reliant on the EU-IMF programme for even its current funding requirements?  Moreover, I note the Government's capital plan has laid out €17 billion in capital investments.  As regards the use of funds generated from the disposals, agreement has been reached after protracted negotiations with the troika that one third of the proceeds can be retained and will be available for reinvestment in the economy to help stimulate jobs and growth.  This represents a significant shift in the position of the troika, the original position of which made crystal clear to the Government, from its first meetings with the former on assuming office, that all of the proceeds were to be used for debt reduction.  This is what the troika requires in other programme countries such as Portugal and Greece.  I am satisfied this represents a real breakthrough in the Government's negotiations with the troika and is a very satisfactory outcome for Ireland.  It offers the potential for the Government to have access to €1 billion for much-needed reinvestment in the very areas pointed out by Members opposite.In this regard, I should also mention the Government has reformed the manner in which the State, as shareholder, engages with its key semi-State companies.  Last year the Government established NewERA, which is now taking a proactive role in overseeing corporate governance from a shareholder perspective of all the commercial semi-State companies in the energy area, including the ESB, EirGrid, Bord Gáis, Bord na Móna and Coillte.  NewERA now advises Ministers on proposals for new capital investment by these companies, approval of borrowings, dividend policy and so on.  NewERA also is working closely with the strategic investment fund and the National Pensions Reserve Fund to ensure that potential commercial investment opportunities are identified and exploited fully.  Consequently, in addition to the disposal of some of the non-strategic State assets, the Government also seeks to make the best use of the remainder of the State's portfolio of assets that will remain in State ownership and this includes identifying the best opportunities for investment in these sectors.As I stated at the outset, there has been much misinformation about the Government's asset disposal plans over recent weeks.  Some of it has been ill-informed and some has been downright mischievous.  In fairness, however, I must also acknowledge that I have heard some legitimate concerns being raised by Deputies opposite in respect of some of the wider implications of the proposed asset disposals and in particular, a number of Deputies have raised concerns in the context of Coillte and its forests.  Fears have been raised about a potential lack of public access to the forests for walkers and for recreational purposes.  Queries have been raised about whether the forests, if sold, would be replanted after the current crop is harvested.  Questions have been raised about the impact of any disposal of Coillte forests in terms of the climate change agenda and the position regarding carbon credits in particular.  More generally, questions have been asked about whether the Government has engaged with thestaff interests in the companies involved with regard to its plans.I acknowledge and accept these are all genuine and real issues that must be addressed.  However, I assure Members that these issues already were identified in the preliminary analysis undertaken by the Government in the form of the interdepartmental working group, which reported to Ministers in December 2011.  That group considered a range of State assets identified by the Government as potential candidates for disposal, which included Coillte.  I can confirm the Government is conscious of all the issues I have outlined and that they all will be taken into account before final decisions are arrived at by the Government with regard to what assets of Coillte are to be sold and the manner of the sale.In this regard, I already have explained that the Government decision with regard to Coillte and its assets is different from that in respect of Bord Gáis and the ESB.  Whereas specific decisions have been taken and announced regarding the assets that are to be disposed of in the case of the energy companies, no definitive decisions have yet been taken with regard to Coillte.  The Government has agreed that Coillte is to be included in the asset disposal programme but my announcement of last month indicated the need for further consideration on how this was to be done.  I already have indicated that any disposal in the case of Coillte is likely to focus primarily on the harvesting rights but that primarily is because I wanted to make it clear there would be no question of any disposal of Coillte land holding.  The Government is determined this should be maintained in State ownership.  As for the final decision on how best to release value from Coillte, since the Government made its announcements, a number of ideas have been presented to it, all of which are being considered.  I will revert to this House with any decisions arrived at and Members can debate them again.A working group, comprising my Department, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and NewERA, currently is considering this matter in detail.  NewERA is preparing a valuation of the company and its assets and the working group will report back to Ministers by the end of March with the outcome of this assessment.  Its report also will set out any policy, regulatory, legislative, corporate governance or financial issue that must be addressed to facilitate a disposal of Coillte or its assets.  On completion of this report, together with similar reports also being prepared on Bord Gáis Energy and the ESB's non-strategic power generation capacity, the Government will be able to take further decisions on how best to proceed with the implementation phase of the asset disposal programme announced.  I assure Members the Government will ensure that all the implications of each asset disposal will be individually and carefully considered with a view to mitigating any potential negative impacts associated with such disposals.  This will include ensuring the continuity of access to the forests as a public amenity that is highly valued by the Government.International investors are again beginning to look favourably on Ireland's long-term growth and prospects.  The indications are, therefore, that there should be significant interest in investment opportunities in this State.  The Government hopes and fully expects to benefit from this renewed international interest as the State assets are prepared to be brought onto the market.  I am confident the Government will be able to secure good value for the assets it puts on the market.I will conclude by noting that as I indicated previously, there will be no fire sales.  If the Government is not convinced that any particular asset is achieving fair and good value for the Irish taxpayer, that asset will not be sold.

First, I listened carefully to the Minister's contribution and acknowledge some of the points he made.  However, I hope the Minister will understand me when I state I was shocked by the contents of the second paragraph of his script.  I hope the Minister did not mean what he actually stated because he mentioned people referring to this issue as being akin to selling off the family silver.  Immediately afterwards, he went on to ask "what family, if faced with real financial difficulties and a substantial amount of debt, would not consider" whatever assets and investments it possessed to ascertain whether it could draw on some of them to reduce its vulnerability.  That means the Minister is telling families in financial difficulties that they should consider drawing on the value of their family homes to reduce their vulnerability.

I do not believe he meant what he said when he used the term "whatever assets".  The main asset most people possess is their family home.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	180	It is a conclusion which can be drawn from what the Minister said.  I prefaced my remarks by stating I hoped the Minister did not mean what he said.  However, the words to which I refer are those which he used.  We will move on.It has been pointed out previously that many semi-State companies have been set up since the foundation of the State.  These companies contributed to the economy and created employment.  A number of them - ICC Bank, ACC Bank, the ferry company etc. - were sold over time.  The Irish people have, therefore, been involved in the establishment of semi-State companies and - this is part of the normal commercial life-cycle of businesses - the sale of some of them to finance other projects.  It is important to place on record that this is not the first occasion on which sales of this nature have occurred.  There are some who will refer to the family silver.  I did not go down that route but I was concerned with regard to wider implications of what the Minister said.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I wish to comment on the position of Bord Gáis, ESB, Coillte and Aer Lingus.  We all agree there can be no sell-off of strategic State assets.  The Minister has used the word "strategic" in several speeches without ever explaining what it means.  I would like him to indicate as soon as possible what he means when he refers to "strategic State assets".On previous occasions I have made suggestions in respect of some of the ESB's plants, particularly those connected to hydroelectric dams.  I refer, for example, to the dams at Ardnacrusha and Inniscarra, which is situated on the River Lee.  It cannot be the case that a private company might own and control these installations and, by definition, could control the water levels in the rivers on which they are located.  It would not be acceptable if such a company, in order to generate electricity or for some other purpose, opened these dams and caused severe flooding downstream.  Clarifying the position in respect of matters of this nature should not prove to be too difficult.  The Minister may have other strategic power plants in mind in this regard and it is important, therefore, that information regarding his intentions should be placed on the record as soon as possible.I agree with the Minister's comments in respect of Coillte.  A number of Members on this side of the House previously referred to issues such as continued access to Coillte land.  I refer, for example, to a situation where the company would retain the freehold in respect of a plot of land but where it sold the leasehold relating to that land to another company or person for a period of ten, 20 or 30 years.  In such circumstances, whoever held the leasehold would effectively be in situ and in control of the property and this could prevent the attendant forestry from being used for leisure and tourism purposes.  There would be a need to cut down some of the trees on such land during the period of the leasehold.  Will there be a commitment in respect of replanting during this period?On the previous occasion on which we discussed this matter, I referred to the carbon credits relating to our forests.  These are extremely important because they are of great assistance in the context of the climate change agenda.  Perhaps the Minister might indicate the overall value of the carbon credits which Coillte currently holds on behalf of the State and then the approximate value per hectare of these.The Minister indicated that he is considering a number of options with regard to Coillte.  I wish to suggest one such option but I must include the caveat that it is not necessarily one which I would pursue.  From a commercial point of view, most people consider trees planted in forests as being part of a 20-year crop.  We know the Minister is not selling the land.  Many individuals involved in forestry view their crops as a form of pension fund because they will obtain a big lump sum from these crops at some point.  Would it not be possible for Coillte to retain ownership of the ownership, management and harvesting of its forestry crops while realising now what would be the value of these when eventually harvested?  It could raise that money from a pension company and give the latter a right to claim the relevant funds in 20 years' time, when a particular part of a forest might be harvested or sold off.  This would allow Coillte to realise the value of future crops now and it could then hand over the money obtained to the State for investment purposes and to create jobs.  Perhaps the Minister might give consideration to this proposal, under which Coillte would retain control and management of its lands and forests.We all agree that there should be no fire sale and that State assets should not be sold for a price below their economic value.  In the context of raising money to facilitate job creation, I am concerned that the sale of State assets could take a couple of years to complete.  The Government is not going to realise any cash in this regard during the current year and it will probably fail to do so again next year.  The people who were queuing up to gain entry to the jobs fairs in Dublin and Cork in recent days will have left the country at that stage.  Essentially, the Minister is saying that they should telephone us or communicate with us in three years' time via Skype and we will inform them at that point as to whether we obtained any money to create jobs in the meantime.  The Minister stated he will not be rushing the process in this regard.  Effectively, therefore, he is informing people that we might have something for them in a few years from now.  This approach is not fair and it fails to provide hope to those people who are seeking an early indication with regard to what is going to happen.The Minister is well aware that I object to any of the proceeds from the sale of State assets being used to pay down debt.  Such proceeds as accrue should be used entirely for the purposes of job creation.  The Minister and I have different views on this matter.  He has stated that the troika has given us a concession by allowing us to use one third of the proceeds towards job creation.  I am of the view that the Government is being submissive in the context of handing over two thirds of whatever amount is realised to the troika.  It is important that all of this money should be used to generate growth, employment and economic activity because the latter offer the best avenues towards securing our future.The Government's track record on job creation is extremely poor.  Figures which emerged during the past year bear this out.  The Government introduced a jobs initiative last year and this involved raiding private pension funds to obtain €2 billion for the period up to 2014.  The majority of the funds raised under this scheme were supposed to be spent on job creation last year.  This did not happen, however, and the moneys in question were carried over in order to bolster the Government's coffers.  I am concerned that the Government will do with the proceeds from the sale of State assets what it did with the money it obtained by raiding private pension funds last year, namely, subsume them into general funds and use them to reduce the budget deficit.  This is what happened in respect of the jobs initiative.I have proof in this regard.  On Tuesday last, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, when addressing delegates at the annual conference of the Irish Hotels Federation, referred to the reduction in VAT from 13.5% to 9% in July 2011 as part of the Government's jobs initiative and stated that this had cost the Exchequer €110 million to €130 million a year.  He indicated that this "is a lot of money".  The Minister then stated that the Government will be obliged to consider whether to extend this measure, which is only due to remain in place until the end of July, for another year.  He indicated "That has to be worked out in the context of the next budget as to whether we have that kind of space".  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport let the cat out of the bag by stating the money taken from private pension funds, which certain individuals stated in the House last year would be used for job creation purposes, will be considered in the context of next year's budget.  In other words, the Minister has indicated that the jobs initiative was put in place in a budgetary rather than a job creation context.  I am concerned that any proceeds realised from the sale of State assets would merely be subsumed into general Government funds and put towards balancing the budget rather than being used to promote growth.Reference has been made to a figure of €3 billion.  I do not know from where this came but the Minister indicated that the NTMA supplied it.  The figure has not been verified.  On the previous occasion on which we discussed this matter the Minister stated it cannot be verified until we go to the market.  The figure of €3 billion may be correct or it may be wrong.  No one really knows and we will be obliged to wait and see.

Perhaps the Minister will clarify the position in this regard but he appears to be nodding his head.  People seem to have obtained the impression that the first moneys realised from the sale of State assets will go to the troika and that if the entire €3 billion accrues, €1 billion can be used by the Government for its own purposes.I hope that is not the case and the Minister will act.This is part of the privatisation policy which has always been pursued by Fine Gael when it is part of Government.  There is a market and the general mass of Fine Gael supporters agree with wholesale privatisation.  The party wanted a celebration today for its first year in office and it has got Labour Ministers, including Deputies Howlin and Rabbitte, to speak in here about the sale of ESB, Coillte and Bord Gáis assets, as well as the remaining shares in Aer Lingus.  It was quite a victory for the Fine Gael Party, although one can understand that it is galling to Labour Party supporters to see a triumphant march today, celebrating the capitulation of the Labour Party to Fine Gael policy.  The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, called it a silly exercise and the Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, probably understands the sensitivities of the Labour Party supporters, knowing how deeply upset many could be because they are employees in the semi-State companies.  They would have voted for Labour to protect their jobs and not to join a Fine Gael agenda to sell off these assets.  It is important for the matter to be clarified.We want to see an analysis of how this will work out for consumers, staff and the taxpayer.  There would have to be detailed discussions with the staff.  This morning the Minister for Finance, effectively the sole shareholder in Allied Irish Banks, saw an announcement of 2,500 job losses on top of the 750 losses already announced in Bank of Ireland, as well as other losses in Aviva and Ulster Bank.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	224	A similar spin has been applied to the issue discussed today, the sale of State assets.  We have been told that the Government has now agreed the shape and scale of the asset disposal programme, which is now set at the more ambitious target of €3 billion.  It can be recalled that the programme for Government set a limit of €2 billion on the value of the sell-off.  In itself, that flew in the face of commitments given by the Labour Party during the election to oppose any such a move.  The party's election manifesto clearly stated that "Labour is opposed to short-termist privatisation of key State assets, such as Coillte or the energy networks."  Now, not only do we have a Labour Minister, Deputy Howlin, in charge of the sale but we are also being told that even the compromise agreed, that the original €2 billion would all be reinvested in public job creation programmes, has been abandoned.  Now we are told that the Government has secured agreement that a third of those proceeds will go to reinvestment in the economy.What we now have in place of the original proposal to sell off €2 billion of valuable State assets built up over a long and hard period is a new proposal that €3 billion of assets will be sold and that €2 billion of the proceeds will go not towards any programme to create employment but into the black hole of the bank debt.  That is a major escalation of both the scale of the sale and a major reversal of the stated policy on what the proceeds would be used for.  Nevertheless, in a reply to questions from me and Deputy Browne on this last week, the Minister claimed that all of this, resulting from consultations with the troika, represented a remarkable advance.How is it a remarkable advance, even if it were the case that the privatisation agenda was being exclusively driven by the troika, something I do not accept is the case given that clearly there are ideological supporters of privatisation within the Cabinet and the author of the report on State assets, Professor McCarthy, makes no secret of his hostility to public investment of almost any sort other than paying him and his chums large consultancy fees?  Even if all of this was done at the behest of the troika, it would still represent a significant climbdown on the part of the Government.  It is not an advance but another retreat to go along with all the others which are dressed up as something else in the progress report.To see what the sale will mean, we can look at what happened when Eircom was privatised.  That company had received significant inputs of State investment and was worth €8.4 billion at the time it was sold off.  Following its stripping by the vultures, it has been reduced to a current net value of just €39 million.  That is what will happen to Bord Gáis and to any other State company that is broken up and sold.  They will be cherry-picked and the State will be left not only with a loss in having divested itself of profitable parts for a once-off payment but also with the responsibility for the maintenance of the infrastructure, for example, the Bord Gáis network having to supply gas which will be sold by private companies that will buy the gas supply section of the company.The short-term outlook of the sale of State assets and the long-term loss it will represent is starkly illustrated by the fact that three of the key targets of privatisation - Coillte, the ESB and Bord Gáis - have paid just under €2 billion to the State in dividends alone over the past ten years.  That is apart altogether from wages, tax and their overall contribution to the wider economy.  The logical and economically positive action would be to retain these wholly in State ownership and develop them as key parts of a programme of publicly led job creation.  There is vast potential in all three companies in areas of the economy that will become ever more important over the next decade.It is nonsensical to be selling off key players in the energy sector when the emphasis of State energy policy is on decreasing our dependency on imported fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable sources of power such as wind, wave, biomass and tidal energy.  That is why Sinn Féin is proposing the coming together of State companies to maximise the potential for growth in those areas with the emphasis on job creation, in co-operation with the private sector but with the State energy companies, as well as Coillte and Bord na Móna, as central and more proactive agents.With Coillte specifically, it is worth pointing out again the potential which the forestry sector has if it could be better managed, which I acknowledge has not been the case.  However, that is not a reason or an excuse for it to be broken up and its forestry sold to private companies.  The Swiss example was highlighted last week as a potential model.  Switzerland has approximately twice the amount of forestry of this State but employs 120,000 people directly and indirectly compared with less than a fifth of that number here.  The Swiss state is a key actor and owns over 70% of the forestry.  It is clear there is massive potential given the right policies and focus.  Among the potential areas is the use as input for biomass of wood products which are not otherwise used in timber production.We also know that privatisation is not only economically a bad idea but also that large-scale privatisation of the sort being proposed here leads to political and financial corruption.  We have seen that in the creation of the new oligarchies in Russia, for example, where former devotees of the same ideology once espoused by some of the Labour Party Members used their positions within the Stalinist state to move in on valuable assets.  It seems the oligarchs are now well set to meld robber capitalism with undemocratic Stalinist politics, something that might ring a bell with some of the backbenchers in the party of the Tánaiste and the Minister in the light of their own dissatisfaction.We do not have quite the same dynamic here.  What we do have is a former Taoiseach who has been prominently connected with a group which has previously expressed an interest in acquiring Coillte's forestry assets.  He also visited China, apparently in pursuit of possible investors in such a project.  The Chinese state investment corporation has expressed interest in Irish forestry assets.  It will be interesting to see who will be the bidders when Coillte comes up for auction.  It will also be interesting to see if we will again be subject to the type of shady dealings which attended previous privatisations, as it seems they closely complement one another.The previous position of the Labour Party, when in opposition, on the sale of State assets was one I applauded.  However, the impact in going down the road it is taking in selling off State assets will be felt by the people for a very long time; it will do enormous damage to our control of the public sector.

I wish to use mine to highlight what happened in the past in the sale of State assets.  The old Posts and Telegraph service which provided our telecommunications services was dead in the water.  In 1983 when it was turned into a semi-State company, it improved in leaps and bounds as Telecom Éireann.  The service was upgraded and Telecom Éireann workers worked on contracts in England and other parts of Europe.  We finished up debt free and with one of the best networks in the world.  The Government's coffers were receiving money from the semi-State company and the surplus was being used to fund upgrading.  However, it was then sold.

However, when I sought to secure the provision of a broadband connection there, I was told by the company that 300 customers would not make it viable to provide a service.My point is that when semi-State companies are taken over and plundered by profiteers who send their money to Australia, we are left with nothing, as is clearly evident if one travels the countryside.  Poles are falling down and wires are hanging down.  The Minister can laugh, but is he blind?  Can he not see it is wrong?

This is a major concern.  More than 60% of the unemployed in the State have been out of work for more than one year.  The sad and sorry fact is that the policies of this and previous Government have failed utterly.  This is compounded by the thousands of people who see no future here and are being forced to emigrate.  The weekend saw scenes reminiscent of the worst days of the 1980s with thousands queuing at the RDS for an opportunity to work abroad.

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	256	The contradiction is glaringly obvious.  This money should not be given away to the gamblers of capitalism but instead should be invested in job creatin.  The three companies up for sale, namely, Coillte, the ESB and Bord Gáis, paid a total of €1.97 billion to the State in dividends in the past ten years.  If the Government has its way, we will no longer receive these dividends.  The decision to hand over €3.1 billion, while selling off State assets worth €3 billion is one the Government did not have to make.  Let us be clear: we would not make this choice.Our proposals are simple, clear and focused on benefiting the country and its people.  We would use the €3 billion not for lining pockets but for a job creation plan which would include the provision of creches, 100 new school buildings, the refurbishment of other school buildings, regeneration projects in Limerick and Dublin and a range of other projects such as health centres which the Government wants to put in place.  This is an opportunity to do so.Sinn Féin believes the Government is making the wrong decision.  This is not to have a go at the Government; we believe this sincerely.  The Government's plan to dispose of State assets in the next two years includes the possible sale of the assets of Coillte.  The Woodland League calls for an urgent re-evaluation of the State forestry model as part of a national public works programme, involving training for the unemployed and the creation of long-term forestry jobs as the backbone of national recovery.  The Government should consider the merits of these proposals which could help to stimulate employment.  Using public resources and taxpayers' money, over many years Ireland's public forests were built as a national asset and it makes no sense to sell off parts of them.The Irish Congress of Trade Unions is on record as stating the sale of State assets threatens to transform companies such as the ESB and Bord Gáis into another Eircom.  We know what happened in that case.  The Government is being disingenuous when it states it does not intend to sell off strategic assets because the ESB, Bord Gáis and Coillte are the most valuable assets we own.  If job creation is the single most important goal of this Administration, the sale of State assets contradicts this aim.  It is important that semi-State companies are left in a position where they can advance, develop and be used for job creation purposes.The Minister and previous Government speakers have stated only power generation facilities will be sold.  This is the same as saying only the source of water would be sold.  The pipes and wires are used for connection; that is all they do.  The money is in the generation.  The valve to turn on and off the power will be in private hands.  The Minister understands this because he is in government and has been a Member of the House for longer.  He is handing over the lever of power and putting it in the control of private individuals.  I appeal to him and the Government to think about this again.  Do not sell our State assets.  Do not hand over these public assets or the sum of €3.1 billion.

I listened to the Minister's statement with great interest.  While I accept no decision has yet been made, it seems the ground is being set for a sale of the logging and timber rights.  I understand the reason for the sale of State assets in these difficult times and how the money raised from their sale could potentially be used to reinvest to create jobs.  I do not have time to discuss the economic reasons for selling logging rights, but I will discuss another aspect of the issue, one to which the Minister did not refer.  Last night it was made clear to the House how important access to turf was for hundreds of thousands of people in the midlands.  As a Wexford man, the Minister knows County Wicklow well and I have no doubt he drives up and down the M11 several times a week.

People in the county have an emotional attachment to its forests and mountains.  It is an attachment with which I empathised last night when I listened to the debate on turf cutting.  Not only does access to the forests matter to people in County Wicklow, so too does the fact that we own them.  We do not differentiate between the land and the trees.  It matters to us that while the land will continue to belong to us, the trees will belong to a logging company.  The Minister may frown and perhaps he does not feel the same way as we do, but, as someone who grew up in County Wicklow, I assure him that based on the number who are contacting me with queries about his proposals, ownership of our forests matters.I have met the Coillte management team, as I am sure the Minister has, and it appears to be doing a good job.  There seem to be important synergies between the various elements of its operations.  Having walked the mountains of County Wicklow for decades, I know the company's investment in recreational amenities is making a difference.  We have, for instance, new cycle routes and many other positive developments are taking place.  While I accept the Government will do its best to try to maintain access to our forests, its efforts will not succeed.  We have seen what logging companies do all over the world.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, referred to selling the rights to the forests for 90 years.  The companies in question will find excuses and reasons to shut down access and decline to invest as much in our forests as Coillte did.As a representative of County Wicklow, I implore the Minister to bear in mind that ownership of our trees and access to our forests matter a great deal to people in my county.  I ask him to consider that, in addition to their economic value, our forests have an intrinsic value and should be maintained in public ownership.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	261	The Labour Party should be ashamed of itself for contemplating a sale or part sale of State assets.  To sell such assets would be a wanton and criminal act.  The view of people on the street is that our assets are not the Government's to sell.  The feedback the United Left Alliance is receiving is that people are angry that the Labour Party is even contemplating the part sale of State assets.Selling off State assets to pay off banking debts is not acceptable.  It is a national scandal to propose selling off part of the public companies which have been built up over many decades.  Their sale would amount to a waste of money as the proceeds would be largely used to pay off the gambling debts of those who gambled in the economy.  Even if €1 billion or one third of the expected proceeds was invested in job creation initiatives, it would be a drop in the ocean in tackling the problem of there being 450,000 people on the dole.The proposed sale of State assets marks the beginning of loosening State control of key infrastructure which is essential to the economic development of the country.  Did we not learn lessons from the sale of Telecom Éireann which later became Eircom?  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, stated the proceeds from the proposed privatisation would be used to deliver broadband services nationwide.  If Eircom was in State hands, the Government could take a strategic decision to use public infrastructure to roll out broadband nationwide.  This is no longer possible, however, because of the madness of a Fianna Fáil-led Government which decided to sell our telecommunications infrastructure.Key industries should be used for the purposes of national public job investment.  Private owners are interested only in investments that make profits rather than balanced development across the country.  We will potentially lose control of where development takes place.On the decision to sell trees to logging companies, what is preventing us from establishing a State-run timber processing industry using timber from Coillte lands?  The vast majority of timber is imported.  Rather than developing this indigenous industry, our timber resources will be given to outside industries and used to generate profits for their shareholders.  These resources should be used to help to tackle mass unemployment.The United Left Alliance has consistently argued that money is available and has submitted its economic proposals to the Government.  A tax on wealth and the assets of the super-rich could generate revenue of almost €10 billion, while an increase in tax rates for high earners could potentially generate additional income of €5 billion per annum.  This income could be used to invest in job creation.  In the past the Labour Party would have advocated job creation measures based on this type of investment.  Instead, it is turning its head and disgracefully playing a role in the sale of State assets.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	262	The sale of State assets has been likened in many circles to the sale of the family silverware.  It more closely equates to selling off the kitchen.  State assets can be used as the driving force for the economy and must be maintained in State ownership.  This is at the crux of the issue.  The Government's agenda on the sale of State assets is being driven by the Fine Gael Party.  The Labour Party has done a U-turn on the issue.  It is interesting to note, however, that the process is being driven by a Labour Party Minister who is pursuing the policies the Fine Gael Party insisted on having inserted in the programme for Government.  In its election manifesto the Labour Party stated:Labour is committed to the concept of public enterprise, and is determined to ensure that semi-state companies play a full role in the recovery of the Irish economy.  Labour is opposed to the short-termist privatisation of key state assets, such as Coillte or the energy networks.Despite these commitments, we have short-termist proposals to privatise State assets for short-term gain.  If the full value of the assets in question was realised, the national debt would be reduced by 1% and if we were lucky, we would be able to provide €1 billion for labour market stimulation measures.  We would have great difficulty in realising the full value or achieving the €1 billion figure.Recent privatisations have been disastrous.  When we sold off Telecom Éireann in the late 1990s, the quality of our telecommunications infrastructure collapsed.  Another Labour Party Minister recently concluded a broadband review in his Department and we will probably be given a mishmash of proposals in the coming months on how to roll out next generation broadband nationwide.  We had an asset in our control which could have been used as a vehicle for achieving this objective and driving economic regeneration across the county by providing fibre broadband in every area.We are told the sale of Coillte will not entail selling off land.  That is hardly a big deal, given that it is proposed to sell the rights to land held by Coillte for 90 years, effectively ceding ownership of it to whoever purchases the rights.  When I was a member of a local authority, a 99 year lease implied full ownership for the person who acquired the lease.  We are handing over control and ownership of our forests which should be a vital national resource.  In the years ahead our wood biomass resource should be a crucial element in efforts to develop alternative energy sources and industries.  Instead, it will be handed over to private sector interests and profit takers who will use it for their own ends, thus removing its benefits from citizens.We should retain ownership of public enterprises.  There are many models worldwide of public utilities working for the benefit of the public rather than private sector interests.  We should use public utilities to drive forward the economy and develop new industries such as wave power, offshore wind and wood biomass projects.  These are the areas we should target for future economic regeneration.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	263	The Government's proposal to sell off State assets and natural resources is the ultimate betrayal of the country and its citizens' economic future and heritage to protect the interests of bankers and speculators.  It amounts to robbing the country and its citizens of the national resources and means through which we could have an opportunity to work our way towards economic recovery and resolving the unemployment crisis.  It is laughable in the extreme that the Government has made a distinction between, for example, power generation as non-strategic and distribution and transmission as strategic.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	264	That is what the rest of the world does.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	265	How much more strategic does it get than the ability of the State to produce its own energy?  It does not get more fundamental than that.  If we do not have energy, we have nothing.  To say giving that away does not represent a giveaway of a vital strategic asset is beyond belief.I would like, however, to focus on forests.  Like Deputy Donnelly, I was brought up in Dún Laoghaire and Wicklow is the back garden amenity of the people of the area.  We have walked in the forests since I was young.  I also spent many summers walking through forests in County Kerry.  It is again laughable in the extreme to draw a distinction between selling forests and somehow retaining ownership of the land.  If a private company gets hold of the forests, it will control and manage them and any guarantees or safeguards the Minister promises regarding the maintenance of public access will be worthless because once the lease is handed over, the private companies will have control and we will be on a slippery slope.We were on a slippery slope even under semi-State management.  For example, 70% of Coillte's profits, even under State ownership over the past ten years, were generated through the sale of lands.  How much more pressure will there be when a private company is managing our forests and approaches the Government to sell off more State land to make profits?  Given it is almost certain Ireland will be forced into a second bailout, how much more pressure will there be on the Government to sell the land then as well?   That is what happened in Greece.  As part of the first bailout, some privatisations were agreed but, as part of the second bailout, the demand for privatisation was ratcheted up and the Greeks were told by EU representatives to sell beaches and islands.  That is the slippery slope the Government is going down.It is worrying that Coillte was set up by the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern when he was Minister for Finance.  Coillte was managed by the Department of Finance in its early years when it began to sell off forests.  Contrary to what Deputy Donnelly said, major questions and investigations are needed into the failure of Coillte to utilise the 1.1 million hectares under its stewardship, given it made almost no money other than through selling off land and forests.  A company headed up by none other than Bertie Ahern would be one of the major bidders for Coillte if it went on the market.It is shameful that the Government would consider selling off 7% of our landmass and I appeal to everybody who loves our forests to fight and to get out on the streets to prevent the Government from selling off our national heritage and assets which could resolve the unemployment crisis.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I wish to share time with Deputy Anthony Lawlor.I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute.  This is an emotive debate because we are discussing the fallout from an agreement made with the troika in November 2010, which came like a financial tsunami at the country.  The ECB woke up to the fright that it had an exposure of €135 billion in loans to our banking system and, in turn, to our economy and there was a deficit in the public finances of approximately €20 billion a year.  The improbability of getting the €135 billion back when the Government faced an annual deficit of €20 billion was alarming.  The memorandum of understanding was cobbled together by the IMF, the EU and the ECB in emergency mode and this coincided with the financial crisis that was about to explode on the eurozone and the world.  That was the confluence of events that led us to the memorandum of understanding, which required us, as part of the algebra, to repay the agreement loans by realising €5 billion through the sale of investments.I am glad the Government has renegotiated this amount down to €3 billion with a balance of €2 billion for debt repayment.  The repayments relate to the debt taken on on foot of the memorandum with €1 billion to be reinvested in State enterprise.  However, this is an opportunity for us to think in bigger terms and to examine the woods, not the trees of that agreement.  We must consider the number of variables in the overall equation rather than concentrating separately on each of the variables and the fractions or decimal points that go with them.  As a nation, we should continuously review State investments in enterprises.  For example, employment should be examined in order that there is refreshed rather than stagnated employment.  Are the people in those enterprises learning new skills and engaged in continual professional development, which is required in all professions nowadays?  The agreement at least drives the Government parties to review our investments whether those are in Coillte, Aer Lingus, ESB or Bord Gais and that is what they are doing.  Rather than squabbling about the arithmetic of the €3 billion being divided into €2 billion and €1 billion, we should have a calm, measured review of the investments.  There is an opportunity to realise some of the investments and invest in fresh sectoral opportunities in the economy and that is what I advocate.It is also useful to connect with our creditors, including the ECB, whose governing council meets today and it is hoped the Governor of our Central Bank will robustly persist about the provenance or origin of the emergency liquidity assistance in IBRC and about the ECB advances to AIB and Bank of Ireland with a view to restructuring, renegotiating and writing down those debts because only then will it be possible for the two remaining operational utility banks to pass on write downs to their customers, which are the households and businesses that are being crushed by debt that is astronomically higher than any other country in the developed world.  That is the opportunity but let us take down the tone to one of measured, constructive co-operation.  Let us insist to our creditors that we should sit down with them to examine this.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	267	It is strange that we are debating the sale of State assets because the same debate is taking place in New Zealand, a country to which many of our people have emigrated.  Last night, the New Zealand parliament voted in favour of selling state assets.  The country has a budget deficit similar to our own of approximately NZ$18 billion.  It is using the sale of state assets to reduce its budget deficit.  It is fascinating to hear a debate taking place here and a measured debate taking place in New Zealand at the same time.  I note the debate taking place in New Zealand is measured whereas here we are getting a rant, by which I mean that people pick up certain words within the debate and the legislation and on the sale of State assets and use it.  Every speaker on the Opposition mentioned Eircom.  Eircom was sold in its entirety.  If we had held on to the strategic part of Eircom, that is the cabling and wiring, we would not have a debate in which Eircom would be mentioned.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	268	We would.

I often wonder if people listen to what we say.  We are not selling the strategic part of the assets put up for sale.  We are selling the generating part, yet we are maintaining the wires and cabling.  We are not selling the land associated with Coillte as my learned colleague, Deputy Boyd Barrett, said on a number of occasions.  We are selling the product of the land, just like every farmer.  He sells the product of his land, he does not sell the land.  Will the Deputy please listen?

Any celebrity economist will say the reduction of debt in the long term generates more income for the country.I welcome the sale of State assets.  I stand firmly behind the Minister in the hard work ahead and look forward to debating the issue with the Opposition in a proper and controlled manner.

The reality is that nobody in the House is against the sale of State assets because, if one takes it to an absolute ridiculous level, it would be equivalent to saying that if a State company owned a van it wished to trade in for a new van, it could not sell the old one.  We know that trading of State assets takes place all the time.  However, what we are talking about here is a firesale of State assets.

What is being done in respect of Coillte is a disaster.  There is always a movement of State assets, big and small.  What is being discussed here is the sale of strategic State assets in large quantity.  Two years ago the Labour Party would have thrown its hands in the air and said this was disgraceful.  The Labour Party never ceases to amaze me.  The Government will deny it is a firesale yet when one examines the documentation it is clear the sales will commence in 2013.  As the Minister is aware the economic forecasts for 2013 are not good as there will suddenly be huge valuations on assets.  What will the Government sell?  I suspect it will be some generating plant.  I have an open mind to see what will be put up for sale.  Some has been sold in the past.  We should keep some critical generation capacity.  I note that Mr. Colm McCarthy said the generation capacity of certain assets should not be sold, therefore, I want to see what it is proposed to sell.I am opposed to the sale of the retail side of Bord Gáis.  If one was Minister for Social Protection one would find that the attitude taken by the State companies to ordinary people who run into problems paying their bills is much more constructive, more planned and fairer than that of the private companies.  When a big hullabaloo was raised by Fine Gael and the Labour Party about electricity being cut off when I was in government, they did not realise that in a large number of these cases, a disproportionate number compared to the customer base, that it was being done at the behest of Airtricity.  The physical cutting off was done by Electric Ireland, but the demand to do it arose from the non-payment of Airtricity bills.  Before selling State assets it is important to consider what is being done.The amount to be generated from the sale of State assets is a projected €2 billion.  Some €1 billion worth of State assets is being sold because the Labour Party needed a fig leaf that it would create jobs out of the sale of State assets.  When it could not the €2 billion it had promised out of the sale of State assets it said it would add another €1 billion to it and the people would not notice it.  The people do notice.  I wonder how much money will be got when one takes into account the pension fund deficits and calculates a multiple of the loss of the dividend.  In other words, the value of an asset must be set against the income one would have earned from that asset, where one owns the asset and the income, whereas when one sells, one sells the goose that lays the golden egg, unless one gets a good multiple return.Much play is made about the sale of Eircom.  A mistake was made subsequent to the sale of Eircom in regard to the way the telecommunications sector was regulated - I am still very critical of that.  The reality is that we got €6.4 billion in 1999, which is more than twice what we will get for the sale of a large number of assets.

That amount of money particularly for a rapidly redundant technology, that is, copper and wires, would give a significant dent in providing money for jobs.  If the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, said he was going to sell off redundant technologies and get €9 billion, €7 billion of which would go to jobs, that would be an interesting scenario.  I have argued for some time that the copper wires are useless and should be replaced by fibre optic cable and the actual technology is so outdated as to be irrelevant in the modern world.

The forestry used for rural recreation had a big investment from Coillte.  Is the Deputy trying to tell me that the private owners of the crop will be as amenable as Coillte has always been in ensuring that harvesting operations do not interfere with what is a rapidly growing industry, namely rural recreation?  Some 45% of the waymarked ways are on Coillte property.  I ask the Minister to ask himself what does it profit a Government to sell its soul for the full world for €3 billion.

First, I wish to correct Deputy Matthews on one particular matter which may have slipped his mind.  He referred to the agreement made by the Government with the troika in November 2010.  I remind him there was no agreement to sell State assets in that agreement and there was certainly nothing relating to a sum of €5 billion; that was agreed by the current Government.  There was a commitment to review State assets in so far as they might contribute to debt reduction but there was no commitment on it.  Unfortunately that gets peddled around a good deal.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I thank the Deputy.  I would expect nothing less.I do not have a personal hang-up about the disposal of State assets, and I do see merit in the sale of certain non-strategic State assets to deal with the debt burden.  I recognise the need to inject liquidity into the economy to assist the Government in its job creation proposals and certainly, where non-strategic State assets can be employed, that is the right thing to do.  The debate then comes down to what is strategic and what is not.  Deputy Lawlor talked about Eircom, for example, and the necessity of retaining the copper wire network.  I am not so sure the copper wire network is really a strategic component.  Rather, the strategic aspect is the back office management of customers and the capacity to develop and roll out new technologies.  Sadly, Eircom became a stock-market play when the State did what other states were doing at the time, which was to leverage too heavily the capacity to generate revenue from customers, which is a far more intangible asset than copper wire.  Technology has moved on and we are now looking at next-generation transmission systems.However, my point was not about telecommunications companies.  We need to look at this with our eyes wide open.  Let us consider the proposal to sell Aer Lingus.  In my view, the portion that is retained by the State is of strategic benefit.  There are difficulties with it, it is not the golden share that some might like, but it does provide the State with at least some capacity to influence its own aviation policy.  Without some influence in terms of how an airline operates, the State is not in a position to ensure its broad aviation policy is controllable.  We are an island nation and depend to a huge extent on our capacity to generate inward tourism and outward business because of the level of exports we have.  The Government is talking about developing an aviation policy.  This was alluded to in the recently published Booz & Company report about the ownership and management of our three State airports.  Regional development must be an important component of that.  If we are not in a position to influence in some way the activities of one of our airlines, we will put ourselves at a major disadvantage.  To me, the 25% share is strategic.Others will ask why the Government was unable to influence the activities of Aer Lingus when it sought to move those famous Heathrow landing slots from Shannon Airport a number of years ago.  The Government was left on the back foot at that time because it had not appointed its complement of directors to the board and the airline made a management decision that did not go to board level.  The management decision was to move the Heathrow slots around among airports on the island of Ireland, and we know the impact that had on business and tourism in the west and mid-west.  We should learn our lessons from that.  The last Government certainly learned its lesson, and appointed directors.  We accept that directors of a public limited company must dispose of their fiduciary duties - that is a requirement - yet they can also have a mandate to consider the broader aspects of those fiduciary duties, which would involve regional development.  That was achieved, and the decisions taken in Aer Lingus thereafter about issues such as landing slot allocation had to be made at board level.If the 25% share is sold, it is my contention that the board will not contain any directors appointed by the State.  They will not have the broader remit of considering regional development, tourism or our national interest in maintaining connectivity.  Their only concern will be the profitability of the company.  That is why I believe the 25% shareholding in Aer Lingus is of strategic importance and should not be put up for sale.  The return will be minimal when we take into account the pensions hole that will have to be dealt with as part of any sale.  There will be nothing left for the Government's noble aims of reducing debt and injecting capital into job creation.  I am fearful that this particular aspect of the asset disposal is short-sighted and could create difficulties for us in the long term.  There is also the issue of competitiveness, which I have not had an opportunity to discuss.
#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	286	I wish to share my time with Deputy Mulherin.  I welcome the opportunity to speak on the proposal to sell some of the assets that the State currently enjoys.  It is just gone a year since the last election, and one of the serious mandates this Government was given at the time was to sort out the mess the country was in.  One could boil it down to nothing less than fixing the intolerable problems faced by this country.  It is not so much an ideological issue.  Although that is how some members of the Opposition have portrayed it, that is not the case.  The simple fact is that for every man, woman and child in this country, we are spending €12,192 and taking in €8,312 in income.  That is not sustainable and never will be, and it must be dealt with.  If we look at this in terms of a householder or the treasurer of a GAA club or any other societal organisation, we can see that a decision must be made on the sale of assets, whether we call it that or call it a car-boot sale.  I am pleased that the Minister has taken a pragmatic approach on what should be the sale of non-strategic State assets.I have listened with some amazement and no little humour to Members talking about the sale of Coillte.  Coillte is not for sale and its lands are not for sale.  The product of the land, as Deputy Lawlor quite rightly mentioned, is on the market, but it would be on the market anyway.  Trees grow and mature and then they are felled and sold.  It does not matter who owns them or what they do with them, the process cannot be stopped.  People have talked about the curtailment of walking rights or access to Coillte lands.  When works are being carried out by Coillte, such disruptions take place in any event, and anybody who lives adjacent to Coillte lands in rural Ireland is well familiar with the consultation process.  To suggest that citizens will be refused access to those lands for all eternity is quite simply ludicrous and cannot be accepted.  We have a solid system of waymarked trails and rights of way, and access to those lands is enshrined in our law and will continue to be supported.I remember, in the past, we operated a small telephone exchange in a country office.  Thirty years ago, access to a telephone was a major issue, and many Deputies remember that one of the biggest vote-getters was to promise a phone to a house within two years.  The system was then under public ownership, and the country invested hugely in telephone services.  The Department of Post and Telegraphs became Telecom Éireann, then Eircom, and then it was lost.  That was a harsh lesson for the country and for those who had invested having been told they were investing in their future.  This Government will learn from those mistakes.The proposal for the sale of non-strategic State assets that is under examination shows exactly what should have happened when Eircom came on the market.  If we do not continue with deregulation and the movement of assets, things will never move on.  Today it is less likely to be a question of access to telephones than to broadband connections, and ultimately we will be talking about 100 Mbps broadband connections.There may be an issue about access to other vital State infrastructure.  If State assets are retained in the comfort zone of public ownership, things will never change.  Therefore, decisions must be made.  Even if we were not in the midst of the current economic crisis, we would need to continue to make decisions on what was strategically vital or beneficial to the country.There are advantages to the proposal to allow €1 billion from the proceeds of the sale of these assets to be set aside for job creation initiatives.  This must be welcomed.  If we do not reduce the national debt by €2 billion on foot of the sale of State assets, the money will have to come from some other sector, be it health, education or social welfare.  I have not heard of a proposal from any Member as to the Votes of Departments from which the required €2 billion will come.  It is unacceptable for Deputies to speak about the ideology of the sale of State assets and then return to their comfort zone and say the Government should not cut funding in this or that Department.  That is simply intolerable.

#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue, one which can capture not only our imagination but also that of the public.  I can well understand, based on past form and the history of the disposal of State assets, why people can have reservations about what is entailed.  When we look back on the history of previous Governments which sold many State assets, it is evident that they had no plan in that they should have ring-fenced some of the moneys secured from their sale to ensure we would have had something in place today, instead of the moneys being scattered to the four winds, which appears to have happened in most instances, with the exception of the €1 billion put into the National Pension Reserve Fund.In the case of the TSB, ACC, Eircom and Aer Lingus, shares were sold; some were sold in their entirety and at one stage the Central Bank was raided.  We have also witnessed the confiscation of dormant account funds.  Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, the man who does not want to support the European stability treaty, was instrumental in using the dormant account fund as a slush fund to gain votes in previous elections.  There is poor form in the sale of State assets and definitely their sale was not managed in strategically.However, we are living in times when we have to look at things differently.  We simply cannot dismiss something because we have a certain ideology and as we all know, ideologies can evolve as our understanding grows.  In the times in which we are living we want to be assured good water quality from an economic and health point of view.  We also want energy security, to develop our renewable resources, includindg wind and wave energy projects, and so on.  We want to lead the way technologically in order to create jobs, invest in broadband infrastructure and ensure our aviation, transport and health sectors grow.  We need investment in infrastructure, whether it be in the grid, broadband infrastructure or the pipes in the ground for water services to ensure people throughout the country will have access to a water supply of uniform quality.  Therefore, we have to think differently.  Aside from the obligations on us resulting from the IMF's presence here, we can examine investing money, as envisaged under NewERA, to create and build the kind of future we want to allow economic growth to occur.On the sale of State assets, we need to question if what is being done in the bodies in question is working.  Is it right that the ESB should have a dominant position from a power generation point of view which skews the market?  Most people who have an appetite to invest here and develop our renewables are in the private sector and at times they are frustrated by the constraints imposed upon them.With regard to Coillte, on which I had an exchange with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, yesterday, we should not only consider selling the timber rights but the right to use forestry lands.  Hundreds of thousands acres are in the ownership of Coillte in remote areas that would be suited to developing wind farms.  We should, therefore, examine the granting of long leases to private industry to develop wind farms on forest sites.  As the State would not be involved in developing such facilities, investment capital would not be required, yet we would secure a benefit, the value of which could be released to generate job creation.The current operations are not working right.  Bord Gáis and the ESB are competing with each other in the supply of energy.  Last year the Comptroller and Auditor General said that between them these two companies were spending €20 million on marketing.  They control 75% of the domestic supply market.  All that is happening is that a person knocks on the door of a customer of the ESB to ask him or her to sign up for a Bord Gáis package and a year or two later the ESB asks the same person to sign up for one of its packages.  That is not a wise way to spend taxpayers' money.  I highlight the fact that Bord Gáis has spent €2.4 million to secure the naming rights of the Grand Canal Theatre.  That is not an appropriate activity for a semi-State or State body to be engaged in.We can get the balance right, safeguard key infrastructure, allow the market to develop and give people a chance in the private sector who want to do something in this country.

If any business was in the same position as Ireland, it would look at its assets strategically.  It would examine how it could reconfigure its assets base in order to survive.  We are engaged in an critical analysis of State assets.  However, we are under no obligation to sell them in a firesale.  No one is saying we have to sell them tomorrow, but it has been acknowledged and conceded by those who are funding the country that one third of the receipts of the sale of State assets, whatever they might be, can be reinvested to create jobs.As somebody said to me recently, we have many opinions but very little analysis.  We need to engage in an analysis to determine what would be the best list of assets to sell and which assets are strategic and those which are non-strategic.  In this context, as has been said by others, we need to consider networks as opposed to facilities, be it rail, telecommunications, energy, gas, electricity supply netowrks, etc.  We saw what happened in the case of Eircom when €6.2 billion was used purely for the purpose of ensuring one political dynasty would stay in power forever.  Ultimately, it did not work.  We are now in a position where we are considering selling up to €3 billion worth of assets and using one third of the proceeds to strategically invest in the creation of jobs, be it through the provision of improved water and broadband infrastructure, in order that we can attract foreign investment to allow us to export goods and services.As I live in the uplands of County Wicklow in the heart of forestry territory, I wish to make a few points about Coillte.  Much of what has been discussed with regard to the sale of Bord Gáis Energy, some of the ESB power generating stations, Aer Lingus and other assets is black and white.  The positon on Coillte is much more complicated.  Mr. Colm McCarthy in his an bord snip report said the sale of the land should not be considered, which was welcome.  There are other models, but there are also dangers inherent in every option that might be taken.  Therefore, a long and deep analysis is needed.  For instance, if we were to sell board mills, the chances are they would be bought by a company which was our biggest competitor in the United Kingdom purely to close them down.  Jobs would be lost as a result.  We have to be mindful of that.  If we are not careful about how we auction the licences to fell, there is a risk that the raw materials could be diverted from the board mills.I have been talking to people in Coillte and I understand they are on the verge of a breakthrough in creating a waterproof MDF.  This is where they need to be able to get leverage investment from other countries and from outside investors.  Deputy Colreavy is a colleague of mine on the agriculture committee.  I hope that when representatives from Coillte come before the committee, we get that sort of information out of them and find out what they have in mind.  It could be the case that we do not sell it, but that they try to leverage more money and by so doing, bring in as much money as if some of Coillte was sold or auctioned.  We should look at the New Zealand Crown Forestry licensing system.  It gives the country complete ownership and control, and it even controls the way the licences are auctioned.This debate will go on.  We need to be reasoned about it and we should not look for populist soundbites in respect of the whole issue.

Roimh an toghchán, bhí Pairtí an Lucht Oibire go háirithe i gcoinne díola mar seo.  Tá an Rialtas ag chur an locht ar an AE agus ar an IMF, agus de réir a chéile, níl an dara rogha againn.  Tá rogha eile ann, agus níl sé riachtanach leanúint leis na polasaithe seo.  Tá slí eile ann, agus leag Sinn Féin amach sa bhúiséad slí níos fearr gan a bheith ag díol mhaoin na ndaoine.Recently the heads of Aer Lingus stated their concerns that any Government decision to sell off the public stake in the company would be detrimental to their business model.  This model made a €71 million profit last year, which was nearly double the profit of the previous year.  A 25% stake may not cream as much from that profit as the once-off pay off that we could get for selling the stake on the open market, but that is real profit accruing to the State every year.  Some €71 million is a lot of profit, not to mind the taxes and incomes that are provided by this Irish company, but the Government has stated that it will wait for the best time to sell it off, or when it will be most attractive to do so.  This means that Aer Lingus will be sold to make up part of the €3 billion that the Government intends to waste on repaying debt that is not ours to pay.  It will be even more profitable than it is now, and will be a more juicy cherry to pick for the private business world.The head of communications at Aer Lingus, Declan Kearney, said the following:we would like to stress that our success is very much linked to building connectivity and partnerships with multiple airlines...Ireland is an island and we see it as our primary mission to connect Ireland with the world.  If the stake is sold in a way that is offensive to any of our partners, that would damage our business model and the connectivity of the country.What else do we get from this stake in what is seen around the world as a quality airline which is Irish through and through?  I am not in the habit of quoting Michael O'Leary, but he made a good point about the future of Aer Lingus if it was sold off:Aer Lingus will be broken up because everybody else only wants certain bits: the Heathrow slots and maybe the long-haul.  Nobody wants the short-haul, because they will have to compete with Ryanair.If we sell off Aer Lingus, we lose these slots to interests in the private market, which will do with them what they wish, with no concern for the connectivity of Ireland other than what suits their bottom line.  The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport told The Irish Times that there was no longer any strategic value in owning the Aer Lingus stake, but when we consider “not a red cent”, “the second bailout” and other outrageous statements by the Minister, perhaps we should not give that too much consideration.The State is not an entrepreneur or inventor which can just move on to the next project using the capital from the last sale.  Our State assets like Aer Lingus, ESB, Bord Gáis and Coillte are vital to the interests of the people of this State, as was Telecom Éireann.  The bottom line is that the quick sell off and the one-time pay off do nothing for us.The ESB is a profit-making company that employs 7,000 people.  In 2010, it made €340 million in profits.  Bord Gáis did the same.  The argument that we are only selling off non-strategic assets is the argument that led to the privatisation of companies and the loss of well-paid State jobs.  There is an ideology behind selling off the State assets.  There is a drive towards privatisation from this Government and we in Sinn Féin thoroughly oppose that.

Unfortunately, that promise was dashed this morning by the expulsion of Deputy Doherty for the crime of asking a question of great public interest and concern.The question here is not just about whether it is wise or unwise to privatise our State assets.  It is also a question of the use to which the proceeds of any such sale are to be put.  The Government has claimed that it will raise up to €1 billion to support job creation sometime in the future from the sale of State assets.  It is ironic that the same Government will hand over €3.1 billion to unsecured bondholders at the end of the month.In these hard economic times, the Taoiseach and his Ministers should be eagerly searching for opportunities to improve our job creation structures.  However, the Government is doing the exact opposite.  It is selling off State assets paid for by the taxpayer, putting people's jobs at risk, and taking a gamble on how much the sale of those assets will make.  I predict that the only people who will benefit from the sale of our taxpayer-funded assets are already very wealthy people and institutions whose sole motivation is profit.It is a pity the Government does not look towards Scandinavia to see examples of where real profitable State companies create employment and generate growth.  Sweden has those examples, where the right investment and encouragement breathe life into that nation's economy.  Just like Thatcher and Reagan, this Government is hell bent on ridding this country of Keynesian economic policy.  There is no clearer example of this than the Government's unwavering support for the austerity treaty in the forthcoming referendum.I hope I do not sound arrogant when I say the Taoiseach, the Government and our negotiators are suffering from a very simple but profound misunderstanding.  They seem to regard the troika as a friend and partner of the Irish nation, but the troika is no friend of the Irish family.  No friend would force a family to pay for debt it did not owe.  No friend would force family members to emigrate to seek a living.  No family friend would leave that family without hope.  The troika is no friend if it insists on Irish family impoverishment to safeguard European banks.The Taoiseach is right.  We will not be bribed, but the Taoiseach, the Government and our negotiators should insist that the blackmail stops now.

None of his party or none of Fianna Fáil showed up.  They should remember that.My party did not want to be selling State assets.  I make no bones about it.  What we are trying to do is create jobs for the people of the country.  As Deputy Doyle correctly pointed out, we are trying to stop the emigration of a generation.  It is a profound mess.On the sale of State assets, we should look at forming a way in which we would have an option to repurchase them in future.  It is a time of distress for the nation.  We are not as bad as the Greeks, who are selling €50 billion in state assets and who have a brief window in which to do so.  I am delighted to hear there is no fixed deadline as to when we must sell these assets.  If there is a possibility of selling them with an option of buying them back again, I would welcome that and I would encourage the Minister to look at that.This is about jobs and I am happy to see that €1 billion is being pumped into this area.  I would also encourage that some money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund be put into creating jobs here, especially for the younger generation.However we are conducting this sale, we need to look at protecting those working in these institutions.  That must be at the heart of every decision made.

Given the subject matter of this debate, the impression I got from listening to the debate earlier - in fairness, not including the contributions of those here present - was of Members working up a sweat as if all the national assets were to be sold off tomorrow in a €1 shop or some such nonsense.  Very limited assets are being sold off.  Let us be truthful and accurate in the debate.This country is in a bad place and in, to use Charles Dickens' title, Hard Times.  Anyone who thinks otherwise is deluding himself or herself.  It is constantly repeated here, as it was this morning, the number of people, predominantly young people, leaving this country, the number of people on the dole etc.  Quite correctly, that should be repeated because that is the reality, and that is why this debate is taking place.  If such sales take place, part of the proceeds will be used for job creation, and why not?  I support that.I listened to some Members earlier this morning working up a sweat on the issue of the sale of State assets.  These are the same Members who came in here and took up most of the time on Tuesday talking about bogs and who arrived back yesterday to talk about bogs.  When thousands were standing on the road in the freezing cold at the RDS on Saturday, and again on Sunday, there was not a word from these Members who were talking about bogs.  Did they pick up the Irish Examiner, page 7?  With thousands of people in a car park in Cork, if we went down and canvassed them and asked, “By the way, how do you feel about selling off a limited amount of the national assets”, do they think these people would say “No”?  They would, my arse.  They would welcome any initiative by the Government.  This is the only initiative in this regard.  I have not heard any proposal from that side of the House other than, of course, the bog contribution from the highly Technical Group, who know everything and always want Members to turn up for debates but are never here when the real debate is taking place.  Of course, they are qualified in bogs.  I can just see them all on Mastermind on the subject of bogs.

#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I understand the reluctance of many about the sale of State assets.  The commercial State companies have served the country well since the foundation of the State.  They continue to be a core part of the economy.  They are involved in delivering strategic infrastructure and key services across a number of different sectors.  They have developed significant expertise, technical knowledge and skills and they have generated employment.  It is for this reason I want to make it clear that the Government remains committed to ongoing State involvement in critical areas of economic development.The Government persuaded the troika that asset disposal on the scale of €5 billion was unrealistic in the lifetime of the programme and, more importantly, that it was in the best interests of the revival of the economy that the Government be free to re-invest a significant proportion of the proceeds.  Against that background, the outcome announced by my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, is welcome and is a considerable improvement.  We are in a position where there is only one lender available to the Government and the Government has done exceptionally well to secure approval from the troika that one third of the proceeds will be down to the State for investment in employment.It is far too soon for some of the celebrations that were planned.  The overwhelming public interest now is to bring about sustainability to the public finances and to foster economic growth and jobs.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I have three or four minutes to do justice to a debate.  This is the second opportunity Members had to make a contribution on this and I thank everybody for their contribution.The truth is we do not live in normal times.  Listening to some of the contributions from the far side of the House, one would think these were normal times and we were not in a desperate crisis.  We have taken a step back from the abyss over the past year because of concerted action by Government, but we are still far from clear of danger and we are required to make a series of decisions still which will be difficult.  We should not be peddling the notion that there are soft and easy options, that we should be looking for enormous sums of money to invest in State companies rather than seeking to generate capital from State companies.  Would that we had money.  We are desperately seeking money.Let me be clear about what is the strategy of the Government.  First, the strategy of the Government is to focus on jobs.  We need some form of stimulus to do that.  We need to leverage money from the State assets to invest in the productive sector here.  We need to look to other sources of income, including the National Pensions Reserve Fund, utilised through the policy of establishing a strategic investment bank, the first step of which, the Strategic Investment Fund, is up and running to invest in jobs.  We also need to see how we can go about getting further supports from the pension funds.  Some €70 billion of Irish workers' pension funds is invested - except for 2% in this country - all over the world and we must create vehicles for that to be brought home to be invested in the productive sector here.All of that is under way.  In the interim, we need to take difficult decisions.  We need to realise that, and not peddle falsehoods, voodoo economics or Darby O'Gill economics that there is simple magic dust one can sprinkle.  We changed Government last year.  We did not change the economy.  The Government must tackle the economic reality that faced us and we will do that.Let me speak briefly about some of the contributions.  Deputy Seán Fleming, in his usual balanced way, made some sensible, sound logical points and then could not resist having a partisan go to undo it all.  In terms of this concrete proposals, he spoke of securitising future crops.  That is what we are doing.  That is the matter we are exploring how best to do.On those who spoke of the forests being sold off, we are selling the trees.  It was always expected we would sell the trees.  When the trees mature, would they have us cut them down and present each citizen with one to put in their garden?  They were always to be sold.  That is not selling off the natural assets of the country.  We must do that in a way that ensures we get best value now, when this country desperately needs the resources to keep the queues of which the Members opposite spoke from leaving the country.  I am scandalised by such queues and I want to do everything open to me and to this Government to find a mechanism to prevent them having to take the plane or the boat out of this land.  That is the number one objective of the Government.Finally, there are some Members opposite to whom I listen regularly - Deputies Joan Collins, Boyd Barrett and Pringle among them.  I think they are sincere.  They believe what they say, namely, that we do not have to have real taxes so they are against collecting anything except taxes on the super-rich, whatever that means - there are billions there, if we could only tax the super-rich, but they do not want to tax anybody else or to cut expenditure.  That fantasy-land is well and good for sloganising and rhetoric.  We live in the real world.  We have to get on with doing the people's job, giving them hope to ensure they and their children have a stake and a future in this land.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	305	The size of the public service grew significantly in the early years of the last decade.  By 2008, some 320,000 were employed in the public service and, by 2009, the gross Exchequer pay bill peaked at more than €17.5 billion.  It is perhaps easy to become jaded in our discussion of public service pay costs.  However, I would ask the House to note that the total net cost of the public service pay bill will be reduced from 2008 to 2015 by some €3.5 billion - by 20% in seven years.  This reduction is necessary to contribute to the fiscal adjustment targets essential for our economy.While commenting on public service numbers and the associated pay bill, we must always remember that these costs are the price we pay for a civilised society.  Public servants educate our children, care for our sick and disabled, clean our streets and protect our environment.  Public servants ensure that our rights are protected and our person, homes and businesses are secure.  In an emergency, gardaí, fire and ambulance crews and members of the Defence Forces willingly place their lives at risk in the service of the State and their fellow citizens.  Less dramatic but no less important is the role played by public servants in the administration of a complex modern society such as ours.  Bluntly, too much odium has been poured upon public servants in an effort to divide public and private in recent years, which I regret.Citizens expect and demand a wide range of services to ensure their rights are protected and their well-being is ensured in such areas as housing, water, transport, food safety and the provision of a social welfare safety net.  Business requires an appropriate regulatory environment in which to operate and flourish.  Without such services it would be impossible to attract inward investment and international confidence.  In short, the myriad of roles undertaken by the public service has ensured we now have the healthiest, best educated and most innovative population in this country's history.As I stated, the Government is committed to reducing public service numbers and producing a more customer focused, efficient and better integrated public service which delivers maximum value for money.  This is not being done merely because it is a fiscal imperative; it is being done to ensure we can continue to enjoy a vibrant, modern, forward looking civil society.The Government must and will continue to give close attention to the State's finances.  Ireland is committed under the EU-IMF programme to reducing the overall size of the public service and this is also a key element of the programme for Government agreed one year ago between the two parties.  Delivering this reduction will require continued implementation of the moratorium on recruitment, with exceptions being limited to only essential posts and the utilisation of redeployment as the primary mechanism to fill posts which have been approved.  To protect frontline services, the Government is committed to making fundamental changes to the way the public service operates.  This will inevitably mean changes in the way in which services to the public are delivered.As Deputies will no doubt be aware, the Government is committed to reducing public service numbers to 282,500 by the end of 2015 as part of its reform agenda.  The overriding objective is to have a more customer focused, leaner, more efficient and better integrated public service which delivers maximum value for money.  The establishment of enhanced numbers monitoring systems and multi-annual employment frameworks has strengthened the Government's capacity to control public service pay and plan future staffing levels.  Today, I am pleased to inform Deputies that significant progress is being made in reducing the numbers employed in the public service.  The numbers working in the public service have continued to fall, with the provisional outturn for the end of last year now standing at 296,900, which means we are now at close to the 2005 staffing levels.  This is a year-on-year reduction from the end of 2010 of more than 8,500.  The employment control framework ceiling for the public service in 2011 was 301,000.  To exceed this target by more than 4,000 is impressive.The public service pay bill has stabilised and we are now back to 2006 pay levels.  This is no small achievement and I recognise the impact this has had on public service workers and their families, although, given the response in some quarters, one would think there has not been a significant contribution to our economic recovery from the public service.  I would like to salute the many people in our public services who are striving daily to deliver a first-class service with reduced resources and increased demands.I am confident that, given the number of departures last year, together with estimated retirement figures for 2012, we are well on track to meet our 2012 target of 294,400, exceeding the target set by the previous Government by two years.  This will allow us headroom to recruit up to 3,000 additional staff this year to maintain services, mainly in the health and education sectors, which Deputy Ó Caoláin will be glad to hear.Of course, such a reduction in public service numbers will pose challenges.  It will require a re-focus on business processes and adjustments to the way public servants use available resources.  It will require changes to the way individual public servants go about their daily work and greater flexibility in the way services are provided, for example, with greater use of technology and shared services.  I am certain, however, that our public servants are capable of meeting and exceeding these challenges.  The Croke Park agreement demands a number of specific sectoral and cross-sectoral reforms.  Some of these are designed to save money directly, others are tools to manage and prioritise services, as staff numbers decline.  Reforms so far delivered include reduced leave, extended working hours, rationalisation of agencies, centralised and shared services, staff relocation and staff redeployment.The redeployment arrangements contained in the Public Service Agreement 2010-14, popularly known as the Croke Park agreement, allow the Government to sustain priority services by providing the Government with an effective and efficient mechanism for allocating staff to the areas of highest priority without the need to resort to outside recruitment.  Where recruitment is necessary, this can and will be undertaken within the parameters of the Government's numbers and budgetary strategy.There are some who question the Croke Park agreement.  However, it has provided the framework of co-operation and flexibility to enable us to effect a necessary reduction in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in a climate of industrial peace.  That is very important.  Few of the critics of the Croke Park agreement recognise that it is almost unique in Europe that we are making such fundamental change without industrial unrest and without impact on frontline services.  In simple terms, the agreement provides an agreed framework to reduce base costs, to enhance productivity and to support the public service reform agenda.  There are real advantages to the State as an employer to be able to pursue this ambitious programme without industrial strife.In addition, where the circumstances require it, the Croke Park agreement allows for targeted voluntary exit mechanisms in the public service.  It is envisaged that such mechanisms will be required only when redeployment or upskilling are not appropriate and a permanent reduction in numbers is required.There was some focus on my comments during Question Time last week that the next round of exits would be targeted.  I did not wish to imply that there would be a great new set of programmes but, in future, now that those who wished to exit before the impact of the reduced pay affected their pensions and lump sums, we would look at areas that are overstaffed to see whether we could shrink those as well.As Members are aware, some concern has been expressed about the ending of the grace period towards the end of last month.  I am pleased that the considerable work undertaken in all areas of the public service has ensured that the nightmare scenario depicted by some has not materialised.  It is a little like the year 2000 when people expected something catastrophic to happen.  I am pleased that the management controls, supports and flexibilities that were put in place have managed to get us over that period.  It was expected that between late 2011 and spring 2012 approximately 9,000 public servants would retire.  The latest figures suggest we will have exceeded that slightly.  Overall, there will be approximately 17,000 retirements between 2011 and 2012, which equates to three years of retirements truncated into two.I suspect that in many cases Deputies misunderstood the extent of the departures in February.  Approximately 8,000 retirements will occur over 2012.  What is different this year is that most of the retirements are happening in the first two months rather than over the 12 months as a whole.  It is always the case that staff retiring in any organisation will be among the most experienced.  However it is the responsibility of local management to handle ongoing staff turnover.  It gives opportunities for people to naturally migrate upwards in the public service.Sectoral transition teams have been put in place to deal with the specific short-term challenges arising from the ending of the grace period.  The reports from these teams indicate that they have given due consideration to the impact of staffing reductions on the various sectors, and the most fitting and expeditious ways of managing those have been put in place.  As they have the most current information on service provision at a local level, each sectoral transition team has been directed to communicate actively with the public via whichever appropriate means to allay concerns with regard to critical front-line service delivery.  I said at the beginning of the process that I would not seek to micro-manage it from the top and that there was a responsibility on front-line managers to manage their staffing.  They are sufficiently skilled and paid to do that, and to communicate any difficulties if they arise and their plans to deal with them at local level.  Public concerns about service levels are being addressed proactively and the public should and will be kept informed of business continuity arrangements that are in place.Much has been made also of the fact that public service pension costs are set to rise from €2.1 billion in 2008 to €3.1 billion in 2015.  However, it should be noted that the €1 billion increase in Exchequer pension costs represents a pension liability that was due to mature in any event as a result of the normal retirement of staff recruited 30 to 40 years ago and - this is a critical point - it does not represent a new liability for the Exchequer.  Those who wish to recognise the point do and those who do not, do not recognise it.  The liability was always known.  Those people were coming up to the age of retirement in any event and provision has been made because they were paying for their pension for the past 40 years.There was a significant expansion in many parts of the public service in the 1970s, influenced among other factors by the accession of this country to the then EEC and the introduction of free second level education.  It should, therefore, come as no surprise that we would see additional public service pensioners coming on-stream in this decade as the original cohort of staff reach the end of their careers.The increased number of retirements and the changed nature of society present the Government with the challenge and the opportunity to reshape and reform the public service to meet emerging social needs.  That is the central mission of my Department.  To help with the task, the Government has established strategic workforce planning groups in the Civil Service and in the education, health, local authority, defence and justice sectors.  These workforce planning groups will ensure that sectoral employers are developing plans to deal with the operational and strategic consequences arising from the anticipated staff turnover in 2012 and future years on an ongoing basis.  The sectoral groups are liaising with the central strategic workforce planning forum under my Department.While the primary focus of the numbers policy will remain the reduction in the public service pay bill, there will also be an opportunity in the coming years to reinforce the upskilling and reform of the public service.  It is important that longer-term workforce planning needs are also addressed with, initially, a very small-scale recruitment of staff at various levels across the various parts of the public service.  Measures such as the targeted graduate recruitment competition, which is now under way, will address such gaps.I reiterate that in the first instance, responsibility for operational planning must and will rest with the relevant public service body and its parent Department.  To mitigate the impact on front-line service provision as far as possible, with the co-operation and flexibility of individual public servants, we will fully use the mechanisms set out in the Croke Park agreement, including the filling of essential posts and the utilisation of redeployment.Public services are essential to the functioning of the economy and society.  Citizens and businesses expect and demand a modern public service that is continually improving and delivering more and better for citizens.  It is the intention of the Government to ensure we have such a public service not only for this generation but for the next and future generations.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this special debate on public sector numbers.  I acknowledge that time has been provided for the debate by the Government.  It is probably a good time to have the debate now that 29 February has come and gone.  There was much debate, discussion and anxiety in the months prior to that date.  Perhaps the Minister is correct.  The public might be a little jaded with the topic at this stage.  However, it is important to have an objective discussion on the matter at this remove.There is not a family in this country that is not composed of a mixture of private sector and public sector employees when they meet for Christmas dinner, a wedding, christening or funeral.  I have yet to meet a family that was all in one category or another.  Inevitably, because of the recession, heated debates regularly occur in most houses when there is a big social gathering involving brothers, sisters, cousins, in-laws and outlaws all assembled with different perspectives.  My intention in the debate is to maintain social cohesion and not to set one group against the other because, ultimately, we all work to earn a living and everyone wants to do that to the best of his or her ability.  Whether one works in the public sector or the private sector, it is important that people would do that.It might not be popular among certain groups to say that those in the public service have taken quite a hit in recent years.  A myth exists that people are getting off scot free and those in the private sector are losing their jobs.  I accept that is true and there is suffering all around.  I wish to refer to an interesting set of statistics that came out yesterday as part of the quarterly household survey.  I looked in detail at the figures produced.  Reference is made to employment in the Civil Service, the Defence Forces, the Garda Síochána, the education sector, regional bodies in the health sector and, separately, in the semi-State sector, as well as the total number in the State sector and the private sector.  The figures date from 2008 to the end of 2011, which was just the other day.  This will surprise people.  The figures to which I refer represent people working in the public service, not whole-time equivalents.  The numbers to which I refer will not correlate with the 292 to which the Minister referred.  I assume when he referred to a post he referred to whole-time equivalents.  We are all aware that in every walk of life in the public sector, there is an element of job sharing in some posts.  At the end of 2008 a total of 21% of the workforce worked in the public sector, excluding semi-State bodies, and 25% of the entire workforce in this country at the end of 2008, out of a total workforce of 1.713 million, worked in either the public sector or the semi-State sector, and 75.1% worked in the private sector.  We are all aware that our workforce, the current figure for which is 1.532 million, has reduced.  The number currently employed in the public sector and semi-State area represents 25.8% of the workforce and the number employed in the private sector represents 74.2%.  Four years ago, three quarters of the workforce was in the private sector.  Following jobs losses in the private sector and the introduction of a moratorium and retirements in the public sector, the position remains the same, namely, 75% of the workforce is employed in the private sector and 25% is employed in the public sector, which is remarkable.  These figures were published yesterday by the Central Statistics Office.We are all aware that half of the jobs lost in the public sector were in the health sector.  I will deal separately with that matter later.  I recently heard a person say that the Croke Park Agreement was put in place to protect the pay of public sector staff even if this meant people had to retire or jobs were lost.  What that person failed to take into account is that prior to the Croke Park agreement pension levies and pay cuts had been imposed on the public sector.  There are now job losses in the public sector and pay rates for public sector employees have not increased.  Many people have spoken of employers giving their employees the option of taking a 10% cut in order that all could retain their jobs or of retaining their wage and one person being let go.  I believe most people would have agreed to take a small pay cut, thus keeping everyone in employment.  People have forgotten in the debate on this issue that public sector employees did not have any choice but to suffer the pay cuts and pension levies.  This is perhaps one of the reasons I am on this side of the House, which I understand.  Anyone who does not understand this does not understand Irish society.Many public servants did not vote for members of the previous Government in the last election because of the hit they had taken to their pockets.  While I do not want to get too political now, many public servants voted for the Labour Party because they were not happy with Fianna Fáil.  They might also have been afraid that Fine Gael if elected would cut their wages further.  They voted for the Labour Party because they believed it would be more moderate.  I hope the Labour Party lives up to their expectation.  While I acknowledge that other people will have a different view in this regard, that is mine.The Minister stated earlier that the public sector bill, which in 2008 was €17.5 billion, will reduce over a seven year period by €3.7 billion or 20% to €14 billion by 2015.  Having looked at the figures again, I note that most of the reductions in the pay bill occurred between 2009-2011.  The actual reduction in the pay bill for 2012-2013 will be modest.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	310	Yes. It is the level of saving that will be made on a permanent basis.  All organisations must review their pay and pensions bills.  I will not engage in a debate on there not being any new liability because people are retiring.  However, pay and pension costs need to be addressed.  The Minister stated that the pay bill in 2008 was €17.5 billion and the pension bill was €2.1 billion, which gives us a total of €19.6 billion and that the pay bill at the end of 2015 will be €3.5 billion less, bringing it to €14 billion.  However, the pension bill will have increased by €1 billion to €3.1 billion.  Most companies record pay and pension expenses in their accounts.  They do not try to pretend they are not connected because they are to some extent.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	311	There will be no new liability.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	312	I am speaking only about the cost involved.  The Minister stated that there will be a 20% reduction in the cost of the public sector pay bill.  However, when one adds the cost of the pay bill to the cost of the pensions bill, the actual reduction achieved between 2008 and 2015 will be only 12% or 13%, which while only a modest reduction is to be welcomed.We have had several opportunities to debate maintenance of front-line services, accident and emergency units and so on and I will not get into that now.  However, it is important there is flexibility within the public service and that the Croke Park agreement delivers in this regard.  I will give some examples.  Currently people engaged in administrative work can be redeployed to free up staff to assist in the delivery of front line services.  For example, the employment of clerical staff in the Garda Síochána has allowed gardaí to do more policing work in terms of enforcement of the law and prevention and detection of crime and so on.I would like now to revisit an issue which first arose many years ago.  One of the challenges of the Croke Park agreement will be elimination of the different pay anomalies and arrangements in the public service, including the differing levels of annual leave for county managers.  One particular example - this matter arose many times at Committee of Public Accounts meetings - in respect of which the previous Administration got a great deal of flack, is the cost and failure of the PPARs system in the HSE.  The system is working well in many parts of the country.  On the last occasion a chief executive from the HSE was before the Committee of Public Accounts it was stated that a hold had been put on rolling it out countrywide.The key point is that when structures within the HSE were examined, in terms of pay, holiday leave entitlements and so on, 2,700 different arrangements were identified.  There were more than 50 different rostering schedules in respect of porters, who open and close doors.  I am told that these arrangements were put in place by county health committees which later became regional health boards and subsequently the Health Service Executive.  An attempt was made to computerise the payroll system within the HSE.  However, I believe that the operation on the ground should have been streamlined before this commenced.  Had that been done, computerisation of the payroll system would have been easier.  An attempt was also made to computerise the 2,700 different local arrangements in place.We all know that staff in some hospitals get an hour off to attend mass on a holy day, a half day off to attend a local festival, time off to cash their cheques, despite that they are no longer paid by cheque and so on.  Staff in the Defence Forces who live within 100 km of the Border are still being paid allowances for Border duty.  Up to recently, new recruits were being paid Border duty allowances despite that such duty is no longer done.  All of these issues need to be addressed through the Croke Park agreement.  I will be impressing on the chairman of the implementation body the need for him to produce a comprehensive report on the Croke Park agreement.  If he does not, the public will lose confidence in it.  I will tell Mr. Fitzpatrick, who is a man of great competence, that in the public interest he needs to deliver a report which details Department by Department what shortcomings or good news has been identified.  The public is not interested in hearing about overall cost savings.  It is important, if the Croke Park agreement is to be continued, that the public retains confidence in it.A point often forgotten in the debate on this issue is that the Croke Park agreement brought about a level of industrial peace.  We have not had the type of disputes or protests witnessed in Greece.  Many people will say public servants have not gone on strike because they have retained their well paid jobs.  Many public servants are not well paid.Members can concentrate on another day on the coterie of people who are in receipt of more than €100,000.  While I acknowledge they exist and this is too high, most people in the public service who I meet have pay packets of approximately €500 per week.  Moreover, many public servants who work in my local authority probably are eligible for social housing, such is the level of their income, and this must be taken into account.People must realise what would be the impact of the absence of industrial peace.  For example, what would a hiccup in the health service lasting one to three weeks do to the waiting lists?  All elective surgery would be postponed and accident and emergency activity would be postponed for several days.  I acknowledge people working in the health service would never walk off the job and fail to deal with urgent, emergency cases, but industrial action would add to the backlog and probably would set back public access to the health services by several months, as measured by waiting lists.  It would be the same were anything to happen in the education sector.  I do not believe the Government ever should be soft in giving pay simply to buy industrial peace, but it would be the same story in respect of social welfare.  If people did not receive cheques or money into their bank accounts every Thursday morning, there would be revolution on the streets.In debates like this, it is important for Members to remember that people no longer live from week to week but are living day to day.  Today is Thursday and many people in Ireland have not eaten since Tuesday.  I have met people in my constituency who had no heating in their houses.  In that context, I will say something extraordinary: this recession has an aroma.  I now regularly meet people who, due to their poverty, lack the money for fuel to heat their houses.  Their clothes become damp when they go outdoors and, on their return home, they lack heating in their houses to dry their clothes.  When one meets such people the next day, there is a smell of damp clothes in the air.  People should begin to realise this is the current position.  Although calling up the lorry to fill up the tank with central heating oil may be fine for some people, it is different for other people, both in my constituency and that of the Minister.  The main oil distributors in County Laois and elsewhere allow people to fill a five-gallon drum to bring home enough heating oil to keep the central heating in their houses running for a week.  This is the state to which people have been reduced.  People used to speak of being obliged to draw water but at present, some people are drawing central heating oil home in five-gallon drums.  This is the level of poverty that obtains at present and, consequently, Members seek to protect the current level of social welfare payments.  While Members can get all hot and bothered in the Chamber about the big issues, they must remember that poverty levels are increasing and such people must be the focus of their attention.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	313	In recent weeks, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has repeatedly denied that the 9,000 public sector workers who have retired over recent months have done so as part of an incentivised scheme under agreements made under the Croke Park agreement.  I am not quite sure of the reason the Minister feels he must lead every discussion on the retirements now under address with an indignant rebuttal of the facts.  How does an employer achieve significant downsizing of his or her organisation?  The answer, of course, is by incentivised redundancies or enhanced retirement packages.  It is an absolute nonsense for any Cabinet member to stand up in this Chamber and deny the grace period retirement scheme is anything but an incentivised scheme.  The programme for Government commits to a reduction in public sector employees of between 18,000 and 21,000 by 2014.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform reaffirmed this commitment in his budget 2012 announcements, which stated the Government expects to reduce public sector numbers by 37,500 by 2015 from the number of workers in the service in 2008.  There is no ambiguity here.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party have shouted from the hilltops their commitment to slash tens of thousands of public sector jobs.This incentivised scheme has not targeted, for example, the much talked about bureaucracy across the HSE.  It does not reflect new structures or seek to complement the public sector reforms about which one hears so much.  It literally has been a free-for-all that has hit the front line hardest and has resulted in an overnight exodus of knowledge, skills, experience and expertise that have been developed over many years.  It is plain silly for any Minister to tell Members the loss of 7,500 staff in the last two months, and 9,000 staff in total, is no big deal.  It is a very big deal.  Change management consultant Eddie Molloy has commented that such a significant loss of senior knowledge and skills across the public sector would take five years to process if managed correctly.  While the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform can talk about transition teams till the cows come home, the simple fact is that by its own admission, the Government knew neither who was leaving the public sector nor the numbers involved until the end of January of this year.  The health service alone has lost 4,200 posts, while education, the Civil Service, local authorities, defence and the Garda have lost 2,058, 1,236, 931, 362 and 310, respectively.In the recently published HSE regional plans for 2012, there is no sign of what the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, called his "dynamic contingency plan" to cope with the loss of staff.  My local HSE region, Dublin-north east, covers north Dublin and counties Cavan, Louth, Meath and Monaghan.  It saw the retirement of 400 staff by the end of February and, on top of this, the service plan for this region states that up to 561 more staff will need to leave the service this year.  The exodus of 961 staff from one region will be a devastating blow to health services across the board, a fact the Minister could not bring himself to admit when I questioned him on this matter in the Dáil on 15 February.  The HSE Dublin-north east plan states these further significant reductions will be needed before any priority replacement staff are recruited.Last month, the HSE chief executive, Mr. Cathal Magee, told the Committee of Public Accounts that he intends to take on 400 mental health staff.  However, when questioned further by Sinn Féin, he admitted that 500 mental health workers, including 370 nurses, will leave the health service under the Croke Park early retirement scheme.  This is a net loss of 100 mental health workers hidden behind a so-called good news story by the HSE and is just one example of how skewed the Government's policy is.The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, perhaps naturally, has shirked ministerial responsibility for managing the decrease in personnel by stating it is a matter for the public services bodies and their respective Departments.  Public services bodies must first look at work practices, reorganisation and redeployment and only then, if a Department identifies a "potential exception to the moratorium on recruitment", can it seek new recruits under the sanction of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  However, he and other Ministers have stated they may recruit up to 3,000 new public sector workers, although all may not be on a full-time permanent basis.  It is clear there is no actual Cabinet strategy to deal with the impact on services arising from the job losses.Sinn Féin's proposals to tackle the budget deficit expenditure would eliminate waste and protect front-line services.  Our proposals did not require an incentivised retirement scheme and allowed an additional €145 million to ease the recruitment ban for front-line services.  Sinn Féin would tackle excessive pay and pension in the upper echelons of the public sector.  It is unacceptable to protect the pay privileges enjoyed by the almost 7,000 highest paid civil servants at the expense of desperately needed nurses and special needs assistants.  I can only imagine what would have been the reaction of the Minister if the Labour Party was still in opposition.Fine Gael and the Labour Party continue to peddle the myth that the public sector is bloated.  I accept that public sector numbers increased between 1995 and 2007.  However, this increase was set against a very low base.  Even before the reduction in current public sector numbers, Ireland had the third smallest public expenditure as a percentage of GDP in the world and was only above Mexico and Korea in this regard.  People should consider the facts.  Heaping private bank debt on to the sovereign has skewed the figures but the fact remains that we do not have excessive numbers of public sector workers.Savings can be found and must be made.  Nobody would argue against that.  Flexible work practices and interdepartmental redeployment must be both continued and accommodated.  The economic advantages of shared services and online facilities have not been fully realised across Departments and local authorities.  This is not reform, however, it is merely a process of belated modernisation.  It is public sector management finally playing catch-up with the private sector.  Radical reform would be constituted in the form of an agreement which ended the culture of entitlement and lack of accountability across the top levels in the public sector.  We are continually informed that these individuals, whomever they may be, are worth the big bucks they are paid.  As recent studies have shown, however, this is not the case.A research paper published November 2011 by the Institute of Public Administration, entitled, Public Sector Trends 2011, found that remuneration rates vary significantly from top levels to bottom levels in central government, with a much bigger gap than that which exists in the Nordic countries.  The remuneration paid to top and middle management in central government is significantly higher than European norms, while that paid to administrative staff is towards the lower end of those norms.  Let us consider the position in this regard.  Senior public servants' remuneration levels are over seven times those of administrative staff.  In Nordic countries, those levels are only 3.5 times greater.  Middle management remuneration levels in this State are four times greater than those of administrative staff.  In Nordic countries, they are two times greater.  The Government's organisational review programme of Departments outlines myriad management failures.  Such is the depth of the problems in the Department of Education and Skills with the disbursement of European Globalisation Fund moneys that the relevant Minister has described his officials' handling of the funding as "maladministration".The reality remains that front-line services are delivered by people and if the Government keeps hacking away at public sector numbers, this will make a bad situation infinitely worse.  Some 85% of the HSE's staff are front-line workers, with 93% of them involved in direct service delivery.  It is nonsense to suggest that the loss of 4,200 positions will not impact adversely on the health service's ability to provide health care.  In his initial contribution, the Minister said that, despite the reduction in numbers, it appears things are still being done.  He should make no mistake: it is early days.

It gives none of us any comfort to state that real issues and problems are going to arise because adequate provision has not been made across all services and Departments.  The retirements in question follow hot on the heels of a devastating recruitment embargo across the public sector which has decimated the front line.  No where is this more in evidence than in the area of health.The sovereign deficit must be addressed and no one is arguing against public sector reform because it must happen.  However, slashing public sector numbers will neither solve the State's economic crisis, nor will it deliver real reform.  This approach just does not tick the boxes.

The Minister has been a champion of all of these throughout his political life.  If, however, the public sector does not have adequate numbers to deliver services, then we are facing into a very real and protracted crisis.This Government has alternatives available to it in the context of addressing the Exchequer deficit.  In that context, why not secure a write-down of the capital payment of the promissory note relating to the former Anglo Irish Bank, which will cost €30 billion plus the additional cost of borrowing the capital?  Why not tackle the State's soaring levels of structural unemployment through a capital stimulus investment programme funded by the National Pensions Reserve Fund and the European Investment Bank?  Why not complete the regeneration projects in Limerick and Dublin?  Why not properly kick-start the wind power industry across the island by working with commercial semi-State management and leveraging State assets?  Why not provide the necessary capital investment to roll out next generation broadband, taking Ireland to the top of the broadband league?  Why not increase our competitiveness and, critically, our attractiveness in the context of the creation of further high-tech jobs?  These are just a few examples of what could and should be done.It is most disappointing to be obliged to note - the sense of disappointment in this regard is greatest among all of those who bought into the promises made by the Minister's party and Fine Gael just over 12 months ago - that the Government, like Fianna Fáil before it, continues to trot out the same failed proposals that have done such a disservice to ordinary citizens throughout both our domestically created crisis and the world economic crisis.  Quite frankly, those citizens deserve better.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	319	The title of these statements, which relates to public sector numbers, is wrong.  The title should have referred to the reform of the public service and the provision of quality public services to the citizens of the State.  The focus of our attention must be on these aspects of the debate.  People are required in order that quality public services might be delivered.  The Minister referred to managers being employed to manage.  The difficulty is that this presupposes an equal distribution of managers, both geographically and across the relevant skill sets, which simply does not exist.  We face a major challenge in this regard.It is understandable that unions will represent the best interests of their members.  A great deal of rubbish has been uttered in respect of the Croke Park agreement.  The latter certainly offers particular benefits and we would have run into serious difficulties without it.  The agreement is compartmentalised in respect of public servants.  The focus of the Government and the Minister's Department is, for economic reasons, to reduce public service numbers.  I am concerned that the focus of attention on public services will only happen somewhere down the line.  There is a need to focus on those services now.I wish to refer to a couple of matters.  I wrote to the Garda Commissioner yesterday seeking a meeting.  We had a meeting with the assistant commissioners last year and we might as well not have bothered doing so.  This has been the case on several occasions in the past.  I wish to highlight the position in the context of the unfair distribution of Garda numbers.  This is not a matter for the Minister for Justice and Equality, it is one for the Garda Commissioner.  The ratio of gardaí to members of the population in Kildare is 1:640.  This is the worst ratio in the country.  Sligo and Leitrim are at the other end of the spectrum, with one garda for every 82 people.  There is a significant difference, with a national average of one garda for 379 people.There was an awful shooting in Kilcock in the past week, but no matter how many gardaí we have, that probably could not have been prevented.  The problem is with unfair distribution, as this exposes areas to such criminality.  Criminals may be bad but that does not mean they are stupid.  They will go where they are less likely to be caught or detected.  I would not say the following unless I absolutely believed it.  The Garda Commissioner and his predecessors have not done their job.  It is only fair that the people of this country, irrespective of where they live, get an equal service proportionate to population and crime rates.  Areas like Kildare, Meath and Wexford - which are growing - are not getting a fair crack of the whip.  The Garda Commissioner should be asked to speak to the Minister for Justice and Equality to deal with this serious problem.With schools, distribution again illustrates what happens in the growing areas, such as Fingal, where the population grew by 13.8% between 2006 and 2011.  The average class sizes there are 10.4 above the national average.  Kildare and Meath are the other counties which feature strongly, and at the other end of the scale are counties in the west or others with a very gradual increase in population.  The historical model is used where a need must be demonstrated before a service can be supplied.  That impacts disproportionately on growing areas, and primary school children in those areas suffer a disproportionate impact.I will also mention local government.  I have put together a table on the most recent figures received from replies to parliamentary questions.  The areas at the bottom end of this spectrum again take in the counties on the periphery of cities or in commuter belt areas.  Meath had the lowest ratio in the country, for example.  I do not point this out because the Minister of State is in the Chamber.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	321	There is one member of staff for every 294 people in Meath but there is one member of staff for every 88 people in Dublin city.  There is one member of staff for every 118 people in Leitrim.  We cannot deliver libraries, planning compliance, or the taking in charge of housing estates unless there are people working in local authorities.  There is a very unfair distribution and not only are we losing numbers, it is happening at different proportional rates.I have already had people on the phone to me in tears because of the cutbacks in health services.  I have been trying to resolve the problem, and one would think that if there is a phone line, there would be somebody at the end of it.  I do not know how many phone calls I have made in recent days where I cannot get to speak to somebody who can deal with the withdrawal of services to children in my area who are on the autistic spectrum.  The liaison person dealing with schools has been moved and the service is being curtailed.  There may be an expectation that crisis will manifest itself in hospitals through cutbacks in the HSE, but it is already obvious in areas where there is a need, particularly when it involves vulnerable children.  There is no point in us talking about putting children at the centre of our attention and considering referendums if the most vulnerable children are the first to feel an impact from the cuts in public service numbers.

Deputy Murphy is right in her comments about Garda numbers, and criminals are not stupid and will move to places that are poorly policed.  That is not the fault of local gardaí but rather a result of decisions made at the top.  That is disgraceful.I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, but it is a pity the Minister, Deputy Howlin, has left as I have commended him for many of the jobs he has tried to do in reforming the public sector.  The task he has been given is not easy.  It is made twice as difficult by the promises made before the last election.  Letters went out from SIPTU to every community employment scheme in the country urging its members to support Labour, but they have been under siege and decimated ever since.  I will not get into that today.I pay tribute to the many hundreds of thousands of decent public service workers throughout the country who have worked so hard over the years.  I was at retirement events for two officials in Teagasc last Friday night and I have been invited to a similar event for an ambulance driver, Mr. Michael Wall, who is retiring after 44 years of service.  People like him have provided great service and did their job with hard work and dedication.  When 4,200 people are taken from the HSE, 1,030 people are taken from the Civil Service, 931 people are taken from local authorities and 315 people are taken from the Garda, how can we continue, especially when people are not being replaced?A certain large number of appointments have taken place under the radar in recent years, both before the current Government was in office and since.  Privileged positions, such as ushers to esteemed justices, have been filled while basic front-line services have been removed.  That is an outrage and insulting.  It should not be done because we will be left with many chiefs and no Indians.  The unions must be involved with this as their representatives sat around the table in the good times and shared the spoils.  They have completely abandoned front-line workers at the coalface, such as the man on the road, the lower paid public servants in offices, clerks and administration personnel.  We saw what happened with the HSE fund that was to train people but was abused by union leaders.The Construction Industry Federation, CIF, was also a cosy partner at the table when the negotiations took place in the good times.  There are investigations into the actions involving unions, with €30 million or up to €100 million gone missing.  Ordinary front-line employees in the trenches, working drills and jackhammers and laying blocks, paid the fees every week to the federation but they are getting nothing now.  The money is gone like snow from a ditch.  Hard questions must be asked about where it has gone and the scandals that went on at every level throughout the country.  This happened even when times were not good but when the economy improved, these problems were compounded.Senior public servants are apparently paid seven times more than the administration personnel or the man on the road providing front-line services or called on in an emergency.  These include gardaí or paramedics who must attend awful tragedies, such as the house in Kildare the other night.  They also attend to accidents, such as the tragedy in County Louth, to pick up the pieces and inform families.  It is awful.  I am told that 85% of the staff in the HSE are front-line staff, with the rest as managers.  If that is the case, much of the money is going on managers.  Their careers are important to them and they are not interested in front-line staff or patients.  In many cases they want to build their own careers and nest eggs.  In St. Luke's Hospital in Clonmel, which is in my constituency, the offices are fit for a king or queen, with paintings on the wall.  It seems they think: "To hell with front-line services, the public and everything else."  I call these people self-serving.  It is outrageous and it should not have been allowed happen.We must have the highest standards in public service and we have had the highest standards over the years.  I wish well the public officials who have retired.  We have a new Secretary General at the Department of Finance.  I will not mention his name but everyone knows who he is.  There are serious question marks over his appointment.  I am all for bringing in people from outside the public service to mix it up and bring in outside expertise.  However, we must have impeccable standards and such people must have unblemished records.  This man should stand aside for the present until such time as he comes before the Committee of Public Accounts or an Oireachtas committee with responsibility for finance to answer questions on the five-year sabbatical which shows as a gap in his CV after he left Zurich Capital Markets in the United States.  Major problems occurred and it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The company in question was severely fined.  I am not saying he is guilty of anything-----

He was CEO and the buck must stop at the top.  He should stand aside and come before the Oireachtas committees.What is the point of us tarnishing good public servants who want to do their jobs and work with the Department?  Incidentally, since the man who has become the new Secretary General joined the Department of Finance, a building society was taken over.  The main architect of this, and the person who signed all of the affidavits, was the same gentleman.  I cannot say too much because of existing court cases.  Did the State take, steal or rob the shares of these ordinary people?  We must question this.  When it happened, the main adviser and architect was this same gentleman.  We must have the highest standards possible and we cannot have any question marks.I have sat on interview boards during the years for menial and senior jobs.  If any CV had a five-year gap, questions would be asked as to why someone would take a sabbatical.  Was it enforced?  Was it agreed?  Was it taken because the company was questioned?  I do not know.  The CV of the man in question states he was CEO during the particular time.  The Department of Finance might say something different, such as on the news at one o'clock today.  Either his CV is wrong or the Department of Finance is wrong.  He must be brought before a committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I support the request of Deputy McGuinness that members of the Committee of Public Accounts and Oireachtas committees with responsibility for finance should be on the interview boards.  We must have the openness and transparency promised by the Government to get rid of the last shower which was not open on anything.  However, the Government is worse and neglecting this job.

Some of these are fair, and I agree with some of the points made on the process and how it unfolded, but not with others.  I ask people to consider the alternative to the approach outlined.  There is general agreement that we need to reduce the cost and size of our public services, but the number of options open to us to do so are quite limited.The first option open to us is another round of wage cuts.  If the Government were to follow this route, it would be the third such wage cut in 24 months, which is something any government would be eager to avoid given the recent implementation of two such wage cuts in a short time period.  The next option is to reduce the number of people in the public service.  There would be no consensus or support for the Government following the route of compulsory sackings from the public service.  The Government chose the voluntary route, asking people whether they wanted to leave and whether it is worth while to do so given where they were in their lives, the options open to them and the support the State could give them. Once one goes down this route, one must give people time to make up their minds and respond.  Of the three options available to the Government to deliver the targets of a public service that is affordable inside the constraints of the money we are raising, this is clearly the most attractive and fairest route.The point has been made that this generated uncertainty regarding where we would end up, and this is a fair criticism.  However, I ask people to bear in mind that once we go down the voluntary route, our understanding of where we will end up will always be uncertain because one must see how people respond.  It is an inevitable consequence of going down the route requiring the consent of one's employees.  That being said, there could have been greater clarity regarding where we thought the exits would come from and better understanding of what numbers could be delivered without putting pressure on front-line services.Given what is happening, a discussion on the number of people we have in our public services misses the point.  We need to focus on what they can deliver and how we can support them in doing so.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	348	One of the most regrettable features in the difficult times we have been experiencing has been the forces attempting to pitch one group of society against another: young against old, urban against rural, employed against unemployed, and private sector against public sector.  These attempts have served no purpose whatsoever in the battle to regain our economic sovereignty, which is a battle that can be won only by working together.In recent weeks, several thousand workers from across the public service have opted for early retirement.  It has been highly distressing for some workers to hear accusations that they have, as it were, taken the money and run.  When one considers the facts, it is clear that a completely false and inaccurate picture was constructed by some sections of the media who often engage in rounds of attacking the public sector.A total of 87% of public sector workers who opted to retire were over 60 and had given 40 years or more of dedicated service to the Irish State.  The remaining 13% were in their mid to late 50s and opted to receive a reduced pension.  I hope this will put an end to the erroneous belief retiring public servants were receiving anything more than that to which they were entitled.While the public sector is, as a whole, imperfect, many of its problems lie in the shortcomings at leadership level, by which I mean Government level.  During the so-called Celtic tiger years, when governance was less concerned about value for public money and more about popular, headline grabbing measures, the public sector grew immensely.  The 2009 report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes, otherwise known as an bord snip nua, contained some startling revelations.  In the seven years between 2001 and 2008 public sector numbers increased from 270,000 whole-time equivalent posts to just shy of 320,000.  This increase of approximately 45,000 positions cost the public purse €2.25 billion.  By 2009 the overall public sector pay bill was a staggering €17.5 billion.  To put this figure in context, State revenue at the time was slightly more than €30 billion.  With such substantial increases in expenditure and personnel, it would not have been unreasonable to expect the most efficient and effective public service in the world.  However, what taxpayers received was a service lacking an overall strategy and focus.  Funds and additional public moneys were thrown at any and every problem as a universal solution.Another startling revelation from the 2009 report was that between 1997 and 2009 the number of middle and higher level managers in the public service increased by 82%.  Another solution to whatever problem presented itself was to add an extra layer of management.  Is it any wonder that there is such anger at the fundamentally flawed financial and economic decisions taken by some at senior managerial levels, including Government level?The stark reality facing us is that we must work within our means, a concept which was undoubtedly lost on many in the previous Governments.  The Government cannot afford the public sector it inherited.  For this reason, it has committed itself to reforming, reshaping and refocusing the public service.  Reducing public sector numbers is a crucial part of the effort to stabilise public expenditure in the battle to regain our economic sovereignty.  I am heartened to note attention is not only on reducing numbers but also on refocusing how the public sector works.  This will allow us to ensure services are delivered in the most effective and efficient manner.Out of our economic problems we can seize an opportunity not only to achieve the necessary savings but also to reform the service, by which I mean changing how we do things, examining and reviewing business practices to ascertain whether they are serving us well and identifying more customer focused approaches.  I very much welcome how the Government has prioritised public sector reform, with the most visible action being the creation of a new Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  I also welcome the new focus on communication and dialogue, specifically communication between the Government and the Oireachtas and members of the public on the planned changes and the progress made in dialogue between the Government and public sector workers.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has been most active in communicating its actions.  Every Deputy and Senator has received the comprehensive reports and reform documents on a regular basis allowing progress to be closely monitored.The other significant driver of reform has been the public sector agreement, more commonly known as the Croke Park agreement.  Although the agreement is not without its problems and has attracted both supporters and opponents, no one can doubt that reforms have occurred as a result of it.  The goals and targets set and exceeded are unambiguously set out in the various progress reports of the implementation body.It would be dishonest of me if I did not point out that public sector workers enjoy a measure of job security above and beyond that available in the private sector.  However, no one can deny that savings have been made or that public sector workers have taken pay cuts, are making higher pension contributions and changing old and often unproductive business practices.  The proof is available.  The total number in the sector fell ahead of schedule to below 300,000 at the end of 2011.  This year it will be lowered further to reach a target level in order that by 2015 we will not only be back to more sustainable figures before the excesses of the years of Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats and Green Party coalitions but we will also have a more efficient public service capable of meeting the needs of all citizens.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	349	Having listened with great interest to Deputy Seán Kyne, I advise him to conduct a little more analysis.  While he is correct to note a large increase in public sector numbers under previous Governments, one must drill into this figure to identify the sectors in which the largest increases occurred and from where they were driven.  Many of the increases were in the health care professions.  One will find, for example, that the number of physiotherapists, speech therapists and so forth increased dramatically from 1997 onwards.  These are vital front-line staff and it will be extremely difficult to claw back the increases in their numbers because most people believe a modern economy needs their services.A second area in which numbers increased significantly was the Garda Síochána.  I never agreed with the drive for more and more gardaí; I believe instead that we should increase the number of community gardaí.  I am totally opposed to removing gardaí from the community because one garda living in a community is worth three gardaí travelling into an area, working an eight hour roster and returning home.  While the garda who lives in the community technically works 40 hours each week, he or she is in the community at all times.Similarly, the number of special needs assistants increased by 10,000 while we were in government.  This increase accounts for approximately 25% of the increase in the number of jobs in the education sector.  The number of teachers, including resource and language teachers, also increased substantially.  A significant increase in the population in the period after 1997 also created a need for more services.  If this problem was as easy to solve as Deputy Seán Kyne suggests, one could decide tomorrow to get rid of 45,000 excess public servants.  I guarantee him, however, that if one was to take this approach, many of the services for which his party argued would be decimated.Governments can function with or despite the Oireachtas.  The Government is fortunate to have a large majority which allows it to ignore most Deputies on this side of the House.  It also has a sympathetic media, which may not be a bad thing at times.  The reality during the Fianna Fáil Party's time in government was that it did not matter how sensible or overdue were the changes we made, the Fine Gael Party and, in particular, the Labour Party opposed them line by line.  In cases in which one could have done with fewer staff and done the job more effectively, the Opposition still opposed changes.  At times, the Labour Party, in particular, was more obsessed with job numbers than services.I commend the vast majority of public servants who do their jobs well.  I have no doubt the percentage of public servants who are interested in their job is as high as the percentage of employees interested in their job in any other sector.  However, change is necessary and the Opposition in this Dáil is a good one which will not resist change for the sake of it.  I continue to believe, however, that the job could be done better.  Anyone who worked with me in the Departments will know I placed great emphasis on efficient public administration.  Any Deputy who served in the House while I was a Minister will know that I went to considerable effort to ensure Members received timely and full replies to queries.  As I used to say to civil servants, it is no good providing a reply in three or five months because that is not what public representatives or members of the public want.  They want a reply to a question on the day they submit it.  I made good progress in the areas I could control.  The small Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, in which I had an opportunity to serve for a long time, enjoyed very high public commendation.  It also disproved the theory that decentralisation was inefficient.  As the years progressed and we decentralised, it became quicker, more open and better at meeting the demands and requirements of members of the public.Trade unions in the public service are often unrepresentative of the great mass of the workers.  The impression I often had was that if one had 1,000 staff working in a Department, the union would be lucky if 150 of its members attended the annual general meeting.  Moreover, those who attended the AGM tended to be those who took a strongly ideological position on what the public service was about.  This was not always a positive ideology.  The trade unions often impeded progress which would have made the job of workers easier.  When I raised this issue as Minister for Social Protection, I was informed the system had to be changed, which was a good idea.  The Department started to involve workers at the lowest level, in other words, front-line staff, in the design of the system.  Part of the reason for doing so was to work around the public service unions, which is a sad commentary on them.  I am very pro-union in the case of unions working in the genuine interests of workers and trying to create stability.We have built inefficiencies into the system; for example, manual systems continue to be used where computerisation is possible.  That still happens in the case of maintenance records and so on in the Department of Social Protection, which is outdated.  When such inefficiency is built into a system, inevitably, it results in poor service, huge delays, a great deal of anger among the staff who have to service the front desk and general dissatisfaction, which is not good for the workplace.  On the other hand, when quick answers are given and efficient systems are used, the queues disappear and the time lost in addressing parliamentary questions about issues that should have been dealt with long ago is recovered.  There is a good feeling when people approach the Department which, therefore, is a much more pleasant place in which to work.I appreciate that Deputy Seán Kyne gave so much credit to the previous Government for bringing in the greatest game changer in public service attitudes to work practices.  However, we must get away from the unplanned reductions we have witnessed in the public sector recently.   Rather than conducting an overall general analysis, each job and section must be analysed as one would analyse a factory to establish the way each job is done and whether, for example, forms are unnecessarily complicated by asking essay type questions when questions that required boxes to be ticked would provide better answers and be more objective.  It would also establish whether the methods in place created unnecessary bureaucracy.  I could give concrete examples of how the way work is done could be changed to make it much simpler for the applicant and much quicker for the Department to deal with applications.I question whether we need all the tiers and grades in the public service such as clerical assistants, staff officers, executive officers, higher executive officers, assistant principal officers, principal officers, assistant secretaries, Secretaries General and a few other grades that I have not thrown in.  An executive officer today could be Secretary General in ten years, but by then the spirit of entrepreneurship and drive will have left him or her.  It is valid to ask whether every officer should have to climb four or five tiers.In the past 15 years, because of management consultants, many layers were added to the public sector to improve services, but poorer services resulted.  I refer to two initiatives, the first of which is Better Local Government.  It diluted the impact of local government on core services.  Any corporation in the private sector would state one should maintain such services.  The second is the Strategic Management Initiative which was all about ticking boxes pro forma but which did not deliver on the ground because there was no focus on making jobs deliver a better service to the public.The level of uncertified sick leave in the public service must be brought into line with that in the private sector because, as previous speakers said, it has led to staff believing this leave is holidays under another name.  This is unfair to workers who do not take such leave and has to be changed.The value of much of the training and third level courses paid for by the State has to be questioned.  A great deal of training was undertaken and I often wondered whether the plethora of public servants with MBAs, PhDs and MAs paid for by the State performed better than those who did not have them.  Were the people who took these courses not making a contribution to the State anyway?  Others who were close to leaving the public service did these courses, meaning the Exchequer would never recoup the money involved.  This issue needs to be examined carefully.When we brought in the pension levy, it did not affect pensions, but when we cut public service pay, we should have cut public service pensions at the same time.  The pay and pension ratio should never have been changed.  Now we have the crazy anomaly that will last for many years where two public servants with the same length of service will receive different pensions at the end of their careers because of a cut-off date.  It is important to admit mistakes made.  Over time, the Government should put this right.
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  It is our responsibility, as a Government, to deliver public services we can afford and, by the end of this year, the public service pay bill will reduce to approximately €15 billion.  There has been a significant saving since the process began in 2008, with a view to a total reduction of more than €14 billion by 2014.  This will have a significant impact on budgetary issues.  This necessitates changes in 2012 that will have the greatest impact on services, at which point we will have reached 70% of our target reduction.  For this reason, this year presents an opportunity for the public sector to reaffirm its commitment to the conditions of the Croke Park agreement.  I have had the opportunity as a member of a Government party to meet the unions and individual public service workers in recent months and there is a sense of willingness among them to bring about change in order that they not only adhere to the agreement but also ensure the State wil be in a better position when the agreement concludes.While staff reductions will result in many changes to the public service, this is part and parcel of the agreement to ensure savings can be made without cutting jobs or wages and to provide for the delivery of improved services.  The agreement is not only about reducing staff numbers and hoping for the best; it also allows for strategic conditions to be put in place amidst a reduction in resources, while enabling management to continue to identify options for redeployment.  Ordinary retirements throughout the public service create an opportunity and a challenge for young, ambitious public sector workers to make their mark and bridge the gaps, where necessary, while also encouraging newer strategies to improve work practices.Two Ministries are focused on the delivery of a smaller, more efficient public service.  I welcome the Taoiseach's recent establishment of the transition teams to manage the impact of early retirements following the closure of the scheme on 29 February.  These teams will oversee the management of the delivery of public services under the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  Recruitment will be enabled, despite the embargo, where Departments can justify a requirement for additional staff resources.As Deputy Seán Kyne said, there has been a debate in the media pitting public and private sector workers against one another, which is unfortunate, because, in an international context, public service participation in the workforce stands up in comparison to our European counterparts, with 14.8% of the workforce employed in the public sector.  This is at the mid-point of the scale compared with France, the United Kingdom and Denmark, while it is significantly ahead of Germany, Italy and Greece.  While the majority of public sector pay scales are in line with the EU average, Ireland does not perform well in the context of overall working hours.  It is crucial that improvements are made in this regard to counteract reductions in staff numbers, although there are always exceptions.While commentators may find it easy to criticise the implementation of the Croke Park agreement by creating a perception that there is a lack of co-operation or success, these views are not helpful, especially when the enormous increase in demand on public services since 2008 is considered.  There is a greater demand on the Departments of Social Protection, Health, Environment, Community and Local Government and Education and Skills.  For example, the HSE processed more than 1 million medical card appliacations last year.The Department of Social Protection, despite the enormous number of applications and pay-outs each week, has managed to maintain services, while also developing new initiatives such as Pathways to Work.  The movement of 700 staff from FÁS to the Department is a method of balancing demands, while retaining numbers and skill sets.  That is what the agreement is about.One of the more obvious examples of the Croke Park agreement is within the education system which has undergone changes to classroom arrangements, teaching resources and working hours.  It is important to note the development in the number of hours that teachers give voluntarily to their vocation.  For example, many sports and extra curricular activities are organised by teachers outside their core hours and it is important to acknowledge how students and the community benefit from their input.While I welcome the progressive co-operation we have enjoyed with unions with regard to implementation of the Croke Park agreement, there are still peripheral issues that I consider to be relevant and wish to highlight.  I would not be alone in raising concerns about the level of aggressive lobbying experienced after the budget, most notably involving the use of children to lobby Members to protest against cuts to the numbers of teaching posts, such as those who attended many clinics throughout the country.  This took place without the support of the union hierarchy, as they informed me.  It is not the right of those who benefit from the terms of the agreement to engage in such practices in protesting against it.  There is a need to secure a commitment from union members that we are on the same page and ready to take the next step in order to instil public confidence.While there is no agreement in place for students, patients, old-age pensioners and any other section of society, the Croke Park agreement can be used to protect services in the interests of the public at large.  That is our priority in the Oireachtas.  It is in the interests of public sector employees, the implementation body for the agreement and the Government to ensure we are successful in delivering services which is the key to its success.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	351	Last week in reply to an oral question put by my colleague, Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, outlined his view of his job and priorities.  He said:I am fixated with two things, namely, restoring the economic sovereignty of the State, which is a job I have been given, and reforming the public service.  We will do both and are in the process of doing both.  In the first year we have achieved a remarkable amount.There is no doubt that the Government has achieved a remarkable amount in restoring our economic sovereignty and public sector reform.  However, we are told, on the one hand, that austerity and cutbacks in the public service are required to regain economic sovereignty, while, on the other, the Labour Party is at the same time supporting the transfer of economic sovereignty through a treaty that will remove the flexibility available to this and future Governments to respond to economic difficulties.  Already German parliamentarians are discussing proposals in respect of the economy before they are even discussed in this House.  We have a treaty that in legislation will continue austerity beyond the life of the Government.  A remarkable amount has been achieved by the Government, yet €21.3 billion has been handed over to banks since it came to power, while in the budget €2.2 billion worth of cuts were made to vital services.  The rates of unemployment, at 14%, and emigration have remained rigid and static.  In fact, more people are emigrating than gaining jobs in the State.  Therefore, Government actions have failed in restoring our economic sovereignty.In regard to the Minister's other fixation, public sector reform, we all agree that there is a need to reform the public service to ensure it is fit for purpose and the delivery of a First World service to citizens in an efficient and effective manner.  We need to put in place a system of accountability throughout the public sector, but particularly at senior management level.  Secretaries General, local authority managements and VEC chief executive officers are all responsible for spending billions of euro of taxpayer's money.  They are responsible for spending the wealth of the people and the buck stops with them.The actions of the Minister demonstrate a fixation not with public sector reform but an ideological attack on the public sector in terms of its size.  It appears the Labour Party has bought into Fine Gael's concept of small government, with which it is preoccupied.  While I do not agree with the Minister opposite, I congratulate him on the efficient manner in which his party has whipped the Labour Party into line on this issue.  Was the first act of the Labour Party to reduce the excessive pay and pensions of high earners in the most senior echelons of the Civil Service?  Did it seek to hold those at the highest levels of the public service to account for the economic crisis that many of them had helped to shape?  Did the Minister take as his starting point in seeking reform the experiences and expectations of citizens?  No, of course not.  He and his Cabinet colleagues have slashed essential budgets in the health and education sectors.  They have, however, failed to reel in the excessive payments made to senior public servants.  They brought forward a blunt instrument to deal with retirements.  This plan which could be described as an unplanned and unco-ordinated system has led to 9,000 job losses, this from a Government which has promised to create 100,000 new jobs.  It is clearly moving in the wrong direction.  There is no plan, rather this is about a head count.There are 6,700 staff in the Civil Service who earn more than €100,000 a year.  That is a phenomenal amount of money which is three times the average industrial wage.  This excessive payment is being guarded by Fine Gael and the Labour Party while they chip away at the salaries of new teachers on the lowest level and services throughout the State.  Under the Minister's watch, Secretaries General have retired on full pension - one at 53 years of age, with special severance payments of up to €140,000, in addition to lump sum and annual pension payments of more than €100,000.  Despite the Government spin, the retirement scheme will not deliver public sector reform or lead to a more efficient service, rather it guards those paid the most.  It will, however, lead to the loss of skills and experience within the public sector.  More than half the retirees have 30 years experience.  An accumulated 270,000 years of experience is being lost without a plan to safeguard public services.  In the first two months of the year 2,567 workers in the health service, 2,058 in the education sector, 310 in the Garda Síochána, 1,236 in local authorities and 931 in the Defence Forces have left.In the absence of a plan to meet the skills deficit the only option open to the Minister is clear - to allow the services already under strain to cover the holes.  In other words, the weight will come down on the shoulders of the workers remaining in the system.  They will carry extra responsibilities, while those who have retired will receive their money.  This is not scaremongering.  Already within the education sector 383 posts are being filled by teaching staff in receipt of pension payments.  I ask the Minister to monitor and report on the number of retirees who will return to work in the public service because this makes a mockery of the system proposed.  We have reduced numbers, resulting in a loss of experience and a reduced level of service, yet we are willing to pay people pensions and a wage to do the jobs they were doing.  It is clear the Government rushed into reducing the headcount in the public service without having a plan in place.  The Minister is now trying to make the best out of the mess created.There are savings to be made in the public sector and there is a need to realise them.  However, it appears the Government views public services as a burden on the public purse, as a column on the governmental spread sheet.  It needs to move away from this ideology that the public service is a burden.  It was elected to deliver services.  It was charged with economic management in order to deliver wealth and prosperity, an economy for the benefit of all citizens and high quality, efficient and effective public services.  That is why people voted for it.As the Minister said, the key issues facing his Department are the need to regain economic sovereignty and the delivery of public sector reform.  I look forward to his explanation of how the fiscal treaty or, as I called it earlier, the fiscal union, the school-closing treaty, the hospital-closing treaty, the emigration treaty and the unemployment treaty will enhance our sovereignty.  These are the outworkings of shrinking the economy beyond 2016 and into 2018.  How will this increase the size of the economy or restore economic sovereignty?With regard to public sector reform, we have a retirement programme designed to drive down the headcount and deliver a headline.  However, this does not mask the lack of a strategic plan to deliver better public services.  What we are facing is the immediate loss of a range of skills and our choice is between leaving posts vacant, thus reducing the quality of public services, and rehiring workers and paying them both a wage and a pension.  Impím ar an Aire féachaint arís ar an rud seo agus a dhícheall a dhéanamh athrú a dhéanamh.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I welcome the opportunity to make a statement on this matter.  Last week was the deadline for early retirement in the civil and public service.  The retirements have presented challenges and will continue to do so for some time.  That cannot be argued.  However, they are not the kind of apocalyptic challenges the irresponsible rhetoric of the Opposition and some sections of the media would have us believe.  More than 7,000 people applied to take early retirement, which represents less than 3% of the staff serving in the public service.  This is a significant number, but in listening to Opposition rhetoric in the lead-up to 29 February, one would have believed there was to be a mass exodus from the public sector.  This was not the case.I hope we will see a maturing of the debate throughout 2012 and a move away from the reckless hysteria that has defined it so far.  The entire debate needs to shift focus from the number of staff in the public sector to how we can reform the public sector in order that it can deliver services with increased efficiency and productivity and provide the kind of public service the people deserve.  The good news is that we have an agreement that can deliver these reforms.  At its core, the Croke Park agreement is a bargain.  The Government has agreed to protect pay, including increments, and jobs in the public sector from 2010 to 2014 in return for improved efficiencies and productivity.  The latter part always seems to be ignored by the media.  The title of this debate tends to focus attention on the first part of the bargain, that is, pay and numbers in the public sector, and shifts attention away from the other side, namely, the delivery of improvements in productivity.People need to ask the question: what is the Croke Park agreement stopping us from doing?  The answer is nothing.  We now have an opportunity to radically reform the public sector with the co-operation of the trade unions.  The agreement offers the best opportunity to improve how our civil and public services are run, make them more efficient and productive and ensure the best possible services are provided for the public, yet there are dissenting voices, not just in the media but also even in this House, including some Fine Gael Members, our partners in government.  What do the dissenters want?  Do they want further cuts in public service pay?  Do they want further cuts in public sector numbers?  What would that achieve?  Strikes, industrial action and a downward spiral of confidence and morale would most definitely result.  That is not what Ireland needs at this critical time for the economy.Full implementation of the Croke Park agreement is a no-brainer.  All stakeholders must work towards this and the naysayers must stop what they are doing.  The Minister needs to lead the way, as he is doing.  Secretaries General must examine their entire Departments to identify waste in all its forms and eliminate it.  Well paid senior managers in the public service must step up to the plate and line managers must do the same.  Public service managers must do what private sector managers have been doing for years in order that their companies stay competitive, that is, deliver improvements and manage change and to be held absolutely accountable for doing so.Public sector workers do important and, at times, unappreciated jobs.  They look after the sick, fight crime, teach our children, clean the streets and provide many more services that are often taken for granted.  The public versus private sector debate promoted in certain sections of the media needs to stop now.  It is our public service and we must appreciate it, but we must also challenge it and at all times seek to improve it.  We have an absolute responsibility to make it more cost-effective.  This must continue on an ongoing basis, not just for the period of any one agreement.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I wish to share time with Deputy Clare Daly.I heard the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, say earlier that some of us on this side of the House, including those in the United Left Alliance and some other Independents, in criticising the plans to sell State assets and continue the cuts to the public service, were genuine but misguided.  Let me turn that back on him, the Minister of State, Deputy Shane McEntee, and the Government generally.  They are probably genuine, but they are utterly misguided in their view that there is no alternative to austerity, carving up the public sector, privatising our assets and massacring jobs in the public sector.  Just as the Minister rejects our view, we reject his view that there is no alternative to austerity.  We reject his view, articulated again today, that there is no possibility of taxing the wealth of the super rich in society as an alternative to attacking the livelihoods and jobs of low and middle income workers.  We reject his view that there is no alternative to paying the debts of private banks and bondholders and that slashing public service jobs and privatising State assets will somehow, perversely, create jobs and improve public services.  Call us simplistic, but we think the very opposite.  If the Government cuts the number of public service jobs, it will end up with fewer jobs.  If there are fewer staff working in the public service, there will be fewer and poorer public services.  Privatisation and outsourcing will mean more job losses, higher costs for citizens and less efficiency in delivering services.Cutting the number of public service jobs not only affects public service workers and users but also leads to job losses in the private sector.  I am being simplistic, but I defy the Government or anyone else to challenge this logic.  Dún Laoghaire, in my constituency, is a town that is massively struggling, like many others, with small and medium-sized businesses going out of business one after the other, such that it is beginning to look like a ghost town.  Probably the biggest employer left in the town centre is St. Michael's Hospital.  What would happen if the hospital which employs 400 or 500 people was to be closed?  Would that be good or bad for the small and medium-sized businesses in the town?  It is self-evident that it would be bad and more of them would go out of business.  It is precisely those health workers who keep many of the shops and businesses in the town going.  Setting the public sector against the private sector and implying that privatising and slashing jobs in the public sector will improve competitiveness and create the conditions for more jobs is fantasy in the extreme, and all the evidence shows that to be the case.  Equally, the evidence of what that does to our services is manifest everywhere.  For the Government to suggest there is no connection between the fact that  7,000 health workers have been lost from the health service and the planned removal of ambulance services in west Cork, the closure of the 24-hour accident and emergency department in Roscommon and the planned closure of the 24-hour accident and emergency department in Loughlinstown is bizarre.  Furthermore, to suggest the taking of thousands of workers out of the education system will improve our education system and enable those in the sector to provide a better quality education to our children is fantasy in the extreme.If we continue to cut the public service, particularly when the private sector is on strike and the banks refuse to lend money into the economy, we will continue in a downward spiral.  We need to move in precisely the opposite direction.  We need public sector reform but the reform is needed at the top.  The Government should slash the salaries of the people at the top, and the people at the top who have failed so miserably should be removed, but it should stop attacking the people who deliver the services, who are on low and middle incomes, and whose jobs are vital to keeping this economy going.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I am still reeling from Deputy Ryan's contribution when he attempted to dress up what is an attack on the public sector as being something in its favour.  We have heard many contributions throughout this debate on the negative impact that job losses will have on the delivery of services.  Contrary to what Deputy Ryan said, it is not reckless hysteria to say that, rather it is a matter of fact and a matter of record.  To take the area of health alone, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation said that last year was the worst year for patients being on trolleys since that organisation was set up.  More than 86,000 patients were on trolleys last year, representing an increase of 14% on the previous period.  How can removing more staff out of that system possibly alleviate that situation?  It cannot.  To overcome the short-term gap, more agency staff will have to be employed, which will be hugely expensive, the hours of the existing staff will have to be increased and they will be forced to postpone leave and so on.The Tánaiste told Members this morning that people need have no fear, that the closure of Garda stations will not have an impact and that it will result in more community gardaí being out on the street improving everybody's safety.  That is complete and utter rot.  The reality is that public services are being slashed.  The same gardaí the Tánaiste would have us believe will be on the beat are being instructed to conserve petrol, not to go out in their cars and to cut back on their mileage because An Garda Síochána owes millions to Topaz in unpaid petrol bills.  This is developing into a banana republic when it is not possible even to have petrol for Garda cars and the Tánaiste thinks that is okay.  All of us know the appalling nightmare it is for citizens waiting to avail of social welfare allowances who cannot access them because there is no staff to process the claims.  It is rich of my constituency colleague, Deputy Ryan, to talk about services being protected by productivity when he knows that in his own area of Fingal County Council, services are nearly grinding to a halt as a result of the exit of staff from those areas.I want to deal briefly with the issue of how we got here.  The jobs that are being axed are not just any jobs but relatively decent, secure, permanent and pensionable jobs, and they provide valuable roles not only for the individuals in those jobs but also for society.  Normally, if jobs were being axed, the unions would be beating down the door demanding justice, but they are not doing that because they are part of the problem.  They, too, perpetuated a myth under the false claim that they would protect jobs and workers' conditions which they have not done because the staff remaining in the public service are the ones who are bearing the cost of all of this.  Ten of thousands of decent jobs have been lost in our economy.  That is not the fault of people who took redundancy.  The Government orchestrated a scheme where people had no choice but to leave.  I have met many people who did not want to leave but it would have been economic madness for them to remain as they would not have been able to avail of their entitlements if they did not exit now.  It was a gun-to-the-head situation where they would have been at a financial loss and would have been working essentially for nothing if they had continued on in their jobs.  The Government orchestrated that situation with the connivance of the unions and the result is that the remaining workers, all the people who benefit from public services and the economy, are bearing the price of that.  We are losing valuable quality jobs against the backdrop of the tragedy of people queuing on the streets of Cork and Dublin to leave this country to get employment elsewhere.  It is a myth to say that people in the public service were sitting around doing nothing and that there are many jobs that could be saved by working harder and working smarter.  That is not the case.  What we have is a con to put up a headline figure to pacify the troika and finance the bailouts.  The reality of what the Government is guilty of is not protecting the public service, as Deputy Ryan tried to say, but butchering it and economic short termism which will have a devastating effect on all our citizens and ultimately on the economy.
#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I am grateful for this opportunity to talk about the public service and its staffing levels.  We are all very proud of the public service and I particularly appreciate the work carried out by it in our schools, hospitals, in the justice system and even in this building where all rely on the high calibre of the staff, their skills and the services they provide to us.The real picture is that 300,000 people are employed in our public sector, 3% of whom are leaving under this early retirement scheme and 97% of whom will remain in situ.  Now that D-Day has arrived and the hysteria from the Opposition benches about the mass exodus from the services has died down, all that is happening is that those public servants who were already planning to retire this year are most likely to leave a little sooner than they had planned.  The normal number of retirements this year, therefore, has been speeded up and will take place in a shorter timeframe than usual.Nobody on this side of the House has said this process was easy.  Thanks to the previous Government, nothing in this economy is easy at the moment.  However, this Government is ensuring there are safeguards to front-line services.  The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, has committed to taking on the extra 3,000 public servants to fill the gaps in the strained resources.  There is also a commitment by public servants and their managers to work together within the Croke Park agreement to change the way in which the public service does its business to ensure both its cost and the number of people working in it can fall significantly while continuing to meet the demand for services and improve the experience of service users.I would say to Deputy Barrett that fewer people does not equal poor services.  That is a poor reflection of his opinion of the people currently serving in our public service.

#ReginaDoherty	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-party	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-dob	unknown-#ReginaDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	358	At Department level, a series of high level units have been set up in various Departments to determine how the public services could accommodate the retirements with the least disruption to public services.  Those units are working with the Departments, Ministers and local managers to ensure the smooth transition to the new staffing arrangements.  Within the health sector in particular there has been detailed planning at national, regional and site specific levels to manage proactively the impact for front-line services of staff retirements under the grace period.  In the development of national service plans, all factors, including budgets, staffing levels and the impact of retirements, have been factored in, and that applies to regional service plans as well.The principal focus is on protecting and maintaining critical services such as emergency departments, maternity care, critical care and neonatal services.  The Health Service Executive is seeking to mitigate the impact of these retirements through the implementation of national clinical programmes, targeted investment and recruitment as set out in the national service plan, and utilising the provisions of the public service agreement to bring about greater flexibilities, together with co-operation from the unions.  Some of the initiatives that have been taken include the reform of the supply chain management and the inventory, greater sharing of IT facilities, which we should have done years ago, and revision where there is an overlap in services.  Overtime payments are down by in excess of 5% since 2008.  Revised working arrangements in hospital laboratory services are set to deliver savings of €5 million per annum.  The number of principal officers has fallen by more than 7%.  Senior management, namely, assistant secretaries, has fallen by 4.6% in the same period.  Flexible redeployment is critical to the agreement's capacity to support the large reduction in staff which the recovery of the economy requires.  Without redeployment, gaps that will appear owing to retirements and departures will have to be filled by recruiting replacement staff.  I thank public sector workers for their participation in the process and its success to date.  There is an additional safeguard.  The Public Appointments Service has put in place a system of resource panels to support redeployment and an online tool is being developed to support the programme.It is clear that, despite fiscal constraints, many public servants have been succeeding in delivering service enhancements that will make a tangible difference to the public and Irish businesses.  To meet these expectations as numbers fall, the use of resources must improve through revised work practices, significant reform and reorganisation, providing for more shared services, organisational restructuring and greater innovation, and recognizing the much greater availability of online services.  To achieve savings without recourse to further pay cuts, staff and their representatives must urgently deliver savings and efficiencies.  We have already seen great improvements such as the centralisation of the medical card processing unit which I was lucky enough to visit last week.

This is another example of how successful the Croke Park agreement has been in some sectors of public life.  The public rely on the delivery of quality public services.  I am proud of our public services for what they are doing to rebuild the State after it was almost destroyed by the previous Government.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.The policies being pursued by the Government are working and the evidence is there for all to see.  The public service pay bill has stabilised and we have now returned to 2006 pay levels.  The number working in the public service continues to fall and we are now close to 2005 staffing levels.  The Croke Park agreement has provided for the co-operation and flexibility required that have enabled the Government to achieve the necessary reductions in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in a climate of industrial peace.Front-line services are being protected.  Strategic workforce planning groups have been established in all sectors and are developing plans to deal with the operational and strategic consequences arising from the turnover of staff expected in 2012 and future years.  When account is taken of the effect of the pension related deduction in public service pay, the total net public service pay bill will be reduced by around €3.5 billion, or 20%, in the seven years between 2008 and 2015.The bottom line is that we cannot sustain the current system of public service delivery.  It must be changed.  The coming years will not be easy and a massive effort is required.  Future economic growth will only be generated from a solid and sustainable fiscal position.  Taking the easy option is no longer an option.The mission statement of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is "to achieve the Government's social and economic goals by ensuring the effective management of taxpayers' money, and the delivery of quality public services that meet the needs of citizens".  In less than 30 words, it provides the road map we must follow if Ireland is to return to having a sustainable financial model.  Under the EU-IMF programme, Ireland is committed to reducing the overall size of the public service.  This is also a key element of the programme for Government and it is not being done merely because it is a fiscal imperative.  It is also being done to ensure we can continue to enjoy a vibrant, modern, forward looking civil society, with a public service that supports such a society.In order to protect front-line services, the Government is committed to making fundamental changes to the way the public service operates.  This will inevitably mean changes in the way in which services to the public are delivered.  Our overriding objective is to have a more customer focused, leaner, more efficient, better integrated public service which delivers maximum value for money.  I am confident that the public service and public servants are up to meeting these challenges.  What was lacking was leadership.  The Government will provide that missing element.  It will provide the people with an affordable public service that is fit for purpose, that rewards efficiency and decreases waste, and enables its workers to serve their fellow citizens with pride, while earning a decent standard of living.In response to Deputy Ó Caoláin, on the question of retirements, whether grace periods are incentivised is not purely semantic.  Staff have chosen to retire at the end of their careers and there can be no suggestion that their employer will not allow them to retire.  Their managers will need to address how the work they have been doing will be discharged.Deputy Sean Fleming has agreed that certain historical allowances need to be reviewed.  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will be reviewing them critically.We would not be having this debate if we had the money.  We have to tell people the truth.  Opposition Deputies are talking about the provision of services, but what happens if we do not have the money to pay for them?  We spoke about the killings in County Kildare yesterday and the accident in Dundalk which was attended by gardaí, firemen and ambulance drivers, all of whom need to be kept on the front line.  I cannot understand how Opposition Deputies are saying "No" to everything.  They are all against the €100 household charge, but that is what the money that will be raised will be used for.  If somebody puts his or her card in an ATM and there is no money in it, he or she can shout and roar and kick it, but no money will come out of it.  We have a treaty to pass and need to have a system in place by which we can obtain money at a reasonable rate from the European Union.  Whether we like it, we have signed up to the treaty.  Those who are saying "No" to everything are being disingenuous and not telling the people who put them where they are the truth.  I cannot understand how they have complained about the provision of services for the entire afternoon and yet do not want to pay for them.  The money is just not available.

#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the dire situation in Syria.  What is happening in that country shows the lack of respect for human life by President Assad.  He calls himself president, yet the country has been run by himself and his father for 41 consecutive years.  Assad was elected unopposed in 2000 and 2007.  Unfortunately, now we see why no opponents put themselves forward for these elections by the way of the current regime.  There is a cruel irony in this, as President Assad is a trained medical doctor who worked in hospitals in Damascus for many years prior to getting involved in so-called politics, and, in reality, as we all will be aware, replaced his father as a dictator of Syria.When I learned of his background in medicine and of his years in working in hospitals, it aroused suspicion within me as to how much control the army has over the killings that are taking place in Syria and the level of collusion that was shown in "Prime Time" on Monday night between the medics and the army.  This evidence leads me to believe that international sanctions currently being imposed on Syria will not bother President Assad and the army which is propping up this regime at his behest.  He was put in power with the approval of the army and it shows what kind of regime it is.In Kosovo in the 1990s and in Rwanda also, the international community was slow to react and, subsequently, we found out that thousands of people, and in the Rwanda case hundreds of thousands, had been massacred.  I would like to see further intervention, possibly from the UN and NATO.  I want Ireland to put pressure on the international dimensions that exist for us to do so.  It is not enough to stand idly by, and especially when one sees organisations such as the Red Cross being prevented from entering borders at present.  We need to raise the profile of what is going on but we also need action.  I am appalled by what I perceive to be Russia's and China's lack of interest in human life.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	371	Recently, Deputies Spring, Ann Phelan and I were in Vienna as part of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe's parliamentary assembly.  At that meeting, we discussed the issue in Syria.  Unfortunately, it does not pertain directly to the work of the OSCE but we felt what was happening there was so grave that it was our duty as parliamentarians from across the OSCE regions to raise this matter.  At the conclusion of the meeting, Parliamentary Assembly President Efthymiou, from Greece, read out the following statement the assembly:As President of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, I deeply regret the violence and loss of life in Syria.  As OSCE participating states and partners for co-operation have expressed their concern about the current situation, I call for a full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the country.  I salute the journalists who have paid such a heavy price to keep the world informed.At the end of that statement, the parliamentarians there supported him in it.  As the head of the delegation that went to the OSCEPA, I repeat that statement here to voice my support for it.  When we speak of intervention in this context, we are talking very much about humanitarian intervention.  What we have seen in Syria is medical care being used as a tool for repression, and it is disgusting.I would very much like to know what our policy is as a country.  We were very quick to support NATO military intervention in Libya when it occurred, yet we are not so quick in this case.  Why the discrepancy between the two?
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	372	The matter is close to everybody's heart.  By right, we should be discussing this for a couple of hours rather than a couple of minutes.  We stated it would never happen again after the Second World War and it has happened several times since.  In this case, I hate to think that we must wait another four years for the truth when people are being butchered by their own government.Horrific suffering and a campaign of ruthless repression is being visited upon the civilian population in Syria.  The Government, in concert with its EU partners, has strived to exert strong and united political pressure on the Syrian regime to end its campaign of repression and make decisive progress towards fulfilling the aspirations of the Syrian people for a democratic transition.  The grim facts of this conflict are truly horrifying.  Credible reports of more than 7,500 people killed since March last, an estimated 200,000 internally displaced persons, and 35,000 who have fled to other countries as refugees.  According to the latest report of the commission of inquiry established by the UN Human Rights Council to investigate events in Syria, state forces stand accused of committing widespread and gross human rights violations which amount to crimes against humanity.  They have done this, apparently, with the knowledge and consent of President Assad and his regime.There is no doubting the widespread international revulsion.  This is evident from the overwhelming support for various resolutions adopted by the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council in recent weeks.  It was also evident at the initial meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People group, which the Tánaiste attended in Tunis on 24 February and where more than 70 countries gathered to voice their support for the Syrian people and for international efforts to end the conflict and promote peaceful democratic transition within Syria.  There is an obligation on the international community to do all it can to end the violence and suffering of the Syrian people and to help them to chart a new way forward.The immediate priority must be to secure a ceasefire which will end the indiscriminate shelling of cities such as Horns and Rastan and at the same time provide the UN, ICRC and others with humanitarian access.  The visit yesterday of the UN emergency relief co-ordinator, Baroness Amos, to the Baba Amr district of Homs revealed the true extent of the human catastrophe.  She reported that the area had been completely devastated and most inhabitants had fled to other parts of the city or nearby villages.  It is vital that full humanitarian access to the whole country is achieved urgently.It is regrettable that the UN Security Council has so far failed to agree a resolution on the situation.  The Government regards it as a welcome development that discussions have now got under way at the UN on a new draft resolution primarily addressing the humanitarian situation.  It is incumbent upon the Security Council to live up to its responsibilities in the area of the maintenance of international peace and security and to adopt a resolution at the earliest opportunity on the situation in Syria.  No other action could better convey to the Syrian regime the strength of the international condemnation of what is happening in that country.

In saying all of this, we must be also realistic about what the international community can accomplish in regard to Syria.  There is little or no appetite anywhere for any form of external intervention.  This also extends to any idea of arming those now opposed to the Syrian regime.  We must never fail to remember that Syria is a country through which many fault lines run, whether political, ethnic or religious.  The worst-case scenario would be if Syria were to slip into an open civil war which would be profoundly destabilising for the entire region.

There are new lows happening every day in the Homs area of Syria, where it is now being reported that local hospitals are unable or unwilling to provide blood transfusions to patients in dire need because the medical blood banks in Syria come under the aegis of its Department of Justice.  I ask the Tánaiste to bring his weight to bear in order that this situation be rectified.  I do not believe I have heard anything as low as this in my time.  Anecdotally, we hear that some members of staff seem to be taking part in this, which is abominable.

There is incredible hypocrisy on the part of the international community.  While I am not calling for military intervention, there are other things we can do.  We are reading reports from Médecins Sans Frontières about problems in terms of resources and supplies, including getting medical supplies into the necessary areas.  Deputy Ann Phelan touched on this point.  What kind of financial resources are we willing to put behind some sort of medical assistance?  Are we examining ways of getting medical assistance into the country to help those areas that do not have the necessary supplies, including supplies of blood, and expertise, given people have had to flee?

The League of Arab States is playing a particularly important role at present in the peace plan outlined last November, and agreed at that stage by the Syrian authorities, which still provides the only credible plan for bringing the violence to an end and initiating a peaceful transition in Syria.  The Arab League has made other important contributions to current efforts to resolve the crisis in Syria, including the monitoring mission deployed in late December and subsequently withdrawn due to the non-co-operation of the Syrian regime.Arab League Ministers called for an international peacekeeping force to be deployed and the idea of a joint UN-Arab peacekeeping mission was positively considered at the recent meeting of the Friends of the Syrian People held in Tunis on 24 February, which the Tánaiste attended.  However, a ceasefire would first need to be in place before any possible peacekeeping mission could be deployed.  In addition, some form of authorisation or mandate for such a mission from the UN Security Council would be highly desirable.  It is by no means clear that any such agreement would be forthcoming from the Security Council at present, given current Russian and Chinese attitudes.  For the moment, international efforts to broker a ceasefire are concentrating on the mediation by the joint UN-Arab League special envoy, former UN Secretary General, Mr. Kofi Annan, whose mission Ireland and the EU fully support.  It is hoped Mr. Annan will be in a position to travel to Damascus for discussions in the coming days.In conclusion, I can only reiterate the Tánaiste's words of yesterday that there are no easy solutions to what is a very complex political situation now obtaining in Syria, nor should we view any form of external military intervention or, alternatively, arming the badly divided Syrian opposition, as offering any form of panacea.  Such forms of action or intervention are, unfortunately, only likely to accelerate the descent into open civil war in Syria, a civil war, moreover, which would provide profound destabilisation for the entire region, not least neighbouring countries such as Iraq and Lebanon.

In deference to this auspicious day, I call on the Government to legislate for a corporate board quota similar to that of Norway.  This would compliment the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill, which proposes an increase in women's representation on the ballot paper for the Dáil.Irish female representation on corporate boards is dismal.  In March 2011 women made up only 6% of directors in our biggest company boardrooms.  Almost all of our 35 largest Stock Exchange-listed firms have no women board members at all.  These are the heavy hitters, with market capitalisation of €5 billion.  In terms of female decision making in the Civil Service, the statistics are also depressing.  There is nearly twice the number of females as males working in the Civil Service yet, at the highest ranks, they are far outnumbered by men.  At the highest level of Secretary General, women account for only 17.6%, while at the clerical officer level, women occupy 77.3% of posts.The most widely known example of quotas for corporate boards is in Norway, where a 40% gender quota exists.  These boards are in public, limited, state-owned and inter-municipality companies.  The quota policy was introduced in Norway in December 2003 but gave companies a grace period until 2008 to reach the target.  Female representation increased gradually before it dramatically jumped from 15.9% in 2004 to 37% in 2007 and finally reached the 40% target in 2008.  Legislated board quotas have since been introduced in Spain in 2007 and in France and the Netherlands in 2010.  Quotas for public limited companies are also being discussed in Belgium, Canada and Italy, where laws are pending at different stages of the ratification process.Ireland's big investors seem to be averse to the implementation of a gender quota system.  Companies in Norway were also quite against the idea in the first instance.  It was argued that companies would be forced to appoint less qualified people as board members just because of their gender.  However, studies have since revealed that 36% of female board members in Norway have a university education lasting six years or more, compared to just 22% of their male counterparts.  I ask that a corporate quota to increase women's representation be put in place.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	379	Given it is international women's day, I must say they are all looking very well today in the Dáil.  I welcome the opportunity afforded by this debate to underline the Government's strong commitment to improving corporate governance, particularly in light of the serious shortcomings of corporate governance revealed in the recent past in both the private and the State sector.  The quality of board governance is key to the successful and prudent management of enterprises.  Since the Government took office, we have made changes to the system of appointment to State boards to ensure greater transparency and balance.  Departments now invite expressions of interest in vacancies on the boards of bodies under their aegis on their websites.When requested, the Public Appointments Service provides a selection and support service to Departments and offices where State board vacancies have been advertised on their websites.  In short-listing applicants, the Public Appointments Service gives due regard to the recent experience of applicants to ensure an appropriate mix of skills and gender.The programme for Government also contains a commitment that: "Public funding for political parties will be tied to the level of participation by women as candidates those parties achieve".  The Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 includes provision for a requirement that to qualify for full State funding under Part 3 of the Electoral Act 1997, a qualified political party will have to have at least 30% female candidates and at least 30% male candidates at the next general election - I do not know where that leaves the rest.  Seven years from the general election where this provision first applies, this will rise to 40% commencing at the general election held next after that.  When the Bill is passed, the intended outcome will be effectively to double that figure to 30% within one general election cycle, which is very ambitious.In March 2011 the Government announced in the programme for Government that it will take steps to ensure that all State boards have at least 40% of each gender.  While that has been a long-standing goal in public policy, it is a challenge to achieve it.  The figures for the end of 2010 show that the participation rate for women on State boards is 34.67%, which is slightly above the 2009 rate, but still short of the 40% target.  The position of women chairpersons is more encouraging however, up from 46 to 52 in 2010, or from 18% to 20%.Quotas or incentives may have a role to play but there are wider societal factors that impede the participation of women in public and corporate life.  In the general context, the issue of gender balance and corporate governance was the subject of a public consultation last year by Internal Market and Services Commissioner, Michel Barnier.  The Commission summary of the outcome noted that the majority of respondents rejected the idea of listed companies being required to ensure better gender balance on boards.  The respondents that were in favour proposed different means for achieving a better gender balance, starting with a voluntary approach for a transitional period, followed by compulsory measures if need be.The Government will keep the situation under review and consider what further action may be needed to achieve the desired target.  It is noteworthy that the Electoral (Amendment) (Political Funding) Bill 2011 does not compel or oblige parties by law per se to provide a quota of candidates of a particular gender but operates by way of encouragement and incentive.

However, I also wish to highlight the gender pay gap.  The unadjusted gender pay gap in October 2009 was 12.8%, an increase from 12.4% in October 2008.  I acknowledge that women have made strides in many respects, however, as a Government we must respond to gender barriers and tackle issues that hinder women's ability to fulfil their full potential.  For example, today Safe Ireland launched its national one day census of domestic violence services 2011.  It reported that on the 4 November 2011, a total of 770 women and children received support from a domestic violence service.  Furthermore, the gender inequality in the time use 2008 report indicated that on an average day women spend two hours 29 minutes at caring work and two hours 36 minutes at house work.  By comparison, on an average day men spend 39 minutes caring and one hour and 15 minutes, which I question, at house work.  There is a large discrepancy between the two.I wish to draw attention to a statement made at the recent Davos summit by Facebook's Sheryl Sandberg.  She called for girls to be more ambitious at work and men to be more ambitious at home.  We must create an Ireland where this is possible.

One is ashamed, especially when one sees the manner in which women are treated in other countries.  Everyone must strive to achieve equality.  We are all the same and we are all entitled to the same wages and to be in the same positions.  With people such as Deputy Mitchell O'Connor fighting for that aim it is not too far away in this country.  One cannot force anything on people but one must create the situation in which it can happen.  I thank the Deputy for raising the subject.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	384	The cuts to the school in question in this matter arise from budget 2012.  At the time I said the budget, in particular the education budget, lacked balance and in many cases was affecting the most vulnerable.  The school in question was informed that it would lose eight teachers, who were informed of the loss of their jobs during the week.  The school is typical of many schools throughout the country.  One of the big concerns we all have as elected representatives is that the effect of the budget is only beginning to affect many schools.  The loss of eight teachers constitutes a reduction of one third in the staffing complement of the school.Taking the family background of the school pupils into account one could probably argue that if the DEIS programme was open to other schools that it would be included in DEIS.  Unfortunately, the current system prevents schools from becoming involved in DEIS.  If the school was in DEIS it would not lose some of the legacy posts.  Part of the difficulty is that four of the posts date from the pre-DEIS scheme, giving children an even break.  The legacy posts in DEIS schools are being retained.  However, in a school such as the one in question, which probably fits the criteria of DEIS, they are not being retained.  DEIS was never intended to create barriers to other schools; it was supposed to dismantle barriers but unfortunately the children in this school will be affected.The area is one of high unemployment and there is a refugee centre close to the school.  The number of children coming and going from the school can vary at different times of the year.  That in itself can have implications.  The school is losing one post because of a projected drop in school numbers.  The proximity of the refugee centre may have a major impact on the situation.I do not know whether the Minister can answer the questions posed.  This is just one school.  I do not know how many schools will be affected in a similar way.  Schools in my area, which is the same area as the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, who is present, may lose five teachers.  It is not sustainable for any school to lose that number of teachers.  As I stated, we are being drip fed information on this matter.  Some of the posts will be withdrawn from 31 August next, which means the school is facing into a bleak future.  I am concerned about the impact of these cuts on children in this school.  Neither they nor their parents are responsible for the creation of the crisis in our country.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	385	Last Saturday, I learned from parents and teachers in Carrick-on-Suir that eight of the 25 teaching posts at the Presentation primary school there are being withdrawn by the Minister.  The school received notification of this on 29 February last.  The loss of this number of teaching posts is unacceptable.  This, effectively, is an assault on students and teachers at the school and on the community in Carrick-on-Suir.  Four of the posts concerned are pre-DEIS posts allocated under the giving children an even break scheme, two are learning support posts, one is a language support post, which allocation was, as stated by Deputy Crowe, granted because there are many children in the school whose first language is not English.  The final post is being drawn based on enrolment regulations.  While enrolment at the school was down by seven on 1 September last it may have increased by 1 September next.  However, the post will have been withdrawn.The withdrawal of these eight teaching posts is a bolt out of blue for the school and is devastating news for the local community.  These posts were allocated to the school in 2006 on the basis of social issues, including that Carrick-on-Suir is a RAPID town.  One might wonder what has happened since to support the withdrawal of these eight teaching posts.  However, nothing has happened except that the situation in Carrick-on-Suir has worsened.  For example, on the date the Department sent notification to the school of the withdrawal of these teaching posts there were more than 2,000 unemployed people in Carrick-on-Suir.  When the four posts allocated to the school under the Giving Children an Even Break scheme was made there were 958 unemployed in that town.  Unemployment in Carrick-on-Suir has more than doubled in the intervening time.As I stated, this is unacceptable.  I call on the Minister to immediately reverse the decision to withdraw these teaching posts.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I welcome the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House.  The Government must have anticipated the Labour Party would be holding its party this evening given he has been left to respond to the two remaining topical issue debates.  Members of Fine Gael expected to be celebrating this morning.  However, thanks to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, that party did not get under way nor should it have.I support my colleagues on this issue.  I am aware that Senator Landy, who is a good colleague of the Minister, will also be making representations on this matter to the Minister for Education and Skills.  The withdrawal of eight teaching posts, or one-third of the teaching population, from this school is unsustainable.  It is akin to the 66% cut in training and material funding for CE schemes.  This is what we are getting from a Minister and party which sent out letters prior to the election, through SIPTU and others, urging CE participants and so on to vote for the Labour Party.These cuts are unsustainable.  The school might have survived the withdrawal of one or two posts but not eight.  Carrick-on-Suir has been on its knees for decades. I do not wish to talk down the town wherein I know there are many good and enterprising people.  It is a RAPID town which, as Deputy Healy stated, is experiencing massive unemployment, with more than 2,000 people unemployed which figure is as high or, perhaps, higher than in Clonmel which is several times the size of Carrick-on-Suir.  While the people of Carrick-on-Suir are resourceful the school cannot sustain this type of attack.While the school is not a DEIS school it was granted four extra posts under the giving the children an even break scheme.  This cut is unacceptable to the school, board of management, parents council and Presentation Sisters.  We will not accept it.I was previously a board member of Carrick-on-Suir VEC.  As stated, the town is currently experiencing massive unemployment, leaving families in great disadvantage.  While the primary school failed in its application for DEIS status, the VEC school under the principalship of Mr. Pat Callanan, has been granted DEIS status.  I pay tribute to Mr. Callanan who recently retired.  Approximately 80% of boys from the primary school feed into that college.  It makes no sense that the primary school has been refused DEIS status.I know that the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, played a huge role in having cuts to DEIS schools in his area reversed.  The Minister was quite vocal on this issue.  I call on the Minister for Education and Skills to listen to the pleas of the people on Carrick-on-Suir, Deputies in this House and Senator Denis Landy.  We cannot accept a one third cut in teaching posts at this school, which is, by any benchmark, totally unfair.  The school cannot do without a working principal who is, owing to disciplinary issues, a huge resource to the school.  His assistance in the classroom is vital.  If his post is withdrawn the remaining teachers will be left in an awful situation, which is not good enough.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, who regrets he is unable to be here, to this matter regarding the allocation process for primary schools, including the reforms to the teacher allocation process that are being made and will take effect from September 2012.While the Government has tried to protect front line services, difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across all Departments, in line with the requirements of the EU-IMF programme of support for Ireland.  Achieving savings in education is particularly difficult given the significant increases in the overall number of pupils in our schools.  Notwithstanding this the Government has protected the 28:1 pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.The staffing arrangements for the 2012-13 school year are set out in primary circular 0007/2012 which is available on the Department of Education and Skills website.  This includes the detail of the reform of the allocation process, which is designed to bring a more equitable distribution of existing posts between schools.  The new arrangements incorporate a long overdue updating of the GAM, learning support, allocation for all schools.  This inevitably involves changes to existing clustering arrangements whereby a teacher is shared between schools.  A further change is that schools in any locality are being empowered to cluster and arrange their GAM resources in a manner that best suits their local needs.  This should be completed by schools by 16 March.There are also new and separate arrangements for how resource hours for individual pupils are converted into teaching posts in schools.  The requirement for resource hours in a school varies from year to year, depending on the number, if any, of its pupils with autism etc.  Small schools generally have a lower requirement for resource hours.  The new arrangements take account of the later timescale for the allocation of these hours necessitated by individual assessment by the NCSE.  All of the changes are designed to enable a more efficient operation of the teacher allocation and redeployment process in the new climate of a fixed ceiling of teacher numbers.Deputies will be aware that Budget 2012 provided for the phased withdrawal of approximately 428 posts allocated to some schools under disadvantage programmes prior to the introduction of the DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, initiative in 2005.  As already announced, the withdrawal of 192 posts from primary schools outside DEIS band 1 and 2 and from DEIS second level schools will proceed, including the 38 posts from 15 non-DEIS schools, which includes the school referred to by the Deputies and in respect of which representations have been made to the Minister by Senator Denis Landy.The staffing schedule also includes an appeals mechanism for schools to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent appeals board.  Details of the criteria for appeals are contained in the aforementioned primary circular.  The existing staffing appeals criteria have been extended to enable limited phasing arrangements for schools where the combination of budget and reform measures has a particularly adverse impact on a school's overall allocation.  Schools such as the one referred to by my colleagues in the House which are due to lose three or more posts as a result of a combination of the budget and reform measures will be able to apply to the staffing appeals board with a view to seeking to have a portion of the loss in posts deferred to the 2013-14 school year.  The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the appeals board is 23 March.  The appeals board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.  The precise date in April for the appeals board meeting has not yet been set, but it is envisaged it will be held before redeployment panels are published.  This, therefore, will avoid surplus permanent teachers being unnecessarily placed on the published redeployment panels in respect of those schools which are successful in the appeals process.  However, it is important to note that all schools which have surplus permanent teachers for redeployment are required to return the completed redeployment forms to the Department on or before Friday, 16 March.The Department will be working with schools and the relevant education partners to ensure these new arrangements operate as efficiently as possible.  The final staffing position for all schools, including the school in question, ultimately will not be known until later in 2012.  At that stage, the allocation process will be fully completed and any appeals to the appeals board will have been considered.

It is a pity it does not include the number of schools which are losing three or more teachers in this manner, as that would be useful information to have in this debate.  Nevertheless, the school and many like it nationwide are being doubly disadvantaged because they are not allowed to participate in the DEIS programme which has been closed.  Consequently, they will lose their legacy posts.  While the Minister has made reference to the appeals process, that really is putting off the inevitable and many such schools will be hit very hard.  I appeal for a review of this issue.  The Minister has stated he will examine the schools mentined and will open up a debate on the issue.  However, a review is needed which I hope would solve some of the problems for the school in question.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	389	I had hoped the Minister would accept this was an extraordinary and exceptional situation because I had certainly not encountered a case involving the withdrawal of eight teachers, or one third of the teaching staff of a school.  Moreover, I remind the Minister that last year this school lost three special needs assistants, SNAs, and will lose a further SNA this year.  I ask him to consider putting in place a process by which the school might be able to enter the DEIS programme for which it is undoubtedly a candidate because of the various matters I have raised.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I thank the Minister for the reply on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, who I accept is not present for bona fide reasons.  This is a typical situation in which the mandarins in the Department have designed different schemes, including the DEIS scheme, with different rules, guidelines and processes.  However, this is a human problem that must be dealt with humanely because, by any yardstick, one cannot possibly accept the loss of one third of the teaching posts in a school.  This is a clear example of how the best of man-made schemes can go wrong.  I appeal to the Minister to meet a deputation comprising the school management, Senator Landy and the Deputies present.  Moreover, I note that, in addition to the loss of the teaching posts, the school has also lost SNA posts.  This is unacceptable and untenable.  I accept the reply gives a glimmer of hope, in that there is an appeal system in place and that the case will be re-examined.  However, the loss of eight teachers is too great and the school will be unable to continue as a result.  The town of Carrick-on-Suir cannot and will not accept this.  Consequently, I seek a meeting between a deputation and the Minister to examine the nuances in this regard as the school cannot be pigeonholed.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The reason there is no reference to any other school is the question I was asked to answer on behalf of the Minister for Education and Skills is particular to the school in Carrick-on-Suir.  Moreover, without being knowledgeable, I doubt whether there are many such examples elsewhere in the system.  I draw the attention of Deputies Healy, Mattie McGrath and Crowe to the provision in the appeals system whereby a school which is losing three or more posts as a result of the combined impact of the reform measures and the budgetary allocation can make an appeal before 16 March in the reasonable expectation that some of the loss will be deferred to the subsequent school year.  I will, of course, take the time to explain to the Minister for Education and Skills the fervent advocacy of the Deputies about this school which I have visited once.  I am very familiar with the circumstances in Carrick-on-Suir and will represent that view to the Minister.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The Minister will be aware that a special meeting of the RTE Authority has been called for tomorrow following the upholding of a complaint by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland about the unfairness of the final television presidential election debate on RTE last year.  Everyone will remember this issue well because between 800,000 and 900,000 people watched the programme live.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland stated the station had made no apparent effort to verify the source and accuracy of a tweet broadcast during the "The Frontline" programme.  The tweet was incorrectly described by the presenter, Mr. Pat Kenny, as having been issued by the official Martin McGuinness campaign.  Since the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's findings were released, RTE's Noel Curran has apologised for the mistake made in the programme, but, importantly, he has refused to countenance an inquiry into the matter.  Although he stated, "We have been found against and we have to learn from that," I do not consider this to be sufficient, which is the reason I am raising this matter.RTE accepts it made two errors.  First, the veracity and source of the first tweet, the text of which is well known to many by now, should have been checked.  In addition, RTE also accepts that the second tweet, correcting the earlier one, was received approximately 28 minutes before the conclusion of the programme and that it should have been mentioned during it.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland stated the radio programme broadcast the following morning, coincidentally with the same presenter, Mr. Pat Kenny, had exacerbated the unfairness of the debate on "The Frontline" by failing to clarify the tweet.  The RTE compliance committee, chaired by Mr. Chris Morash, has stated it agrees that Mr. Kenny did not take the opportunity to verify the content or provenance of the tweet with Mr. McGuinness during the debate.  It has also stated it notes that information was available during the programme that clarified the tweet account at the centre of the complaint was not an official Sinn Féin Twitter account.To some extent, on the face of it, the RTE compliance committee is dumping on Mr. Pat Kenny.  RTE is a public service broadcaster.  The board must appoint an independent investigator to establish the facts and the sequence of events that night.  Everyone, including the Minister who spoke on the "Morning Ireland" radio programme, accepts that it had an impact on the outcome of the election campaign.  I cannot say by how much or by how little, but the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland is not going down that road.  While it would be impossible to establish at this point, owing to the privacy of the ballot box, no one disputes that it had an impact on the outcome of the campaign.The reputational damage to RTE in this instance is extremely serious.  In fairness to the staff at the station, particularly Pat Kenny, it is important that corrective action should be taken.  It is also important that Mr. Kenny should take the opportunity both to preserve his good name and clarify the position.  I am of the view that Mr. Kenny acted in a genuine and above-board way in respect of this matter.  He has an extremely good reputation as being one of the best broadcasters in Ireland.  It is clear that the tweet in question was received in RTE but the compliance committee of the BAI has stated that Mr. Kenny did not avail of the opportunity to put it to Martin McGuinness, MLA, during the programme.  Some people might presume that Mr. Kenny was aware of the information and did not broadcast the fact that there was a second tweet.  I do not know what was the position but I suspect Mr. Kenny did not have it.  However, it would be in his interests to clarify the position.RTE must put in place protocols, similar to those which already obtain at the BBC, in respect of social networking.  I ask that the board of RTE appoint an independent person to carry out an investigation in respect of what happened on the night in question.  I make this request because since the original complaint was lodged with the BAI, the management at RTE vigorously defended its actions right up until the authority issued its report.  Those who manage RTE have not been willing to accept that mistakes were made.  The RTE Authority must appoint an independent person to carry out an investigation.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I am sure Deputy Sean Fleming will permit me to point out that both the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, and RTE are independent bodies, each with clear roles and functions established under the Broadcasting Act 2009.  The compliance committee of the BAI is charged, under section 48 of that Act, with investigating and deciding upon different categories of complaints.  It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the manner in which the BAI conducts its work, just as it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to interfere in the editorial affairs of RTE.  I am sure the House will understand that I must be circumspect in what I say for a number of other reasons, not least because of the fact that the RTE board has not yet considered the BAI's findings or issued a formal statement on the matter.  I fully accept, however, that, as Deputy Sean Fleming stated, this is a serious matter.  I am sure most people will agree with the adjudication of the BAI to the effect that the use of the relevant tweet in this fashion was ill-considered.  There are lessons to be learned from this matter by everyone involved in the media in this country.I agree with the Deputy's comments to the effect that the presenter concerned is an eminent broadcaster who has an unparalleled record and reputation in the area of public affairs programmes.  However, this matter is serious from a number of perspectives.  News and current affairs in RTE, which is a public service broadcaster, are generally regarded as the gold standard for broadcast journalism in this State.  People have the right to expect the very highest of standards from a public service broadcaster, even more so in cases as important as this which relates to one of the final debates of a presidential election campaign.  It is also serious because it calls into question the manner in which traditional broadcast media deal with and report on new media.  In that context, I welcome the fact that RTE, through its director general, Mr. Noel Curran, has already acknowledged that mistakes were made in the course of the programme in question and that the relevant tweet should have been handled quite differently.  Mr. Curran has apologised to Mr. Gallagher.There are a number of larger points in question here.  First, it is clear that the extremely competitive environment in which the media operate should not be allowed to impugn journalistic standards.  Second, it is also clear that substantial lessons need to be learned from this experience in respect of the manner in which journalists deal with material garnered from social media.  The arrival of widespread Internet access and social media have come to pose huge challenges for traditional broadcasters, not just in the context of a major increase in the number of sources but also in terms of the massive increase in competition for audiences.  Broadcast media clearly feel they have to be seen to engage with this new media in case they might be seen to be slow and cumbersome or as being somehow unreflective of the zeitgeist.  This does not mean that basic journalistic standards can be allowed to lapse.  I am, however, encouraged by the fact that the director general of RTE has confirmed that a new set of guidelines for programme makers at the station will reinforce protocols around the authentication of social media and other inputs to programmes.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	396	The central issue here involved the content of what the tweet was about, namely, a political donation.  My understanding is that the Minister personally canvassed for the successful candidate in the presidential election.  I do not know whether he signed the candidate's nomination forms.  I understand that he personally made a financial donation to the successful candidate.  The Minister had a personal, financial, vested interest in the outcome of the election campaign.  I thought the least which would have happened, given the Minister came before the House today, was that he would have declared his personal interest in this campaign, in view of the fact that we are talking about a political donation.  I was surprised he came before the House to take this matter when a Minister of State took the earlier matters.I genuinely believe that the proper procedure here would be to have a Minister other than Deputy Rabbitte, and possibly other than a Labour Party Minister, who made a financial contribution to the campaign of one of the candidates to deal with this specific, narrow issue.  I am not talking about RTE which does a great job, but to this specific, narrow issue.  In the interests of impartiality and fairness, I think the Minister should personally step aside from dealing with this particular issue because of his declared financial interest in the election campaign and his contribution.  The good name and reputation of RTE are at stake.  In the interests of RTE, please have some other Minister who is not personally compromised or conflicted in relation to the particular campaign and the outcome of the election result deal with this particular issue from now on.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I am not often lost for words but in all my time in this House I have never less anticipated a line of questioning than we have just heard from my friend, Deputy Fleming.  The innuendo is outrageous.  Of course, it is a matter of public record that I canvassed on behalf of my former parliamentary colleague - of course it is true.  I was canvassing with him on the day on which the programme in question was broadcast.  Of course it is true that I made a financial donation to his campaign.  That donation was twice the size that has been reported in some quarters.  I understand that matter has since been corrected with the appropriate authorities.To suggest that because I campaigned on behalf of my former parliamentary colleague has any bearing on an investigation of a complaint on behalf of a defeated candidates in the presidential election is little short of outrageous.  I did not conduct this inquiry.  Under the Broadcasting Act 2009, the investigation is a matter for an independent body, namely, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.  It is a matter for the authority to consider certain categories of complaint.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland considered this complaint and found that, in the particular regard referred to, it was unfair to Mr. Gallagher.  Earlier this morning I said most reasonable people in the country would agree with that conclusion.  That continues to be my view.  I do not know how in heaven's name Deputy Sean Fleming can think that I am conflicted in my approach to this issue.  It is a matter for an independent statutorily established body, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, to investigate a complaint such as this and it has done so.  It has found grounds for the complaint and it is a matter for the RTE authorities to respond as appropriate when the board meets.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.I have stated on a number of occasions that I will keep under review the need to provide financial support to households whose domestic waste water treatment systems are deemed, following inspection, to require substantial remediation or upgrading.  The need for any such support will be only become clearer when inspections are being carried out.  At that stage, more information regarding the nature and extent of problems with domestic waste water treatment systems and the type and cost of pragmatic remedial actions that may be required to address these and remove the risks posed to public health or the environment by failing systems will be available.  Any scheme of support will need to have regard to budgetary constraints and to the financial position of the individual households concerned.Draft performance standards, which include operation, maintenance and de-sludging requirements, have been prepared by my Department in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and were published on 1 March.  The consultation document has been drafted in an easy-to-understand format so that it is clear to everyone what the standards involve.  If it had been issued as a draft statutory instrument, the legal format and language may have proved confusing for some people.  That should not happen now.The draft standards elaborate on the basic requirements for all domestic waste water treatment systems set out in the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 that the system does not cause a risk to public health or the environment.  The consultation document provides more detail regarding the responsibilities of owners of domestic waste water treatment systems.  These include requirements for the removal of sludge and for ensuring the system is in working order and functioning properly.The public consultation process will be open until 30 March and I encourage all interested parties to consider the consultation document and, if they wish, to make submissions to my Department on the draft performance standards before the closing date.  The submissions will be reviewed by my Department prior to finalising the content of the regulations, which will be made under section 70L of the Act.  The regulations will give legal effect to the standards.  As soon as the regulations are made, the relevant statutory instrument will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for approval in accordance with section 18 of the Water Services Act 2007.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	399	What the Minister published reveals little detail on the impact of the regulations on home owners in rural Ireland.  Given that the regulatory impact mentions a charge of €17,000 - this is not scaremongering as the Department mentioned this in its figures - does the Minister envisage a lenient inspection plan or should we expect a more comprehensive plan that will drive up costs and affect the people who need to upgrade tanks?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I do not know what I have to do in order to make it easy for people to understand that this is a very well laid out and comprehensible document setting out the reasons we must have a licensing and monitoring inspection system in order to comply with a European Court of Justice judgment.  The full details are laid out on how inspections will be carried out and when people can register has already been indicated as part of the press release for the Act.  I cannot make it any simpler and if there is a problem with on-site waste water treatment systems, it will be tackled without any difficulty.  I do not envisage an enormous number of people failing to comply with the inspection process arising from the regulations which I successfully negotiated, through the EPA, with the European Commission.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	401	Fáilte ar ais, a Aire.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I was only away for a day and the Deputy missed me.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I know, I was only winding up the Minister.  We welcome the publication of the draft standards, and although they are a bit vague, the language is clear.  We will be making a submission on them.  Some €2.7 billion was spent between 2000 and 2007 in upgrading urban waste water treatment plants, a process funded by taxpayers in urban and rural areas.  Rural householders are now expected to foot the total bill to meet waste water standards.  In many cases this will be unworkable, as in 99% of cases these are private houses constructed with loans or mortgages, and many owners may be in negative equity or arrears because of a collapse in income arising from unemployment or the past five austerity budgets.There is a requirement on the Minister to ensure that we put in place is workable and can be carried out.  We must ensure that people will comply and protect ground-water.  We do not want to see people being dragged through the courts because they cannot pay for this.We can learn from last night's debate on turf cutting.  That was not a climb-down by the Government but rather the Government taking a great initiative to put a good plan in place.  If we approach this issue similarly, engage and listen to people in order to find compromise, and if we apply the draft standards on a risk-based approach, the number of septic tanks requiring expensive repair would be modest.  Will the Minister put in place the necessary financial measures to enable people in this process?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	404	Sinn Féin is arguing that we should sign a blank cheque without knowing the extent of the problem.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	405	That is not what I said.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	406	It is.  I have explained very clearly to the Deputy that when I know the extent of the problem arising from inspections, I can deal with it.  Neither the Deputy nor anybody else knows what the issues will be in 2013 arising from inspections.  I have dealt with all the issues raised by the Deputy's party through misinformation and otherwise over the past nine months.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	407	That was not me.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	408	To be fair, the Deputy was not party to it, although some of his party members were.  Deputy Martin Ferris and others could educate him about public meetings and misinformation in the House.  Those Deputies have been seeking to misinform and frighten people on an issue that should not cause a problem for many.The Deputy mentioned some people with high mortgages but they would have already complied with the 2009 regulations and the 2007 Act.  Recently built houses should have no difficulty in complying with the standards set out in the draft regulations and the cases where there may be problems would go back years and would not have engaged in a proper maintenance and de-sludge programme.  Mentioning the category referred to by the Deputy is again misinforming people as he is arguing that they will have a problem with these standards.  There will be few problems arising from these standards and I will consider the financial position of people if there are problems.  I cannot and will not do so until I know the level of the problem arising from inspections in 2013.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I welcome the Minister's comments with regard to identifying problems and I hope the Minister can assure us there will be some grant assistance for people who must carry out major or minor improvements on their septic tanks.  Will these inspections satisfy the requirements of the European Court of Justice and the European Commission?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Every step of the way we have been in contact with the European Commission and my predecessor was also in contact with it.  The Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government submitted proposals on the basis that every septic tank would have to be inspected, with an annual inspection charge and compliance with the 2009 EPA code of practice.  I immediately engaged with the Commission to indicate this was unacceptable in dealing with the European Court of Justice judgment and I succeeded, where my predecessors failed, and with the EPA we were able to convince the Commission that we had a system, proposals and standards.  The Commission was satisfied they would comply with the judgment, which is what we are doing.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	411	Will there be a grant?

#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I asked a question concerning what happens if an environmental group, or a body which calls itself an environmental group, takes a case to Europe.  I believe he answered that in saying he has this squared with Europe.  The one thing I ask the Minister to do is to give people some time to get septic tanks remedied where they are found to be defective.  I know it will have to be risk-based; if a septic tank is polluting the public water supply time cannot be lost and I understand this.  I would not ask any local authority to back-pedal on this and if it must be done quickly then it must be done quickly.  The Bill states it must be done by a date.  The Minister probably left it like this to give people latitude.  Guidelines will be issued from the Department to local authority inspectors and they should state that a reasonable approach should be taken.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I agree with Deputy Stanley.  He correctly pointed out I have given people as much flexibility as I possibly can to comply with the court judgment that there is no damage to public health or the environment.  Irresponsible people have gone around the country and effectively advocated that watercourses should be polluted and people's households, businesses and neighbours should suffer from public health or environmental issues.  This was totally irresponsible and has caused much fear and misinformation.  I am glad the standards will be able to put away all these fears.  They are based on what I said months ago in the many contributions I was asked to make on these issues.I know many Deputies were wondering how I could negotiate with the European Commission a set of standards that would meet the European Court of Justice judgment without imposing any major financial problems for people deemed in their own minds to be in breach of the EPA code of practice of 2009.  We have a pragmatic and practical solution to a very difficult issue which I inherited.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	416	The charges applied by waste management companies are a matter between those companies and their customers, subject to compliance with all applicable environmental and other relevant legislation, particularly the conditions attached to each waste collector's collection permit issued by the relevant local authority under the Waste Management (Collection Permit) Regulations 2007, as amended.  Waste collection in individual local authority areas may also be subject to local by-laws.The programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers would bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service.A public consultation designed to inform the policy development process concluded in September 2011.  A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests.  A consensus is not apparent and, on almost all of the relevant issues, a considerable breadth of opinion was expressed.  All of the responses received, in addition to a summary document, are available on the Department's website.I expect to be in a position to submit final proposals on household waste collection to the Government by Easter this year.  All policy proposals will be carefully considered by the Government and will take account of the full range of issues and perspectives.  Matters including pricing structures, waivers for low income households, uncollected waste and the regulatory regime in respect of inspection and enforcement will all be considered in this context.  My policy objective is to put in place a system of regulation of household waste collection that provides the optimal mix of economic, environmental and social outcomes.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I thank the Minister.  We are speaking about the present.  There is mayhem in our communities, with four or five different private companies going down the same street on different days.  So much for the polluter paying or trying to protect the environment, because this totally turns that on its head.  Greyhound, which serves the Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council areas, charges those in the Dublin City Council area who previously had waivers €100.  However, those who will lose their wavers on 31 March in the South Dublin County Council area will be charged only €40.  There are huge inequalities and discrepancies in local authority areas.Does the Minister think the local authorities could have administered a proper polluter pays system without going to the private market?  What we have now is a joke.  People are very angry about the service they receive from these private companies.  Consider Greyhound's record and how it got the tender in the first place.  Dublin City Council paid Ernst and Young €250,000 to put out the tender.  The question must be raised as to whether the Minister thinks the country would be better served by public waste collection rather than the mayhem of private collection which we have at present.  Perhaps the Minister will reply in more detail.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	419	I think the Minister should.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	420	That is Deputy Collins's opinion.  I am telling her what I am doing.  I do not intend to make that recommendation to the Government.People have several opportunities to have their waste collected.  Some people choose not to pay or not to have it collected.  Such people are open to challenge under the waste collection legislation.  Fewer than 18,000 people have refused to sign up to having their waste collected in the Dublin City Council area.  There have always been 10,000 or 12,000 people who have refused to pay for anything.  These are the people who brought the viability of Dublin City Council's scheme into question.  It is not only Greyhound which can collect waste.  Other service providers can also do so and there is a good civic amenity recycling centre not far from many of the residents affected by Greyhound's collection service.I do not subscribe to Deputy Collins's view that we should nationalise the household waste collection system.  It is a considerable cost to local authorities.  There is an incentive for many people if they have difficulty with paying to recycle and use an alternative means of disposing of their waste.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	421	It is wrong to say 12,000 or 18,000 households caused the privatisation of services in the Dublin City Council area.  I do not accept this and I do not think the majority of people would accept it.  The previous Government made a conscious decision, and supported by the present Government-----
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	422	We are running out of time.  Does the Deputy have a question?
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	423	-----to privatise services.  Does the Minister think the privatisation system in place at present does not do the service well and that it would be better to nationalise the bin service?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	424	As I stated, I do not subscribe to the view that we must have a nationalised household waste collection service.  People have many choices with regard to recycling and civic amenity centres, and they also have a choice with regard to who will collect their waste.  I agree with the Deputy that it is not acceptable to have five different collectors going into one housing estate.  We are seeing what we can do to regularise this.  I wholeheartedly subscribe to the view that it does nothing good for the environment.  However, we must have in place a system that will not cost an enormous amount of money to the customer or to local authorities.  We are heading down the road of people paying more for their services to ensure we will not be paying any more income tax.  This is the choice people will have to make.  Under the law people are required to dispose of their waste.  They have a series of options and I advise them to take one.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	425	In December 2011 NAMA identified more than 2,000 properties as being potentially available for social housing.  While most of these are located in the greater Dublin region and in Cork, properties are identified in a total of 15 local authority areas throughout the country.  A steering group was then established to monitor progress, identify and address any obstacles that arise in particular cases and deal with any general policy implementation issues.  My Department, NAMA and the housing agency are represented on the group and it will serve as an ongoing point of contact between NAMA and the bodies responsible for the delivery of social housing.At present, a number of projects have been identified as being suitable for social housing, and these are being advanced for inclusion in the leasing scheme.  These projects are at various stages of development, from early discussions with developers on the type and number of units required, to negotiations on price, inspections, contract negotiations, completion works and fittings.Once a developer or receiver and the housing authority are interested, the basis for a contract will be created which can be negotiated between the parties.  This contract can take the form of a lease only or, where an approved housing body is involved, there is the potential to acquire units which are then made available to housing authorities under a payment and availability agreement.  A systematic process is being used and I expect that housing units will start to be delivered under this arrangement by the middle of this year.Funding is available for both housing authorities and approved housing bodies under the social housing leasing initiative to meet the cost of leasing these units.  Funding is also available under the capital advance leasing facility to assist approved housing bodies which want to purchase units for social housing purposes from NAMA.The social housing leasing initiative, facilitated in this case by NAMA, will make an important contribution towards meeting the demand for social housing support.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I thank the Minister for the information.  I understand 100,000 people were on social housing list in recent times which is double the figure of four years ago.  If, as the Minister states, there is an oversupply of housing, and I saw figures of 80,000 to 100,000, will these houses be leased?Is the Minister in contact with the National Asset Management Agency with a view to using the agency to tackle the housing waiting list in a creative manner?  If so, when will NAMA act on this issue?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	427	Arising from the intervention of me and the former Minister of State, Deputy Penrose, with the National Asset Management Agency, we were in a position to secure agreement on the provision by the agency of 2,000 units of accommodation.  This is a major boost towards the social dividend we expected from NAMA and will assist those on the housing waiting lists, which are, I regret, growing.  The Department is examining initiatives of this nature to ensure families are moved into houses as quickly as possible.  We are also engaging with local authorities in respect of the 2,000 units.  We also want to ensure the National Asset Management Agency spends the moneys needed to make the properties fit for purpose in order that people can enjoy their new homes without the householder or local authority having to do work on them.  Every effort is being made to ensure the units we identified in 2011 through this process will be expedited under the leasing scheme.  I believe, however, that home ownership is ultimately the best way for people to have a stake in their home and ensure they have pride in their home.  After a period, if the property market improves, I hope we will revisit the matter and be in a position to offer people an opportunity to purchase some of these homes in due course.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	428	While I welcome the Minister's response, local authorities will require some funding to address housing waiting lists.  Will the Minister examine options for providing additional revenue to fund the leases of National Asset Management Agency properties?  What will be the role of voluntary housing agencies and local authorities in this regard?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	429	It will not be possible for local authorities to engage in the traditional approach of direct building.  The amount available for construction, direct purchase or to assist voluntary housing bodies in acquiring housing has declined from €1.5 billion to €353 million over the past four years.  This is a substantial reduction and I do not know where we would obtain capital resources to go down that road again in the years ahead.  Leasing and rental accommodation schemes have been to the fore in trying to resolve problems for people by providing private rented accommodation.There is an opportunity to lease a substantial number of accommodation units from the National Asset Management Agency to assist those who are on the social housing waiting lists.  I hope we will have the co-operation and goodwill of the local authority system to expedite the units and make them available to people on the social housing lists as quickly as possible.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	430	Work is proceeding with a view to bringing policy proposals to Government at an early date on the reform and development of local government in accordance with the programme for Government.  Decisions have already been taken to merge the authorities in counties Limerick and Tipperary and implementation work is proceeding.  Progress reports have been submitted in both cases which present a positive account of work to date.  I have also established a local government committee to consider whether Waterford city and county councils should be unified and I expect to receive its report shortly.Building on these actions to date, I intend in the near future to bring wider policy proposals to Government for an action programme on local government, with particular focus on strengthening local government structures generally at regional, county and sub-county levels.  This will include proposals for an enhanced local authority role in economic development and enterprise support, reflecting arrangements arising from the recent Government decision on the local enterprise service and in respect of the alignment of local and community development functions with local government.  The programme will also incorporate proposals arising from consultations with ministerial colleagues regarding functions and services of their Departments and bodies under their aegis that could potentially be devolved to local government in the short to medium term.The programme will also reflect other work under way on local government efficiency implementation and financing and will broadly map out further aspects of the local government system on which reform proposals will be considered.  The range of action under way and proposed will form a substantial programme of mutually reinforcing reform measures which should result in stronger, more effective and cohesive local government, with greater capacity to address challenges and promote economic and social development in their respective areas.My overall vision is for a reformed system of local government to be the main vehicle of governance and public service locally, performing as wide a range of appropriate functions as possible, as efficiently as possible as close to citizens and communities.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	431	As the Minister realises, Ireland has the most centralised government in Europe and one of the Continent's most ineffective local government structures.  I am not sure the measures to which the Minister referred will significantly change that position.  Does the Government plan to return some power to citizens?  There is a substantial gap between citizens and politics.  The former do not feel represented because the councillors they elect at local level have virtually no authority.  Other than having a say on the development plan, most of the work of a councillor involves representation and lobbying on behalf of constituents.  Does the Government have any appetite for real reform of local government to provide it with proper funding to invest in people friendly areas such as crèches, education and health, as is the case in most local authority systems elsewhere in Europe, or will this country remain among the most centralised in Europe?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I fully concur with Deputy Wallace on the centralised nature of government here.  This is not acceptable, which is the reason I am doing something about it.  In view of the Deputy's stance on the household charge, I would welcome his proposals on financing local government.  Where will we obtain money at local level to contribute to the effective running of local government and the provision of services if we comply with the standards the Deputy has set?I want to move many of the functions of agencies and sections of Departments to ensure services are delivered as closely as possible to individuals and communities.  I have made a start on enterprise functions.  My Department and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have agreed to devolve the community and enterprise development functions to local authority level.  There is a challenge for local authorities to step up to the plate by engaging with people on the ground to ensure we get a good response to rolling out all of these services.  However, these services must also be paid for.  If one seeks to devolve functions and remove the centralisation of functions, which the Deputy correctly noted is a problem, one must have the wherewithal at local level for funds to be provided to implement these services and give the greatest possible discretion to elected members to implement such services at local level.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	433	Taxes collected at local level should be used at local level.  Removing responsibility for motor taxation, driving licences, payroll and water from local authorities will mean they will have even less to do.If the household charge was a tax on homes, we would consider it.  However, someone who paid 12% stamp duty on a house purchased for €200,000 will pay €25,000 over a 25 year mortgage, which amounts to a household tax of €1,000 per annum.  If the Government abolishes stamp duty for principal residences, as is the case in the rest of Europe, the notion of paying a tax on one's home would be fair.  There is, however, no comparison between the position here and elsewhere in Europe because Irish people have probably paid more tax on their homes through stamp duty than any other Europeans.  If the Government abolishes stamp duty on principal residences, it could be deemed fair to impose a household tax in respect of homes purchased thereafter.  However, the current position is definitely not fair.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I accept the household charge is not progressive or fair and one needs to have a property tax in place, as most socialist parties in Europe would agree.  I intend to bring forward proposals later this year to achieve this outcome in 2013.

I refer, for example, to the proper devolution of functions to local authority level and the proper provision of local services which can be delivered by people at local level as close as possible to the people.  However, these services must also be funded at local level, which is what I am striving to do.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	440	The draft guidelines for planning authorities on retail planning will be finalised by April 2012.  The guidelines are aimed at ensuring the planning system plays a key role in supporting competitiveness in the retail sector, advancing choice for the consumer while promoting and supporting the vitality and viability of city and town centres, and contributing to a high standard of urban design and encouraging a greater use of sustainable transport.  We are clarifying the messages of previous guidelines in promoting a sequential approach to retail development.  This will mean that the preferred location for new retail development is within city and town centres.  Following the sequential approach, if no development sites are available within a city or town centre, then the next preference should be a location on the edge of the city or town centre.  Only where the applicant can demonstrate, and the planning authority is satisfied, that there are no sites or potential sites within a city or town centre or on its edge should out-of-centre development be considered.In parallel with this policy objective, the guidelines will also clarify that to ensure proper planning and sustainable development, retail development and activity must follow the settlement hierarchy of the State, including the various gateway and hub town locations identified in the national spatial strategy, the regional planning guidelines and the core strategies of development plans.  My objective will be to strengthen national planning policy requirements for all planning authorities in relation to retail planning and the requirements in relation to driving city and town centres as focal points for retailing.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	441	Forfás conducted a study in this regard last April while the EU and the IMF examined the economic impact of a retail cap, although they did not state that they wanted it abolished.  What steps will the Minister take to ensure all retailers will be treated equally?  For example, could large retailers use a particular model to avoid town centre or city centre development?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The Deputy is correct that we were obliged under the EU-IMF agreement to carry out an independent study of the retail sector from the point of view of competitiveness.  We did so and we submitted a draft proposal to the EU-IMF, which did not take into account all the recommendations made by Forfás.  I am conscious that balanced development is needed, as the Deputy said, and I am equally conscious of the potential power of the large multiples to suck business out of town centres if they are located on the edge of these towns.  That has happened in the past and the Deputy will be aware from my earlier reply that I do not favour that.  I am examining the sequential approach to ensure it is more robust and stronger in the context of the planning and development Acts, thus ensuring town centres are improved once again.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	443	Commercial viability is an issue and the approach must be thoroughly tested.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I would be glad to hear from the Deputy if he has a methodology that would allow for the free market to operate while, at the same time, preventing the abuses to which he has referred.  I am strong on ensuring that in the scheme of development contributions, we err on the side of ensuring we protect and enhance town centres.  We all know that there has been a reduction in footfall and business in town and city centres.  This is not the interest of the consumer or the planning and development of the centres involved.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	445	The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.  Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge by 31 March 2012, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.  The Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, is administering the household charge system on a shared service-agency basis for all county and city councils.  I understand, from data provided by the LGMA, that as of 7 March 2012, a total of 200,101 properties have been registered for payment of the household charge.  This equates to income of €20 million.It is estimated that 1.6 million residential properties are liable to the household charge.  If collected in full, the charge has the potential to raise €160 million annually.  As an incentive to pay the self-assessment charge, late payment fees and late payment interest apply and amounts due and unpaid remain as a charge against the property concerned.  Such amounts will have to be discharged in the event of the sale or transfer of the property concerned.  I will keep the income being generated from the household charge under constant review and local authorities and I will take any necessary measures, as appropriate, in regard to compliance with the legislation.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The Minister said 1.6 million households are liable for the charge but, up to the end of February, only 128,000 householders had paid.  He cannot operate on the revenue estimate of €160 million.  Will local authorities be given funding by the Department to address the shortfall?  The household charge is not an additional income stream for local authorities.  It replaces the local government fund, under which €164 million was available last year.  The figures do not add up.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	450	The household charge will go into the local government fund and will be disbursed among local authorities.  If the estimated amount is not collected, the local authorities will have to examine their service plans for the remainder of the year.  The Government has no additional money.  If the €160 million is not paid into this fund, there will be an impact on services and local authority staff need to realise that.The penalties for late payment are proportionate to the level of the charge and are similar to the provisions that apply under Revenue legislation in respect of the late filing and payment of certain taxes.  Late payment fees and interest will only apply if the household charge is not paid in respect of the liability date and the property that is liable.  That will act as a strong incentive to pay the self-assessment charge on time.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I refer to a practical matter relating to the charge.  People who are presenting at local authority offices are being refused when they offer cash to pay the charge.  They are sent away to get a postal order.  In particular, I have encountered elderly people who do not have cheque books or credit or debit cards but who want to have their affairs in order.  Will the Minister direct all local authorities to accept cash?  Cash is the primary mode of payment in this country.  The same issue applies to the non-principal private residence charge.

How does he intend to pursue people with late interest payments given the State would have to take them to court and the courts system is in crisis?

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I will not develop any method.  My methodology is to ensure people understand the law and understand they are liable for this charge and have to pay it.  The late payment interest will be 1% per month and late payment fees will apply in the case of a household charge.  If the Deputy is advocating that people should not pay, he is telling them that they should pay late payment fees and mount up a bill on top of the €100 charge.With regard to Deputy Daly's question, people do not pay until they have to and they will have to pay by the end of this month.With regard to Deputy Mulherin's question, I have advocated to the local authorities that they take legal tender.  I am developing a system with An Post whereby it will supply the household charge forms.  People will have access to them in the next few days, hopefully next week, and can pay through that methodology, particularly the elderly community in rural areas.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	461	There is an ongoing moratorium in the public service which was introduced as an emergency measure in response to the financial crisis.  Under the terms of the moratorium all local authority staffing requests must be sanctioned by my Department.In accordance with section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, it is a matter for each local authority, in the first instance, to ensure that the reduction in staff numbers is managed in order that the appropriate service level is maintained.  Section 10 of the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 set out the functions of a fire authority, which include the establishment and maintenance of fire brigades, the assessment of fire cover needs, the provision of premises and, of course, its fire fighting role.My Department works very closely with local authorities to ensure that critical posts are filled while overall numbers are reduced having due regard to the continued delivery of key services and the need for further reduction in overall staffing levels and expenditure in the local government sector.  Dublin City Council's overall staff numbers have reduced from 7,326.15 whole time equivalents in June 2008 to 6,072.35 whole time equivalents in December 2011, a reduction of 17%.  In the same period the number of full time firefighters employed increased from 825 whole time equivalents to 874 whole time equivalents.I understand that the position in regard to staffing in Dublin Fire Brigade is kept under constant review by Dublin City Council.  The panel referred to by the Deputy, which was in place since 2007, expired in December 2011.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	480	In line with overall national policy which promotes a reduction in energy use, the enhancement of energy efficiency standards remains a priority within my Department's overall strategy for the improvement of local authority housing.  Under the Department's Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures to improve the standard and overall quality of their social housing stock.  The programme includes a retrofitting measure aimed at improving the energy efficiency of older apartments and houses by reducing heat loss through the fabric of the building and the installation of high-efficiency condensing boilers.Given the constraints on new local authority housing supply, it is important that the existing stock of local authority housing is available and in fit condition to meet housing need.  Houses requiring significant pre-letting improvement works can quickly deteriorate if left vacant for an extended period.Under this year's improvement works programme, the focus will continue on returning vacant properties to productive use.  Local authorities may also undertake works, out of the allocations provided, to improve the energy efficiency of occupied units, where the local authority considers this appropriate.  In drawing up improvement works programmes which include the upgrading of tenanted properties, I envisage that local authorities would give priority to older houses which lack adequate wall and roof insulation.In respect of occupied units my Department provides a grant of up to €15,000 per house, depending on the energy improvement achieved, for necessary works such as attic and wall insulation, the replacement of windows and external doors and the fitting of energy efficient condensing boilers.

I welcome the Minister's reply.  My question is on older houses.  In regard to O'Moore Place, Portlaoise, the local authority was told by officials in the Department not to proceed with the retrofitting measure because they could not get it up to the B standard.  They were advised to leave them as they occupied houses.  What is happening is that the local authority is spending the money on houses built only ten or 12 years ago which have insulation but would not-----

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	488	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 29 together.The Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 set out a clear statutory framework for construction activity based on clear legal standards as set out in the building regulations; detailed technical guidance documents to outline how these standards can be achieved in practice; the burden and responsibility for compliance resting first and foremost with developers-builders; a statutory responsibility for professionals who are engaged by developers to ensure that construction at least meets the legal minimum standards; and the responsibility for enforcing compliance with the building regulations resting with the 37 local building control authorities.  Where a contract exists between the owner of a building, including a local authority in the case of certain publicly owned buildings, and the relevant builder-developer enforcement may also be a civil matter.Local authorities already have extensive powers under the Building Control Acts which they can use to enforce compliance with the building regulations.  The case at Priory Hall demonstrates that Dublin City Council is willing to use its powers for enforcing compliance with fire regulations when necessary and other local authorities have also used the courts to effect compliance with planning permissions, building regulations and fire regulations, all of which are critically relevant to the quality of the built environment.  Results can also be achieved, and often are, through discussion and persuasion with the threat of legal action.Clearly, however, there are steps that can and must be taken to improve compliance with, and oversight and enforcement of, the building regulations.  That is why in July 2011, I announced a number of measures to be advanced by the Department and local authorities.  They include the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the building regulations have been met; the lodgement of drawings at commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the building regulations; more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective oversight of building activity; standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions; and better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.Mandatory certification, lodgement of drawings and improved inspection arrangements as outlined above are key reforms which, I believe, will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and will lead to further strengthening of the regulatory regime as early as possible in 2012.  Professionals who are engaged by developers will be required to ensure that construction at least meets the legal minimum standards and there is an urgent need for the construction professions to deliver high standards and professionalism in the construction field.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	489	One can have all the regulations one wants but there will have to be enough people to ensure the work is done correctly.  Drawings can be checked before and after construction and one can sign off on work.  In the case of Priory Hall, not only did the builder say the work was done correctly but so also did the architect and the engineer and Dublin City Council appeared to be satisfied with it.The guy the bank sent out to test it thought it was okay for people to get mortgages in respect of it.  However, it was not right.  The reason was that there were no daily inspections on the site, which is what is required.  If fire-stop is missing in a floor or around an opening in a wall, nobody will know unless there was someone on-site on a daily basis.  That costs a lot of money, and many people are needed, but it is the only way to ensure things are being done right.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I agree with Deputy Wallace; there is no point in having any regulations if it is not possible to enforce them.  In 2010, 82 enforcement notices were served by building control authorities, compared to 36 the year before.  A clerk of works system is what the Deputy and I know best in terms of ensuring proper compliance with building control, and that is why I am trying to pool resources in local authorities to do precisely what the Deputy has advocated today.  I am considering that intensely at the moment and examining whether we can obtain the necessary staff, notwithstanding the reduction in staff in local authorities generally, to ensure proper compliance with building regulations in future.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	491	Am I to understand that the Minister is thinking of going back to the idea of requiring a clerk of works on-site - someone who represents the council and can make sure the architect, engineer, fire safety officer and builder are doing things according to plan?  That would be great, and it would be money well spent.  Some badly built developments are known to us, but I would say there are a lot more that we do not know about.  It would be a good investment on the part of the State to bring back the clerk of works system.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I am not ruling out anything.  The system has worked well in the past.  We have had a lot of irresponsible building projects overseen by professions that we trusted.  We asked them on behalf of the State to sign off on these developments, but we have seen some of the shoddy workmanship that has gone on.  This has caused problems for the unfortunate residents who bought properties or are in social housing and who are caught up in this through no fault of their own.  These are the professions that we all expected to be pillars of society, and we thought they would do the right thing by the citizens and by the State.  I am not ruling out a return of the clerk of works system in order to ensure that the mandatory inspection regime I advocated earlier is properly enforced and implemented.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I hope that at some stage the Minister will agree to meet with the Priory Hall residents.  I know he said he was waiting for the court case, but he should meet with them.  We now know that the Minister's Department was involved in this in 2006.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	494	Hold on a minute, Deputy.  These are supplementary questions.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	495	This is a supplementary question.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	496	There is a time limit, and three other Deputies wish to speak, so please be short.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	497	I will ask the supplementary question.  When Department officials visited and inspected this site back in 2006, they discovered fire safety issues.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	498	That is not a question; it is a statement.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I am going to ask the question now.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	500	Well, ask the question.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I will ask it.  These fire safety issues included the absence of fire collars.  What action was taken at this time to rectify this?  When spot checks were made to ensure compliance, how did the Department satisfy itself that the certificate provided by CLM Fireproofing, dated 21 November 2006, was adequate?  Did the Department subsequently contact either CLM or the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, whose certificates of opinion on compliance were provided by the developer?
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I welcome the fact the Minister will be examining these issues, although I hope he will do more than examine them.  I am glad he is inching towards that.  The elephant in the room is the question of what he proposes to do to deal with the existing breaches of regulations in places such as Priory Hall.  Tens of thousands of homeowners are affected by issues such as water ingress, drainage problems, unfinished estates, inadequate fire safety and pyrite.  These are existing problems.  I respect the fact that the Minister will be examining this in the future, which is necessary - a clerk of works system is required - but he needs to tell us how he will help the tens of thousands of families who are caught up in this situation now, with Priory Hall and Belmayne to the forefront.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I agree with Deputy Wallace that we should return to a clerk of works system as soon as possible.  In addition, I support what was said by the previous speaker.  We need to rectify the appalling damage that has been done.  Would the Minister be prepared to appoint a high-level inspector from his own Department to examine all of the north fringe?  Like everyone else in the House, the Minister was exasperated when we started hearing of problems with Belmayne.Has the Minister investigated the certificate that was given to Kingspan Century to erect four-storey buildings with wooden frames?  Is it the case that this is the only company in the UK or Ireland that has such permission?  Has he requested an urgent explanation from the Dublin city manager of why the investigations in Belmayne in 2011 did not reveal the appalling problems we are facing in that part of the north fringe today?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	504	Belmayne was launched in 2007, as Deputy Broughan knows, at the height of the property boom as a high-profile housing development in Dublin's north fringe.  The company behind the development, Belmayne Ireland limited, has had its loans taken over by NAMA.  On 6 July 2011 a report was prepared for the chief fire officer of the Dublin region outlining the position with regard to fire safety inspections carried out between April and July 2011 on a number of units in Belmayne.  The report indicated that based on visual inspections, the means of escape layout and fire protection facilities were in compliance with the relevant fire safety certificate as issued by the building control authority.  While the inspections were limited in terms of the actual construction that could be accessed, the officer reported that the exposed construction inspected was in compliance with the Irish Agrément Board certificate.  As we now know, this was not satisfactory.  When matters came to a head on 19 January 2012, Dublin City Council, through Dublin Fire Brigade, was notified by a developer of a construction defect.  Although nobody needed to move out, it is not satisfactory that a proper investigation was not carried out earlier.  I am having these matters followed up.Deputies Daly and Ellis asked how we intended to deal with the legacy issues.  I have asked each local authority to carry out inspections and have areas they suspect are non-compliant with fire regulations investigated as a matter of urgency in the interests of residents.  I hope to receive reports from the local authorities shortly so we can identify and address any problems.  There is sufficient legislation to allow local authorities to do their business properly, and that is what they have been doing in some cases but not in all.  I hope to be able to follow up on this in the near future.The issue raised by Deputy Ellis was the subject of a parliamentary question on 1 March, the reply to which set out the exact position.  I will not read it out again as the Deputy will be familiar with it.  Trusted individuals in the professions were asked to sign off on particular items and this was not done in substantial compliance with the building regulations.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	505	The programme for Government contains a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection under which service providers would bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service.  A public consultation designed to inform the policy development process concluded in September 2011.  A large number of responses were received from a broad spectrum of interests.  As I said earlier, many people had differing opinions on how such matters should be dealt with in terms of policy.  All of the responses are on the Department's website, www.environ.ie.I met recently with representatives of the household waste collection industry, during which an economic analysis of many of the issues was presented to me.  This research, in addition to the recently published National Waste Report 2010, will help inform the completion of the regulatory impact analysis in respect of household waste collection, which is now at an advanced stage.  I expect to be in a position to submit final proposals to the Government by Easter this year.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The promised regulatory impact analysis was to be published by Easter.  From what the Minister is saying, it seems it is soon due.  There are problems with waste collection all over the city, but particularly in certain areas where rubbish is left scattered.  We clearly need a service level agreement.  Refuse collection companies are leaving rubbish uncollected.  Black plastic bags are left in some areas, and shops are still selling bin tags.  The waiver scheme has been abandoned even though, as I understand it, it was supposed to be retained for 12 months.  How will that aspect knit with the proposed national waiver scheme contained in the programme for Government?
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	507	I hope to include as part of the national policy an obligation for a waiver for low income families.  That has worked well in many local authorities.  It has been an expensive provision for local authorities in the past but, nevertheless, it is a valuable policy instrument to assist people, particularly those on low incomes and in receipt of social welfare benefit, to ensure they are able to comply with the waste regulations.A good deal of work has been carried out and the Deputy will be aware of the submissions that have been made.  Local authorities have found this to be a very expensive system to operate.  It has been largely privatised now but it must be properly regulated and, under the new waste policy, we will seek to regulate the waste industry properly and ensure that people get a service in every part of the country - there are many parts of the country where people do not have a service - at affordable rates in a competitive environment.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	508	Is it still the intention to move towards a system whereby there would be tendering on an area-wide basis rather the choice which consumers have at present?  It would be very uncompetitive to do that and would ultimately cost the consumer more and remove choice from consumers.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	509	It is interesting that the Competition Authority, which had strong views on this issue some years ago, appears to have changed its mind recently.  It is now indicating that the existing collection system is more competitive and consumer friendly than it previously thought.  It is amazing that such an august body as the Competition Authority can change its mind on these matters.  Taking that into account, which it would expect me to do, the issue of franchise bidding and the household collection system is still in the programme for Government but, equally, I am looking at enforcing the existing system better through a stronger permit system as well.  All these issues are on the table to ensure we have a competitive system that gives good consumer choice and deals with the obligations on citizens to ensure their waste is collected.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	510	On 1 March 2012 I published a consultation document which sets out the proposed standards for the operation and maintenance of septic tanks and other domestic waste water treatment systems.  The consultation process will be open until Friday, 30 March and submissions can be made to my Department on the proposed standards before they are given legal effect.  It is my intention, subject to the outcome of this consultation process, to include the standards in regulations to be made under the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.My Department is in regular contact with the European Commission on the steps necessary to comply with the October 2009 European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland regarding domestic waste water from septic tanks and Ireland's obligations under the EU waste directive.  A copy of the draft performance standards has been provided to the European Commission.The Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012, together with the regulations I am proposing to make, are key measures to achieve compliance with the court ruling and to avoid the imposition of financial penalties by the court.  The court is due to consider an application for the imposition of fines and penalties on this matter later this year.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	511	Is the Minister aware that Professor Tol, a former environmental economist with the ESRI, has cast doubt on whether the risk-based inspections will be upheld by the Commission?  He talks about the need for inspections to be periodic.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I am surprised the Deputy would take his advice from Professor Tol who said it would cost €800 to put a water meter in a house.  He has got a number of things wrong.  He is no longer working for the ESRI.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that not everybody who presents himself or herself as having such levels of expertise is always right.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 45 together.Under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Acts 1878 to 2001, local authorities generally, acting in their capacity as burial boards, have a range of powers to provide and manage burial grounds in their functional area.  It is a matter for each local authority to set an appropriate level of charges in respect of burial grounds managed by it.There are no plans to introduce new legislation in regard to burial grounds.  Perhaps Deputy Dowds in his question is getting at the cost of plots.  I am not sure what is the nature of his question but he might allude to that.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I was referring more to the private side.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	515	Okay.  In Dublin, the four local authorities operate a large number of burial grounds throughout their administrative areas.My Department has no role in regard to the Dublin Cemetery Committee or The Dublin Cemeteries Committee Act 1970, which is a private Act.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I thank the Minister for his reply.  This is a difficult issue and I ask the Minister to examine the operation of The Dublin Cemeteries Committee Act 1970, which covers the operation of several cemeteries in Dublin such as Glasnevin, Palmerstown, Dardistown and Newlands, because people have to bear extreme costs when they bury loved ones in those cemeteries.  One of the problems is that people do not know what the cost will be when they go about buying a grave.  Given that the The Dublin Cemeteries Committee Act applies to these cemeteries, I ask the Minister to examine this matter.  I have concerns about a number of serious issues.  This body does not publish accounts and even though it is a charitable body, yet it is engaged in commercial activities.  I respectfully ask the Minister to examine this matter to see if anything that can be done to ease the cost for people who choose to bury loved ones in those cemeteries.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I know that the Deputy would not be asking this question until he received many representations on it.  It is interesting that prices differ widely-----
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	518	Hugely.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	519	-----especially between rural and urban areas.  A single plot in Mayo costs €375 while one in Fingal costs €1,900.  The cost of plots in south Dublin increased significantly on 1 January last.  A single plot rose from €1,200 to €1,800.  It is an expensive matter and it might be a matter for the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in that this could involve a competition issue.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	520	In Palmerston the cost of a plot could be €8,000, and that is before one does anything else.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	521	The Deputy might send me details of those levels of extortionate costs, as in the case of the plot that cost €8,000 and I will have that investigated.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	522	The worst I heard was one that cost €16,000.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I support the concerns expressed by Deputy Dowds on this issue.  A few people who make gravestones  and from whom I used to buy granite told me how unlevel the playing field has become in terms of their having to compete with the Dublin Cemeteries Committee.  These people have set up a substantial stone business and they supply the stone that goes around a grave and the headstone.  Unfair conditions are at play.  One man in this business has had to lay people off because he is not able to compete with those other people in this business.  The situation that prevails is unfair and it needs to be examined.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I would concur with that.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I thank Deputy Dowds for raising this matter.  One can buy a plot for as little as €300 in County Laois.  With regard to the transfer of responsibility to a separate body which appears to have charitable status, the service seems to work better under the local authority because it is accountable to voters and citizens.  The Minister might examine that aspect.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	526	I must admit that regulating the cost of burial plots and burial grounds was not high on my list of priorities.  The Deputies have indicated that there is a significant variation in the costs charged.  There are problems associated with it.  I would glad if the Deputies would forward me examples to back up the assertions that have been made in the House and I will have them investigated.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	527	Part of the problem is that the information only comes out in dribs and drabs.  People do not know the real cost when they start the process of looking for a grave.Written Answers follow Adjournment.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	528	The 2002 National Spatial Strategy   (NSS) is a twenty-year planning framework designed to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development and population growth between regions, and it provides the spatial vision and principles for statutory regional planning guidelines across eight regions and for development plans at a local level.A comprehensive review of implementation of the NSS was undertaken during 2010, culminating in the publication in October 2010 of the NSS Update and Outlook Report (available at www.environ.ie). This report reaffirmed the commitment to implementing long-term planning frameworks such as the NSS and identified new priorities and objectives to deliver more consistent implementation at all levels, taking account of experience since 2002 and the new environmental, budgetary and economic challenges that we continue to face. In particular, the 2010 Report identified a series of actions in respect of:better alignment and prioritisation of sectoral infrastructure investment,improved governance at national, regional and local levels, andthe promotion of more sustainable patterns of development, both in rural and urban contexts, through more effective, evidence-based planning policies, with the aim of maximising the role of NSS implementation in supporting overall economic recovery.In addition, the adoption of updated Regional Planning Guidelines in 2010 for the twelve-year period to 2022 and the new legislative provisions in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 to include core strategies in development plans, taking account of regional policies, targets and priorities, are further embedding the NSS principles into the forward-planning process, and should help to deliver more co-ordinated, coherent and sustainable planning outcomes.It is a matter for the locally elected members of planning authorities to introduce these evidence-based core strategy provisions in new development plans and variations to existing plans in line with the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010, including providing information in relation to the quantum, location and phasing of lands zoned for development over the period of the plan.  It is also a matter for the elected members to ensure that local area plans are consistent with the development plan thereafter.I expect shortly to receive a Regional Planning Guidelines Implementation Annual Report 2011 being prepared jointly by the 8 Regional Authorities in respect of their activities; these include ensuring proper oversight of the alignment of plans at national, regional and local levels.  I will as necessary consider the need for any further review of the National Spatial Strategy in light of evolving economic circumstances and the beneficial deployment of our now more constrained resources.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	529	The Government is fully committed to progressing the National Regeneration Programme and to improving the lives of those living in our most disadvantaged communities. This year the total funding available for the Social Housing Investment Programme will be over €390 million. Capital allocations to local authorities for 2012, will shortly be announced, including allocations to authorities in respect of their regeneration programmes.Despite the difficult economic circumstances in which we find ourselves, we will continue to protect, to the greatest extent possible, the level of capital investment in regeneration.  In that context, I am anxious to ensure that the construction of the 75 social houses and associated works on a new crèche and estate office in St. Michael's Estate is progressed to completion as quickly as possible. To this end, the necessary funding will be made available to Dublin City Council under this year's regeneration allocation.The Building Works Contract entered into for the construction works at St. Michael's Estate is between Dublin City Council, as the Employer under the terms of the contract, and the contractor, BAM Builders Ltd. My Department is not a party to the contract and, as such, I am not directly involved.  My Department's involvement is primarily concerned with the provision of the necessary capital funding to support the construction project.  However, I am well aware of the challenging nature of regeneration projects due to the large number of stakeholders involved, the need to manage the relocation of a resident community and indeed the issues that can arise on brown-field sites.  I am aware also of the on-site issues which resulted in the cessation of work for a two-week period at St. Michael's Estate. Both the Employer and the Contractor are bound by the terms of the contract and, where disputes arise, these must be dealt with in accordance with these terms.I am pleased that the contractor and the City Council are working together, within the terms of the contract, to ensure this project is delivered as designed and on time.  Following the recent work stoppage, and discussions between the parties, the contractor is back on site and proceeding with the works with a commitment from both parties to the contract to ensure the satisfactory completion of this project.

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; andCategory four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, inter alia:the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; and,where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.In terms of the resolution of problems in unfinished housing developments the formulation of Site Resolution Plans (SRP) is a key tool. Such plans enable developers to work with local authorities, financial institutions, NAMA and residents in determining how best to pursue resolution of problematic sites. The process also entails working with stakeholders in identifying the best long-term solution for developments in terms of their configuration, use of vacant buildings and ownership in a way that is in the best interests of residents.  As part of the work of the National Coordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments my Department has initiated a pilot project for the resolution of sites using the site resolution plan process. As part of the process my Department has issued a working template in order to establish best practice in this area. I intend that the process, which is pivotal to the resolution of problem sites, will be used more extensively in the coming year.In addition, under the Public Safety Initiative, my Department has made allocations totalling some €2.59 million to 21 local authorities from the €5 million funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues in 2011. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites. A provision of €2m has been made for 2012 and my Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.

The Osberstown Wastewater Treatment Plant contract, with an estimated cost of €22 million, is one of these contracts.  Under this contract Kildare County Council propose to expand and upgrade the existing Osberstown Waste Water Treatment Plant from 80,000 population equivalent to 130,000 population equivalent.Kildare County Council has submitted Contract Documents for this contract to my Department and these are under examination at present.  Following consultation with the Council, additional information is to be submitted to enable my Department finalise its examination of the documents.  It is anticipated that, following a tender procedure to be conducted later this year, work on this contract will commence during 2013.  Contract Documents for two further contracts of the Upper Liffey Valley Sewerage Scheme, Contracts No. 2A and 2B, comprising the expansion and upgrade of the sewer network and pumping stations, are being prepared by Kildare County Council for submission to my Department for approval.

Under the existing arrangements a manager is entitled to maximum pension equal to half pensionable remuneration and a maximum retirement lump sum of one and a half times pensionable remuneration.  A manager may also be entitled to up to 10 added years and a severance payment of up to half annual salary. The provisions in terms of added years and severance reflect the fixed term contract nature of city and county manager posts.My Department has examined the new pension terms for secretaries general to assess how they apply to city and county managers. The implementation of new pension terms for managers will require legislation. In this regard, I will consult with my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in the coming weeks before the precise details of proposed legislative amendments are finalised.  While I acknowledge that a review of the existing terms is required and, as I am indicating this is at an advanced stage, I wish to acknowledge the critical role city and county managers have played in delivering savings of over €735 million and staff reductions of 7,500 — equivalent to a 20% reduction — since 2008.In this regard, city and county managers are committed to pursuing the reform agenda intensively in 2012 and have established a dedicated Office to drive this work. In particular, the Office is co-ordinating the approach to implementation of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group recommendations including in relation to staff reductions and shared services developments.

It will ultimately be a matter for Irish Water to determine the staffing and skills required for the new organisation.In the initial phase, Irish Water will work largely through service level agreements with local authorities.  This will ensure a smooth transition to the new model and guard against the loss of local expertise.  As Irish Water will be a public sector body, considerable protection will be provided by law for staff transferring to Irish Water from local authorities.  These issues will be further considered in the development of an implementation plan which will address transformation planning, including human resources issues, and will be the subject of discussion with local authorities, staff and the Unions to ensure that the change is managed well.The overall water reforms the Government has planned will create 2,000 construction related jobs in the economy on an ongoing basis. This will be achieved through the planned roll-out of a universal programme of water metering this year which will lead to the creation of up to 2,000 jobs for the three year duration of the metering installation programme. Once the metering programme has been completed, a steady level of capital investment of potentially €600 million per annum in water services, facilitated through the new public utility will see this level of construction employment sustained on an ongoing basis through capital investment in new infrastructure.

The Memorandum of Understanding between Ireland and the EU/IMF commits Ireland to undertaking an independent assessment of the establishment of such an authority.My Department procured consultants to undertake this study through an open competition advertised on the Government's public procurement website —www.etenders.ie.  As a result of this competition, a team led by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which includes legal and engineering consultants, was appointed.  The full cost of the study is expected to be €107,800 excluding VAT.  The first part of this study is now completed and was published in January 2012 as part of a consultation process to inform the implementation phase.  A sum of €49,000 of the consultancy fee (excluding VAT) was paid in 2011 and the balance is due to be paid during 2012.The need for further external advice as the work continues will be determined in the light of the conclusion of the final phase of the current work.  Accordingly no specific allocation has been made for such work in future years, at this stage.

As such, if collected in full, the household charge has the potential to raise €160 million annually.  The household charge is framed on a self assessment basis at a point in time.  It is a matter for those who own residential property liable to the charge to declare this and to pay the charge by the due date, 31 March 2012.  As an incentive to pay the self assessment charge, late payment fees and late payment interest apply and any amounts due and unpaid remain as a charge against the property concerned.  Such amounts will have to be discharged in the event of the sale or transfer of the property concerned.As of 7 March 2012 a total of 200,101 properties have registered to pay the household charge.  This represents some €20 million.  I will be keeping the income being generated from the household charge under constant review and I and local authorities will take any necessary measures, as appropriate, in regard to compliance with the legislation.

The financial parameters within which we will have to operate in the coming years rule out a return to very large capital funded construction programmes by local authorities. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models, such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).

In carrying out their functions as competent authorities under waste legislation, local authorities have a role in taking the necessary measures to ensure that any waste generated and left abandoned by diesel launderers is safely disposed of so as to avoid endangering human health or harming the environment.  As the waste involved is classified as hazardous, it is sent abroad for disposal.Up to now, my Department has reimbursed in full, from the Environment Fund, the costs associated with such safe disposal on an exceptional and case by case basis, in recognition of the particular difficulties which arose for the local authorities concerned in responding to instances of illegal dumping of oil-laundering residues.  Since 2003, a total of €4.677m has been provided for this purpose, comprising €3.254 million to Louth County Council, €1.395 million Monaghan County Council and €30,000 to Offaly County Council.My Department participates in a Cross Border Fuel Fraud Enforcement Group led by the Revenue Commissioners.  While delivery of a complete solution to this problem is challenging, it must necessarily involve effective and co-ordinated enforcement of the law from both a revenue and waste management perspective and by authorities on both sides of the border.

Given the constraints on the public capital programme, authorities were asked to have particular regard to the size and value of proposed projects.  My Department is currently reviewing the proposals received with a view to compiling a three-year capital investment programme which will take account of housing need in the relevant area, capacity to deliver the project within a reasonable timeframe and the ability to leverage additional housing supply through a combination of capital and leasing finance.  I intend to announce details of the three-year programme of new works later this year.

These data, and not information collected in 2010, were used in the determination of household charge waiver eligibility.Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; andCategory four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, inter alia:the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; and,where there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge.  Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  This list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 and forms the complete and final list of such developments for this year.  The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 does not provide for an appeals facility in this regard.  A revised list of estates will be prescribed for 2013 after which time the waiver for unfinished housing developments will end.  Throughout this period it is anticipated that the numbers of categories 3 and 4 developments will decrease as my Department continues to work with local authorities and other stakeholders to resolve outstanding issues, including through the Public Safety Initiative.

Under the Public Safety Initiative, my Department has approved applications to fund, inter alia, the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting and other works to secure sites in Category 4 developments. Category 4 developments are, by definition, those where the development has been abandoned by the developer and is posing serious problems for residents. The possibility, therefore, of employing the original developer to carry out works under the public safety initiative does not arise.

Several attempts to have the developer address fire safety concerns were unsuccessful and on 3   December 2009 Dublin City Council delivered a letter by hand to each occupied apartment advising them that Fire Safety Notices had been served on the developer which prohibited the use of the buildings until such time as works specified in the Fire Safety Notices had been completed.  Dublin City Council made arrangements at that time to relocate the occupants of 30 units comprised of 16 social housing units, seven units occupied under the rental accommodation scheme and seven units of accommodation managed by St. Michael's House.The Housing Department of Dublin City Council subsequently engaged consultant engineers to carry out a detailed investigation of the buildings which identified further and more serious concerns than had been uncovered by any previous inspection.  Since that time the local authority has used the statutory powers available to it to pursue compliance with planning permission conditions and with fire safety and building standards requirements, all of which are at issue in relation to Priory Hall.  Failure by the developer to honour court undertakings to remedy fire safety defects led to the latest High Court proceedings.The legal proceedings in relation to Priory Hall are continuing and it would be inappropriate to anticipate their conclusion.  The overriding priority is to ensure the optimum outcome for the households concerned and to facilitate as early as possible a return to their homes.  In this respect it will be necessary to ensure that these homes are made fit for purpose and that the costs of so doing fall where they should.  I have asked Dublin City Council to do all within its powers to achieve this objective and have asked my Department to continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council in this regard.

In the case of new dwellings (which, since 2001, must be visitable by people with disabilities) there are new requirements in respect of approaches to a dwelling and the widths of internal doors.In the case of buildings other than dwellings, in broad terms, the latest regulations require that all new buildings should be designed and constructed so that people with a range of disabilities can safely and independently approach and gain access to a building, circulate within it and use the relevant facilities within it.  The regulations also apply to the approach and access to, and sanitary facilities in, existing buildings when extended or subject to a material alteration or a material change of use.Building Regulations are subject to ongoing review by my Department working in conjunction with the Building Regulations Advisory Body.  All proposed changes to the Building Regulations are subject to a comprehensive Regulatory Impact Assessment and a detailed public consultation process prior to their being signed into law.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	549	I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 54 together.The Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007 set out a clear statutory framework for construction activity based on:clear legal standards as set out in the Building Regulations;detailed Technical Guidance Documents to outline how these standards can be achieved in practice;the burden and responsibility for compliance resting first and foremost with developers/builders;a statutory responsibility for professionals who are engaged by developers to ensure that construction at least meets the legal minimum standards; andthe responsibility for enforcing compliance with the building regulations resting with the 37 local building control authorities.Where a contract exists between the owner of a building (including a local authority in the case of certain publicly owned buildings) and the relevant builder/developer enforcement may also be a civil matter.Local authorities already have extensive powers under the Building Control Acts which they can use to enforce compliance with the Building Regulations.  However, there is a time limit of five years after a building has been completed during which an enforcement notice may be served by a local building control authority.  The case at Priory Hall demonstrates Dublin City Council's use of its powers to enforce compliance with fire regulations.  Other local authorities have also used the courts to effect compliance with planning permissions, building regulations and fire regulations, all of which are critically relevant to the quality of the built environment.  Results can also be achieved, and often are, through discussion and persuasion with the threat of legal action.Clearly, however, there are steps that can and must be taken to improve compliance with, and oversight and enforcement of, the Building Regulations.  That is why in July 2011 I announced a number of measures to be advanced by my Department and local authorities and which include:(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;(b) the lodgement of drawings at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations;(c) more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective oversight of building activity;(d) standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions;(e) better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.Mandatory certification, lodgement of drawings and improved inspection arrangements as outlined above are key reforms which, I believe, will have the capacity to improve the quality of buildings and will lead to further strengthening of the regulatory regime as early as possible in 2012.  Professionals who are engaged by developers will be required to ensure that construction at least meets the legal minimum standards and there is an urgent need for the construction professions to deliver high standards and professionalism in the construction field.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	550	Part B of the Building Regulations sets out the legal requirements in relation to fire safety in respect of new buildings and in respect of existing buildings undergoing works involving an extension, material alteration or material change of use.  The Part B requirements represent a national statutory minimum standard of fire safety provision and there is no question of variance in the legal requirement as between local authorities.A Fire Safety Certificate is currently required before relevant construction work commences on new or existing buildings and apartment blocks.  The Fire Safety Certificate is issued by the relevant Building Control Authority and certifies that the works or building, if constructed in accordance with the plans and documentation submitted, will comply with the requirements of Part B.  My Department has published technical guidance documents to assist those involved in the design and construction of buildings with regard to compliance with the Building Regulations.  In the case of fire safety, where works are carried out in accordance with the national guidance provided in Technical Guidance Document (TGD) B — Fire Safety (2006), this will, prima facie, indicate compliance with the fire safety requirements of the Building Regulations.Where the TGD B 2006 includes a reference to a technical specification the reference is to the latest edition current at the time of the publication of TGD B.  However, if that version of the technical specification is subsequently revised or updated by the issuing body, the new version may be used as a source of guidance provided that it continues to address the relevant requirements of the Building Regulations.  It is also open to designers to use alternative approaches, premised on the use of fire safety engineering principles, to meet fire safety requirements provided compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations can be demonstrated.The Building Regulations are subject to continuous review and improvement in the light of ongoing technical progress and developments within the construction industry.  In this context, my Department has begun a review of TGD B.  The review of Part B will be subject to a Regulatory Impact Assessment and will be informed by a full public consultation process before any final decisions in the matter are made.

The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting, and other works to secure sites. A provision of €2m has been made for 2012 and my Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.This is part of the overall national effort that I am co-ordinating through the work of the National Co-ordination Committee on Unfinished Housing Developments. This Committee oversees implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group on Unfinished Housing Developments, together with the Government's response to the recommendations. It includes representatives from the Irish Banking Federation, local authorities, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, NAMA and the construction sector.  The Committee is meeting on a regular basis with the aim of publishing a report on progress achieved within the next 12 months.  That report will include an analysis of the way in which the funding provided under the public safety initiative has been applied.

Of this, €1.56m was paid to Kildare County Council in respect of the costs incurred in extinguishing the sub-surface fire which had developed at the site.  Following the completion of the fire fighting activity on 25 February 2011, the fire services passed control of the site to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  The EPA is now using powers under the Waste Management Acts to remediate the site and to put in place appropriate aftercare measures.  A total of €4m was paid from the Environment Fund to the EPA in 2011 to assist in this task.Remedial works are continuing at the site as part of a process that will take a number of years to complete.  Activity in 2012 will involve a detailed site investigation, followed by detailed design of the full remediation works programme. I have made provision for €2.8m from the Environment Fund to support these activities in 2012.  It is not possible at this point to quantify precisely the further funding requirements that will arise, as the costs involved will depend on a range of factors, including the quantities of waste, the approach to remediation required and the results of tendering processes.

Under the Department's Social Housing Investment Programme, local authorities are allocated capital funding each year in respect of a range of measures aimed at improving the quality and standard of local authority social housing stock, ranging from large-scale regeneration and estate-wide improvement works to the retrofitting and refurbishment of individual vacant and occupied units. My Department also provides capital funding to local authorities to assist with the provision of necessary adaptations and extensions to their properties to meet the needs of tenants with a disability.In order to better understand the quality and distribution of the national social housing stock and to facilitate the planning of sound and robust improvement works programmes, my Department, in conjunction with the local authorities, is undertaking an audit of the 130,000 social housing units. This will provide a comprehensive database to inform future targeted interventions aimed at improving the stock.  Last year alone my Department provided over €181 million for the various measures under the improvement works programme.  This year, the total funding available for the housing capital investment programme will be over €390 million. I envisage making announcements shortly in relation to budgets or allocations for the various housing programmes, including the improvement works programme.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	554	The Programme for Government   contains a commitment to complete ratification of the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters. The three pillars of the Convention are partially implemented in EU law by two Directives. The first of these deals with public access to environmental information and was transposed into Irish law through the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 and the European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) (Amendment) Regulations 2011.The second, known as the Public Participation Directive, deals with public participation in decision making and access to justice. Several pieces of legislation have been used to transpose the Public Participation Directive into law. The most recent is the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011, which introduced new cost rules that apply in certain environmental court cases; this Act also implements certain aspects of the Convention that are not implemented by EU Directives.Prior to the ratification of any convention of this nature, Ireland must ensure that its provisions are implemented in national law, a task which has been ongoing for a number of years in relation to the Aarhus Convention.  My Department is currently carrying out a final assessment of all implementation measures, which are already in place, in cooperation with the Office of the Attorney General, with a view to ratifying the Convention as soon as possible. I do not therefore propose to delay any project pending formal ratification.

Decisions in relation to the appropriate levels of staffing for building control purposes are a matter for each County and City Manager who, under section 159 of the Local Government Act 2001, is responsible for staffing and organisational arrangements necessary for carrying out the functions of the local authorities for which he or she is responsible. In this regard, it is a matter for each County and City Manager, in the first instance, to ensure that staffing levels are managed so that the appropriate service level is maintained.   Numbers assigned to building control duties vary depending on the size of the authority and the volume of construction activity; in addition, local authority fire services are involved in the administration of building regulations.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	556	The recommendations contained in the Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group   provide important input to consideration of options for expenditure reduction, revenue raising, efficiency and other policy developments.  I established an independently chaired Implementation Group, in April 2011, to drive forward relevant recommendations of the Report, with a focus on key recommendations that will remove costs and yield early savings.  The Group has met on eleven occasions since June 2011, and its overall work programme is progressing.  It has recently completed an interim report, which I have asked it to develop further, and I expect to receive its finalised report shortly.With regard to the establishment on a regional basis of a single building inspectorate service, I announced, in July 2011, a number of measures to be advanced by my Department and local authorities with a view strengthening the arrangements in place for enforcing compliance with the requirements of the Building Regulations.  In broad terms these measures will involve:(a) the introduction of mandatory certificates of compliance by builders and designers of buildings confirming that the statutory requirements of the Building Regulations have been met;(b) the lodgement of drawings at both commencement and completion of construction, demonstrating how the building has been designed and built to comply with all parts of the Building Regulations;(c) more efficient pooling of building control staff and resources across the local authority sector to ensure more effective and meaningful oversight of building activity;(d) standardised approaches and common protocols to ensure nationwide consistency in the administration of building control functions;(e) better support and further development of the building control function nationwide.The matter is therefore being progressed in the context of the above-mentioned actions being taken at Department and at Local Authority levels to further the development of the Building Control function.

These inspections were carried out in the presence of the owners and their technical advisers and were in the main visual inspections although in a number of units some construction had been opened up.  At a number of locations the construction had been opened to address acoustic problems whereas the objective of the inspections was to establish the extent of compliance with the relevant fire safety certificates.The report indicates that, having regard to the visual inspections, the means of escape layout and fire protection facilities (in terms of mains-powered fire detection and alarm systems) were in compliance with the relevant fire safety certificate as issued by the Building Control authority. While the inspection was limited in terms of the actual construction that could be accessed, the officer reported that the exposed construction was in compliance with the Irish Agrément Board Certificate issued in respect of the proprietary timber-frame construction system in use. The report also indicates that the fire authority followed up with the developer, the designers and the specific timber-frame construction company and that they received documentation showing a continuous audit trail during the construction phase of the Belmayne site.  The report concludes with a statement indicating that the fire authority did not at that time recommend any further action in relation to the Belmayne development.  The report of the fire authority was communicated in a clear and open manner to the residents of the units concerned.However, on 19 January 2012 it is understood that Dublin City Council, through Dublin Fire Brigade, was notified by the developer of a construction defect in some properties at the Belmayne Housing Complex.  The developer, acting responsibly, in consultation with his Fire Engineer consulted the local authority and undertook to carry out remedial works to all affected properties.  The Fire Officer carried out an inspection and determined that the defects now identified raised additional and more serious concerns than had been uncovered by any previous inspection and that remedial action was necessary and timely.  Having regard to a number of alternative fire safety controls within the complex which are all functioning and subject to a regular maintenance programme the Fire Officer was satisfied that evacuation was not called for.Dublin City Council and the Fire Consultants for the developer have agreed on the necessary remedial works — this will involve inserting fire-proof board to seal a 75mm gap in the voids above ceilings and the removal of service ducts to be rebuilt with full fire-proof construction.  Further inspections were carried out on a number of vacant units after which the Fire Officer was satisfied that the remedial works proposed will remedy the defect.   A project manager has been assigned to oversee the works with the assistance of two Superintendent Inspectors (Clerks of Works).  Works on all the affected apartments are expected to be completed within three months.The responsible parties in this case are facing up to their obligations in carrying out remediation works and bearing that cost together with the costs of relocating residents.  This is clearly not a similar situation to Priory Hall.  I am satisfied that the question of Dublin City Council including Dublin Fire Brigade having misinformed the Department in relation to this matter does not arise.  My Department will continue to liaise closely with Dublin City Council in relation to the evolving situation at Belmayne.

In the majority of cases, properties remain in the ownership of the original borrowers.  The remaining properties are controlled by receivers appointed by NAMA.  NAMA's commercial and legal obligations preclude the provision of properties free of charge for social housing purposes.  NAMA is, however, committed to ensuring that provision is made for social housing and that mixed developments are encouraged.The units being advanced through NAMA will, in general, be provided through the social housing leasing initiative under the standard terms and conditions that apply in that scheme. A local authority will have the option of leasing the properties directly from the relevant borrower or receiver. Alternatively, an approved housing body may secure the properties through direct leasing or, in some cases, by purchasing using private or HFA finance and leasing them back to the State.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	559	In terms of the delivery of social housing, the Government's housing policy statement, published in June 2011, clearly identifies that the priority for Government will be to meet the most acute needs of households applying for social housing support. These needs reflect a range of factors including population densities in the larger urban areas.  The financial parameters within which we will have to operate in the coming years rule out a return to very large capital funded construction programmes by local authorities.  Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models, such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	560	I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 138 together.The implementation of the Water Framework Directive requires the extensive monitoring of groundwater quality and the inclusion of programmes of measures in each river basin management plan to ensure continuing improvement in the quality of groundwater. In transposing the Directive, the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010 give legal effect to measures for the protection of groundwater.The Water Framework Directive classification assessments have identified that the main pressures impacting on groundwater quality include the input of nutrients from diffuse sources and, to a lesser degree, historical pollution from industrial activities. Local pollution is considered to be caused primarily by farming activities and the inputs from domestic wastewater treatment systems. Pollution from agricultural sources has been targeted through significant investment by farmers and the State under the Farm Waste Management Scheme and by the implementation of the European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2010. Pollution from domestic waste water systems is being addressed by the requirements of the Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012.Ongoing monitoring of groundwater quality is carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency.  The monitoring includes substances such as ammonium, nitrate and phosphate as well as faecal coliforms and pesticides.  In the report Water Quality in Ireland 2007-2009, the EPA found that overall, in comparison to previous reporting periods, pollution of groundwater was found to have decreased somewhat over the period, with reductions in nitrate and phosphate concentrations.  Regarding faecal coliforms, there has been a decrease in the proportion of samples with detections since the 1998-2000 reporting period; however, this proportion has been increasing slowly since.The Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007-2010 provide for an authorisation system for all wastewater discharges to waters from treatment plants or collection systems owned or controlled by local authorities. The purpose of the authorisation system is to prevent and reduce pollution of waters by waste water discharges. As part of the authorisation process, the EPA can place conditions on the operation of individual plants and systems and it can set emission limit values for the discharges.  In December 2011, the EPA published guidance on the technical assessments that are needed to authorise discharges to groundwater, as a means of satisfying the requirements of the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations, 2010.Over €5.5 billion in Exchequer resources has been invested between 2000 and 2011 in water services infrastructure. In the same period, 341 waste water treatment schemes and contracts have been completed. This has led to an increase in treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of population of almost 3.9 million. Ireland is currently about 93% compliant with the 2005 deadline of the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive requiring secondary treatment for discharges from agglomerations above certain specified size thresholds, compared with 25% in 2000. Current investment plans under the Water Services Investment Plans 2010-2012 will see necessary infrastructure for secondary treatment in larger agglomerations in place by 2015.The Water Services (Amendment) Act 2012 has been introduced to address a European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland in October 2009 regarding domestic waste water treatment systems. I anticipate that the implementation of the new registration and inspection system will also contribute to improvements in water quality.

In May 2011 and again in December 2011 my Department was represented at meetings arranged by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs with a range of interested bodies and service providers at which the current Youth Homeless Strategy was discussed. The various service providers present updated the Department of Children and Youth Affairs regarding the services under their remit in order to inform that Department in terms of their approach to updating or reviewing the Youth Homeless Strategy.My Department understands that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has now engaged the Centre for Effective Services to undertake a high level review of the Youth Homelessness Strategy as a basis for the development of a framework to address youth homelessness over the next 5 years.  My Department will continue to engage as required in respect of any assistance we can offer the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the development of that framework.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	562	I propose to take Questions Nos. 51 and 57 together.We are facing challenging economic times in all areas, including in the community and voluntary sector. There has never been a greater need for us to do more with less. A key principle underlying my Department's activities is that of enabling communities themselves to identify and address social and economic needs and problems in their own areas. There is a particular focus on supporting communities that are vulnerable, disadvantaged or under threat, and an adherence to the values of local participation.  My Department is responsible for a range of programmes and initiatives to support communities including the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP), the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 (RDP), the Scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector and the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising.The Local and Community Development Programme tackles poverty and social exclusion in disadvantaged communities. LCDP is a key tool of Government in providing employment supports, training, personal development/capacity building and other supports for the harder to reach in the most disadvantaged areas in society.  It is a locally accessible, frontline intervention, supporting disadvantaged communities.  As part of the Programme's overall goals, LCDP supports individuals into employment and self-employment through education, training, work experience, job placement, enterprise and the social economy in both urban and rural areas.The 2012 allocation for the LCDP is €54.884 million, which represents a reduction of some €8m on the funding available in 2011.  However, every effort was made to protect the viability of smaller companies.  This is reflected in the lower than average budget reduction of 10% that was applied to these groups.  Despite this reduction, I am confident that the budget allocation will allow for the continuation of important supports for people in disadvantaged communities and will allow for the key, essential, front-line services delivered through the Programme to be maintained for 2012.  The adjustment to the Programme has been structured to protect front-line services and supports at the expense of administration, overheads and ancillary costs.  The annual planning process is currently underway in the Local Development Companies.  I have not been made aware of any services that will cease as a result of the allocations.The Government's commitment to enabling rural communities to become self sufficient has been reaffirmed this year through the increased funding provided to Axes 3 and 4 (LEADER Axes) of the Rural Development Programme (RDP). The RDP's allocation has increased by €34 million this year to a total allocation of €96 million.  The LEADER approach ensures that communities are involved and have a say in their own development choices, thereby reinforcing the sustainability of the interventions funded using this approach. This increased financial allocation is also accompanied by a commitment to ensure that funding delivered through the RDP is efficient, effective and presents good value for money in the current economic climate. This Programme continues to offer significant financial resources to rural communities all over Ireland.At a national level, in 2012 my Department commenced a two and half year scheme to Support National Organisations in the Community and Voluntary Sector. This Scheme provides multi-annual funding to national organisations towards core costs, salary and related overheads, associated with the provision of services. Priority is given under this scheme to supporting national organisations which provide coalface services to disadvantaged target groups.  In 2012 €4m has been allocated to 64 organisations.Last year, I also re-convened the Forum on Philanthropy and Fundraising.  The Forum's view is that the opportunity exists substantially to increase the level of private sector investment in the community and voluntary sector by creating a favourable environment for individual and corporate philanthropy in Ireland, and developing fundraising capacity. Increased investment in the sector will generate increased employment in local communities, build social capital and support the movement for national renewal.The Forum has set out a target to increase philanthropic giving by ten percent year on year in Ireland from its current level of approximately €500m per annum to €800m by 2016. This increased investment in the sector can and should contribute to economic recovery as well as play a significant social role in the community.My Department continues to provide funding and support to the community and voluntary sector and although, in some areas, we have had to reduce the level of funding provided I believe that these initiatives and programmes combined will continue to enable communities to identify and address their own social and economic needs, and allow them to work together to create vibrant and strong communities in Ireland.

The Committee is meeting on a regular basis with the aim of publishing a report on progress achieved within the next 12 months. In the meantime, work is ongoing on implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group and real progress is already being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.While planning authorities are making progress in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions and/or bond holders, thereby obviating the need to use Exchequer resources to fund such work the ongoing work of the Committee includes an assessment of the framework for the operation of bonds. This is taking account of existing legislative provisions, statutory guidance and practical experience in the operation of bonds in order to determine what further policy advice and action are necessary in this regard.  The specific information sought in relation to the number or values of bonds of particular types is not available to my Department.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	564	As part of the Government's Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the 2012 estimates process, difficult decisions have had to be taken in relation to prioritising funding for core services in all programme areas.  The provisional funding estimate to support the mainstreamed drugs projects under my Department's Housing programme for 2012 was €100,000, compared with €400,000 in 2011.  In view of this, my Department informed the relevant local authorities,  Dublin City Council and South Dublin County Council, that it would not be possible to continue funding the relevant projects concerned throughout 2012.  Pro rata funding would be provided for the first quarter of 2012 only, while a consultation process was pursued between the projects, the Councils and other bodies to explore alternative funding mechanisms for the projects for 2012 and beyond.In the interim, and having regard to difficulties identified by the Councils, the projects and other funding partners in ensuring that the relevant drugs projects have sufficient time to identify alternative streams of funding and/or to undertake a reconfiguration of project tasks and priorities, my Department has also agreed to provide additional pro rata funding to support the projects for the second quarter of 2012, i.e. to 30 June 2012, through a transfer of €100,000 within the provisional housing programme estimate for 2012.This funding is being provided strictly on a once off basis and on the clear understanding that it represents an extension of the transitional arrangement only, thereby providing projects with sufficient time to undertake a fully comprehensive consultation to identify future alternative funding mechanisms. It will be a matter for all the public funding bodies, as part of the consultation process, to identify resources to deliver on the overall objectives of the reconfigured projects beyond end June 2012.Furthermore, in the context of a public funding provision of €260 million for drugs programmes across all Departments and agencies in 2011, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy is currently undertaking a review of the structures that underpin the National Drugs Strategy at local, regional and national level, including how the current funding structures can be improved or streamlined, particularly in relation to local and regional drugs task forces.

The Government will continue to review our network of diplomatic missions to ensure that it most efficiently and effectively meets Ireland's needs, consistent with the resources available, including further co-location of Missions, where this may be feasible.I can confirm that the Irish Embassy to Austria and the Permanent Mission of Ireland to the OSCE are already co-located in Vienna. In Belgium, the office of the Permanent Representative to the EU, the Deputy Permanent Representative and the Ambassador to the Political and Security Committee are also co-located.  In addition, the roles of Ambassador to Belgium and Head of Delegation to Partnership for Peace are carried out by the same diplomatic officer.The two offices situated in Northern Ireland perform distinct roles and in both cases are joint institutions established under the Good Friday Agreement; with the British Government in the case of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in Belfast and with the Northern Ireland Civil Service in the case of the North South Ministerial Council in Armagh.In line with the priority my Department attaches to the promotion of Ireland's economic interests abroad, a large number of Missions overseas participate in an ‘Ireland House' arrangement where offices of State Agencies are co-located with Irish Embassies and Consulates. As well as bolstering our effectiveness of promoting trade and investment, these co-location arrangements facilitate co-operation and are cost-effective in terms of managing our scarce resources overseas.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as lone parents who qualify for that increase are not distinguished from other payers of the Universal Social Charge it is not possible to provide a precise estimate of the numbers so qualifying.    However, on the basis of available indicative data, it is tentatively estimated that the numbers of lone parents benefiting from the new exemption limit is of the order of 15,000.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	569	The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty, was signed by Euro Area Member States on 2 February 2012. The original version of the Treaty was signed on 11 July 2011, but it has been modified to incorporate decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government (HoSG) of the Euro Area on 21 July and 9 December 2011, aimed at improving the effectiveness of the mechanism.The ESM Treaty as signed does not have any requirements specifying the method of national ratification. This is a matter for each Member State. My understanding is that the ESM Treaty will enter into force as soon as Member States representing 90% of the capital commitments have ratified it. The ESM will become operational as soon as possible and a target date of July 2012 has been set, which is a year earlier than originally planned.  Primary legislation will be required to enable Ireland to ratify the ESM Treaty and implement its provisions. It is expected that the required legislation will be published this term.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	570	As the Deputy is aware, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks were required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion in 2011, €3.5 billion this year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs. I can confirm to the Deputy that both banks have achieved their 2011 targets.I should stress that the targets are for approvals of credit, targets have not been imposed for drawdowns.  I would point out that the drawdown of funding is at the discretion of the borrower. There are many factors affecting whether or not funding is drawn down, such as changes in market conditions or company restructuring. The recent Mazars Survey of SME Lending, conducted on behalf of my Department, found that the most frequently cited reason for not availing of approved credit was "not needed at present time".In terms of the banks imposing strict conditions on loans, if a borrower believes that a bank has attached terms and conditions to a loan such that the loan cannot be accepted, all borrowers have the right to appeal through the bank's internal loan appeals process and this is the first step that should be taken. If the appeal to the bank is unsuccessful, the Credit Review Office (CRO) will review that decision and make an independent recommendation on the refusal. It is worth noting that, of the appeals made to the office, in approximately half of cases the CRO has recommended that the credit should in fact be granted and I would encourage SMEs that feel they have been unfairly treated to use the services of the CRO.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	571	I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.I assume the Deputy is referring to the European Stability Mechanism. The European Stability Mechanism (ESM) Treaty was signed by Euro Area Member States on 2 February 2012. The original version of the treaty was signed on 11 July 2011, but it has been modified to incorporate decisions taken by the Heads of State or Government (HoSG) of the Euro Area on 21 July and 9 December 2011, aimed at improving the effectiveness of the mechanism.The ESM treaty will enter into force as soon as Member States representing 90% of the capital commitments have ratified it. The Treaty provides that the ESM will have total capital of €700 billion composed of €80 billion of paid in capital with the remaining €620 billion as callable capital. Ireland's share of the paid in capital is 1.592% which requires an actual amount of €1.27 billion, payable in installments starting in July 2012.  This contribution is payable by all ESM members. Membership of ESM requires ratification of the ESM Treaty. Primary legislation will be required to ratify it, and the ESM will become operational as soon as possible and a target date of July 2012 has been set, which is a year earlier than originally planned.The ESM Treaty also provides "that the granting of financial assistance in the framework of new programmes under the ESM will be conditional, as of 1 March 2013, on the ratification of the TSCG by the ESM Member concerned" and on implementation of the balanced budget rule as specified in Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance (TSCG) in the Economic and Monetary Union within the agreed timeline (i.e. one year after entry into force of the TSCG).The linkage between the ESM and the ratification of the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary was accepted in the context of the acceleration into force of the ESM by July 2012. It was of particular importance to a number of partners. It is entirely logical and reasonable that a country receiving the support of its partners under the ESM should be prepared to run sensible budgetary policies as required under the new Treaty.I have clarified that the linkage of both the ESM Treaty and the TSCG refers to new applications for assistance under the ESM and will not affect the transfer to the ESM of undisbursed amounts under the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) for Ireland and other programme countries. The funding approved under the existing Programme of Financial Support for Ireland is not therefore conditional on Ireland ratifying the fiscal compact but, as is currently the case, on Ireland successfully implementing our programme.

As Minister for Finance I announced the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on a non-statutory basis on 7 July 2011.  The Council is part of a wider agenda of reform of Ireland’s budgetary architecture which is envisaged in the Programme for Government and is a requirement of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland.  When establishing the Council, I stated that the Council would be an independent body whose existence and independence would be underpinned by legislation.The Chairman was not interviewed by Oireachtas Committee as a prospective nominee but the Fiscal Council appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 17 November 2011 to discuss their first fiscal assessment report published in October.I appointed the members having regard to a number of criteria including the desirability of having a mix of appropriate backgrounds (academia, the financial sector/financial markets and public finance), macroeconomic/microeconomic expertise and a strong international dimension, as well as the need to take gender considerations into account.  I am satisfied that the appointed members have the mix of skills and experience, including in relation to fiscal affairs, to ensure that the Council will be highly effective in fulfilling its mandate.  The legislation putting the Council on a statutory footing will include provisions for the appointment of members.National Asset Management Agency —Mr John Mulcahy was appointed to the Board of the National Asset Management Agency.  He was not appointed under the new procedures for board appointments as he was an internal appointment from within the National Asset Management Agency.  Mr Mulcahy is head of Asset Management within the National Asset Management Agency.

In so far as the supply of printed matter is concerned, three different rates may apply.  The general position is that books are zero-rated, newspapers and periodicals are subject to VAT at the 9% reduced rate and stationery and other printed matter are liable at the standard rate of 23%.  The 9% reduced rate applies to newspapers and periodicals, including sectoral publications (sports, fashion, etc.), leaflets, holiday brochures, prospectuses, catalogues and maps.It is not possible to inform the Deputy which VAT rate applies to all publications that are used for health promotional campaigns, as the VAT rate applicable depends on the type of printed matter concerned, for example books, periodicals, etc.  I would, however, point out that the fact that the material is used for health promotion does not alter the VAT rate that applies to the printed material.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	574	As a result of the March 2011 PCAR Irish Life & Permanent (IL&P) was required to raise additional capital of €4 billion.  In July 2011 €2.3 billion of this requirement was injected by way of a placing of shares to the Minister for Finance, leaving the State with its current holding of 99.24% in IL&P.  At that time a further €400 million was also injected into IL&P in return for the issue of a Contingent Capital Note to the Minister bringing the total State contribution to €2.7 billion.  During 2011 a further €0.2 billion was met from internal IL&P resources.While the company also completed a liability management exercise which generated additional core tier 1 capital this did not improve the bank's overall capital position due to the existing capital treatment of its investment in the subsidiary Life Company.  After all of these actions the remaining capital requirement for the company is €1.3 billion.  It was previously intended that this remaining capital requirement would be satisfied on completion of a successful disposal of the Group's life assurance subsidiary Irish Life, with any shortfall from the €1.3 billion outstanding capital requirement being provided by the State.The recent Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") dated 10 February 2012, which has been agreed with our External Partners states that the recapitalisation of IL&P will be completed by end-June 2012.  The MOU also confirmed that, following the suspension of the sale of Irish Life, it has been decided that a State acquisition of the company would be the most effective mechanism to complete the recapitalisation and ensure that the separation of IL&P and Irish Life that is already well-advanced is completed.  This approach was approved by Government at its meeting on 6th March 2012 and it is expected that the acquisition will be completed as planned by end June 2012.Irish Life is a valuable asset for the State and will continue to be managed on an independent commercial basis to ensure that value is maintained.  We will continue to work to dispose of Irish Life when market conditions permit.  In relation to the proposed restructuring of IL&P t/a Permanent TSB, as part of Memorandum of Understanding dated 10 February 2012 it was also agreed that the authorities will make a decision on the proposed way ahead for the company by the end of April 2012.  It would be premature for me to discuss possible outcomes at the present time.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	575	The mortgage lenders operating in the Republic of Ireland are independent commercial entities and are subject to compliance with relevant legal, regulatory and accounting requirements.  It is a matter for each institution's Board and management to manage and report on the performance of its mortgage book and other activities of the bank.  This includes estimating impairment charges on their loans in accordance with the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).On 20 December 2011, the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) issued best practice guidelines regarding the policies, procedures and disclosures which the State supported Covered Institutions should adopt for loans and other financial assets that are subject to impairment review in accordance with IFRS.  These guidelines are expected to be substantially implemented by the institutions in their 2011 annual reports.  The guidelines have three principal objectives which are that the Covered Institutions: review and revise their existing impairment triggers for each loan asset portfolio to ensure that a trigger identifies a loss event as early as possible.  This should result in the earliest possible recognition of losses within the IFRS framework; adopt a more conservative approach to the measurement of impairment provisions across all loan portfolios; and significantly improve the number and granularity of their asset quality and credit risk management disclosures.In early 2011, the CBI undertook the Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) and the Prudential Liquidity Assessment Review (PLAR).  The PCAR is an assessment of forward-looking prudential capital requirements, arising under a base case and stress case, with potential stressed loan losses, and other financial developments, over a three year (2011-2013) time horizon.Completing the PCAR/PLAR exercises allowed the CBI to model both balance sheet and profit and loss dynamics in a transparent and conservative manner, offering robust reassurance that the resulting capital requirements are assessed on credible stress modelling.  As part of this assessment, BlackRock Solutions performed an independent estimate of losses to include those which may occur on mortgage portfolios in both base and stress scenarios, based on expectations regarding loan amortization and prepayment, borrower delinquency and default, and loss severity.The CBI's calculation of projected losses under the stress case ensures that banks will hold capital to meet potential future losses, even if they occur in a severely stressed macroeconomic context.  This goes well beyond impairment provisions required under existing accounting standards.  As a consequence, Irish banks have been recapitalised to cover higher target capital ratios set by the CBI, a prudent regulatory buffer for additional conservatism, adverse stress scenario loan loss estimates based on conservative assumptions; and a prudent estimate of losses arising from deleveraging under an adverse stress scenario

It is deeply regrettable, for all concerned, that such action has had to be taken but it is an inevitable consequence of the necessary restructuring of the banking system to render it fit to better serve personal and business customers throughout the economy.  As for any group of workers whose positions are being made redundant, the services of the State will be available to assist them across a range of issues including employment support services, education and training interventions and income maintenance and money advice.  Any such supports will supplement the facilities being put in place by the employer.  The exact nature of the supports will be determined by the particular circumstances.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	578	The Central Bank has advised me that they wrote to all mortgage lenders in 2010 to ascertain whether they were offering, or intended to offer, a mortgage product that would allow home owners to sell their existing home and transfer the negative equity portion of  the original loan to the new loan.  In order to ensure that proposals in relation to such mortgages are consistent with the Central Bank's consumer protection and prudential policy objectives, the proposed criteria for any such facility would need to be agreed in advance between mortgage lenders and the Central Bank.In response to the Central Bank's letter, only a small number of mortgage lenders said that they would consider offering such a facility.  The Central Bank has also advised me that, following the issue of the report of the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group in September 2011, which included a recommendation on trade down mortgages, several lenders have contacted the Bank with regard to offering negative equity mortgages.  This includes trade-up, trade-down and trade-down where the customer is in arrears.In light of this and the initial low level of take up in 2011, the Central Bank has reviewed some of its criteria for negative equity mortgages and recently communicated this revision to the main lenders.  While the provision of negative equity mortgages will facilitate people moving homes and generate transactions in the housing market it is not expected that these would be a large take up of this product.  It still remains that any institution offering such a mortgage facility may do so only in accordance with criteria set out by and with the prior approval of the Central Bank.The Deputy may be aware of the speech given by the Deputy Governor of the Central Bank to the Harvard Business School Alumni Club of Ireland last Friday in which he stated that negative equity mortgages do pose consumer protection issues, as such mortgages may involve a home owner trading up to a larger home and taking on increased debt.  The Deputy Governor also mentioned that the Central Bank was approached by two lenders at the end of 2010 about launching negative equity mortgages.  The Central Bank agreed that these could be developed on a pilot basis, involving guidelines on affordability and the ability to service debt as well as restrictions on marketing.In the light of the very limited take up of these mortgages, under the framework that was agreed and of the potential benefits for facilitating moves and generating transactions in the housing market, the Central Bank has decided to adapt its approach to make provision of negative equity mortgages easier.  The Central Bank has set out for lenders general criteria under which the Bank will consider allowing the provision of such mortgages.  All such mortgage sales must comply with the affordability and suitability provisions set out in the Consumer Protection Code.  A copy of the speech referred to is available on the Central Bank's website.

Testing of software programmes designed to implement the new rate has commenced with some lenders.  There is ongoing contact with all others to ensure changes are implemented as speedily and efficiently as possible.  The speed with which the software changes can be developed and implemented varies from lender to lender.  Revenue is continuing to engage with all lenders to ensure the changes are implemented as soon as possible.  As I previously advised the Deputy, as an interim relieving measure a 25% rate that had previously been tested with lenders has been applied by Revenue since January.

From the details supplied, it appears the Deputy is referring to proof of independent residency to allow a student to be assessed as an independent mature student for grants purposes i.e. to be assessed without reference to parental income.For student grants purposes, students are categorised according to their circumstances either as students dependent on parents or a legal guardian, or as independent mature students.  An independent mature student is defined as a mature student who was not ordinarily resident with his or her parents or legal guardian from the October preceding entry or re-entry to further or higher education.  In order to establish a candidate's status as an independent mature student, documentary evidence is required as proof of a candidate's address from 1 October of the year preceding entry into college.In considering whether a mature student meets the conditions to be assessed independently of his or her parents, awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period has been submitted by the grant applicant.  The documentary evidence normally required includes utility bills, such as telephone, gas or electricity bill, evidence of registration with the Private ResidentialTenancies Board or official documentation received at the address, for example, from a Government Department.In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to produce such proofs of residence in the relevant period for demonstrable reasons, the awarding authority may, at its discretion, agree to accept other documentary evidence that provides an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period.  Individual circumstances should be discussed by an applicant with his or her grant awarding authority.  The awarding authorities are obliged to satisfy themselves beyond doubt that an acceptable degree of proof is submitted by the grant applicant in establishing eligibility under all aspects of the schemes.

However, there is a phased increase in the pupil threshold for the allocation of classroom teachers in small primary schools.  As part of the Budget decisions announced, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014.  The schools concerned are those with four or less classroom teachers.  All schools are being treated equally irrespective of the type of patronage.  The phasing of these measures can provide the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible.  If amalgamations take place, they will be voluntary and follow decisions taken by local communities and not by my Department.This Government recognises that small schools are an important part of the social fabric of rural communities.  They will continue to be a feature of our education landscape.  However, this does not mean that small schools can stand still or never have their staffing levels changed to something that is more affordable and sustainable for these difficult and challenging times.  The teachers in small schools cannot be immune from the requirement that is being asked of all public servants to deliver our public services on a reduced level of resources.My Department has expanded the existing appeals process so that it is accessible to the small schools that are losing a classroom post as a result of the budget measure.  They will not lose their classroom post if any of them are projecting increased enrolments in September 2012 that would be sufficient to allow them to retain their existing classroom posts over the longer term.  The detailed arrangements are set out in the Department's Staffing Circular that is now published on my Department's website.  The closing date for submission of appeals for the April meeting of the Staffing Appeals Board is 23 March, 2012.  The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.All schools have now received their resource teaching allocations for the current school year, based on the number of valid applications for resource teaching support received by the NCSE to 25 November, 2011, and taking into account my Departments Employment Control Framework obligations which limits the number of overall resource teaching posts which may be allocated to schools.  The NCSE recently published statistical information on SNA and resource teaching allocations on a county by county and school by school basis, including in relation to the school referred to by the Deputy, on its website www.ncse.ie.
Where a pupil meets the criteria for Resource Teaching support, following diagnosis or enrolment to a school which does not have any existing allocation of resource teaching support, the NCSE may make an allocation for such pupils from the small pool of remaining posts which have been reserved for such emergencies or eventualities.

On 22nd November 2011, I re-appointed Mr. Connell as chairman until 29th February 2012 in order to allow him time to appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance Public Expenditure and Reform.  Mr. Connell appeared before the Committee on 14th December 2011 and his re-appointment as Chairman has been ratified with effect from the 29th February 2012.Name of AppointeeDate AppointedMr. Turlough O’Donnell, S.C.

(has since resigned)All Members appointed on 1 September  2011The appointments were not made using the new procedures and the previous Chairman was reappointed to the role on the new board.  The reason for not following the new procedures in relation to board appointments is that the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004 states that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (in consultation with Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence) should appoint members of the Board of the Public Appointments Service.The Board is meant to be representative of its client base i.e. (Government Departments and Public Service Bodies).  The majority of the board are therefore   civil or public servants, nominated by the relevant Minister.  There is also a union representative nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU).  I reappointed the outgoing Chairman.  I approved the appointment of the two external members because of their expertise in strategic change and public service recruitment respectively.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21543	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The following appointments were made to State boards:
Forfás
Mr. John Murphy, Secretary General of the Department was appointed to the Board of Forfás with effect from 18 January 2012.The Industrial Development legislation provides that the Director General of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) serves on the board of Forfás. Professor Mark Ferguson therefore became a member of the Forfás Board on taking up his position with SFI with effect from 18th January 2012.  The SFI post is an ex officio appointment provided for in legislation. It has been the custom to appoint the Secretary General of the Department to the board of Forfás for reasons of policy cohesion and corporate governance. As such, the new procedures were not utilized in the case of either appointment.
National Standards Authority of Ireland Board (NSAI)
Helen Curley, a Principal Officer in my Department, was appointed on 8 July 2011.  Ms Curley resigned from the Board on 15 November 2011, as due to an internal transfer she was no longer responsible for the NSAI policy area.Ms Barbara O'Leary and Mr. Terry Landers were appointed on 6 March 2012.  Both appointments were publicly advertised.  Both applied through the advertised process.
 Competition Authority
While it does not have a typical board structure, the Competition Authority consists of a Chairperson and up to four other members who act as an executive board. The Competition Acts 2002 to 2010 set out the requirements pertaining to appointments to the Authority. Chairperson: I re-appointed Mr Declan Purcell as Chairperson of the Competition Authority on 1 July 2011 and following his retirement, I subsequently appointed Ms Isolde Goggin as Chairperson following her selection by the Public Appointments Service (PAS) who publicly advertised this position.  Members: I appointed Ms Noreen Mackey and Mr. David McFadden as temporary members of the Authority in July 2011 and I subsequently re-appointed both from 1st October. On 9th   August 2011, I re-appointed Mr. Ciarán Quigley as a temporary member of the Authority. These temporary appointments were made in accordance with the Competition Acts 2002 to 2010 and did not require to be publicly advertised.Advertisements for three full time members of the Competition Authority were published in June 2011 and following the completion of the PAS selection process for these posts I appointed Mr Stephen Calkins and Mr. Gerald FitzGerald from December 2011 and Mr. Patrick Kenny from January 2011.
Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority
Seven appointments were made to the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA). Mr Dave Martin and Mr. Kevin O'Donovan were both appointed as nominees of the Prescribed Accountancy Bodies on the 26 May 2011. Ms Sylvia McNeece of the Irish Pension Board, Ms Deirdre Behan of the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Mairead Devine of the Central Bank, Ms Marie Daly of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation and Mr. Sean Hawkshaw of the Irish Association of Investment Managers were all appointed as nominees of the Designated Bodies on the 3rd January 2012.  As these appointments were made in compliance with the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Act 2003 it was not appropriate to advertise the posts.
National Consumer Agency
Ms Isolde Goggin was appointed to the Board of the National Consumer Agency in November 2011.  While this appointment was not made using the new procedures Ms Goggin's appointment as Chairperson of the Competition Authority and Chairperson designate of the new body, which will be established on foot of the merger of the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency, reflects the Government's commitment to the rationalisation of State agencies.
PIAB
Two appointments were made to the Personal Injuries Assessment Board (PIAB).  One was the re-appointment of Ms Ann Fitzgerald in her capacity as Chief Executive of the National Consumer Agency, which is a statutory position on the Board.  Therefore the post was not advertised.  In the case of the second appointment, it was considered appropriate to have a representative from the Department on the Board and Ms Breda Power, Assistant Secretary, was appointed. Given the nature of this appointment, the post was not advertised.
Science Foundation Ireland
Dr. Rita Colwell and Professor Martina Newell-McGloughlin were both reappointed to the Board of Science Foundation Ireland with effect from 26th of July 2011. Dr. Colwell and Professor Newell-McGloughlin are internationally renowned scientific experts in the Life Sciences and Biotechnology sectors. As the Minister considered it appropriate to re-appoint them to the Board, the vacancies were not publicly advertised.
InterTrade Ireland
The InterTradeIreland Board expired on the 12th December 2011.   Minister Richard Bruton nominated four new members to that Board. These members included the following: Mr. Martin Cronin Chairman; Mr. Philip Doherty; Mr. Kevin Norton; Ms Mairead Sorenson.   These four members were subsequently appointed to the Board on the 13th December, 2011 by the North South ministerial Council. Mr. Philip Doherty did not take up his membership on the Board, and an alternative is currently being sought.  Both Mr. Brendan Butler and Ms Patricia McKeown who served on the last Board were re-appointed on the 13th December, 2011.
Shannon Development
Mr. Stephen Curran, Principal Officer, was appointed to my Department on 09 January 2012 and was subsequently appointed to the Board of Shannon Development on 23 February 2012. This appointment was a direct replacement of Mr. Bob Keane, Principal Officer, who transferred from the Department to a position in Brussels and subsequently resigned from the Board. This appointment did not fall under the new procedures as Mr Curran is the Departmental representative on the Board.
IDA
I recently made the following two appointments to the Board of the IDA:  Alan W. Gray and Mary Campbell.The Deputy will be aware that Government policy is to introduce greater transparency in the appointment process. In line with this policy and in an effort to broaden the pool of suitable candidates for consideration for appointment to boards, I sought expressions of interest last summer from suitably qualified people for appointment to the boards of several agencies under my Department's remit. I also made it clear in advertising those vacancies that I would not be restricted to only those who responded to the advert. In the case of IDA Ireland, neither appointment was made using the new procedures. Ms Mary Campbell was identified following consultations with IDA Ireland to nominate a person with relevant international financial experience for my consideration for appointment to the Board.I intend to launch another expressions of interest campaign in the near future in respect of further vacancies that have arisen or that are due to arise over the coming months. In this respect, my overriding focus is to find the best people for particular board appointments. In making appointments I will have regard to the expertise and experience of individuals, the balance of skills and attributes in terms of the overall composition of the board, the gender balance of the board and the availability and commitment of people to serve on the board.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21543	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	593	The Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme is to operate under the De Minimis State Aid rules as agreed by the Government in November.  The De Minimis State Aid framework provides a basis for swift implementation of such a Scheme.Operating within the scope of the De Minimis State Aid regulations places limits on the range of options available in terms of the extent and pricing of the support which can be provided. It also places some limitations on the business sectors and loan purposes which the Scheme can support.  Primary production in agriculture, horticulture and fisheries are excluded from the scope of the scheme in the light of particular restrictions under the De Minimis State Aid rules.The relevant regulations are:Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1998/2006 on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty to de minimis aid;Commission Notice on the application of Articles 87 and 88 of the EC Treaty to State aid in the form of guarantees (2008/C 155/02).Furthermore, the Scheme is a targeted intervention to address specific market failure where a business is unable to secure lending due to a lack of security required for conventional collateral based lending.The evidence is that currently, the agricultural sector is not experiencing a significant market failure in relation to collateral based lending in comparison to other industry sectors. The Government agreed that the absence of security was less likely to be an issue in agriculture than in many other sectors, as at least for owner farmers there would be the underlying asset of the farmland and buildings, and thus there would be proportionately fewer agriculture borrowing propositions to which the principal underlying rationale for the Scheme would apply.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21543	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	594	Our commitment to supporting business is particularly evident from the range of initiatives outlined in the Action Plan for Jobs. The Plan tackles the issue of access to finance through a range of measures, such as the introduction of a Micro- Finance Fund to provide loans of up to €25,000 to micro-enterprises and the roll-out of the Temporary Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme.On a practical level, my Department and Enterprise Ireland (EI) will be working closely with the banking sector to assist them in achieving a cultural shift in lending practices towards those companies and sectors that are crucial to economic growth.  In the area of procurement, the Plan includes practical measures such as the strengthening of EI's engagement between SMEs and procuring authorities and a new initiative to encourage contracting authorities to consider more innovative solutions to their procurement needs.Enterprise Ireland (EI) will also have a crucial role in delivering many of the initiatives in the Action Plan for Jobs through delivering supports to drive sales and marketing capabilities, building Leadership and Management Capabilities, embedding Competitiveness Improvements, and providing financial supports.  Under the Action Plan for Jobs, the micro-enterprise supports in Ireland will also be re-shaped to put in place an improved enterprise support structure for small businesses throughout Ireland.  EI will work with the Local Authorities to establish a new network of Local Enterprise Offices (LEOs) in each Local Authority, which will combine the enterprise support service of the previous CEBs and the business support work of the Business Support Units in the Local Authorities.Good progress has also been made by my Department and its Agencies in reducing administrative burdens on business, with a reduction of over 23% already having been achieved. This amounts to an annual saving of over €198 million.  Details of all the initiatives making up this total are available on my Department's website. Work is continuing to identify new areas where administrative burdens on business can be reduced.I am confident that these initiatives combined with the focus that this Government has brought to bear on the issues that are of particular concern for business, will yield real benefit to individual enterprises and the economy as a whole in the short to medium term.

The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseeker's Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.The eligibility to access the National Internship Scheme is based on the overall objective of labour market policy in ensuring a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register. It is important that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register. The structure for achieving this objective is through a reinvigorated National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) which currently provides the framework for engaging with the unemployed.Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy and of the NEAP will be to keep those on the Live Register close to the Labour Market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment. This will ensure that Live Register members availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.For these reasons, it has been proposed as a matter of public policy that eligibility for the scheme be confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the last 6 months.  As such, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it thereby ensuring a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.  My Department continues to monitor and review the operation of the JobBridge scheme including its eligibility criteria on an ongoing basis.  However, there are no current plans to review the 78 days qualifying period.

Those details are updated as required.The Social Welfare Tribunal consists of a Chairperson and four ordinary members, two on the nomination of Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU) and two nominated by Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC).  The positions of the four ordinary members are not subject to the new procedures due to the nature of the work of the Tribunal, as it deals with entitlement to Jobseeker's Benefit or Jobseeker's Allowance in cases where a claim is refused because it is considered to be connected to a trade dispute.  For that reason, the board is made up of individuals who are deemed to be representative of both employers and employees and are nominated by both ICTU and IBEC.  One of the ICTU members of the Tribunal resigned in 2011 and on the nomination of ICTU, a replacement member, Ms Chris Rowland was appointed commencing 24 October 2011.I have made two appointments to the Citizens Information Board since coming into office.

He recently applied for, and has been awarded an increase for a qualified child (IQC) of €29.80 per week, in respect of his dependant grandchild. Arrears of IQC, amounting to €715.20, have been paid.As an alternative to the IQC increase on his State pension, the person concerned may be eligible for a guardian's payment (contributory) if the dependant grandchild is considered an orphan under Section 2(1) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 2005.  The person concerned has been forwarded a claim form for the guardian's payment (contributory).  On receipt of the completed claim form, his entitlement to this payment will be fully examined and he will be notified of the outcome.  In addition, a claim for Child Benefit has been received and is currently being examined.  He will be notified of the outcome in due course.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.The purpose of Rent Supplement is to provide short term income support to assist with reasonable accommodation costs of eligible people living in private rented accommodation who are unable to provide for their accommodation costs from their own resources and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.  Rent supplement is not payable where a person or their spouse or partner is in full-time employment, that is, for 30 hours or more a week.  However, provision was made in 2007 whereby a person in receipt of rent supplement, who is accepted as eligible for accommodation under the rental accommodation scheme, may return to full-time work, subject to a means test, and still be considered for a rent supplement payment.Rent supplement is normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution which recipients are required to pay from their own resources.  The weekly minimum contribution is €30 for a single adult household and €35 for coupled households.  Many recipients pay more than this amount because recipients are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic SWA rate towards their accommodation costs.Where a person has additional income in excess of the standard weekly rate of SWA, the first €75 of such additional income together with 25% of any additional income above €75 is disregarded for means assessment purposes.  This means test ensures that those returning to part-time work (up to 30 hours a week or full-time for those accepted as having a housing need under RAS) or participating in training schemes are better off as a result of taking up such an opportunity.  Gross income less PRSI and reasonable travel expenses are taken into account for the means test.  Other necessary expenses may be allowed in the case of self employment.  However, the assessment does not allow for deductions in respect of repayments on loans.There are many factors which determine rent supplement entitlement, including the number of hours worked, the level of earned income and any social welfare payments or whether the rent payable is within prescribed limits.  As such, based on the example outlined by the Deputy, it is not possible to say for certain if the household would qualify for a rent supplement payment.

I am further advised as the management targets have not been exceeded netting remains suspended under the requirements of the 2010 regulations and in line with the conservation imperative.I am also informed that the Rivers Finn and Foyle are not closed to angling.  However, in the current circumstances, the 2010 regulations require the Agency to restrict to "catch and release" basis to minimise mortalities.  Any plans to reopen the Rivers and a prospective timeframe for same would be dependant on the management targets being achieved and I am advised that the Loughs Agency is keeping matters under ongoing review.

The Programme includes contracts under construction and to commence to the value of some €130 million in Co. Galway during the period of the Programme.  However, the Laurencetown Sewerage Scheme was not amongst the priority contracts and schemes selected for inclusion in the current Programme.The Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and support economic and employment growth.  A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Galway County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in the Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that were more strategically important at that time.Progress under the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012   was reviewed in mid-2011 and through this process, consideration was given to any newly emerging priority contracts and schemes submitted by local authorities for addition to the Programme.  No proposal for the Laurencetown Sewerage Scheme was received from Galway County Council in response to the review.

The main objectives of the RDP are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy. The RDP is designed to address directly many of the challenges facing rural communities including the need to increase economic activity and stimulate job creation; improve access to basic services for rural dwellers and encourage rural tourism based on sustainable development of natural resources. The programme is inclusive in its approach to arriving at solutions to such challenges using a "bottom up method" where local communities provide local solutions.In general, the rates of grant aid available under the measures of the RDP are 50% for private promoters and 75% for Community promoters with some higher rates available for specific activities such as Training (100%) and Analysis and Development (90%). In recent times, due mainly to the current economic climate, it has been difficult for private individuals and community groups to obtain the matched funding required to avail of this support level, particularly for larger projects. In an effort to address these and other issues my Department is preparing proposals for a  suite of measures relating to the delivery of the RDP which have to be submitted through the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine, to the European Commission for approval. It is likely to take some time for the proposals to be considered and decisions made.The results of this approval process will be communicated to all Local Development Companies (LDCs) as soon as it is available. In the meantime, there is a provision of €96m in my Department's 2012 budget for the RDP which LDCs have at their disposal to spend in line with the requirements of the programme.

The agreement provided that by the end of 2002, 95% of all domestic laundry detergents marketed in Ireland should be zero-phosphate. This target was substantially achieved — figures submitted by ICDA at that time indicated a market share of between 93% and 94% for phosphate free products.The Chemicals Acts 2008 and 2010, for which the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise, and Innovation has responsibility, provide for the implementation and enforcement in Ireland of a number of directly applicable European Regulations, including the Detergents Regulation.  An amendment to the Detergents Regulation has been adopted by the European Parliament and by the European Council and will be published shortly in the Official Journal of the European Union, from which date it will become binding on member states.  The amending Regulation, which effectively supersedes the voluntary agreement, restricts the use of phosphates and other phosphorus compounds in domestic laundry detergents and will be applicable from 30 June 2013.It is estimated that the total load of phosphorous from household detergents entering Ireland's rivers and lakes is a relatively small proportion (less than 1%) of the total load from all sources.  The most recent (2010) data available indicate that there has been a 66% reduction in phosphorous loading entering the sea from our major rivers, compared to the average loading entering the sea for the period 1990-1997.

Under the legislation, an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January 2012 is liable to pay the household charge by 31 March 2012, unless otherwise exempted or entitled to claim a waiver.Section 1 of the Act provides a definition of "owner" for the purposes of the Act which, in relation to a residential property, means—(a) a person (other than a mortgagee not in possession) who—(i) in the case of a residential property that is let under a lease or held under a tenancy for a term not exceeding 20 years, is entitled to receive the rent under that lease or tenancy whether in his or her own right or as trustee or agent for another person, or(ii) in the case of a residential property that is not so let or so held, would, subject to paragraph (b), be so entitled if the residential property were so let or so held, whether in that person’s own right or as trustee or agent for another person,or(b) where the property is let under a lease or held under a tenancy for a term exceeding 20 years, the person (other than a mortgagee not in possession) who is the lessee under that lease or tenant under that tenancy.Section 2 of the Act specifies what is residential property for the purposes of the legislation. While the Act places the household charge under the care and management of the local authorities, and application in particular circumstances is a matter for the relevant local authority, the charge is on a self assessment basis, and interpretation of the legislation is a matter for legal advice in individual cases and ultimately a matter for the Courts.

Under section 5(1) of the Act, the owner of a residential property, who on a liability date, is liable to pay a household charge to a relevant local authority, or who is entitled to a waiver from payment of a household charge under section 4(4), must make and provide to the relevant local authority a declaration stating that he or she is so liable or so entitled, as the case may be.  Under section 5(2) of the Act, the declaration must, in the case of a person who is liable to pay a household charge, be accompanied by payment of the household charge in respect of the property concerned.Article 5(2) of the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 requires a household charge declaration to contain information, including the personal public service number of the person who, in the case of an individual, is the owner of the property, or the tax reference number of a company which is the owner of the property.  These numbers are required for identification purposes, particularly in the context of owners of residential property with similar names located in close proximity.

Unfinished housing developments were divided into four categories as follows:Category one, where the development is still being actively completed by the developer, or where no serious public safety issues exist;Category two, where a receiver has been appointed;Category three, where a receiver has not been appointed and the developer is still in place but effectively inactive; andCategory four, where the development has been effectively abandoned and is posing serious problems for residents.Other relevant factors for the purposes of the categorisation process include, inter alia:the state of completion of roads, footpaths, public lighting, piped water and sewerage facilities and open spaces or similar amenities within the development;the extent to which the development complies with the terms of applicable planning permission;the extent to which it complies with the provisions of the Building Control Acts 1990 and 2007;the provisions of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1964 as they pertain to dangerous places and dangerous structures within the meaning of the Act;the extent to which facilities within the development have been taken in charge by the local authority concerned; andwhere there is an agreement regarding the maintenance of such facilities, the extent to which this agreement has been complied with.This categorisation formed the basis for the list of those unfinished developments eligible for a waiver on the annual household charge. Only households in developments in categories three and four are eligible for the waiver from payment of the household charge.  This list of developments in which households are eligible for the waiver in 2012 is set out under the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	632	The Local Government (Household Charge) Act 2011 and the Local Government (Household Charge) Regulations 2012 provide the legislative basis for the household charge.  The household charge is on a self-assessment basis and it is a matter for an owner of a residential property on the liability date of 1 January, 2012 to determine if he/she has a liability and, if so, that person is required to declare that liability and to pay the household charge by 31 March, 2012.Significant efforts are being made to ensure that property owners are aware of the household charge and the requirements to make a declaration of liability and to pay the charge by 31 March, 2012.  The Local Government Management Agency (LGMA), which is administering the household charge on behalf of local authorities, and local authorities have commenced a national information campaign to advise people of their responsibilities in relation to discharging their liability to the household charge.  A similar and successful advertising and information campaign was undertaken in the context of the €200 charge on non-principal private residences on its introduction in 2009 with further advertising taking place each year since.A household charge information leaflet is being issued to residential properties in the State and radio advertising campaigns and interviews, including adverts on social media and other websites together with other appropriate communication measures and initiatives are being undertaken in the period up to the payment date of 31 March, 2012.  I am confident that those liable to the household charge will be aware of their obligation to discharge their liability for the charge by completing the requisite declaration form and paying the household charge by 31 March 2012 and thereby avoiding any late payment fees or late payment interest.My Department and the LGMA are engaging with the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in the context of data sharing generally for the purposes of the household charge.  This includes considerations surrounding the use of contact details obtained for the purposes of the charge on non-principal private residences (NPPR) in the context of the household charge.

Any future changes to legislation governing affordable housing schemes will be informed by that review which will shortly commence.  My Department recently commenced collating data in respect of local authority mortgage arrears.  The latest data available, to end September 2011, show that some 28% of all local authority mortgages are in arrears of 90 days or more.  A breakdown of this data by house purchase scheme (e.g. shared ownership, affordable housing, tenant purchase etc.) is not available.Under the Shared Ownership scheme the rent charged on the local authority's equity in a shared ownership transaction is to cover the funding costs to the Housing Finance Agency which are based on borrowings at the prevailing interest rates.  Any difference between the rent and prevailing interest rate is reflected in the capital outstanding on the property, i.e. if the rent charged in any period is greater than the prevailing mortgage interest due on the local authority's share the purchase price of the outstanding equity will be reduced accordingly.

The CAFE Directive consolidated and replaced the earlier Air Quality Framework Directive and the first three so-called "daughter" directives.The CAFE Directive has been transposed into national legislation by the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2011.  These regulations set limit values/target values for the following pollutants:Sulphur Dioxide;Nitrogen Dioxide and Oxides of Nitrogen;Particulate Matter (PM10 and PM2.5);Lead;Benzene;Carbon Monoxide; andOzone.In addition, the Arsenic, Cadmium, Mercury, Nickel and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in Ambient Air Regulations 2009 transpose the fourth "daughter" Directive 2004/107/EC and specify target values and monitoring requirements for arsenic, cadmium, mercury, nickel and polycyclic hydrocarbons.The EPA publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being the report, Air Quality in Ireland 2010 — Key Indicators of Ambient Air Quality,   published in September 2011.  This report provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2010 based on data from 28 monitoring stations.  The Report confirmed that air quality in Ireland continues to be good and remains among the best in Europe.  In 2010, measured values for the above mentioned pollutants were all below limit and target values set out in legislation.  On the issue of groundwater pollutants, I refer to the reply to Questions Nos. 49 and 138 on today's Order Paper.

My Department supports fire authorities through setting of general policy, training support and issue of guidance on operational and other related matters, and the provision of capital funding.The cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford have full-time fire services, and Drogheda and Dundalk have a combined full-time and retained service.  Fire services in all other communities are provided by the retained system where, in the event of an emergency call, the relevant group of fire-fighters are alerted, respond to their fire station and turn-out to the incident in their fire appliance.  The retained services provide an excellent model of service delivery where, to a substantial degree, a contingent rather than continuous capability is required. I have no plans to change fundamentally what I regard as an excellent community service delivered by the local authorities.Nonetheless, there is a constant need for progress with all services.  The Irish Fire Services National Development Framework 2010-2015 (available at www.environ.ie) sets out a national blueprint and programme for developing and improving the efficiency and effectiveness of Fire Services.  It sets out key actions in a number of areas, and these are being progressed in a collaborative fashion between the local authorities and the National Directorate for Fire and Emergency Management in my Department.

The Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing.  Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition.  There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA).My Department does not hold information on the number of households on local authorities' waiting lists.  This figure continuously fluctuates as households are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support.  Detailed information on the latest statutory assessment of housing need carried out in March 2011, including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department's website —www.environ.ie or on the Housing Agency’s website at www.housing.ie.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	641	The Government's Housing Policy Statement, published in June 2011, identifies approved housing bodies (AHBs) as key partners in the delivery of social housing.  This recognises both the constrained funding levels available for local authority construction programmes and the capacity and track-record of the voluntary and cooperative housing sector.AHBs are uniquely placed to help drive the achievement of the housing supply responses set out in the policy statement.  However, the move from capital funded programmes of construction and acquisition by approved housing bodies to more revenue funded options presents challenges for them.  As such, I intend to develop an enabling regulatory framework for the sector that will provide support and assurance both to the sector itself and to its external partners as it takes on the expanded role envisaged for it in the policy statement and to underline its status as a viable and attractive investment opportunity for financial institutions.I will develop this framework in consultation with the sector but I expect that it will:assist approved housing bodies to develop key governance and management structures to facilitate an expanded remit;provide independent scrutiny and validation of such bodies' competences; andplace sustainable housing management policies and practices at the heart of a coordinated approach to the development of the sector.The development of such a regulatory framework which is both robust and harmonised with the varying capacities of individual AHBs will take some time.  In the interim my Department is actively working with the sector on the development of a voluntary code which I expect most bodies will endorse.  This code, which should be finalised and agreed in the coming months, will serve as a learning opportunity for the sector and for my Department as we develop a longer-term statutory framework that will best support the enhanced role of AHBs.  I expect that the code will set out, inter alia, key basic principles of good governance and financial management and will also set out the range of reporting obligations that currently apply to the sector.

The case taken by the European Commission against Ireland for failure to transpose the ELD by the required deadline — 30 April 2007 — was discontinued by the Commission on 19 February 2009, following the transposition of the Directive in Ireland by way of the 2008 Regulations.  The European Commission had previously issued a letter of formal notice to Ireland on 31 May 2007, followed by a reasoned opinion on 31 January 2008.While the 2008 Regulations fulfil our transposition requirements, there are a number of discretionary provisions in the Directive which Ireland can choose to transpose if we wish, for which primary legislation will be required.  My Department is currently working with the Office of the Attorney General to draft an Environmental Liability Bill to deal with the discretions that Ireland is proposing to adopt.To ensure transparency in the requirements of the legislation, the Environmental Liability Bill will give effect to all of the Directive; this will mean revoking the Environmental Liability Regulations and transposing the Directive in its entirety, including the discretions, in primary legislation.  The Bill is due to be published by the end of this year.

Of course, I do appreciate that in the current economic climate, the challenges faced by retailers who struggle to maintain profitability, bring into ever sharper focus the losses that can be incurred through fraudulent activity.We know that transactions carried out on-line, generally referred to as Card Not Present transactions, do present an added risk to the retailer given neither the presence of the card nor the cardholder, and the fact that a PIN is not used.  I am informed by the Garda authorities, that the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation (GBFI), for its part, regularly offers crime prevention advice in regard to Card Not Present fraud as crime trends in this area demand or necessitate, with information provided to alert retailers, industry and the public in general. In addition, initiatives targeting those involved in this type of criminality are frequently undertaken by GBFI.The Payment Card & Counterfeit Currency Unit (PCCCU) at GBFI is the designated National Unit with primary responsibility for the investigation of Payment Card Fraud in all its guises. Members of the PCCCU work closely with  Europol and other European and international law enforcement agencies in targeting groups that are involved in this type of criminality.  Nationally, the PCCCU liaises directly with the industry through the Irish Payment Card Services Organisation (IPSO) and the Irish Banking Federation (IBF). The PCCCU also works in close association with the National Crime Prevention Office in raising public awareness and delivering crime prevention advice.I am also informed that the card payments industry, together with GBFI, continues to promote the use of security features / authentication systems among on-line retailers as a proven tool to reduce both losses and risks to the retailer.  Of course, retailers must be proactive in this regard and ensure that they avail of all the security and fraud prevention methods that are available.   Where fraud does occur it should be brought to the attention of the Garda authorities.More generally, I should mention that as part of the White Paper on Crime process, which is under way at the moment, there has been extensive consultation on a range of matters including fraud and best practice in crime prevention. The outcome of the consultation process will be reflected in the proposed White Paper, which will set out the overall policy framework for future strategies to combat crime.

These discrepancies have now been rectified. However, a further query has arisen in relation to the issue of the organic licence which is a condition of participation in the scheme. A letter has issued to the person named requesting that this point be clarified. Once resolved, the application of the person named will be processed without further delay.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	658	I am aware of the concerns currently being expressed by the pig production sector, particularly in relation to feed costs and the availability of credit. The pig sector remains the third largest individual component of the agri-food sector, with production, prices and exports all growing significantly during 2011.  Notwithstanding this, high feed costs, most notably cereals and compound feed remain an issue. Pig producers are especially affected by the increase in cereal prices since June 2009, given that cereals account for 70% of feed.Prices of pigmeat and of course feed are ultimately determined by demand and supply considerations. For my part, I will ask my officials to continue to explore with the European Commission all available market supports when circumstances require them, to ameliorate the worst effects of price volatility. Indeed last year's Aid to Private Storage Scheme for pigmeat played a significant role in putting a floor under pigmeat prices at that time. This, together with release of cereal stocks from intervention, improved the situation somewhat at that time.I have held a number of meetings with representatives from the Irish Banking Federation to discuss the issues of credit and financing difficulties and have asked my officials to arrange a further meeting as soon as possible.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies will continue to work closely with the industry to ensure that it can continue to develop and grow in accordance with the targets in the Food Harvest 2020 Report.

I have no role in identifying new sites for razor clam fisheries, or indeed fisheries for any other fish species.In order to fish for razor clams, a vessel must be registered in the polyvalent or specific segments of the fleet.  Generally speaking, no additional consents are required from my Department at this time, though regulations may be introduced, as necessary, to ensure the conservation and rational exploitation of the stock or compliance with EU law.  Certain regulations apply at present in relation to fishing for razor clams in Rosslare Harbour, Co. Wexford and in the area of Cahore, Co. Wexford.  Regulations may also be introduced, as necessary, to protect designated habitats and species in Natura 2000 sites.  Such regulations apply at present in relation to fishing for razor clams in Dundalk Bay, Co. Louth.Under European food safety law, harvesting of shellfish for placing on the market must only take place from classified production areas. The Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority is the Competent Authority under Irish and European Food Safety legislation for the classification of live bivalve mollusc production areas.  I have no role in relation to this process and, by law, the SFPA is independent in the performance of its functions.  I have forwarded this question to the SFPA for direct reply in relation to this issue.

These are the Adoption Authority of Ireland (AAI), the Family Support Agency  (FSA), the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) and the Ombudsman for Children.  With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the children detention schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001.In line with the Government Decision of April 2011, on my Department's website I have invited expressions of interest from persons interested in being appointed to the Boards of State Bodies and Agencies operating under the Department's aegis. The notice indicates the vacancies in the boards of the respective bodies. My officials acknowledge all expressions of interest received and maintain a database of those expressions. In making my decisions on appointments to Boards, subject to the governing legislation, I consider the most suitable persons for the positions available with due regard to the body or agency in question and its particular responsibilities and I seek to ensure that the appropriate mix of skills and experience is in place to achieve the best result.  In relation to the NEWB, there have been four appointments to the Board since my appointment as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs,  Mr. Brendan Broderick, Mr. Eamonn Flynn, Mr. Ruairí Gogan and Mr. Bob Dowling.I have made one appointment to the Board of the AAI since my appointment namely Dr. Imelda Ryan. There is no Board for the Ombudsman for Children's Office.In relation to the FSA, there have been ten members appointed to the Board since my appointment as Minister, namely Sharon Foley, Dick Hickey, Catherine Hazlett , Marie Fenlon, Yvette O'Malley (resigned 10 November, 2011), Liz Chaloner, Nuala Ryan, Imelda Martin, Caroline Murphy and Dr. Nollaig Byrne.  Earlier today the Chairperson Designate, MsSharon Foley, appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.With effect from 1 January 2012, I have taken responsibility for the children detention schools as provided in Part 10 of the Children Act 2001. I  am in the process of making appointments to the Board of Management of the schools and will announce the full Board when all members have been appointed.  The term of the previous Board expired in October 2011 and the vacancies for the current Board are currently listed on my Department's website.  Earlier today the Chairperson Designate, Mr. Joe Horan,  appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children.I hope to hear from the Chairman of the Committee shortly as to the outcome of these meetings with Ms Foley and Mr. Horan before I proceed with these appointments. The new arrangements introduced by this Government with regard to the availability of designated candidates for interview by Oireachtas Committee will apply as appropriate in the case of Chairpersons of Boards and I can confirm that there have been no situations in my Department where this process has not occurred.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	661	The Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free pre-school year to all eligible children in the year before commencing primary school.The programme includes a number of additional provisions to take account of children with special needs.  These include an exemption from the upper age limit for qualification under the programme where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from starting primary school at a later age.  In addition, children with special needs can apply to have the pre-school year split over two years on a pro-rata basis, for example availing of the programme for 2 days a week in the first year and for 3 days a week in the second year.  Application for these exemptions must be made prior to the child commencing the programme.  As the child in question is availing of the full free pre-school complement in this academic year, there is no further entitlement under the ECCE programme.Funding is also provided by my Department to support the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme which enables community-based childcare services to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.  For the purpose of the CCS programme, disadvantage and low income are determined by reference to a range of means-tested allowances and payments including receipt of a social welfare payment, Family Income Supplement (FIS) and qualification for a medical or GP visit card.  Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, parents with middle incomes may also benefit from subvention.Parents who consider that they qualify for support under the this programme should contact their local City/County Childcare Committee to establish exactly what participating community facilities are available in their area.

You will be aware that I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	667	I propose to take Questions Nos. 176 and 198 together.The IMB, the competent authority for the implementation of EU and national legislation relating to medical devices, including breast implants, has been in contact with national health authorities across Europe on this issue including the French Regulatory Authority (AFSSAPS). National health authorities across Europe have met via the Health Threats Unit of the EU's Health Security Committee and from January the European Commission set up an expert committee (the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly identified Health Risks (SCENIHR)) which provided a rapid scientific opinion on the safety of the PIP silicone implants and proposed further work to establish "the health risks, if any, that may be associated with PIP silicone breast implants".As information on PIP implantation worldwide and within the European Community emerges, my Department and the IMB are continuing to review advice for recipients of PIP implants and any issues of concern will be communicated immediately.  To date the advice remains consistent: that there is no evidence of increased risk of cancer for women with this brand of implant and the risk of rupture remains within expected nor Ms Anyone with a concern about their breast implants should discuss the matter with their GP and/or surgeon.As you may be aware, approximately 1,500 Irish patients have received PIP breast implants at three centres in Ireland. The IMB has been in regular contact with the three centres and instructed all three to contact their clients on the matter and to reiterate its continuing advice: "that there is no current evidence of health risks associated with PIP implants". Although, as Minister for Health, I do not have a remit at present over the private health care sector, I expect that any private hospital in Ireland which provided a PIP breast implant procedure would provide for its removal should that course of action be recommended for a woman after consulting with her surgeon.To that end, the Chief Medical Officer of my Department has written to the three clinics involved in providing the implants and it is intended to meet with them this coming Friday, 9th March, 2012.  Due to the number and variety of queries raised by both providers and patients my officials would like to tease out the issues raised with a view to ensuring that concerned clients receive appropriate aftercare and management in accordance with normal standards of good professional practice. Following consideration of all the issues, my officials will be in touch with the group concerned to arrange a meeting.  I must reiterate that my Department and the IMB continue to liaise with the EU Scientific Committee's Health Threats Unit which is maintaining the up-to-date position on the issue for all Member States.

These services are delivered through the HSE's network of local offices, via Public Health Nursing, Day Care Centres and Public and Private Residential Care Facilities and where appropriate, Psychiatry of Old Age teaMsThe HSE also funds non-governmental agencies to provide a range of services under section 38 of the Health Act (2004).  In addition a limited number of memory clinics and specialist services are available.It is not possible to state exactly what the volume of community services is as data relating to service provision is not collated in a way that identifies dementia specific services.  It is estimated that 63% of all long-stay residents have dementia (Cahill, O'Shea and Pierce 2012).The families and carers of people with Dementia can access a number of services through their primary care team or HSE funded services such as those provided by the Alzheimer's Society of Ireland. Respite services are the most common request and this is provided in a number of ways i.e. through the provision of a Home Care Package to support respite in a persons own home, or through day respite within dementia specific or generic day care centres. Respite is also provided in residential homes.   In addition carer support groups have been established across the country, details of which can be obtained from local Primary Care Teams.The Deputy will be aware that the Programme for Government gave a commitment to develop a  National Strategy on Dementia by 2013   which will increase awareness, ensure early diagnosis and intervention, and enhance community based services for people living with this condition.    The first stage of the process, which was to assemble the research and evidence upon which the policy will be developed, was recently completed.  The findings of the review were published and presented to Minister Reilly.  The report is available at www.doh.ie.

While issues relating to carers span a number of different Departments, the Taoiseach has allocated responsibility for co-ordination of the preparation of the Strategy to me with the support of the Minister for Social Protection.The Strategy will address the needs of informal and family carers. It will be conceptual and visionary and will establish a number of high-level principles, goals and objectives and a road map to implementation.   The State already faces challenges in maintaining existing levels of services from within limited resources and the Strategy is being developed in that context. The Strategy will not be an operational plan but will set the strategic direction for future services and supports for carers in recognition of their role and contribution to maintaining children, adults and older people with physical or mental health difficulties in their own homes.Work on developing the Strategy is ongoing and a consultation process with other Departments is currently taking place. It is hoped that a draft will be completed by the end of March 2012 as a basis for final consultation prior to submission to Government and publication.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	682	This is a very challenging year given the extreme financial pressures we face as a country.  However, all services must live within their allocated budget. The HSE has taken steps to provide as high a level of protection as possible for the funding of the children's hospitals.  The budget adjustment to Children's University Hospital, Temple Street was significantly less than the average in the HSE Dublin Mid-Leinster Service Plan 2012. HSE management are in discussions with CUH Temple Street towards agreeing a cost containment plan and will meet with CUH Temple Street next week to further discuss the plan.The HSE Service Plan for 2012 has set a target for children's hospitals which requires that no child should be waiting for treatment for more than 20 weeks by the end 2012.  The hospital is actively engaged with the HSE, the SDU and the NTPF to ensure that this target is met.  The Paediatric Hospitals work together as a unified network   under the leadership of  the Clinical Director to ensure optimisation of resources and facilities. The Paediatric Hospitals remain cognisant at all times of the challenges facing their young patients and of the need to support families. The HSE will continue to work with the children's hospitals to ensure that all patients receive appropriate care and that all emergencies are dealt with immediately.  The HSE will also continue to monitor activity to ensure the optimum use of theatre resources and facilities.I have emphasised the need to ensure that the impact of any changes to patients is minimised and that all changes are fully communicated.  All measures will be reviewed regularly to ensure the least impact on patients and service users.  Patient Safety remains my first priority.

In 2011, a total of 1.68 million personal assistant/home support hours were provided to 11,571 persons with physical and/or sensory disability. Although the funding allocated to disability services has been cut by 3.7%, the HSE aims to maintain this level of service in 2012. Service efficiencies will be achieved through a process of negotiation with service providers around the unit cost of providing the service rather than reducing the number of personal assistant hours.  My Department has asked the Health Service Executive to reply directly to the Deputy in relation to the individual named in the attached correspondence.

In this regard I have established the Special Delivery Unit (SDU), which will work to unblock access to acute services by dramatically improving the flow of patients through the system, and by streamlining waiting lists, including referrals from GPs. The SDU is working closely with its partner agencies — mainly the HSE and the NTPF.As a priority, public hospitals were instructed to ensure that, by the end of 2011, they had no patients waiting more than 12 months for treatment.  I can confirm that the vast majority of hospitals achieved this objective.  During 2012 the SDU will support hospitals in the delivery of a 9 month maximum wait time for inpatient or daycase surgery.  As this is a service matter, it has been referred to the HSE for direct reply. Should the patient's general practitioner consider that the patient's condition warrants an earlier appointment, he/she would be in the best position to take the matter up with the consultant and facility involved.

I believe we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us.The work of the Special Delivery Unit, together with implementation of the Clinical Care Programmes in the HSE, will help to improve the efficiency of our hospitals, allowing us to treat as many patients as possible within budget.  In the current economic climate the acute sector must reduce its costs in order to deliver the agreed level of activity within the resources available to it. The emphasis in 2012 will continue to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter lengths of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery.  In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it provides safe, effective and efficient care to the maximum number of patients withoo.The decision to open and close beds is made at hospital management level and approved by the Regional Director of Operations.  In relation to the specific information sought by the Deputy, as these are service issues they have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.

Since my Department advertised new procedures for appointment to boards on Friday 8th April 2011, all appointments from that date have followed these procedures. However, given the importance of ensuing the right mix of skills and experience on every board, appointments are not necessarily confined to those who have made an expression of interest.In total there have been 63 appointments made to boards under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport during my term as Minister. Of these 36 were new appointments and 27 were re-appointments. Of the 27 reappointments, 8 related to members of the Advisory Committee of the National Transport Authority. These individuals were reappointed pending the completion and implementation of the Taxi Review Group's work. Of the 36 new appointments, 14 of the appointments were from applications received arising from the publically advertised process.The new arrangements in relation to appearance before the Joint Oireachtas Committee only apply to Chairpersons.  Nine Chairpersons whom I have appointed have appeared before the Committee on Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht. The only exception is Mr. Tom Wall, was appointed as Chairperson of the RPA on an interim basis until 18 April 2012 pending the merger of the RPA and the National Roads Authority. Given the short nature of his appointment, it was not considered necessary for him to appear before the Committee. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, prior to the appointment of a new Chairperson they will appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee.

Only then can either system be utilised effectively.  As bicycles do not have registration numbers and cyclists are not required under law to carry identification, it is not possible to bring such offences within the scope of the fixed charge system. Given that we are seeking to encourage an increased level of cycling amongst the population at large, I am not convinced that mandatory registration of cyclists, or requiring cyclists to carry identification is an appropriate measure to introduce.However, section 108 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended) gives a member of the Garda Síochána the power to demand the name, address and date of birth of a pedal cyclist intercepted while committing a road traffic offence. The Garda may seize the bicycle if he or she suspects that false or misleading information is being given to them.  A summons can then be served on the cyclist to appear in court in respect of the alleged offence.  Section 102 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (as amended) provides for a maximum fine resulting from a conviction for such offences of €1,000 for a first offence, or €2,000 for a second or subsequent offence. If a third or subsequent such offence is committed within 12 months, the person is liable to a possible prison sentence of up to three months.

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2012-03-08 00:00:00	Prelude	697	I am committed to exploring a range of mechanisms to seek to secure public bikes schemes in other cities, including Galway. My Department and the National Transport Authority are currently considering the findings of  analysis undertaken  and  the outcome of symposiums held  in November including how to address key issues identified. For example, while a scheme in  a city such as Galway is technically feasible, its commercial viability would require a collaborative approach with the private sector.Funding provision to meet the capital investment costs of a scheme has been identified within the 5-year allocation for Smarter Travel and Carbon Reduction Measures Capital funding. However, operational funding is not available from within the constrained current funding allocations. Options to meet operating costs of a scheme include, for example, potential funding that could be unlocked by Galway City Council through the provision of additional advertising space in the city. However,  the potential and extent of funding from advertising requires further examination. Also a sponsorship deal could prove to be very attractive for a private sector organisation and could include advertisements on the bikes, naming rights etc. Participation in Galway bikes could be a wonderful opportunity for the right partner to get involved and share in the success of smarter travelling in the city. Optimal procurement approaches will be determined in the context of the best mechanisms to bridge the operational funding gap.
