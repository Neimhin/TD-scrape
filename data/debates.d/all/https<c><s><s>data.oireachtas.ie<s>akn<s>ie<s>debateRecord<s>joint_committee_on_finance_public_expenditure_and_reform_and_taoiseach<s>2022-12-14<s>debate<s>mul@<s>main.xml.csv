#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	1	Today's meeting will be in two sessions, the first of which is to discuss report 42 of the review body on higher remuneration in the public service. We have representatives with us from the group that has been affected. I welcome them all here. We are happy to deal with this issue. We will have an opening statement and then members can address the statement and any queries they may have with regard to the overall issue. We will keep it as informal as we can in order to get as much information as possible from the session to progress the matter on the group's behalf. Mr. John O’Brien, Mr. Tim Kenneally, Ms Maureen Cronin and Ms Paula Lawler are very welcome. I ask whosoever will make the opening statement to recall the note on privilege, which states one shall not name anyone in such a way as to make him or her identifiable and so on. Likewise, members already will have heard the note on privilege.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	2	I thank the Chairman and committee for affording us some time out of what I know is a very busy schedule. Before I start, I wish to introduce Mr. Tim Kenneally, who represents the voluntary hospital sector, Ms Maureen Cronin, who recently retired from the HSE finance section, and Ms Paula Lawler, who recently retired from the HR section of the HSE. I have used headings for ease of reference. I will step through this quickly because there is quite an amount in it. The Report on the Processes and Procedures Applying to the Appointment of Senior Executives in the Public Service produced by the committee 12 months ago made certain findings and what we will present today is not dissimilar to the findings of that report. In this instance, we have senior civil servants ignoring a Government decision to pay an award; ignoring a letter of sanction to pay that award; trying to alter the findings of the independent review body that made that award; ignoring the findings of the Labour Court; and applying legislation retrospectively where no such provision existed. By way of background, this issue arises from the report of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector that was published 15 years ago back in 2007, believe it or not. I will not go into the background of the review body and its purpose but suffice to say, it has been in existence since 1969 as a completely independent advisory body to the Government.In the case of the review body's report No. 42, everybody else got paid except senior health officials in the voluntary hospitals, the former health boards and more recently, the HSE. We want to know why and who made that decision. On the question of why the payment of awards was blocked by the then Department of Health and Children, we have obtained an amount of documentation under freedom of information requests in relation to this. It is very clear, from that documentation, that the CEO of the HSE wanted the awards paid. The Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children clearly took a different view, but also recognised the inherent injustice of his position in relation to blocking the payment of awards, where effectively the Secretary General and his senior officials tried to set preconditions to paying the awards, including altering the findings and abolishing jobs into the bargain.  This matter dragged on for two years and four months prior to the introduction of the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, legislation at the back end of 2009. It is worth noting that senior civil servants had arranged payment of the awards for themselves within seven weeks of the publication of the report. What preceded the FEMPI legislation was six months of silence before the introduction of the legislation in December 2009. That led to a flurry of activity because of the injustice that would be compounded by FEMPI. In other words, our cohort of staff had not been paid the awards set out in report No. 42 and were also going to suffer a pay cut arising from the FEMPI legislation. On 4 December 2009, our union was told that payment would be made. There was a move at the highest level in the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance to make that happen on 9 December. However, on the following day all that changed, and there was a move to block payment. That was done by proposing to apply the penal aspects of the yet-to-be-enacted FEMPI legislation, which did not come onto the Statute Book until January 2010. We believe that the interactions between the assistant secretaries in the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance over those two days were unfair, deeply flawed and possibly tainted. We can elaborate on that later if the committee members which to discuss it further.  On the role of the Department of Finance, on 10 December 2009, the Department of Health and Children asked the Department of Finance if it could pay the awards, taking into account the FEMPI legislation, which was at Bill stage at that point. However, the question was not brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance until 28 May 2010, six months later, by which time the question was redundant because the FEMPI legislation was on the Statute Book. The submission to the Minister for Finance was effectively a senior civil servant acting as sole judge and juror in respect of whether the awards should be paid. The submission contained incomplete and inaccurate information, leaving the Minister no choice but to refuse to pay the awards. Our union referred the matter to the Labour Court and matter wound its way to the court in January 2011. A full hearing was held and the Labour Court found that both sides were in agreement that the awards were due and should be paid, and it was up to the parties to bring that about. Nothing has happened in the intervening 11 years to bring about payment. In other words, the HSE, as the employer, and the civil servants ignored the findings of the Labour Court. The current Tánaiste said, in a radio interview in March 2016, "If you make an agreement with your staff down [at] the WRC, [the Workplace Relations Commission,] it has to be honoured and honoured in full ... a deal is a deal...". The current Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, expressed similar sentiments later that year, again in a radio interview. He stated "we have to be fair ... to everybody ... an independent body, the Labour Court .... intervened ... made a recommendation ... that’s the final court of arbitration for industrial relations in our land". That is in contrast to the position taken by the civil servants. In summary, these awards were approved by the Government and sanctioned by the Department of Finance, the Labour Court recommended that they should be paid, the money has been in the HSE accounts since 2021 and FEMPI has been unwound. We want to know why payment is not being made and who is blocking it. We feel that we have been blatantly singled out for unfair treatment. We have avoided taking industrial action because it is not in the nature of those who are seen to be managing and running the services to do so. Unfortunately, some retirees have passed away and their widows are now on the wrong pension rates. The civil servants who are blocking these payments were paid in 2007. As the current Tánaiste said, "a deal is a deal". If the committee wishes to delve further into the matter, we have accumulated an amount of documentation over the years that we are happy to make available to the committee. Our ask of the committee, if appropriate, is to ask the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to intervene with his colleague, the Minister for Health, to either request or direct his Secretary General to issue the necessary sanction to the HSE to pay the awards. I thank the members for their attention.

I have to say this is probably one of the most detailed and well laid out opening statements that I have seen in a long time. It has been extremely helpful, gives a good background to the situation and sets out the points very well. I have a few questions, some of which are to provide me with a better understanding of the matter. According to page three of the opening statement, "It is the strongly held view of those impacted by non-payment of the awards that the Secretary General ... had no authority to adopt this course of action" and may have been acting outside their powers. I ask Mr. O'Brien to elaborate on that particular point.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	4	Basically, the review body is completely independent. It issued its report in September 2007. The report was extremely detailed, ran to 220 to 230 pages and covered 13 different categories of staff, including those working in local authorities, the Judiciary, the fire services, public officials and so on. Shortly after that, the Government made the decision to pay the award in full. The Department of Finance sanctioned the award. Shortly afterwards, I think it was April of the following year, it was formally sanctioned with new salary scales. They were submitted to the Department of Health and Children, and that is where the blockage occurred, from our point of view. The question we are asking is whether civil servants have the power to overrule a decision of Government and not pay the awards. Second, according to correspondence, there was a clear attempt to alter the awards that were granted to HSE officials downwards. Is the Secretary General allowed to do that? We have come to that conclusion that he is not. Otherwise, if the Civil Service has that power to overrule the Government, it is our view that that raises very serious issues for the administration of government.
#MaireadFarrell	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-party	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-dob	unknown-#MaireadFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	5	On that point, my second question relates to the reference in the opening submission to how "civil servants took a different position from the two Government Ministers" and how no effort is being made to honour the Labour Court recommendation. In Mr. O'Brien's experience, is the taking of such different positions and in the pursuit of different course of actions commonplace? Is it something he has seen happen at another point between Ministers and senior Civil Service officials? 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	6	Not in my experience. My experience is that we have always respected the Labour Court as the final court of arbitration and accepted the recommendations. It is not binding and we understand that as well but that is our experience. Ms Lawler, whose expertise is in HR, might wish to say something on that or confirm it but that is certainly our experience. Generally, when those decisions are made, they are honoured.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	7	That is the case. As Mr. O'Brien has said, they are not binding but parties willingly engage in that machinery and the recommendation is always implemented where it can be.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	9	Is the Deputy's question why do we think the award is not being paid?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	11	The only thing that is outstanding is the letter of sanction from the Department of Health to the HSE to pay. Everything else is in place; the Government decision and the sanction from the Department of Finance is there. Effectively, down the years, the sanction from the Department of Health in this type of situation is a rubber-stamp exercise. That is the only part that is missing. We have written to the HSE, which has said that the Department of Health sanction is not forthcoming. In the most recent letter from the Department, the Secretary General has refused to answer correspondence even though as late as about 18 months ago he said all would be reviewed once FEMPI was unwound. We followed that up with correspondence and there has been no response forthcoming. Instead, we have had correspondence from one of the people in HR in the Department of Health saying that sectoral bargaining would solve this or that we should go back to the industrial relations machinery. We have been through that machinery so we simply do not know. The HSE has set aside the money to pay for it so we simply do not know what it is being blocked.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	12	Could I comment on this? I am a bit nervous and my heart is pounding because I am not normally here like this in front of cameras and it is very difficult. It is difficult that we have got to here and I thank the committee for giving us a chance to speak. Something happened in the percentages in that award. Someone decided in 2007 that over their dead body would those people get that percentage. I believe that because I have worked full-time for 41 years in the public system and have never seen this happen. Someone had a hearts-and-minds issue in this regard, which I find disturbing and chilling. I should say I have worked for many years with civil servants; some of whom are my friends and have been colleagues for years. When I refer to civil servants, I am referring to some very small group of very powerful people who appear to be able to work independently. Somebody made the decision that we would not be getting this award and they have the capacity then to pass the parcel and send the fool further. We are blue in the face with the processes and have waited patiently. I am an accountant and have worked in finance all my life. We have senior hospital managers, engineers, architects, procurement specials in the group involved with this award and all of these people are basically the infrastructure underpinning the delivery of healthcare in our system. They are not the front-line people but they are the underpinning infrastructure. I still say "We" because I still feel very embedding in the HSE and I have just retired because my health, to be honest, was becoming an issue and the stress and the pressure was just too much. I have just left and I still feel I am part of it. We feel we are the system and if we were nurses we would not be sitting here today. Nobody would tolerate this. There would have been a strike a long time ago. We have held on and held on all through the FEMPI years. Then we had Covid-19. We have done 90-hour-weeks all through the pandemic. I have seen people put themselves into bad health and marriages gone from the amount of commitment put in by these people. Through all of that, we believed, foolishly really,that these send-the-fool-further things would end and eventually FEMPI would unwind. One of the letters, from the Secretary General I think, stated that when FEMPI was unwound, our people would have a review. None of these things mean anything. It is really about getting this issue away, off the desk, and sending a letter to a pensioner. The most recent letter is from August 2022 and seriously, you would have to be sedated to put up with what we are getting. The letter is telling a pensioner to go into the industrial relations machinery as if this person has landed from Mars. Do they not know we have already gone through all the industrial relations machinery? The highest court in the land in industrial relations is the Labour Court. It made a decision. The parties were even in agreement - there is not even a dispute - and yet somehow in the background, people are still able to not move. There is some kind of channel there or some kind of covert silo; I do not even know what to call it and have found it hard to put the words on it. There is something, however, that runs in parallel with the real system which is not transparent and these people are collaborating and making decisions. Bear in mind that some of our colleagues in the HSE got this award and we were just singled out. We are a blade of grass in the mouth of an elephant in terms of the overall award and are a tiny little group but it is just an exercise of sending the fool further, passing the parcel and telling us this is the process. I apologise as I am a bit wound up. I will stop in a second. Our union wrote to the HSE on 30 September, now that FEMPI is fully unwound, and said that we would be in serious precipitative industrial action if this award is not now paid. As I sit here today 75 days later, that letter is unanswered. I find that absolutely staggering. Mr. Paul Reid has now left us but as the HSE CEO, he wrote in the latest published service plan that in terms of vaccination, testing, and tracing that this sustained response is only possible because of the extraordinary commitment, tenacity, and courage of an outstanding workforce where professionalism has been apparent in the performance of every role. I can tell you that if this was Brian Cody, he would not be treating his team in the way we have been treated. I believe this is a hearts-and-minds issue at its origin and it has been hammered and rehammered to the extent that we were sent a letter on 22 August to be told that the industrial relations machinery of the State is available to us.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	13	Can I focus in on a particular point? I know Mr. O'Brien made reference in his submission to the fact that we believed some things were improperly done and information withheld. There are two key memos which we have analysed in relation to this thing. I have copied to hand if it would help the members. Ours views are based on what is in these two memos and how the Department acting on one particular day. Mr. O'Brien mentioned the flurry of activity on 9 December. There was a flurry of activity to clear everything in order that the award could be paid before the new pay cuts came into place. The Secretary General instructed his assistant secretary to issue a statement to the Minister to that effect. You would think that would be the end of it but no way. There were two memos written and the first was written on the morning of 10 December by an assistant secretary, RIP, and cleared the way to finally pay senior health service managers. The memo was written on the instruction of the Secretary General and a key point within referred to an agreement reached with the Department of Finance days previously.However, shortly afterwards on that morning and completely out of the blue, a new memo was typed up by the same assistant secretary. It was the first time that the prospect was introduced of the award being blocked or stymied by the FEMPI legislation. FEMPI was not legislation at the time but there was the Bill of the same name. On the first memo, somebody wrote the word "draft", as if to make the first memo obsolete, and the one that was carrying the decisions was written on 9 December. I believe that draft could have been written in 2015 when a freedom of information request had been lodged. It was written subsequently when the Department realised that there were two different memos on file.  This out-of-the-blue memo, which was drafted by the same assistant secretary within minutes or an hour of the first one, has some serious questions to be asked of it. Why would the assistant secretary in the Department of Health, partly off his own bat, decide to take a completely new and different approach to what had been agreed as late as that morning, without any indication whatever or any reason for doing so? Why was it deemed necessary to type up a new memo rather than amending the draft, as would have been the case? The second memo stymied the payment of the award that have been agreed the previous day. The typed date on it is 2010 but somebody changed it, in handwriting, to 2009. I have some concerns about the authenticity of that memo. I believe that the word “draft” was written on it in 2015 when the freedom of information request was lodged. The handwritten draft was also uninitiated. Why did the assistant secretary omit the key point in the first memo, which was that this had been discussed and agreed with the Department of Finance. That was completely omitted from the new memo. How did the assistant secretary come to the conclusion and inform his Minister that the matter now fell to be dealt with under the proposed FEMPI legislation, when the stated aim and that of his colleagues was to pay the award before the legislation came into effect? The assistant secretary said in one of his items of correspondence that the FEMPI Bill was published on 10 December, on the same day. In actual fact, the history of the Bill was that it had its first reading on 8 December. There are many anomalies. There is no indication as to how the assistant secretary came to the conclusion that the FEMPI Bill would affect the payment of the award. He sent his memo to the Minister and to his Secretary General saying that the matter now fell to be dealt with under the FEMPI Bill. I am wondering how a matter can be dealt with under a Bill when it has not been enacted.  Later that same day, he wrote to the assistant secretary in the Department of Finance - by the way the very same secretary who had agreed two days previously to pay the award - asking if the award could be dealt with under the FEMPI Bill. He tells his Minister that it has to be dealt with under the FEMPI Bill, and later on in the day, he is asking the secretary in the Department of Finance if it could be dealt with under that Bill. This does not make sense to me. There is a note in one of the memos, which states that the Minister for Health agreed that it could be referred to the Department of Finance. It would be very unusual if it was an absolute fact that it was covered because the Minister would say that it has to be referred to the Department of Finance. She said that it could be referred to the Department of Finance, and that it was optional. It did not seem to dawn on all of these senior civil servants until that morning that the FEMPI Bill could be an issue for them.  Out of the blue, the only thing which could affect payment of the award was the FEMPI Bill. As legislators, the committee here would know more than I would on such matters. Is it legal and proper to apply the penal terms of legislation before it is actually passed in respect of doing something, and then to retrospectively apply the terms of the legislation when it is enacted as regards an issue which had been dealt with prior to the legislation coming into effect? This certainly does not make sense to me but, as legislators, the committee would clearly know the answer to that question. The other thing that happened on 10 December, as well as the assistant secretary in the Department of Health writing to his counterpart in the Department of Finance asking could this matter be dealt with under the FEMPI Bill, was that assistant secretary in the Department of Finance, in a subsequent letter on 7 January, said that he did not expect an early conclusion to the matter. He was right because it was not actually dealt with for a further five months.  If it was so urgent on 9 December, why was it sat on until 28 or 29 May? If it is in order to do this afterwards, I believe it would be worth looking at the memos because we are quoting exactly what the Department’s own actions are.  The one thing that is glaringly obvious from looking at the memos, and one thing that is absent, apart from one mention that the Secretary General was at a meeting that day with the Minister where it was discussed; is that there is not the slightest indication of his influence, input or anything to the process. This is a process that was adopted on one foot and, within hours and minutes, had changed tack completely. Mr. O’Brien has covered some of these issues but he mentioned the Secretary General acting as judge and jury in the matter. He had decided that the Government award, the Department-sanctioned and approved award, would not be paid, unless he was happy to do so. This is a fairly strong statement to make. He then decided to unilaterally reduce the amount of the award. Not alone did he not listen to his own senior officials, including even the memo writer, were urging him to pay the award that he had agreed himself the previous night on 9 December, he did listen to the HSE CEO who advocated that the award should be paid, he did not listen to the national director of HR, nor did he abide by his own views, which he stated repeatedly were that it would be unfair and would be a double hit not to pay this award. My final comment is that something prompted a change of heart within minutes or hours on the morning of 10 December and the only thing that I can think of is that there was a headline in the Irish Independent, which stated, “Pay cuts do Harney a favour ...”. While this money was fully funded and confirmed by the Department at the time, this is one of the reasons the Secretary General said to hold on and that if we play smart, and use the FEMPI Bill, we can avoid paying this award. If the then Government wanted this award to be covered by the FEMPI legislation, all it had to do was to wait until 1 January when this legislation was in place.  Overall, what they did raises serious questions of probity and correctness. Their memos are contradictory; it is amazing that things could be written on memos or drafts, or that memos were produced subsequently to reflect decisions which were made on the day.

When I heard recently about this, it raised questions in my own mind. Deputy Farrell has asked some of the questions I would like to have asked. In respect of the Secretary General, has he ever communicated with our witnesses? Has he ever come back with a response? Regarding Mr. Hourigan’s letter on 22 September under the Freedom of Information Act, the witnesses have had the right to appeal it. Was this request ever appealed?  I believe our witnesses have answered most of what I wanted to ask, in that the Department of Health is saying that it cannot pay this money without the HSE approving it. Knowing the different backgrounds from which all of our witnesses have come from and that their roles were at a certain level within the HSE, is it mainly the people across that level who have not received this money and that people below or above their level have received this money? Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	15	I think it was probably our level upwards where the awards have not been paid. The other grades are covered by general pay awards, benchmarking, and that kind of thing. The review body on public sector pay, which has been agreed since 1969, dealt with grades at that level across the public service, the Judiciary, the local authorities, fire services, together with public officials such as Ministers and taoisigh, and so on. That is basically the position. On the point about Mr. Watt's letter, Mr. Watt wrote to Mr. Hourigan on 22 April 2021 and basically said that Mr. Hourigan was entitled to request a review of this decision on the expiry of FEMPI legislation. Mr. Hourigan followed up on that once the FEMPI legislation was unwound on 1 July, and has received no response to that correspondence.It seems to have been delegated to one of the people in the HR department of the Department of Health, who has told us, basically, to go to the WRC, after we have been through the Labour Court process.
#MariaByrne	unknown-#MariaByrne-party	unknown-#MariaByrne-dob	unknown-#MariaByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	16	Is there an example in any other public sector organisation of something similar having happened, or do the witnesses think they are the only ones who have ended up in this situation? Mr. O'Brien asked that we speak to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I have no problem doing that on a personal basis. I certainly will put a question to him on the matter in the future. Is there any other way we can help the witnesses?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	17	On the question as to whether we are the only ones, the answer is "Yes". All the other staff groups right across the 13 categories have been paid the award. All the awards were capped at 5% in 2008 or 2009 because of the downturn. The original intention was that they would be paid over three phases. Certain grades got higher awards than 5%; some got 10%, 12% and so on. I cannot remember all the details but they are set out in the documentation. We are the only ones that have been picked out for this kind of unfair treatment, as we view it, and we have lived with this basic injustice for the past 15 years. We would be grateful for any help the committee can give us. As I said earlier, if members want to delve more deeply into this, we have a raft of correspondence supporting everything we have said today. We are asking the committee to intervene with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and, in turn, to ask the Minister for Health to direct the Secretary General to issue the letter of sanction from the Department. That is the only missing piece we can see in all of this, unless some other rabbit is pulled out of the hat. There have been many such instances over the past 15 years that have served to block this award.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	18	The Senator asked whether we are the only group in this situation. In fact, even within the HSE, some categories of staff were paid based on the report. Consultant orthodontists were part of that report and they were paid. The outgoing chief executives were included in the report and were paid. The Senator asked what help the committee can give us. We are an example of a small group against whom an injustice has been perpetrated by the processes or the individuals involved. It raises fundamental questions for me about the operation of government and governance when a decision made by the Government can be twisted and tangled and not implemented. That is a much bigger principle the committee may need to consider. We are just an example. Our situation has happened to come before the committee and our position is clear. There is a much bigger principle at play here that should be followed up by the committee, particularly as the Labour Court has also been ignored in this matter.

Has there been any communication from them and have they attempted any action recently on the witnesses' behalf?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	20	I established an internal group within the HSE 23 months ago. It includes a cross-section of senior hospital people, procurement people, IT people and so on. I chaired that group until I finished working during the summer. We engaged with Fórsa because we knew the FEMPI legislation was going to be unwound. We have sought engagement with the HSE. Sadly, our morale on this issue is very low. I said to somebody earlier that the comedian, Michael McIntyre, once said he did not know his wife had a tether until she was at the end of it. We are at the end of our tether. Despite our best endeavours to avoid any disruption to the business, there has been no progress. More than 60% of the people involved in this award are Fórsa members. On 30 September, the general secretary of Fórsa, which is the largest health services union, wrote to the HSE stating, as I said earlier, that we would be in precipitative and serious industrial action if this matter is not resolved. There has been no reply to that letter, which is extraordinary. We have now asked the union to take us back to the WRC but it is like Groundhog Day. I do not know what can break through this brick wall, what the brick wall is and why it exists in the governance of public administration and government administration.

I had a couple of other issues of business to which I had to attend. I welcome the witnesses, for whom I have a few questions. There was an approval of the award by two Ministers at different times. Were those approvals conditional or were they clear and unequivocal?

I would have presumed the Secretary General was the person to approach. I might be wrong.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	26	We cannot answer that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	27	The assistant secretary is mentioned often because he was the primary person involved in 2009. Since then, Mr. Hourigan has written to the Secretary General and we have written to the Secretary General. Over the past number of years, correspondence has been directly to the Secretary General, in fact, the Secretaries General, of whom there have been several.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	29	Mr. O'Brien read out one or two of the responses, which talk about when the FEMPI legislation is unwound and different options. However, all the options are unrealistic.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	31	I want to make the point that it is not just us who are affected by this. It also affects spouses' pensions. Unfortunately, a number of people who should have-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	33	It affects nearly everybody involved. There are approximately 200 people involved but I am not sure how many of them have spouses. On an ongoing basis, it affects everybody's pension and it also affects spouses' pensions. This is why we are concerned about it. It has ongoing and everlasting effects.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	34	Two of our colleagues passed away in the past six months and their widows are affected by this.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	36	The last figure I saw showed there are approximately 240 people. It started out at approximately 150 people in 2007 but staff have retired since then and other people have replaced them. The number is approximately 240. I am not privy to the exact details-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	38	If somebody was in post in 2007, he or she must work right through to retirement. That is my situation and, therefore, my pension, when it is calculated, will be at the wrong rate because my salary was at the wrong rate. Whoever replaces me will go in on the wrong rate. If I were to pass away, my spouse would get the wrong rate. There are a number of different people affected along the chain of employment and pension.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	39	I am particularly interested in the so-called unwinding of the FEMPI provisions. More than a year ago, or even two years ago, I asked more than one Minister whether the provisions were now unwound. I was assured that they were but I have since noted that there appear to be a number of outstanding issues, one of which is the issue facing the witnesses. I propose that the committee needs to have a discussion with the people responsible-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	40	To clarify, my understanding is that the FEMPI provisions are not unwound in the sense that the legislation has not been stood down or taken off the Statute Book, if I am getting the language right. The cuts that were applied, certainly in the HSE, as I know because I was working in the finance operation, have all now been fully unwound since 1 July. In terms of the language, people could be saying the legislation is not unwound but, in fact, the cuts have been unwound and, therefore, we had an expectation. We waited patiently through all the years of cyberattacks, the Covid crisis and so on. You name it, we did it because we believed, foolishly, what we were being told, which is that the FEMPI legislation was the reason the State could not afford this award and that when the FEMPI provisions were over, the matter would be addressed.This is not a pay claim in that sense. These are wages withheld from us. This is not about negotiating, doing a certain amount and going a certain distance. I am relating to colleagues in the Department of Health who are all on this salary scale. It is beyond belief that they are writing letters to us saying that we are not getting it, but they are on it. I just find that extraordinary.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	41	My interpretation of the unwinding is the restoration of the payments associated with FEMPI. We discussed those at length in this committee and in other committees, and in the House. I am sure my colleagues will follow it up, but it might be better to invite a delegation from the Department before the committee. It need not be a long meeting. Half an hour would do it. It will be either "Yes" or "No"; it will either work or it will not work. The commitment has been given in good faith and taken in good faith. For that reason, we should make an incisive intervention.

In line with that proposition, I want to ask the witnesses when this started. The answers are contained in the presentation that they have made, but I want them to confirm a number of points as I go through it. What year did the Labour Court make its decision?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	44	It was 2011.

When was the first time that this arose?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	47	Mr. O'Brien probably has the individual letters there. I think it was just before the award was even approved by the Government.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	48	It was.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	50	Yes, in October 2007. The sanction arrived in April 2008 to pay the award.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	56	It went from a Mr. Dowling as far as I know.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	57	It would have been the assistant secretary, typically the assistant secretary for HR in the Department.

If the sanction went in 2008, do the witnesses have confirmation of the person to whom it was sent?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	59	Yes, we can get that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	61	It was Mr. Carey, an assistant secretary, now deceased.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	63	There is correspondence immediately prior to the receipt of the sanction from the Secretary General to the CEO of the HSE. The sanction was dated 28 April 2008, but five days before the sanction arrived in the Department, the Secretary General wrote to the CEO of the HSE requesting his views on the implementation of the review body report. It is very clear from that correspondence that the Secretary General had formed certain views about paying HSE-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	65	A Mr. Scanlan.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	67	To the Department of Health, and generally there would be a rubber stamp by the Department of Health to the HSE to pay it.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	69	Exactly, but that never happened.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	71	That is it. Yes.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	73	Instead of that, there was an exchange of correspondence between the CEO of the HSE and the Secretary General through 2008 and into 2009.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	74	So who was CEO of the HSE?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	75	It was Brendan Drumm.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	76	Professor Brendan Drumm.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	78	Absolutely.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	79	In the correspondence to the Secretary General, was Mr. Drumm asking for permission? Permission was already there. What was he asking?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	80	He had not got the formal rubber stamp from the Department of Health.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	82	It is very clear in the CEO's response that he wanted the award paid. In fact, in one of the quotes he states: "It is hard to see the justification to unilaterally overlook the HSE-IMPACT agreement. In the interests of respecting existing agreements and maintaining fairness, we should proceed with honouring these limited increases." That was the CEO of the HSE to the Secretary General. The response from the Secretary General to that letter of 5 February 2009 was a handwritten note as follows: "Please prepare a draft reply. I regard this as a most unsatisfactory reply to my letter." He did not agree with the CEO and he made that very clear in handwriting.

Mr. Carey approved it. He wrote to Mr. Scanlan in 2008. At that stage it began to stop making progress. Mr. Drumm was asking for progress to be made.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	84	Yes, he was asked for his views.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	86	Yes.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	87	Could Mr. O'Brien take it from there then?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	88	In March 2009, following that exchange with the CEO, he wrote a letter to the CEO saying, "I now intend to issue a general letter of sanction for the implementation of the award." That letter is on file, but it was never issued, for no logical reason.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	89	How does Mr. O'Brien know it was not issued?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	90	It was not issued to the HSE.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	92	He said it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	93	But also the HSE has always said it could not pay it because it had not got approval from the Department of Health. It never got that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	95	It was 6 March 2009.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	97	He wrote to the CEO saying: "I now intend to issue a general letter of sanction." He proceeded to draft that letter of sanction on 10 March 2009. However, it appears that the letter of sanction never issued. The HSE seems never to have received it and we got confirmation that the letter never issued from the Department of Health.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	98	That letter included salary scales for the amount to be paid to the different groups.

That was 2009. Could Mr. O'Brien quickly take us through what happened after that?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	100	There was a memo on 1 April 2009 from the Secretary General to the Minister, more or less confirming what he had put in the letter of sanction. "It would be very difficult to justify withholding the increases from HSE staff when they have already been paid in the rest of the public service." There is an indication straight away that he understands there is an injustice going on here. On 21 April-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	102	Yes, writing to the Minister for Health.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	104	Mary Harney. On 21 April, he wrote again to the Minister. We do not know why it was necessary to issue two memos, but it says more or less the same thing: "I don’t think we can justify withholding the increases from HSE staff given that they have been paid...in the rest of the public service. Nor do I think we can justify withholding retrospection." That was in April 2009 and then there was a period of silence until FEMPI came on the scene in early December 2009.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	109	The Labour Court in 2011. I should mention as well that this issue was not brought to the attention of the Minister for Finance until January 2010, even though it was a burning issue in early December 2009 that was referred from the Department of Health to the Department of Finance. The Minister was not informed until six months later.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	111	He was not informed, and then when he was informed I referred to a person acting as sole judge and juror on whether it would be paid or not. In fact, that person went so far as to apply two tests to the correspondence.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	114	I would say it was the late Brian Lenihan.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	120	It went to the Labour Court in 2011.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	126	Absolutely.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	127	The parties were in agreement. There was no dispute.

Who are "these people"? Ms Cronin was referring to senior civil servants. Who in the senior ranks of the Civil Service has blocked this payment?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	134	From our perspective, the key people who can be seen in the correspondence are: the Secretary General, Mr. Michael Scanlan; his assistant secretary, Mr. Bernard Carey, who is now deceased; and Mr. Brendan Duffy, assistant secretary at the Department of Finance who, by coincidence, was also secretary to the review body that reported and so was fully aware of the report and the award.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	146	There was no response to the latest letter. In fairness, there was a letter to one of our colleagues saying that, when the financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, were over, there could be a review. Our colleague followed up to ask how the review was to be conducted when the FEMPI provisions and the cuts were being fully unwound. That is when we got a letter, on 22 August 2022, saying-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	147	It was not from the Secretary General.

They have been around the loop. The reason I have asked these questions is to have set out in simple terms that there is a case to be answered here. The Labour Court confirmed everything.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	156	That is correct.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	157	They got it seven weeks after the report was published.

Now, having gone through the machinery of the State and correspondence, the witnesses find themselves in a situation where those who were in senior positions got paid while those in their own positions across the sector were not.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	159	Yes. This is only the case in the HSE and only in our group.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	161	A brick wall.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	163	Yes.

This correspondence will form the basis of what we are going to do next.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	165	We can provide a detailed schedule.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	166	Powerful senior civil servants were mentioned. The reason I took an interest in this matter and read into it is that the question of who is running this country often crosses my mind. This is a clear example of who is running the country. It is also an example of who is being kept in the dark. As long as the very senior civil servants keep the politicians in the dark, they can do what they like, even to their own. I doubt that, when the witnesses were going through their careers, they ever expected having to turn up here to present a case.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	167	God, no.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	168	They would have expected that the Civil Service would at least respect the fact that they were one of its own. The witnesses have had a Labour Court decision and support from various pieces of correspondence and yet payment is still withheld from them.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	169	You would expect people to behave ethically.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	170	So, what Ms Cronin is saying is that they do not behave ethically. It is the reverse or opposite.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	171	The Chairman put it very well. If they can do this to one of their own, what would they do to someone who is not inside the system?
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	172	I can give Mr. O'Brien plenty of examples of that. I will conclude by saying that the reason the witnesses are here is that it is absolutely outrageous that the Civil Service would behave in the way it has in this particular instance. It is an example of the very same arrogance that is applied in running the country and in the administration of various sections within Government and of the lack of timely information being passed to Ministers to make decisions. It goes to the core of democracy, the core of the administration of Government and the core of justice and injustice. I commend the witnesses on coming forward with this case. It must not have been easy for them. Ms Cronin said she was a bit nervous. If that is the case, I would not like to see her fully unfettered in dealing with this. She gave us plenty of information and insight. I am sorry that it had to come to this.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	173	We never wanted to be here. It is very difficult for me to make comment on or critique my employer, where I loved working.

I would love to hear the Government's explanation as to why senior civil servants were allowed to pay themselves while leaving outside the door one small cohort of people who, apart from deserving it, have been supported by the Labour Court in their claim. It is despicable.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	175	Someone will have to force them. That is my view.

With the permission of the committee, we will send the transcript of this meeting to the Secretaries General of the Departments involved in this matter and to the Ministers involved and explain to them that, if they have any shred of decency in them, they will recognise the injustice and pay Ms Cronin and her colleagues immediately. After that, we will take stock of the replies we receive, although some Secretaries General and Ministers choose to ignore committees. We will decide what kind of package to send to each, which will be more or less the same.We will also send it to the new Taoiseach and Tánaiste and to the new Ministers who will be appointed on Saturday. We will pursue it again in the new year if it is not paid. Deputy Durkan made a proposition and we will follow through on that as well.

#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	181	I welcome Mr. Niall Cody, Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Ms Ruth Kennedy, commissioner, and Ms Angela O'Gorman, principal officer. We will start our meeting as usual with an opening statement from Mr. Cody and then members can engage with him on the content of that statement and possibly some other matters.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	182	Thank you, Chairman, for the opportunity to make my opening statement. I will begin with VAT on e-gaming.
The regulation of gambling is currently provided for in the Betting Act 1931 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 and as the committee will be aware the Gambling Regulation Bill is currently before the Dáil. The operational aspects of gambling and gaming regulation are dealt with by a number of State bodies, including An Garda Síochána, the courts, and Revenue. Under VAT law, betting or gambling, including e-gambling services, are exempt from VAT, while gaming services are taxable at the standard rate of VAT, currently 23%. E-gaming is an electronic service, and under EU and Irish VAT legislation, VAT is payable by the service provider in the member state where the private consumer is established, has a permanent address or usually resides. This means that VAT is payable in Ireland by the providers of these e-gaming services at the standard rate. A non-established supplier can register for VAT in Ireland or will, more likely, register through the one-stop shop, OSS. This is an EU wide administrative simplification which allows a business engaged in these supplies to register in a single member state to file and pay its VAT liability for all member states through a web portal in the member state of registration. Corporation tax receipts for 2021 were €15.3 billion, an increase of 29.5% on 2020. Receipts up to the end of November were €21.1 billion, up 56% on the same period last year. We have published detailed reports on corporation tax receipts every year since 2016 and will publish our next report next April. A key feature of the receipts is their concentration, with the top ten companies paying 53% of the receipts in 2021 and the top ten groups paying 56%. This represents a significant increase in the share paid by the top ten. The equivalent figures in 2019 were 40% and 43%, respectively. Work is currently ongoing at the OECD on finalising the pillar 2 package of measures to address the taxation challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy. Pillar 1 is a set of rules designed to ensure the largest and most profitable multinational enterprises pay tax on a certain portion of their worldwide profits in countries where the end consumers and users of their products and services are based. The detailed technical work which will determine the overall cost of this is ongoing. As key elements have yet to be agreed, such as the marketing and distribution profits safe harbour, which affects the elimination of double taxation, it is very difficult to estimate accurately the impact at this stage. The agreement will provide for the reallocation of profits to market jurisdictions such that multinational enterprises will pay a greater proportion of their tax in countries where their consumers and end users are based. The agreement will also provide for the removal of digital service taxes. Pillar 2 is a series of co-ordinated rules which will ensure that in-scope groups pay at least a 15% minimum effective rate of taxation on their profits in each jurisdiction in which the group operates. While it will be optional for countries to implement the OECD rules, the European Commission has proposed a directive to make the application of the rules mandatory for EU member states. Based on the current draft EU directive, it is expected that pillar 2 will apply from 31 December 2023. The introduction of the pillar 2 rules will have impacts on both the Exchequer and in-scope businesses. However, it is too early to estimate reliably the impact of the global minimum tax as this will depend on ongoing technical negotiations and on policy decisions made by Ireland and other jurisdictions.Significant policy and detailed technical issues have yet to be agreed at OECD and EU levels. Our role in Revenue is to support the Department of Finance on the technical issues. When agreement is reached and policy decisions are made, there will be a significant legislative programme to give effect to the new rules. There will also be significant ICT developments to implement the changes over the next two to three years and significant consultation and engagement with business, representative bodies, software developers and agents to implement the changes. Implementing the new system will have significant resource implications for Revenue. Moving to the Commission on Taxation and Welfare report, Revenue made a submission which focused on tax administration, reflecting Revenue's statutory remit as the body responsible for the administration of tax and customs and ensuring the fair and efficient operation of the tax system. The report provides a timely review of the tax and welfare system and provides a detailed framework to support policymaking for the medium term. Revenue will continue to support the Department in aspects of the recommendations which it chooses to take forward. Chapter 17 of the report deals with modernisation of tax administration. I consider this chapter to be among the most important frameworks to signpost the direction we must travel to succeed in our vision to be a leading tax and customs administration. We strongly endorse the recommendations in chapter 17, and several initiatives are under way in Revenue which will help to implement the conclusions over time. In addition to the implementation of significant changes arising from the international corporate tax agenda, which I have already touched on, there are a number of other key challenges facing Revenue in the coming years. We are in an unprecedented position, in that, as at the end of November, nearly €2.5 billion of tax debt was warehoused by businesses in the debt warehousing scheme. The effective management of this debt in the current economic environment is crucial. The digital transformation and modernisation of tax administration, which is a key priority for Revenue, requires a continued refresh of technology to underpin it. Our investment in technology enables us to support Government policy in relation to the implementation of new schemes, such as the temporary business energy support scheme, and new taxes, such as the residential zoned land tax. There will continue to be challenges arising from the UK exit from the EU both as businesses continue to adapt their supply chains to the very much changed trading relationship with the UK, including to regulatory changes on the UK side, and the supply chain pressures brought about by the Russian aggression in Ukraine. We must ensure we have the people and capability to continue to meet all evolving challenges and to deliver on our vision requiring a significant investment in people and making sure we are an employer of choice capable of attracting the talent and skills we need to continue to be a high-performing organisation. I draw the committee’s attention to section 851A of the Taxes Consolidation Act and my obligation to uphold taxpayer confidentiality. Subject to this constraint, I am happy to answer the committee’s questions.

I commend our guests. Through business and in one form or another, I deal with Revenue, on and off, relatively regularly. Particularly during the pandemic when there was a shotgun effect to the need to deal with the pandemic unemployment payment and other immediate payments, we found that when different tax categories needed to be clarified and whatever else was required, it was not straightforward but Revenue was amenable, exceptionally helpful and easy to get on the phone. I must say that. It is one of the arms of the State. Perhaps some people are unhappy about the way Revenue works, but it certainly works. Revenue's online systems are accessible and good. PAYE workers can enter their details on any of the payroll systems and be told what they will get and what they will not get. All of that is fed out automatically. It is incredible how the system is tied in with Revenue at present. I have a bugbear, which is the result of being out and about and listening to different guys. Vehicle registration tax, VRT, seems to be an exceptionally complicated system. I am surprised that when Revenue has so many other things streamlined, there is no easier way to deal with the importation of vehicles and VRT. Every guy I know from that line of business talks to someone different and hears different answers at different times. That seems to be complicated and I cannot see why there is not a way to streamline it. More important to Ireland at present, and I see it is in the headlines again today, is corporation tax. Mr. Cody said Revenue has not yet run the figures on the potential effect of a change in our corporation tax, which is coming through pillar 1 and pillar 2. The starting point will be 15% and it may be higher than that. I am curious as to what would happen if EU members were to advocate for a minimum corporation tax of higher than 15% in the future. I am sure Revenue has figures built in to assess the change as we move from 12.5% to 15%, what that will look like and its likely effect. Pillar 1 will tell us that many of these companies are going to pay at source and whatever else. I know it is a variable that is hard to guesstimate. However, Mr. Cody might look into a crystal ball and tell us where he thinks this is going to go. As the figures show, the amount of corporation tax we are getting is staggering. Our country is going to be a very different place when, because of the change in pillar 1, some of that money is not going to come to us. What foresight has Mr. Cody in that regard? Will he share his thoughts as to what could happen in any particular scenario? He can paint whatever picture he wants. Will he give us a feel or flavour of what to expect? Has Revenue engaged with any multinationals about imminent changes in corporation tax and that type of thing? We know that approximately ten companies are providing 85% of the corporation tax, or whatever the correct statistics are. I am curious on those points.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	184	I thank the Senator for the comments he made at the start of his contribution about our activities. Some of the things we did over the two years of the pandemic were exceptional. The helplines to which the Senator referred were run at a time when people were working from home and we developed systems to allow that to happen. For people at my level, that is fine, but there were people at clerical officer level dealing with schemes that did not exist. They sometimes spoke to businessmen on the phone and they used to read the Revenue website to each other to reassure themselves as to what it meant. That is a testament to the people involved. On the VRT issue, one consequence of the UK exit from the EU has been to turn the second-hand car market on its head. I know some of the statistics off the top of my head because I had a similar discussion with the Committee of Public Accounts last week. In 2019, 115,000 second-hand cars were registered for VRT. Up to two weeks ago, the relevant figure for 2022 stood at 34,000. That is a consequence of the changes in rules and not because of our systems. Cars coming in from Great Britain, as opposed to Northern Ireland, are subject to customs, VAT and VRT. Documentation must be produced for all of them. It depends on where the car was originally sourced and whether a European make had gone into the UK before coming to Ireland. In such a case, a transaction is subject to customs duty at 10%, VAT and VRT. As I said at the meeting last week, because we drive on the same side of the road as the UK, the second-hand car market before the UK left the EU was a single market within a Single Market. It is no longer a single market, with all the consequences that entails.In a way, the VRT registration system has not changed fundamentally and it is the steps people have to take before they get to VRT. We do not have the ownership of the solution in that area. It actually changed the nature of some businesses. Their key business was to source cars and because of the size of the market in Britain and the nature of cars, the tax levels inbuilt in cars made it viable to import them. That model may well settle down a bit but it is still in a huge transition. In regard to corporation tax, I do not have a crystal ball to look into. One of the things we very much do - this is one of the things I was very interested in when the corporation tax receipts started to show that significant increase - is to publish detailed analysis of what happened, and we have done that every year with as much detail as we can give, having regard to taxpayer confidentiality. What we tend to do is focus on and report on what has come in. We support the Department of Finance on forecasting in that we give it the insights that we have but the Department is the body that has the responsibility for forecasting. The reality is that there is significant detailed technical work still to be finalised and agreed at international level for both pillar 1 and pillar 2 that will determine what the outcome will be. For pillar 1, there will definitely be a cost because the nature of the agreement at pillar 1 is a distribution of profits to market countries, so bigger countries with bigger markets will get a bigger proportion. However, there are still technical details about the order of the distribution and what element of countries’ profits are redistributed. It applies to multinational groups that have a turnover of €20 billion-plus with a profit margin in excess of 10%. It is estimated that there are about 100 companies worldwide and, of these 100 companies, probably in the region of 60% of them have a presence in Ireland, so we are right in the mix of that whole debate. There are still key issues to be worked out to see what is the proportion and the order. On one level, pillar 2 seems simpler, if multinationals with turnover in excess of €750 million and a minimum effective rate of 15% is what is in scope, but there are still technical issues. I know there was tentative agreement yesterday in Europe so that, if it follows through with the political sign-off, there will be a directive which means that each member state would have to introduce the rules around the 15%. There are still key issues in regard to the interaction of the rules in each country, the order and who will get the additional taxing rights, and that is not yet finalised. We have not provided any indication of what we think will be the likely cost, on one side, and additional yield, on the other, because until we have certainty on those rules, they will just be guesstimates. As regards our engagement with multinationals, we are organised in such a way that our large corporates division deals with all the large enterprises and we are actively engaged with all of those companies on an ongoing basis. Again, our primary responsibility is to ensure that each of them pays the right tax in the year and we are not so much into discussing their likely decisions. In any case, the decisions of multinationals and businesses are often made in their international headquarters. We do engage and, when it comes to each year's forecasts, we survey the top companies, we get as much insight as we can and we share that on a statistical basis with the Department to aid forecasting. Nonetheless, the reality is that forecasting of corporation tax is a really difficult issue. I often look at quarterly results from multinational companies and see the surprise in the markets even for the next quarter, so we can imagine what it is going to be like looking forward a year. To assess what is the impact in two years’ time is very difficult with the volatility.
#AidanDavitt	unknown-#AidanDavitt-party	unknown-#AidanDavitt-dob	unknown-#AidanDavitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	185	I appreciate what Mr. Cody has said. He spoke about pillar 1 and companies with profits of greater than €20 billion. I would say they will fall into this category of the top ten companies which are paying 56% of our corporation tax and heading for 60%, the way things are going. When that pillar 1 comes into play, I would say it is very foreseeable that more than half of our corporate tax income from these guys is probably going to disappear. Is it alarmist to say that? My reading of it, from seeing what has been going on over the last while, is that it is all pointing in that direction. How quickly it happens is another thing, as Mr. Cody said, given the brinkmanship that is going on. They are finding it hard to agree on anything and we have seen certain countries dragging their heels on a lot of different fronts. I do not know what is the Irish people's view. Maybe I am sounding very alarmist but that is the way I am reading a lot of the stuff that is coming down the line to us.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	186	Again, I do not want to put forward any kind of figure because if I suggest a figure, that then becomes the figure. The Minister has been consistent in talking about the risks around corporation tax and the concentration. There is even the idea that, in 2019, the top ten paid 40% and, last year, that had gone up to 56%. The year before was the first year that the top ten paid over 50% and up to that year, for a long time, it was probably consistently between 37% and 43%, and then 2020 was the first time it was over 50%. Some of that was impacted by the pandemic because a lot of other businesses were suppressed, so there was a kind of natural suppression across the broad swathe, whereas some of the large companies, whether in pharma or IT, probably had a very good pandemic, so that probably impacted as well. The level of growth in corporation tax receipts this year means it is now well surpassing VAT as the second-largest, and that is the first time that has happened. November just gone had the largest tax receipts for any month in the history of the State at €13.3 billion, and €5.5 billion of that was corporation tax. On one level, it is a great problem to have and, certainly, in any discussion I have about this, it is very positive that we have such healthy tax receipts. This year, we will collect well over €100 billion gross, the first time we have collected over €100 billion. There are challenges and risks and we have to be careful, but when it comes to our organisation, our role is very clear, and that is to collect, as we hope, the right tax at the right time from the right people.

Outside pharma and the big IT companies that we are aware of, is there anything else coming on the horizon, or are there different types of business that have struck Mr. Cody in the last while as turning in quite large corporation taxes as well?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	188	Companies in the pharmaceuticals, life sciences and technology sectors have been attracted in by the IDA over the years. They have invested huge amounts of money in the State and are huge employers. In the context of our corporation tax reports over the last number of years, we have also highlighted the income tax, that is PAYE and PRSI, paid by the employees of those companies. It is well known that the levels of pay are very strong and the proportion of income tax, through PAYE and PRSI, from the multinational sector is very strong as well, which adds to that concentration of tax that we receive from the large companies.

In the North, there is no VAT payable on new-build houses. I have discussed this with various Ministers and have raised it at meetings of my parliamentary party and the response I get is that any changes in that regard would cause a problem with Revenue. They always want to blame somebody else. Would Revenue have an issue with making new-build houses exempt from VAT, as they are in Northern Ireland?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	190	The UK rules on VAT are historical and the country was allowed to keep them because they were in place before it joined the EU. Of course, it can keep them in place now because it has left the EU.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	192	There are limits on what we can do under the EU VAT rules. We have dealt with this issue at various fora and have responded to various parliamentary questions about the options that are available. We apply a 13.5% rate on construction across the board. We could not zero-rate new houses. There are options around social housing but there is no flexibility to have a zero rate on new houses under EU VAT law, which we are bound by.
#AidanDavitt	unknown-#AidanDavitt-party	unknown-#AidanDavitt-dob	unknown-#AidanDavitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	193	It is possible for social housing. Is that correct?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	194	No, not zero-rating. We cannot have zero rating at all. The complexity of the EU VAT Directive in terms of what we can do on reduced rates and the standard rate is significant. I have a bit of form on this because my formative years were spent in the VAT area but if it would be useful, we can give a short summary of what is possible in construction under EU law.

#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	197	I thank our guests for coming before the committee. I will start by picking up on the point made by Senator Davitt on VRT, which was very well made. I have been a huge advocate for and have heaped praise on the Revenue Commissioners for its unbelievable ability to adapt to the crisis that we had and to create the structures required. We passed legislation and the Revenue Commissioners had to put the systems in place. There was a massive effort by Mr. Cody and all of his team. That said, VRT is a real issue. We are hearing time and again from individuals who see the goalposts moving all of the time. An individual contacted me recently whose business is dealing in secondhand cars. In correspondence he said that the VRT on all cars seemed to have been hiked up in the last week because it appeared the Revenue Commissioners had adjusted all vehicle prices. Two weeks prior to that, this individual agreed to purchase a car. According to the VRT calculator at that time, a sum of €3,400 was owing. However, when the sale went through, with a sale and a margin agreed, the VRT calculator said that €4,000 was owing. We can all see what is happening to the value of cars in the secondhand market. It is madness, with cars bought for €18,000 that are worth €26,000 two years later. We understand that but the businesses affected are not getting any communication from Revenue to tell them what is happening. Dealers have found that their profits were completely written out or they were selling cars at a loss to the business. Another issue I want to raise relates to certificates of conformity. I give the example of a business which sold a number of secondhand cars in 2021. The cars were made in Britain and were, therefore, zero rated but one does not get a certificate of conformity for a secondhand car. A year later, Revenue contacted the business and said it wanted to check if the cars really should have been zero rated. The issue presented to me was that in other circumstances, when that business files paperwork, Revenue is able to tell it immediately that the car was produced in Turkey, for example, is not zero-rated and that 10% has to be applied. That is fine because then the business knows the rules. Certainty is what these businesses need. They know the rules and they know that they have to pay at 10% so they build that into the sale price. However, for Revenue to contact them a year later to tell them that a part of the car was not created in the UK, thus wiping out all of the profit, is a serious issue. I say that in the context of Revenue being able to move mountains in order to do what we have been able to do in the last couple of years. I am sure we can get the VRT stuff right too. I am fully aware of the volatility in the secondhand car market which is largely due to Brexit. Businesses are not worried about that. They just want certainty; they want to know what are the rules. If they purchase a car today and the VRT calculator tells them they owe €3,000, they do not want to be surprised when they file their return to discover that the VRT owing is €4,000 because that means a week's work is gone. No business can survive in that environment. I encourage Revenue to look into that. It is interesting that this has been raised today because it has been raised with me on more than one occasion. Mr. Cody's opening statement began with e-gambling. I am not sure why that was the case; perhaps someone asked him to address that issue. A long-overdue gambling law will be enacted next year because the existing law dates back to 1931. We have gaming companies that are operating in this State and paying corporation tax to Revenue but they are operating without a licence. They are operating illegally. Mr. Cody mentioned the fact that Revenue works with the Department of Finance, An Garda Síochána and the Courts Service. When Revenue knows that there is a company filing corporation tax returns that does not have a licence to do what it is doing, does it just accept the money or does it do something about it? There are numerous companies out there that are involved in gaming which do not have licences. They do not have a licence because they cannot get a licence for the type of activity in which they are engaged. If they have a permit, they are breaching all of the conditions of that permit because the type of gaming activity in which they are involved is way beyond what is covered by a permit. I must declare here that I am a director of not-for-profit community music festival in Gweedore that raises money through a gaming permit and a gaming licence, which is why I am familiar with this issue.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	198	I started talking about e-gambling and e-gaming because the invitation from the committee itemised VAT on e-gaming, Pillar Two rules, the Commission on Taxation and Welfare, and any other relevant matters. If the invitation had mentioned VRT, I certainly would have addressed it in my opening statement. I know that VRT is problematic and as the Deputy rightly says, the car market is hugely volatile at the moment. VRT is payable on the open market selling price. We refresh the open market selling price, having regard to market conditions.I do not want to say in relation to any individual case because, obviously, I do not know it. I would definitely be interested in looking at it. I know there are problems with certificates of conformity and I know there is a problem sourcing documentation from the UK. On the system for post-clearance checks, we operate customs controls at the point of entry and we operate post-clearance controls, which are essentially a form of audit where somebody declares paperwork and we subsequently check it, as we do for all the taxes. In some of those circumstances, it turned out that the documentation that is being produced was not correct. We do not have the details at the time. It is like any self-assessment system. We have not confirmed at import that that is the correct documentation. When we do a post-clearance check, we look for documentation. If it turns out that the documentation does not reflect what the case actually is, that is the first time we know about it. That can – and I know it has – give rise to difficulties for some dealers. That is the nature of any audit-type system. People paid their tax or duty on a basis, their business runs on that and it turns out that subsequently there is a liability. There were significant challenges, particularly in the first six months post Brexit on cars. We know there were arrangements in certain cases where it was clear that people did not know what they were doing. Sometimes, in some cases, we were not 100% certain on some aspects of it ourselves. As the Deputy recalls, the final agreement was a couple of days before Christmas and it was coming into effect on 1 January. I am willing to look at any details. VRT is an area in which I am very interested. VRT was introduced in 1993 with the Single Market. The technology and the system also has to be in accordance with EU rules and based on registration. It was never visualised that our biggest source of secondhand cars would not be in the EU. That has complicated issues as well. The bulk of money we collect in VRT comes in automatically from the new car system. It is one of those taxes that 90% of the work on VRT is for 10% of the money. We are used to doing everything the other way around. We want most of the money without any work on trying to get stuff out of it. We want it to be as seamless as possible. Certainly, we have no interest in making it difficult for legitimate businesses. Unfortunately, in the sector we have seen some claims being made that people did not know or they have lost money on this. It was very clear that some businesses were using the system to get a competitive advantage and were taking shortcuts. That is a challenge in all sectors, but there is definitely some element of it in the secondhand car market and we have to balance that.  If the Deputy wants to provide me with any specific details, we will look into them. I think that it would be worthwhile. We would want to talk even to the Department of Transport because there is the licensing and the registration. On whole car sector, back when we became the registration authority in 1993, it was a fairly straightforward concept of registering cars. We now have environmental conditionality around registration. In some ways, there needs to look at who is the registration authority. There is no problem with us being the registration authority because we have the technology to do it, but there are issues around environmental standards that we are not qualified to address fully. That is an area that there could be some significant work done. We have had some initial, very tentative discussions – they probably will not appreciate me saying this – with the Department of Transport. I would be interested in that. On e-gaming, the 1931 Act deals with gambling and the 1956 Act deals with gaming. The 1931 Act and the changes that happened around 2019 around remote bookmakers all deals with licences for gambling. Any of those companies that the Deputy talked about is licensed for gambling. There is no licensing system for gaming. The 1956 Act essentially dealt with gaming machines and things such as roulette machines, one-arm bandits and the like. Clearly, there was no idea that there was going to be e-gaming, so e-gaming is not regulated. A lot of e-gaming comes into Ireland from other member states where gaming and e-gaming are regulated. There was a discussion at the Committee of Public Accounts last week about whether it is illegal. I am not competent to say whether it is illegal or not - I know it is not regulated. However, it is legal and regulated in some member states. Under EU law, VAT is charged for the sake of fiscal neutrality and the like. That has been the subject of European Court of Justice, ECJ, cases. It is all handled through that one-stop shop. We get a portion of the receipts from e-casinos in other member states in respect of Irish players.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	199	I appreciate that information. This is not the core issue - I want to talk about the other issue. As I said, I raised it because it was in Mr. Cody’s opening statement. I am talking about registered companies that are set up here that pay corporation tax on their profits to the Revenue Commissioners that should be operating under the Gaming and Lotteries (Amendment) Act 2019, where they can either get a licence or permit but have neither. If they have, they cannot get a licence because they are for-profit. Licences obviously are for philanthropic organisations or charities and the permits are for very small prize funds and all the rest. Therefore, one cannot be raffling cars and so on and so forth. Yet they are doing it, making big profits and paying taxes. It is more a general question. I am not naming any individual company. When Revenue sees corporation tax being paid, does it have any duty at all to say that the company is operating without any legal basis or operating against the law? It could be in that area or a different field. What responsibility or duty does Revenue have? As the revenue collector, is it just a case of its job is to collect the taxes and make sure the taxes are applied to the profit and it is up to the Garda to decide whether a company is operating within the law? I want to have an understanding on whether there is crossover or any responsibility.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	200	Our obligation is to collect tax that is due, and tax is due on gaming, for example, under EU and Irish VAT law. We have engaged consistently. I think I said last week that 14 years ago I was at a meeting about what was going to be the gambling regulation Bill with the Department of Justice, the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and us. Every few years the issue would come up and the question would be asked why we are collecting tax on what may well be unregulated – we will use that term – areas or where a local authority has banned slot machines. The legislation provides that where a District Court has granted the authority, we have to grant the licence. We operate within the legal framework. We did a big exercise between 2017 and 2019 on illegal gaming machines. We seized 450 across the country, leading to an increase in application for licensing.The gaming premises has to be licensed and each machine has to be licensed. It is a little like our discussion around VRT. Some people took out licences and used them as machine licences when they were clearly not. We seized more than 450 gaming machines throughout the country. There will probably be legal challenges relating to that area. There is good co-operation between Revenue, the Garda, the Department of Justice and the courts. Everybody knows what is happening, but the relevant legislation dates from 1931 and 1956.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	201	Yes. It is as broad as daylight. It is different from some of the other stuff where it is trying to be hidden. I will ask about some core issues. Corporation tax concentration has increased. As Mr. Cody mentioned, the top ten companies made up 40% of such tax just three years ago but that has now increased to 53%. When we look at the group of companies, the figure is 56%, which is a significant increase in corporation tax receipts. In the context of the large corporates division in Revenue, did Revenue anticipate that type of level of increase in corporation tax receipts? It appears it did not. This is not a question of why Revenue did not know, rather, if the officials can give any insight to this committee. There is huge volatility in these receipts. Is there any certainty that next year might repeat itself? Could it even be higher again? We are seeing increases in the region of 50% over a short period. Could we see volatility next year? What is Mr. Cody's insight into the large corporates division that is dealing with these groups, including these ten groups, which make up nearly €10 billion of our corporation tax receipts?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	202	We have significantly increased our large corporates division and we continue to increase the resources for work in that area. We spoke previously about realigning our structure and trying to increase resources to deal with these areas of higher risk. Our first engagement is to ensure that what is paid is correct. Every year, in the context of the annual budgetary cycle, we engage with the top 30 multinational groups. We survey them on their expectations for the coming year and on any further insights they might have. I will not say that includes the longer term because "longer term" does not make any sense in this area and I do not think these multinationals are any better equipped than us. That engagement takes place. When the monthly Exchequer receipts come out, every so often the Department of Finance highlights the fact that a once-off factor is included for that month, which is a result of information we received. The tendency, by the companies and Revenue, has very much been to take a conservative view. It is not in any way to understate what will happen. It is because there is such uncertainty about what is happening in the economy. That process takes place. We collate that material and feed it into the Department of Finance. I am constantly amazed, whether business reporting returns are published on a quarterly, six-monthly or annual basis, about the surprise in the marketplace regarding company A's results being X% above or below expectations, when we look at a quarterly period. There is huge volatility. The size and scale of some of the companies, and probably the nature of the businesses they are in, means they have in-built volatility. For example, there is obvious volatility in pharma. There are also technical issues around capital allowances, intellectual property allowances and timescales for how capital allowances are written down. Individual companies can significantly impact on that. If we look at the figures, we can say that the rate of growth has been in a unique period post-Covid during which we probably had accelerated profitability condensed into a period. That is clearly slowing down in the tech sector and whatever is happening-----

I presume that will go up to €22 billion or possibly €23 billion by the time the year is out. Mr. Cody is the best person with any type of insight into where corporation tax is likely to land next year. We talked about betting and gambling. If Mr. Cody was to take a punt on it, is he of the view that we are likely to see those receipts being repeated? Will we see them going back to 2021 levels? Where does he see things at?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	204	The figures that were published at budget time had input from the Revenue survey. The figures for next year are something like €22 billion. Next year's figures will probably be where this year's figures are, which is the out-turn. The projected increase was quite small but I see no reason for it not to be in that ballpark.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	208	Obviously, the lay-offs concern me. If it involves people losing their jobs that concerns me, but in the overall context and numbers, the figures do not concern me at this stage. If there is a downturn, one of the things I will consider is that it would probably bring tax receipts back to where they would have been, if some of the excesses of the past two years had not taken place. The figures just jumped up and it was probably intended for there to be more like that. I do not know how that comes across in the report.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	210	Yes.

To move on from that, quite a lot is required of Revenue in order to prepare for the OECD's base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, including IT modernisation and new systems being in place for pillar 1 and pillar 2. Will Mr. Cody talk to us about whether Revenue has drafted in an additional team? Has it got the resources? What is it doing to prepare for that? Pillar 2 is to take effect through an EU directive by the end of next year. If the EU directive is applied by the end of next year but America may not have joined up, has there been any assessment of what that would do to our corporation tax base? Has Revenue any assessment regarding that risk, which may or may not materialise? There was a sense that the OECD package would cost us €2 billion. That is very outdated. At this stage, does Revenue suggest that is not the reality? Instead of putting words into his mouth, I invite Mr. Cody to comment on that. I know we cannot pin down exactly what it would cost but have we a little more idea of the shape of what may happen? I invite Mr. Cody to comment on that. I will then speak on Irish real estate funds, IREFs, if that is okay.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	214	If we use up all the time on the OECD question, we might never get to IREFs.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	216	I remind the Deputy that I cannot talk about policy matters. I mentioned the challenges we face earlier. Taking it that the directive will be adopted and will apply to accounting periods that begin after 31 December 2023, it will be legislated for in the finance Bill next year. There will be a significant body of legislation required. A significant redesign of our corporation tax will be required because it affects a small number of cases in pillar 1. In pillar 2, we think there are in the region of 70 or so Irish-headquartered entities, with about 1,700 companies out of that. There are probably about 1,700 non-Irish-headquartered entities, with about 7,000 to 8,000 entities off them. We are probably talking about 10,000 entities in scope. Some of those are non-trading, but there is a significant level of engagement. We have to design a reporting system that will have to be consistent with the EU and the OECD, because this will form the basis of a reallocation to ensure the minimum 15% is paid across each jurisdiction. Then there will have to be transparency for other countries. If you take it that the accounting year will start on 1 January 2024 and the year end will be 31 December 2024, that will be the first full year of accounting. The normal corporation tax reporting for that entity will be September 2025. The pillar 2 agreement provides for reporting on the pillar 2 element 15 months after the end of the accounting period. In the first year or two, that will be 18 months. We will have our normal corporation tax reporting after nine months, and then nine months hence there will be the pillar 2 process. We have to develop a corporation tax reporting system to reflect that report. We have to develop our IT systems and engage with business and their accounting systems have to tie in with ours. A big challenge for us in pillars 1 and 2 is that they rely on accounting principles as opposed to the tax principles and computations we are used to. There is a significant capacity and skills-building process that we will need. On additional people, in recent years we have significantly increased the resources and numbers working in the: international tax; business tax policy and legislation; large corporates; and medium enterprise divisions, which are the four divisions that will be impacted by this. I am conscious that the Deputy was asking questions on Committee Stage about resourcing and whether we are adequately resourced. As long as I have been in this job, we have been hugely supported in the context of any case we made. The challenges are significant, however. Since 2018, some 3,000 people have left our organisation, mostly through retirement. I do not know why I pointed at myself, but that reflects the demographic of where we are. Some 3,500 people have joined our organisation in those five years. The challenge for us is that bringing people in on their own is not sufficient. There is a development process involved and you cannot bring in too many people at the same time. I see two big challenges for us over the next few years. The first is the continued investment in technology. Members have talked about what we have been able to do but we have ambitious plans in technology and the corporation tax modernisation because the worst thing we could do is implement pillar 2 for 15 months without looking at corporation tax reporting. We have to use that opportunity, go in there and do a real refresh. What happens with systems is-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	218	We keep adding on. Ms Kennedy could take about this at length because she developed the PAYE technology system and she knows this far better than I do. We have ambitious plans there and it is important for Ireland that we continue to be effective at what we are doing. That is one challenge. We also have a challenge in continuing to attract people to join us who have the right skills. Some of these skills are not in the marketplace. When we started our transfer pricing process in 2010 we gradually built it up to now having a significant transfer pricing resource. Part of the challenge is that the nature of the Irish tax rate at the time meant there was not a core competence in the marketplace and so we have had to develop a lot of that ourselves. Obviously, we will lose some of them to tax practitioners. In recent years, the flow has not all been one way. We attract a lot of people in from the firms because we can give a quality of work and life, both of which are important. I welcome the Deputy’s consistent support in respect of what we need in order to do our job. That support is cross-party, and long may it continue. I forget what the Deputy wanted me to finish on in the context of praising ourselves.

I appreciate the level and complexity of work in the systems that have to be put in place for pillars 1 and 2. Just like Brexit, it is not finished yet so it is hard to develop something that is not there.

That was the other thing. I also want to ask about the impact there would be if Europe goes with the directive while others may stay out, particular America. How could that impact us?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	222	Pillar 2 is clearly more certain on some levels. It looks like the EU will have a directive, so that will be mandatory for all member states. In other countries it is optional but the US has already moved and its system not fully compatible. It is not the same as pillar 2 but it has its categorisations of guilty. It looks like they will have an increase in their rate. The remaining complexity around pillar 2 and putting figures on it involves the following. The big aspect of it is the interaction of the US rules and pillar 2 and who will end up with the taxing rights of the additional money, which is not certain. To the extent that anyone has commonly held views on corporation tax, the commonly held view is that there will be extra money with an additional 2.5%. It is not clear that the additional money will accrue to Ireland.

I have a question about the amount of withholding tax being paid by IREFs in recent years. The taxable amount has increased. If one looks at just the two most recent years for which there are reports, the amount involved went from €369 million to €621 million but the dividend withholding tax nearly halved during the same period. Despite the taxable amount nearly doubling, the withholding tax has dropped off. The effective rate now being paid by IREFs is less than 6%. When it was introduced, it was coming in at about 18%. It moved down to about a 13% effective rate, back up to 18% and is now down below 6%. Some of this may be due to those who are shareholders in terms of pension funds and so on. Does Revenue have any concern about what we are seeing in terms of withholding tax and the sharp fall in it? What is Revenue's view on that? I know it is doing a review on it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	230	We are carrying out a review. Over the years, there has been many a debate with the Minister around the whole sector. The changes that have taken place over time have been as a result of us looking at what is going on. This goes back to our large corporates division realignment. We set up a branch specifically around the whole area of, let us call them, funds. They are not big payers of tax in the context of the tax that we are responsible for. I remember many a time we were asked how many audits we did on them; we looked at it and said, "Why would do an audit on them? They will not have a tax liability". We have a branch in large cases looking at the whole funds industry. Over the past while, between that branch and our policy and legislation people, we have been keen to find out what is going on in the sector, what trends are going on in the sector, and, to the extent that unintended consequences are happening, to bring them to the attention of the Department. Some of the changes over the past number of years have come as a result of that work. That branch is actively looking at, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, shareholders exempt distributions, etc. I am not saying that there is anything wrong in the sector but we want to establish the facts and if there is something we should bring to the attention of the Department, we will. That work is ongoing.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	232	It is a little bit more,. I have the figures. There were 16 in 2020, 16 in 2019 and ten in 2018.

Is that not correct? I am not asking Mr. Cody to explain the case. In instances like that, where Revenue has pursued an individual - I am entitled to say it because it is public knowledge in relation to this-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	240	Absolutely. The Deputy is entitled to say it.

Revenue pursued them and won both cases in the High Court and the Court of Appeal. Some €400,000 will be paid in that levy. Will Mr. Cody explain if the legal costs that would apply? I assume Revenue built up quite a significant amount of legal costs in that case. I commend Revenue; it is important to pursue these issues to the nth degree. Does Revenue have a concern about that fact that there is a smaller number of people paying the non-domiciled levy? Mr. Cody mentioned that there is €2.5 billion of debt tax outstanding through the warehouse scheme. This was important in the Covid-19 period. There is a crunch period, given the economic environment and uptick in insolvencies. I understand that some of that debt has been written off in recent times; it was €26.4 million. Will Mr. Cody give the committee an indication of how much of that debt tax warehousing Revenue expects to receive? We always knew when there was debt warehousing that not every bit of debt was going to be collected, it is the same in terms of taxable accrued, with companies falling into insolvency and so on. Is that in keeping with Revenue's expectations? Is that lower or higher than Revenue's expectation? Where does Revenue see it going?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	242	On challenges, court cases and tax litigation, tax is and has been a very litigious area. My counterpart in the Department of Social Protection was decrying the idea that some of the social welfare cases now involve legal people; I said, "That is our territory. It has always been our territory". In the Tax Appeals Commission, there has been significant improvement in dealing with a whole legacy of cases and the legacy cases are now nearly gone from the tax appeal situation. We will start to see cases coming through in a shorter time frame. Whether it is seven or ten years, by the time a case goes to appeal - it used to have to go through the Circuit Court but that is no longer there - it must first have gone to the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court. There is also the potential to go to the European courts. There are a few types of cases. One is a case which is trying to clarify what is intended in the legislation. I have been asked if I mind losing cases. I try not to see it as winning or losing. Some of them are clarifying the treatment of the law. There are other cases that I feel strongly about winning or losing. There are cases relating to avoidance that we pursue. While you will not find me talking about the matter, the publication of the determinations in tax appeal cases - and in fairness to The Currency and much of its subsequent coverage in this regard - has been a positive part of the tax environment. In those types of cases, if we win, we seek our costs, as happens normally. In cases where we lose, we will always end up paying costs. Deputy Pearse Doherty: TeThat is just the nature of the system that we are in. The other part of the realignment at the time was with our large cases division. It used to deal with large cases on high-wealth individuals, HWIs. In many ways, because of the scale of the large cases, the high-wealth work was never fully resourced. In 2017 we divided them and an assistant secretary-led division was resourced to deal with high-wealth individuals but also to deal with anti-avoidance, which would have been carried out mainly by the tier of people below the HWIs. Again, we continued to invest in that and it is really important work because it goes to the heart of trust in the system.  The debt warehouse is unprecedented, there never was such a thing before. I remember initial discussions, or chat rather, about what we should do. We suspended enforcement and the collection of interest in March 2020 but it would have been unsustainable to do that without legislation. Half the people would give out to us for not collecting tax and the other half would give out to us for collecting it. The debt warehouse became a very useful weapon in our armoury. Hopefully, we will not have to use it again in a lifetime. We structured it in such a way as to support businesses but also to support businesses when the pandemic finished. There was the year interest free and then the 3% cuts in from next January and next May for the people who were extended because of the new health restrictions last November. In September, when we saw the impact of the energy crisis we extended that period for a year, for people to engage with us. We have extended it 3% and that is a really attractive rate. I am not surprised because I think the €26 million is very low and most of that has happened because either a company went into liquidation or examinership or the small company administrative rescue process, SCARP. The €26 million is neither here nor there in the context of €2.5 billion.  The extension was really necessary because of the energy crisis. It depends on what is happening in a year's time but what we want to do is have a tailored arrangement for each of the companies. We will not have something where everybody has to pay 40% down and enter into an instalment arrangement over two years. We will look at the circumstances of each case. Some businesses are paying, because right now there is the zero interest getting cleared before the end of December. The reality is that there are over 70,000 cases with money in the warehouse and of those, 7,300 of them have debt in excess of €50,000. Many of them have essentially their January-February 2020 liability. They closed down, then they started partially trading and they paid their current liability. They left their January-February debt there. Some of them are very small, only a few hundred euro, but about 7,300 that have debt in excess of €50,000. That accounts for €2.1 billion of the €2.5 billion. Essentially, that is the chunk of the money. I would be very confident that a significant portion of it will be paid. I think that there are businesses currently looking at their banking finance and the interest rates. They look at the 3% and they say if we could pay off more expensive debt, it makes sense to leave the Revenue debt sitting there. Also I think the inflation will have a significant impact on the issue. Two years ago, in the context of budget arithmetic, a figure was put in of a 25% write-off but it was not scientifically based, it was just recognising that there would be a write off. Generally, for debt that is not paid within a first few months, they level a write-off. But this is planned debt. The important thing that people do not take seriously enough is that to retain the warehousing facility, people have to file and pay their current returns on time. We can see it very clearly, probably half of the businesses in the warehouse are totally abiding by those dates and the others are not as scrupulous. We are going to be quite firm on that because that will undermine the system. The message that I would like to give is that we continue to engage with businesses and if they cannot pay their current liability, they need to engage with us. If they do not, then not only will we be looking for the current liability but we will be cancelling the warehousing facility. If a business's warehousing facility is cancelled it will lose the value of the zero rate and the 3% rate from the start, so the money that the business owes for January-February 2020 would then be liable to 10% interest from 2020. That is how it is legally structured and the key issue is that businesses pay their current liability. I do not think that everybody fully understands that. We were quite lenient through the process but that is a message that needs to be heard. At the Committee of Public Accounts last week we had a chapter about a pragmatic approach to tax clearance. The challenge is that if we had employed tax clearance as rigidly as we could have, then X number of people would not have qualified for the support systems. We could not have done that when we had a debt warehousing system that if they had, they would not have had to pay the money. Now we do not have a debt warehousing absolution, that is really important. When we talk about a business's due date for VAT, for September-October is 23 November, a lot of small businesses treat that as 23 January. We will be very much following the legislation around due month. From our perspective, this is an opportunity for businesses to move to that idea of the due month actually meaning the due month. When the wage subsidy was first introduced, we built it on due month compliance, payroll compliance at the end of February, and people were surprised. Many people were used to sending it in six months late every time. We might even have had representations about it from Members of the Oireachtas lobbying for businesses saying that they meant to do it on time. This is a really serious consequence of not doing things properly. If someone has a difficulty with their current liability they should file it and engage with us. We will not throw any business that engages with us out of the warehouse.

They thought something and the Revenue thought something different. Does the witness think it would be helpful to have a medium resolution-type forum instead of going to court? Would some kind of halfway house be possible? I have made contact with Revenue on behalf of people and while I have found its officials to be helpful, sometimes people's opinion is X and the Revenue thinks Y. It would be remiss use the word, "ombudsman" but there could be a process.Could there be a process other than going to court? That seems to be the only definite answer in anything with Revenue. Perhaps there is an easier way of dealing with it. I am curious about Mr. Cody's opinion.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	249	We are subject to the Ombudsman, but the Tax Appeals Commission is an efficient, effective and low-cost process. Some of the cases we talked about involve significant legal and accountancy advice, but we try to sort out ordinary cases with our review process. The Tax Appeals Commission is effective and quick. The significant arrears were a challenge but it is now dealing with cases in real time. It is a first level, relatively informal process, and certainly when it is an individual taxpayer, the Tax Appeals Commission deals with it. I have said it here a number of times. The reform of the tax appeals system is one of the biggest administrative improvements across the board.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	251	The vast majority of cases are sorted out at a tax appeals level.

I will not go through them all as we are scheduled to finish in 15 minutes, but a lot of damage can be done in 15 minutes. I welcome our guests and thank them for their helpful assistance in various cases we have to deal with regularly. I will go quickly through the issues that caught my attention. I want to clarify one thing about corporation profits tax and the so-called ongoing debate about the future level. I thought it was settled at 15%. It is not an ongoing question of how long is a piece of string. There is no further discussion on that and that point needs to be clearly and solidly made.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	256	Absolutely.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	257	That is good. I am glad to hear that. Notwithstanding the increased level of payment of the relatively strong corporation profits tax, has Revenue seen any difference or is there any resistance on the part of foreign direct investment companies in relation to the new regime? How do they feel about it? Will it become an incentive or encouragement to move locations?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	258	Again, this is not my area of responsibility or competence but I listen carefully to what the IDA says. The Deputy mentioned earlier the need for certainty. Ireland is a hugely attractive place. The results show that and the idea of that certainty of 15% being a fixed figure is important. If we can get agreement to the finality, individual countries will not be taking unilateral actions. For a small open economy, a multilateral agreement that gives certainty to businesses and allows them to plan is in our interest. That is positive for us.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	259	I agree. The second-hand car market was mentioned. When a car is traded in, dealers should take account of where it is going and the trade-in price or whatever. They will have to plan accordingly and will do so in order not to lose half a fortune in the course of it. Gaming and e-gambling bring the concept of gambling much closer to the gambler or the speculator or whatever we call it. Is Mr. Cody satisfied that sufficient resources are available to the Department to ensure gambling does not become a kind of pandemic racing out of control? The availability of the technology to the person who is speculating in that area is much greater and more sophisticated than it was and it has ways and means of encouraging participation, which we need to keep a close eye on. I stay away from policy. I noticed, incidentally, that the job of the Committee of Public Accounts is explicitly to stay away from policy. It does wander into that area but there are very strict regulations insofar as it wanders into that area and I am quite sure Mr. Cody has reminded the committee of that. If he has not, I have had to do so on several occasions. I will finish with this possibility. Where businessmen or women decide to move to a different location in the country for business purposes or whatever compelling reason, they will rent a house and rent out their existing house because they are not going to buy a house for a short time of two, three, four or five years or whatever the case may be. My speculation is there should be a contra figure where the expenditure on one side is offset against the income on the other side. That does not apply at the moment and I have come across a few cases like that. I fail to understand why that cannot be done. I am not suggesting Mr. Cody should go into the policy part of this but I have views on it. We have all dealt with these issues from time to time and there are some compelling cases where taxpayers should not have been at a loss due to having to move their business for all kinds of reasons. They would have had an income and would have lost on both counts. Such people pay for an extra house or accommodation and they lose the income from the house they have rented out. I will not go through the rest. I will be good as we only have ten minutes left. There are oodles of cases. I would love to have at least an hour to go through them but Mr. Cody will be glad to know I will reserve them for another date. I am sure the Chair agrees.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	260	I thank the Deputy. I do not know whether that was a threat to invite me back for another day-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	262	-----or a promise. If that is wanted, it is not a problem. On the second-hand cars, the issue does not relate to trade-ins and purchases. It is specifically about second-hand cars being brought in from Britain. That is the issue. Regarding gaming and resources, as we said, we are not responsible for the regulation of gaming and gambling. There are many views about aspects of the Gambling Regulation Bill 2022. This is me breaking the rules and straying into policy areas. It is important the gambling sector be regulated in an up-to-date manner. If everyone cannot have all their interests dealt with in the one go, the reality is, if there is a gambling regulator, it can always be revisited at various times. If this opportunity is not taken, I am afraid we might spend another 14 years talking about what we should have. On the idea of being able to offset rent from a property against rent a person might have to pay to rent a property, I will take the Deputy's advice and not speak about policy matters.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	263	I should also have mentioned the area of technology. Is Mr. Cody satisfied Revenue has access to sufficient technology and the necessary funding to provide for the various scales and levels of different taxation of all levels of business to ensure the minimum interruption and gaps?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	264	We will need significant investment in our technology. I believe we will need it all. The reality is that the Revenue online system, which was groundbreaking, is 22 years old in technology. That would have been, and still is, world leading. It has been upgraded. Things have been done to it but basically the Revenue online system in the context of technology systems is an old-age pensioner. We have investment plans over the next number of years. We have always received great support from the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform but the reality is this is a multi-year project. The challenge is that we cannot do two years and then have a break. This is a constant. We also have to implement every year's budget changes and finance Bill changes as well. We use opportunities to do elements of our technology refresh as we are implementing schemes or changes in the budget.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	265	The Revenue Commissioners are responsible for customs as well. Recently a number of Deputies were approached by fuel distributors who deal with coal, gas, briquettes and so on. With the changes coming in with regard to how much of those reserves can be used in Ireland, how are the Revenue Commissioners capturing the cross-Border activity that is going on? It seems to be a growth area. People are coming into towns and villages, selling fuel door to door, which is illegal here. The fuel distributors are complaining to us that it has an awful impact on their business. How do the Revenue Commissioners reassure those legitimate business owners and operators that they are alert to this and are pursuing individuals or companies engaged in illegally selling that product around the country?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	266	I hate to start the answer like this but I will do so anyhow. The primary responsibility for addressing illegal fuel lies with the local authorities in regard to licensing, and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications. They have responsibility for the allowing of sale of illegal coal. With regard to cross-Border activity, because of the Northern Ireland protocol, there are no Border controls between Northern Ireland and the Irish market. There is no legal basis for us to have Border controls on fuel coming in. Our responsibility in respect of fuel relates to the solid fuel carbon tax. The challenge we have is there are essentially two regimes that have a significant price differential. There is no carbon tax in Northern Ireland and there is a reduced rate of VAT. We have no role in regard to smoky coal for example. We are concerned about the tax challenges relating to it. Last Friday, I sat in on a meeting about the policing of the solid fuel carbon tax and the plans we have started. There were new regulations from the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications last October. We already engage with the local authorities. Next year we want a programme of controls in which we will invite the local authorities to accompany us on multilateral vehicle patrols to establish whether there are people coming down with loads. I am worried that there are retailers who source their fuel knowing that it is not subject to control. There a business is selling fuel it has sourced from a wholesaler in Northern Ireland. We want to do a programme analysing where sales are. We talked about this. The legitimate wholesale trade can see where retailers are not sourcing their fuel from it. We would be interested in any of that intelligence and it will be dealt with in a confidential manner. When the solid fuel carbon tax was introduced in legislation, one of the challenges was that it was to be commenced by ministerial order. The desire at the time was that there would be a carbon tax on both sides of the Border that would be brought in at the same time. It never happened in the North. The price differential now is significant. The challenges are that some fuel merchants in the North are doing sales and deliveries in the South. They are doing it on housing estates. We are interested in building up intelligence on that to see how we can enforce a debt. However, it is not like customs. If someone was bringing in tobacco illegally from France through Rosslare we would seize the goods and the vehicle. If someone is bringing in smoky coal from the North we have no powers to do what a border would normally involve. It is a challenge when you have two regimes, one of which has a big price differential, but you do not have border controls. I am most worried about the idea that businesses are selling fuel they have sourced in the North. Then there is a wider issue. There is a VAT issue and an income tax issue. It is not just about solid fuel.

The busiest time of the year is now and into the first quarter of next year. That is their busy time when they make their money for the rest of the year. I have received a number of calls from retailers selling coal about wholesalers in the North coming down, door to door, in some cases with a link online to contact and order coal. On one hand, we cannot fault people who are under pressure financially but the damage they are doing to coal and fuel merchants is now reaching a point where they are not prepared to tolerate it any more. What they do about it then is they come to people like me and other Deputies. They are currently undertaking a report about the situation. However, if the evidence is anything to go by it is a serious business being undertaken which is illegal, wrong and depriving the country of its tax-----
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	272	There are also health issues.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	273	The knock on from that is “And by the way, can you get me X in the North?”, and then other products are coming in. I understand the issue with the Border. However, I am concerned about the small businesses that are affected by bigger wholesalers coming in and giving prices that cannot be matched.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	274	The enforcement agency in this area is the local authority. There is a big health issue as well, including around the environment and the impact of smoky fuel. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, produced an interesting report two weeks ago about the level of enforcement activity by local authorities. There is a range of enforcement. It comes down to individual interest, whether it is chief executives or others. We want to engage with each local authority. My colleagues will be aware that I share the Chair’s concerns. The assistant secretary who was involved in that area is retired now. He campaigned long and hard for the commencement order not to be made. This comes down to a price differential. The likelihood of change happening in Northern Ireland is limited and it is exacerbated now by the energy crisis and the fact that probably solid fuel tends to be the fuel of necessity for many people who are poor.

Certain actions will then be taken, presumably from there.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	276	The issue is that it is a very difficult challenge to get it. I saw some of the price differential. I will not say it is half the price-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	280	From the Chair’s engagement with fuel sector representatives, did they voice any concern around retailers sourcing fuel from the North and selling it off record?

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	282	In some ways, that is nearly more damaging. There is always an element of cross-Border shopping in the Border counties, depending on price differentials. It goes both ways. It becomes very challenging. We would have seen this with fuel laundering when we were closing down fuel plants in Portlaoise or Waterford. When it permeates out down through where we are from, if it goes that far, that will not be a wholesaler selling door to door. That will be sold through-----

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-14 00:00:00	Business of Joint Committee	284	The sector has intelligence. They know who has stopped buying. Much of the work that we did on fuel fraud had to do with getting supply chain information. I refer to part of the solution to this and some of the stuff we were talking about. For example, no coal is produced in Ireland. It all has to be imported It is either coming in from legal shipments or illicitly. There trade often knows much more about what is happening on the ground than we will ever know. Sometimes the trade is quick to make representation but slow to provide details.
