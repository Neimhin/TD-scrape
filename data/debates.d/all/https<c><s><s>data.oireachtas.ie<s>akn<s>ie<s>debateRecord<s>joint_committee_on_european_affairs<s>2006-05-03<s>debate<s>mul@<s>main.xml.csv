On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Mrs. Benisheva, Bulgarian Ambassador to Ireland, to discuss Bulgaria's progress towards EU accession. The normal procedure is for the Ambassador to make a short presentation and then we will have a question and answer session.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Mr. Chairman, honourable members of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, it is a great honour for me to present my country today as a future partner in the European Union. Two years ago on 1 May 2004 Ireland, holding the Presidency of the European Union, welcomed ten new member states from central and eastern Europe, Cyprus and Malta. This biggest ever enlargement of the European Union was designed to put an end to divisions from the past and to bring peace and prosperity in Europe. The forthcoming accession of Bulgaria and Romania constitutes an integral part of the same project, which has been implemented in two stages. In reasoning to the point that we belong to the same, fifth round of enlargement, I wish to briefly recall the track record of Bulgaria's relationship with the European Union.The European Union Association Agreement was signed in 1993 and provided for the establishment of an enhanced political dialogue, strengthened co-operation and progressive liberalisation of trade leading to a free trade zone. Like the other European Union Association Agreement countries from central and eastern Europe, Bulgaria deposited its application for membership in 1995 following the decisions taken by the Copenhagen European Council to the effect that countries from central and eastern Europe that so desire might become members of the Union, provided they meet the necessary criteria. In 1997 the European Union decided to launch the fifth enlargement as a comprehensive, inclusive and irreversible process, at that time comprising 12 applicant countries. Accession negotiations with Bulgaria, along with six other candidates, commenced in February 2000. In April 2003 on the occasion of the signature of the Accession Treaty with the ten new member states the Union adopted the "One Europe" Declaration confirming that the fifth enlargement would be complete only when Bulgaria and Romania join the Union. The principles guiding the process from the very beginning will continue to apply until their accession. In May 2004 during the Irish Presidency, the Union welcomed ten new members. In December 2004 the Union decided to complete negotiations with Bulgaria and Romania. The Accession Treaty was signed in April 2005. The fifth enlargement is to be completed in 2007, ten years after its start, with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.Against this background we wish to reiterate the point that our accession to the Union is not another round of enlargement. It is a part of the same political project of reuniting Europe on the basis of shared values. Bulgaria, like the other countries from central and eastern Europe faced the double challenge of political and economic transformation alongside preparation to assume the obligations of membership. In the course of 11 years since its application, Bulgaria has been vigorously implementing reforms in order to meet membership criteria, including, transforming the institutions to guarantee democracy, rule of law, protection of human rights and rights of minorities, transforming the economy and improving its capacity to cope with market forces within the Union, transposing and implementing the Community Acquis to prepare for participation in the Union’s policies.The Bulgarian journey to the European Union was not an easy one.In our pursuit to conform with membership criteria we had to take some difficult and unpopular decisions such as reducing capacity in the steel sector to comply with state aid rules. In the energy sector, to comply with nuclear safety requirements, we undertook to comply fully with the environmental acquis and allocated investment resources to meet the requirements.On CFSP matters Bulgaria has consistently aligned its position with that of the Union thus contributing before accession to its political weight as a global player. With its active policy for developing regional co-operation in south-eastern Europe, Bulgaria de facto contributes to the objective of further enhancing and consolidating the stabilising role of the Union in the region. This role will be definitively affirmed with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania.During these years we were not alone in our efforts to prepare for accession — we have been constantly guided and assisted by the Union. In this respect the pre-accession financial aid extended under the PHARE, ISPA and SAPARD programmes proved a valuable instrument of support.We are grateful for the bilateral assistance extended by Ireland, sharing with us best practices and experience on how to deal with the challenges of membership. In the course of 2005, technical assistance has been granted to Bulgaria in the following areas: debt management, renewable energy, information and communications technology, milk quota management and on how to participate in the decision-making process. Irish consultants continue to provide assistance on the ground in Bulgaria, for example, on financial management and control of structural funds. We look on Ireland as a role model, in particular the way in which Ireland benefited from membership.Bulgaria is determined to accomplish the goal of assuming the obligations of EU membership on 1 January 2007. Since the signature of the Treaty of Accession in April 2005 all efforts have been concentrated on completing the reforms and delivering on commitments. The European Commission, in its comprehensive monitoring report of October last year, identified the areas in which further action is needed. Another report is due on 16 May and yet another in October this year.The enhanced monitoring provided the framework for a regular dialogue between the Bulgarian authorities and our partners in a joint effort to make accession a success. To illustrate the intensity of this dialogue, between January and today, 20 peer reviews and 55 expert missions to Bulgaria have been organised.Following the findings and recommendations identified in the reports, Bulgaria is making a determined effort to address remaining challenges. Particular attention is being devoted to the areas of judicial reform, the reform strategy launched in 2001 is in its fifth year of implementation, and enhanced efforts are devoted to improving the functioning of the judicial system. The national assembly recently adopted by qualified majority amendments to the Bulgarian Constitution. These amendments aim to improve the operation of the judiciary and of investigation at the pre-trial stage as well as the establishment of a more accountable judiciary.On the basis of the constitutional changes, amendments to the legislation on the judiciary are under consideration to ensure an improved system of appointments and career development of magistrates. Other legislation has been adopted to improve the legal base for implementation of reforms and enhance the efficiency of combatting crime and corruption. For example, the new criminal procedure code will be enforced on the basis of the constitutional amendment.A new ministry of state administration and administrative reform has been established with responsibility for the modernisation and organisational development of state administration. The legislation on administration and on civil servants has been amended to enhance accountability, reliability and predictability in the work of the state administration. The adoption of the administrative procedure code is expected to boost the strengthening of the overall capacity of the public administration and to impact in a positive manner on the administrative service as one of the strategic goals of the administrative reform.In a transition time, vulnerable groups in society suffer most. The Bulgarian Government admits that additional efforts are needed to promote full integration of people with disabilities into society, especially by improving access to public areas, buildings and transport as well as educational and labour services. Particular attention is needed to improve conditions in orphanages, hospitals and homes for people with mental disabilities. Measures are being taken for transferring persons with disabilities from specialized institutions to community-based social services. A number of activities are envisaged under the national programme for child protection concerning the protection of children from violence and abuse and to guarantee equal access to quality education. We are appreciative of the assistance rendered by Irish NGOs. For 2005 financial assistance for 17 different projects to the amount of €100,000 has been granted.Concerning the integration of ethnic minorities, the Bulgarian Government is speeding up the implementation of the framework programme for equal integration of Roma in Bulgarian society. Co-ordinated measures are being taken by central and regional authorities and NGOs for integration of ethnic minorities in the fields of education, employment, health care and housing. The Bulgarian Government recently approved a national programme for the improvement of Roma housing conditions.The economic transformation was a notable success in meeting membership criteria. Bulgaria maintained a high degree of macro-economic stability, with strong economic growth in the range of 5% to 6%. The estimate for 2005 indicates an increase of 5.6% in GDP. Bulgaria also experienced a low inflation rate, a balanced budget and falling unemployment. The currency board arrangement pegging the national currency to the euro will be maintained until accession to the eurozone. As with the other countries from the fifth enlargement Bulgaria committed to participate in economic and monetary union from the date of accession as a member state with a derogation.Structural reforms have been further deepened in all areas and are broadly in line with key objectives of the Lisbon Agenda. The main share of value added, 51%, is generated by the services sector, followed by the industrial sector. The share of agriculture is diminishing and according to latest statistical data agriculture accounts for 9.4% of GDP.The level of economic integration with the EU is high. Statistical data for 2005 revealed that the EU 25 account for 56.5% of total exports and for almost 50% of total Bulgarian imports. Bilateral trade with Ireland is expanding, with imports to Bulgaria substantially outpacing our exports to Ireland. Foreign direct investment coming from the EU 25 accounts for 77% of total foreign direct investment in 2005. Irish outward investment to Bulgaria gradually increased over recent years and as at the end of 2005 Ireland ranks 16th in the list of 32 major investor countries.These results have been acknowledged by our partners as indicative of the successful transformation of the Bulgarian economy in meeting the membership economic criteria, particularly in strengthening the capacity of the Bulgarian economy to cope with competitive pressure upon accession. In the national context the achievements indicate that economic reforms are beginning to pay off. In line with the strong economic expansion and further to the active labour market policy, the employment situation continues to improve. These developments give ground to expect gradual reversal of migration flows in the way in which inward migration gained pace in Ireland.Preparing for accession to the EU proved to be a very demanding task. We admit that additional efforts and resources are needed to implement the commitments and requirements of membership fully, in particular in such areas as the protection of the environment, security of energy supply, and the development of trans-European transport networks, for which high levels of investment are needed. That will be the main focus of attention under the Structural and Cohesion Funds after accession.I will say a few words about the regional dimension of accession. Over the years, Bulgaria has been an active proponent of stability in south-eastern Europe. We enjoy good neighbourly relations with all countries and actively participate in initiatives for regional co-operation. In particular, I wish to single out the process of co-operation in south-eastern Europe, an initiative aimed at enhancing political dialogue and economic links among countries. The various formats of meetings allow the comprehensive exchange of views in matters of common interest in the region. We expect that at tomorrow's meeting of the prime ministers of the countries of south-eastern Europe, a decision will be taken for Bulgaria to take the rotating presidency from April 2007. One hopes that by that time, in addition to Greece, there will be two more EU member states participating in the regional initiative.Regional co-operation contributes to establishing a climate of confidence and facilitates dialogue to find lasting solutions to unresolved issues affecting all countries in the region. We are also convinced that regional co-operation, particularly those initiatives emanating from the region itself, are an important asset to the Thessaloniki Agenda launched by the Union.For Bulgaria, the last decade has been dominated by political and economic reforms inspired by the objective of joining the Union and becoming part of its major political project, expanding the area of peace, stability and prosperity in Europe. Over the years, the political will to be yet another champion of that project has remained intact. In some cases, the reforms have been costly and painful for Bulgarian citizens. Nevertheless, accession to the Union continues to enjoy a high level of support in Bulgarian society, at approximately 70%.It is our humble belief that the accession of Bulgaria and Romania will present potential benefits for the existing member states by spreading stability and prosperity to an additional 30 million people in eastern Europe, providing greater EU prominence in world affairs, enriching the Union's cultural diversity and fuelling economic growth.I am confident that Ireland, having been part of the first enlargement of the European Community, will be willing to extend similar opportunities to the people of the two new member states. The unveiling of the monument Convergence on 1 May 2006 to mark the second anniversary of the Day of Welcomes testifies to that conviction. I am also confident that existing links between Bulgaria and Ireland will be further enhanced by our partnership as members of the European Union.I thank members for their attention.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank the ambassador for a very comprehensive review. It is clear that Irish-Bulgarian relations have developed very significantly in recent years. Bulgaria has made enormous progress, something not ignored by Irish investors. We all know that many of them are buying property in Bulgaria, being much attracted by tourism in the country.In her work, has the ambassador come across any Irish citizens who have had difficulties in that regard? I know there is a double taxation agreement between the two countries and that we have opened an embassy in Sofia. Presumably, most problems can be dealt with in Bulgaria.The second issue relates to access to the Irish labour market for Bulgarian workers. Is the ambassador concerned about the date of accession being pushed back, which is an option? What might its negative consequences be, if any? What is the general attitude in Bulgaria to membership? Does the ambassador think there will be a large movement of workers westwards? Are many Bulgarians aware of Ireland and will they be attracted to it? This committee has discussed on many occasions the fact that in the next ten years Ireland will be competing for overseas workers.Bulgaria has a 480-strong battalion in Iraq. Has its participation had any impact on its relations with other member states?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	3	We have not encountered any problems for Irish citizens participating in the real estate market in Bulgaria. There has been a lot of investment in Bulgaria by ordinary citizens in real estate.With regard to access to the labour market, that is, the flow of Bulgarian citizens to Ireland, the Bulgarian community here is not very large but is well integrated. As the accession date is very close, we are doing surveys at home to find out the attitude towards migration of Bulgarian citizens. According to the latest survey by Gallup International held in February, among Bulgarians of working age there has been a decline in emigration intentions in the past six years. The portion of Bulgarian nationals intending to emigrate in the term or short term fell from 30% in 2000 to 7% in 2006. The survey shows that the motivation for Bulgarian citizens to go abroad ceased long ago to be political or purely material or economic. Now they are driven by their desire for professional self-realisation. The Gallup Internationalspecial survey showsa reversal in migratory attitudes. The share of young people in Bulgaria and the residents of its capital who want to stay and work has increased by 20%. A total of 74% of Bulgarians want to live and work in Bulgaria. A further 19% would be willing to work abroad on a temporary basis. Only 7% would go to live and work abroad.When interpreting this data, it should be noted that the decline in percentages is due to several factors, the first of which is the economic and political stabilisation of Bulgaria; while the second is that, following the signing of the treaty of accession to the European Union and the date of the country’s admission to the Community comes near, working in a member state is possible and the decision to do so can be made by weighing up the pros and cons. Working in another member state is seen as exercising one’s right as a citizen of the Community and is planned in compliance with the legal framework of the receiving country.Noting that the general tendency of migration of the past few years still persists, emphasis should be placed on the positive development of national policy. Our migration policyis an important element of the country's policy of integration with the European Union. Our forthcoming accession will create the requisites for an increase in the inflow of migrants into our country. By November 2005 a total of 52,550 foreigners enjoyed the status of permanent residence. Some 13,000 foreign nationals had been granted long-term residence status. There is interest among citizens of new member states in acquiring long-term residence status in Bulgaria. In 2004 such status was granted to 665 nationals of Great Britain, a 49% increase on the previous year.I will now address what Bulgaria is doing in terms of developing its migration policy.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The ambassador has answered my question. The improvement in the Bulgarian economy appears to have reduced the desire to seek work abroad. As stated, this is all about self-realisation.Perhaps the ambassador would address my question on Iraq before I hand over to other members.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The decision to join the alliance in Iraq was taken by the Bulgarian Government and approved by the Bulgarian Parliament. As the Acting Chairman correctly stated, there are 480 Bulgarian troops in Iraq providing logistical support in peacekeeping operations. We do not have any problems with our partners because of our participation in Iraq.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I welcome the ambassador and thank her for providing the joint committee with a record of Bulgaria's relationship with the European Union in respect of its accession obligations. The presentation is detailed and highlights the areas wherein many reforms are taking place. In that regard, I refer to judicial reform which appears to have commenced in 2001. To what extent will it be completed to fulfil Bulgaria's accession obligations? I note from the presentation that Bulgaria has committed itself to strong concepts in administrative reform. I would like to hear the ambassador's views on whether she believes Bulgaria will meet its obligations by 2007.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I thank the Senator for her questions on judicial and administrative reform. I will focus on what we have been doing in recent years. Judicial reform did not commence in 2001; it started a long time ago. We had to amend our constitution to improve the efficiency of the judicial system and are committed to completing as many as possible of the judicial reforms by the date of accession, following which we will concentrate on the registration and training of magistrates to effectively participate in the judicial system in Bulgaria.On administrative reform, members will be aware that implementation of Community acquis demands administrative structures, the establishment of which is under way and must be completed by the date of accession; otherwise Bulgaria will not benefit from participation in Community policies. In speaking about administrative reform we are referring to the establishment of the new structures required to deal with the implementation of Community policy. By way of example, the parliament recently passed a decision on the establishment of a bank agency in Bulgaria. We are required to establish a bank agency in order to implement European agricultural policy.

I hope all goes well.The committee welcomes the lifting of restrictions on migrant workers from European Union countries by four of the member states. It is a pity all European Union member states did not do so as a block. I hope there will be no restrictions in regard to Bulgaria and Romania, that they will be acknowledged as full members from day one and that Ireland will do as much as possible to ensure that happens. The Taoiseach criticised other European Union member states during the week for not lifting restrictions on migrant workers from member states.I have two questions, the first of which is in regard to the right-wing party, ATAKA. I understand it has approximately 10% of the vote in Bulgaria and seems to be growing. Are there concerns about its racist policies, given Bulgaria's history in relation to some ethnic minorities?My second question relates to the Roma people. I acknowledge the huge amount of work done in recent years in that regard. The briefing documents we have received outline some of the changes that have been made. One issue about which I am concerned is access of the Roma population to housing. The briefing documents mention — the ambassador also mentioned this — that a short-term action plan has yet to be worked out and submitted to the Council of Ministers. When is that likely to happen? Obviously, the sooner it is up and running the better.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	9	On the Deputy's first question, it must be noted that xenophobic sentiments are not characteristic of the Bulgarian people. On the contrary, we are famous for our tolerance. The appearance last year of the political party the Deputy mentioned was an expression of dissatisfaction of some who felt the transition period had not been beneficial to them. Its influence is not growing in Bulgaria because it rejects everything, including privatisation, and offers no alternative in its political platform. The expectation is that it is a temporary phenomenon in Bulgarian society. It reflects also that there are winners and losers in the transition. It is not something that is characteristic of Bulgarians. Bulgaria has never had any conflict on its territory based on ethnicity or religion.On the Deputy's second question, he is right. The Government is doing a lot to integrate the Roma population. It is a difficult process. When we speak about integration, we should avoid resorting to segregation measures. On access to education, health care and housing, we speak about equal treatment of the Roma people, not as a minority but with the majority. The Government has managed to ensure financial backup for the programme, implementation of which has begun with the building of houses.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I welcome the ambassador and thank her for her presentation. It is 11 years since Bulgaria lodged its application for membership of the European Union. In that time there has been continuing concern about corruption at the highest level in Bulgaria. The government recently took measures to deal with the issue. Is there any tangible evidence of their enforcement in, for example, the area of public procurement and financial institutions? Some time ago it was alleged that the proceeds of ill-gotten gains in this country were being laundered through financial institutions in Bulgaria. What reform has taken place in these institutions?Will the ambassador outline the improvements which have been made to nuclear installations in Bulgaria?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Deputy is correct in saying there were allegations of corruption in the awarding of public contracts. There were allegations because we had not introduced the so-called remedy system in Bulgaria which would allow unsuccessful bidders to find out why their bids were not successful. Under the present system, unsuccessful bidders must go to court, which takes years. Those tendering for public contracts are not happy with this and allege corruption in the public procurement process. The Bulgarian financial investigations bureau works actively with its EU counterparts. OLAF recently established an agency in Bulgaria to assist and co-operate with us in financial investigations.Bulgaria has committed to decommissioning some of its nuclear reactors which were considered unsafe. That will happen within a time schedule agreed with the European Union. By the end of 2002 two units were closed. Two more will be closed by the end of this year. Reducing capacity in electricity generation is the price we must pay to comply with nuclear safety requirements and we are doing so.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I am not suggesting Bulgaria should close down its nuclear generating stations but that there be a close examination of the unsafe stations. Are there major financial implications for the European Union in respect of the outstanding nuclear installations deemed risky?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	13	There are no financial implications for the European Union. Monitoring nuclear safety in Bulgaria has been done by joint missions of the agency in Vienna and EU member states. Safety requirements have been checked and Bulgaria is considered to be complying with them. Those plants considered unsafe and those considered unsuitable for upgrading at an affordable cost are to be decommissioned.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I have a number of questions but will start with a welcome. Like other members, I received a driving licence without completing a driving test. When Ireland joined the European Union, acquis communautaire was much smaller than the mountain that faces EU applicant countries. It is a bit Irish for the committee to hold this investigation when the task we had to complete was much easier than that which faces the accession countries. I wish Bulgaria every success in its application and hope the report from the Commission next month will be positive and that 1 January 2007 will be the date on which Bulgaria will join the European Union. I also hope the Government will open the labour market without restrictions with effect from that date. I have read the report on migratory patterns and the possible inflows from Bulgaria are low relative to countries such as Germany and Spain.The exploitation of other EU workers in this country arises from a conspiracy between national labour market contractors in countries such as Poland and Irish construction contractors. The Bulgarian Government should publicise the fact that Bulgarian workers do not have to be recruited through a Bulgarian agency. Workers should be made aware of the minimum wage in Ireland to ensure unscrupulous Irish contractors, primarily in the agriculture and construction sectors, would not be able to exploit them. This is the response the Labour Party would like to see Irish authorities implement to ensure the possibility of exploitation by Irish employers and Bulgarian agents does not arise.I refer to the Irish experience of the Criminal Assets Bureau, an organisation which confiscates the proceeds of crime. It is one of the most effective instruments against crime Ireland has developed. Criminals are not intimidated by jail terms because it is part of their culture but they are greedy people and the confiscation of ill-gotten gains hurts them. I invite the Bulgarian delegation to examine our experience.Bulgaria chose to join NATO, a choice made by a sovereign state. In addition, it has agreed to allow 2,500 US troops be stationed on its territory. Will Mrs. Benisheva outline the reasons it made that decision? Could it be considered provocative by Russia and Ukraine to have former Cold War adversaries stationed next to the frontier? What is the strategic reason for having 2,500 US troops stationed there? What has been the cost of joining NATO in terms of new equipment, material and armaments?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	15	On the first observation on the movement of workers, the member is absolutely right that the Bulgarian Government and Minister for Social and Family Affairs are raising awareness among citizens of the legal systems of the respective countries and conditions there, allowing people to make their own decisions. They must weigh the pros and cons, deciding whether to move on the basis of an informed risk. Through a governmental decision, we have also established in several embassies — not in Ireland, but in other EU member states — counsellors on social affairs to assist migrants. I absolutely agree agencies on our territory advertise to attract workers without there being any delivery. That message will be passed to our government.On the Criminal Assets Bureau, I am happy to say we have already examined the Irish experience. In 2005 we adopted our own version based on the Irish system. Representatives from the Criminal Assets Bureau have visited Bulgaria to discuss the practical establishment of the respective institutions on our side to implement the law on the confiscation of assets gained through criminal activity. We are following that example.On the recent agreement between Bulgaria and the United States, we signed up to the shared use of military facilities on our territory, allowing for the six-monthly rotation of 2,500 American troops. We consider that agreement as providing additional security for Bulgaria and the entire region of south-eastern Europe. The government felt the necessity of having that presence in Bulgaria.We do not conclude bilateral agreements at the expense of other partners' interests. The member mentioned Russia and Ukraine. Both countries' Foreign Ministers were informed when the agreement was signed in Sofia and invited to attend an informal meeting between Ukraine, NATO and Russia. When Bulgaria signed the bilateral agreement with the United States on the Friday of the previous week, it was done on the margins of an informal NATO meeting in Sofia. In the programme for that informal meeting, there were two bilateral meetings, between NATO and Russia and NATO and Ukraine. When we signed the agreement with the Secretary of State, the Russian and Ukrainian Foreign Ministers were in Sofia.

We have heard a great deal about Bulgaria recently regarding holiday destinations and property and its offering very good value for money.The ambassador has stated Bulgaria is vigorously implementing reforms and transforming institutions. She referred to democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the rights of minorities. That is a heavy agenda. I wonder whether the changes are universally accepted. Regarding the transformation, we have only approximately six months until Bulgaria hopes to join the European Union. The ambassador might comment on how well the country has fulfilled its goals to transform itself in recent years.The ambassador also stated Bulgaria was taking steps to improve the situation on mental health services and orphanages. The situation relating to Bulgarian orphanages can be quite a major issue, particularly on foot of some of the images taken in such institutions and shown here. What steps is the Bulgarian Government taking in this regard? Will the ambassador provide an overview in respect of hospitals and health care and the Bulgarian Government's efforts to transform these?The ambassador referred to falling unemployment figures. What is the current unemployment figure? She referred to the reduction of capacity in the steel sector. How well will this be accepted by the people if this industry is the mainstay of the economy and a significant source of employment?The ambassador indicated that reforms are costly and painful. However, they appear to have a support base of 70%. I find it strange that there is such significant support for changes that are costly and painful.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I thank the Deputy. I refer to the observance of respect for the rule of law, the protection of minority rights and the political criteria components I mentioned in my submission. These issues are now well behind us. They were on the agenda for our assessment in the context of whether we complied. Six or seven years ago, when the European Union decided that Bulgaria was meeting the political criteria and could be granted the status of a country negotiating for accession, there was a certain sequence of steps for meeting the political and economic criteria and the implementation of the acquiscriteria. We followed this approach strictly. The Commission continues to state that Bulgaria still complies with the political criteria for accession.On the transformation in society and the institutions dealing with mental health, I agree with the Deputy that there is some kind of disparity between economic success and the social welfare institutions. The situation is improving. I refer to a few initiatives we have undertaken as priorities, such as: steps aimed at decreasing the number of children who are brought up in specialised institutions; the improvement of living conditions in such institutions; the creation of better conditions for children to exercise their rights guaranteed by the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the law on child protection; increasing the effectiveness of measures aimed at the protection of children from violence, abuse and other forms of exploitation; and guaranteeing the access of children to quality education and preparation, with a view to their full social realisation. This is a long list of measures and we expect improvement.We received much assistance from the Irish NGOs in that particular area of the transformation. The 17 projects to which I referred in my submission include the purchasing of specialised transport vehicles for disabled people, provision of equipment for day activity projects, group homes, family consulting centres, the building of specialised facilities, support for the Bulgarian association for people with intellectual disabilities and the co-founding of projects with the Bulgarian ministry. Many Irish NGOs are involved in helping us in that regard. We admit that the social welfare system requires further improvement.The reduction of capacity in the steel sector is taking place in stages in accordance with an agreed plan between Bulgaria and the European Commission. We received funding from the European Union to provide vocational training for those who would lose their jobs as a result of the reduction of capacity in the steel sector. The programme is based on the concept that state aid to the sector should be discontinued and the viability of the industry ensured through the reduction of capacity. There is no option to move in a different direction.Questions were raised about the cost of reform and the high level of support for integration in Bulgaria, in which the European Union continues to enjoy a high profile and reputation. It seems pro-EU sentiments are based on its positive track record in my country in the economic, social and cultural fields.

My questions relate to the Roma people. How many such persons live in Bulgaria? While I imagine them as a nomadic people who wander between Romania and Bulgaria, I may be incorrect and would like the ambassador to tell me something about them. While the Bulgarian Government has taken steps to integrate them into the education system, are they integrated generally and do they contribute to the economy?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	23	According to the latest UNDP survey, the Roma community accounts for 2.6% of Bulgaria's 7.7 million population, or between 200,000 and 300,000 people. It is impossible to have exact figures as they are very mobile. We are trying to ensure regular attendance at school by Roma children. The excuse of the lack of a proper education will lead only to the need to provide social assistance and undermine integration in national life. Some members of the Roma community are invited to attend training courses to help them acquire skills and enter occupations. The majority — approximately 70% — of those involved in our programme of social assistance aimed at entry into employment, which is based on the Irish experience, are Roma.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Mr. Martin Territt, director of the European Commission's Representation in Ireland, will now address the very important issue of the Commission's White Paper on a European communications policy. There is an acknowledged communications gap in dealing with EU affairs. We have a responsibility to the people to bridge that gap and hope to do so with the assistance of the European Commission. Following Mr. Territt's presentation, we will open the discussion to members.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I am delighted to have been invited to address the Joint Committee on European Affairs on the theme of communication, with particular reference to the European Commission's White Paper on a European communication policy. The title of my presentation is, Communications — Bridging the Gap.Let me put the issue in context. The European Union has gone through a difficult period. We all remember the referenda in the Netherlands and France in which the proposed new constitution was rejected. Members will have followed the discussions on why it was rejected, thought about how it could be salvaged and what it would mean for the future of the Union. It certainly was a shock to the system. In the circumstances the European Council agreed last year to a "period of reflection". It seemed right to take time to reflect on the future and meaning of the European Union.The period of reflection has not been one of introspection. On the contrary, we in the Commission and many others have taken advantage of the pause to see how we can reconnect with EU citizens. To move forward, a number of things need to be done; it is not a matter of conducting a single information campaign. In the opinion of the Commission, two steps were absolutely necessary: delivering tangible results in areas important to European citizens and making the European Union a more democratic framework ready to take communication with its citizens seriously. We are getting there.A positive step was an informal summit of EU leaders in November 2005 at which the Commission's call for economic reform and social modernisation was fully endorsed. In December last year the Heads of State agreed the EU's budget, the financial perspectives, for the period to 2013; no small feat for a union of 25 countries, all with their own interests and priorities. The positive momentum was reinforced this year at the European summit in March at which the European Union's commitment to growth and jobs was affirmed. The Lisbon Agenda has not been implemented as quickly as hoped. We have, therefore, renewed the focus of attention on the goals related to growth and jobs.At the recent summit, the Heads of State took decisions on three important areas, namely, business, knowledge and energy. They decided to reduce red tape for new businesses, particularly the small and medium sized enterprises that comprise the engine of growth in the European economy. They agreed to the creation of a European institute of technology as a flagship for European excellence in education, research and innovation. The Commission will come forward with proposals on that in the near future.The Heads of State also agreed on a focus on an energy policy for Europe, aiming at the triple goals of sustainable, competitive and secure energy and building on the Commission's recent Green Paper in this area. The summit confirmed, very importantly, that we want an open Europe as a response to globalisation. In this regard, we have an ambitious and realistic programme for the future. Therefore, despite the obvious difficulties of last year, it is clear that the Union's institutions are working. Proposals and results are being produced, but there are still limits on how much we can move forward. We certainly cannot proceed and leave our citizens behind.That leads me to my next point which relates to the lack of communication and democracy, which are very much interlinked. During the period of reflection, it is essential to listen to citizens, social partners, political parties and national and local parliaments without in any way prejudging the results of this widespread dialogue and debate. For these reasons, the Commission has decided to adopt a new approach to communication. We have had the issue of communication at the forefront of our agenda since the college took office. For the first time, a vice-president with special responsibility for communication was appointed. I refer here to Vice-President Margot Walström, my immediate boss.We have taken three initiatives in the past year. First, we drew up an action plan to put our own house in order in the short term. Second, we adopted Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate for the medium to long term. Third, we published the White Paper on a European Communication Policy. I would like to speak a little on each of these topics.The action plan involves moving from theory to practice, from words to deeds. We set out from the Commission's perspective — in-house, by and large — 50 practical steps aimed at improving its capacity and skills to communicate European policies. For example, public consultations on particular issues will be better publicised. Policy proposals will be drafted in clearer language. A lay person's summary will be produced in respect of major proposals. We are taking steps to improve our Europa website and we are in the process of producing clearer and more easily comprehensible publications that have more of a local focus. This is particularly important, not necessarily in Ireland but in those countries that do not have English or French as their main languages. English and French, with some German, are the main languages in which texts are produced.The Commission has taken steps to reinforce its representation in the member states in order to communicate to citizens on those policies and initiatives that concern them. In this context, my representation in Dublin has been strengthened by additional staffing and financial resources. We have taken a number of initiatives. We launched a new website and initiated a major local radio advertising campaign to make people aware of their rights under EU law, how to access more information from our new website, www.euireland.ie, from our freephone number or from the variety of regional Europe Direct centres we have established in Blanchardstown, Longford, Letterkenny, Carraroe, Ballinasloe, Dooradoyle in Limerick, Dungarvan and Macroom. With the increased resources at our disposal, we are endeavouring to listen to and communicate with groups such as the national and local media, national and local politicians, civil society groups, businesses, schools, trade unions and third level students in order to achieve a deeper understanding of citizens’ concerns about the Union.We organised a seminar on migrant workers in the Union in early March. I note that this committee recently released a report on migration issues. The objective of our seminar was to allow an open exchange of views on the benefits of and concerns about migration. Participants included representatives of the relevant Departments and agencies, Irish political parties, embassies of the 25 member states, candidate and accession countries, civil society and the media.The Commission's second communication initiative is its Plan D for Democracy, Dialogue and Debate. This puts in place a framework, through national governments, for a 25-country debate on Europe's future. This is the Commission's unique contribution to the period of reflection. It concerns a long-term commitment to improving the democratic legitimacy of the European Union and ensuring a real public debate on serious questions such as the sort of Union citizens want, how citizens can be more involved in setting the EU agenda and how to improve relations between the EU institutions and citizens. Plan D seeks to provide a common framework for the 25-country debates, providing potential models and structures for national governments. The Irish experience of the National Forum on Europe helped the Commission suggest this type of initiative to other member states.The Commission's role is to assist rather than replace member states. The debate must happen at member state level. We will prepare a synthesis report of the national debates in time for the June 2006 European Council under the Austrian Presidency. Ultimately, this process should result in a roadmap for the future of Europe.The third communication initiative is the White Paper, which is a call for action on how we can bridge the gap between the Union and its citizens. The White Paper proposes five areas where joint action should be taken: defining common principles to guide communication activities on European issues; empowering citizens; working with the media and new technologies; better understanding European public opinion; and doing the job together.We are seeking the views of the broad body politic, including, individuals, governments, local authorities, national parliaments and NGOs on these matters. The consultation process will run for six months until August, although, given that the European Parliament is not likely to offer its views until November, we will not disregard any later submissions.I invite the committee to make a submission on the White Paper, if it so desires. I am pleased that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated that the Government is considering whether to make a submission. At the end of this process, the Commission will summarise the replies and draw conclusions with a view to proposing plans of action for each working area.The White Paper has a more limited scope than Plan D. It does not ask for people's views on the European Union but on the question of how we can set up better communication between citizens and the EU policy-makers. This is a long-term question. Anyone who thinks that the European Union can solve its confidence deficit solely through advertising campaigns has not understood where the problem lies.This is a fundamental problem but is not unique to European institutions. The director general of the Institute of European Affairs in Ireland recently stated that the deficit lies not only in European institutions but also in their national equivalents and in local authorities.Long-term vision, democracy and participation are essential. In recent years we have witnessed the growth and power of the Internal Market. In the same way, we must now construct a common, democratic public arena for discussion and debate on the Europe we want to see.Essentially, the White Paper proposal aims to place citizens and democracy at the heart of how we discuss and present the European Union as a political project. From the Commission's perspective, it is a presentation of what the basis for this could be. We aim to create a special EU charter of common principles on the right of citizens to receive information, debate issues and influence political decision-making processes at all levels. We hope for consensus between institutions, governments and society. We also hope to improve citizens' democratic knowledge and skills, as well as their ability to communicate by focusing on adult education, networking and discussion forums and by making better use of modern media such as digital libraries to improve and supplement the democratic possibilities open to citizens to access information. This will allow them to participate in political debate.We aim to develop a wide partnership between member states and citizens on these issues. Democratising European politics will need not only time but also commitment and leadership at all levels of the European Union. Local, regional and national politicians, parties and NGOs must take greater responsibility for encouraging more democratic and wider debate about the Union.The role of this committee is very important in fostering parliamentary and public debate in Ireland on European issues. On behalf of the European Commission, I congratulate the committee on its work, not just its work on policy areas but also its diligent work in the scrutiny of EU proposals. I acknowledge its work which I have been happy to support in promoting 10 May as Europe day in the Dáil. I have worked with its members, the Ceann Comhairle and the Whips on this important development in Irish parliamentary democracy. For the first time a European Commissioner will take part in a debate in the Chamber. I am pleased that Commissioner Fischer Boel will attend.I hope I can provide answers for any questions members may have. I will listen to their concerns which I will convey to the authorities in Brussels.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I thank Mr. Territt for his presentation. This debate has been sparked by dissatisfaction in France and, to a lesser extent, the Netherlands regarding local issues which are beyond the control of the Commission and other member states. They should be dealt with by national democracies rather than the European Union. Nevertheless, we must consider them and bring the Union closer to the citizen. For many years it was a point of last resort in a legal context rather than a facilitator in everyday life in the way one sees a local authority.Advertising has moved from public announcements on radio and is now more subtle. One does not realise one wants something until the advertising industry has impressed upon one the need for a particular product. It also advertises by association with people who are respected. That is how the major corporations prepare us to desire what they want us to desire. If we are going to deal with advertising, we must be somewhat more constructive. I will now take questions from members.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I wish to make a comment rather than ask a question. I thank Mr. Territt for providing us with a great opportunity to start contemplating the communication gap that exists. His contribution is timely, particularly as this is European week. Through the initiative of this committee, we have arranged a European day for next week, which is very important. This is a period of reflection and pause during which we might consider our future direction. None of us — we are all guilty in this regard — anticipated the shock relating to the rejection of the draft constitution by the Netherlands and France.The paper is very much tied in to the question of how we empower and involve the citizen. Mr. Territt dealt in detail with the action plan, Plan D and the White Paper. We endeavour to reach out to all Irish institutions at national, regional and local level. However, the nitrates directive came through that communication gap and I could not understand why local authorities were not involved because it was an environmental and agricultural issue. People did not know what was happening and I had great difficulty in understanding the directive. That sums matters up.How do we empower citizens so that they will know that a decision is being made in Brussels and that it is being discussed at local, regional and national level? Brussels should only be involved thereafter. That is how it should work, rather than a decision being made by Brussels, after which we must proceed in line with what it says. We are reaching out to Brussels and it should not be so because that is why there is rejection and no link between Brussels and Members of the Houses or between the Oireachtas and citizens. This is a matter of concern.Mr. Territt stated that it must be done through education, which I feel is one of the best means. We are attempting to do it through the National Forum on Europe, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, which is an excellent idea. However, it will be difficult to give the EU a human face, since the attitude is still very much one of "them and us".While the White Paper contains great ideas, their implementation will decide how we get involved — something that I ask everyone to do. We are attempting it here, but will this debate have an impact outside this setting by the end of this evening?
#MaeSextonPD	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-party	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-dob	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I should begin by saying that I do not have the answers either. I had anticipated that the White Paper might be somewhat more exciting and that someone might have produced a solution. Like Senator Ormonde, I have been saying all along that we have been losing the citizens. It is an international trend that people are turned off by politics. I do not know how we will win them back, but I cannot see the White Paper doing it.We have returned to the business of its being in the interests of the national political parties — not merely the Government — to keep citizens engaged with Europe. However, we are losing that battle and I cannot see the White Paper addressing the problem. Younger people coming through the education system are certainly grasping the notion of Europe much better than we, including the benefits and merits of being a member state of the EU, which I need not enumerate here, since we all know them. However, we do not seem able to get that across to citizens and the White Paper will not do so either. Its proposals seem to be coming through national, regional and local government. There does not seem to be any engagement with the man in the street, the guy who has to come out to vote and must be convinced that the European constitution is the way forward. Something more than advertising is required if it is to be done on time and avoid losing momentum. The European Parliament elections still produce good turnouts but this will change. The turnout is decreasing for national and local elections. I do not know if the White Paper has the answer — I do not — and more action is required. It is unfortunate that the headlines and frenzy created by the media are what sells. We are all so institutionalised that we are not grasping the matter. We need someone to tell us how to do it because we are losing the battle. We are too constrained in a straitjacket in the way we look at things. We know the benefits which we want to impart to Joe Citizen but we are not getting the message across; neither is the White Paper. This is not intended as a criticism because I do not have the answer but we must remove the straitjacket or find somebody who can remove it from us in order that we can communicate.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	30	These are comments rather than questions. Does Mr. Territ wish to reply now or hear from other members first?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I will respond briefly now. I agree with the Acting Chairman's remarks that we need to disentangle genuine European issues from national ones. This is part of the exercise in which we are engaged. Whether it is called the action plan, plan D or the White Paper, it does not really matter to the ordinary citizen. I agree with the Acting Chairman that there advertising in all its forms, both direct and indirect. This morning I heard on radio an advertisement by the Oireachtas advertising Europe Day next week. It also advertised the Oireachtas website and the fact that citizens could present questions for debate on that day.To answer Deputy Sexton's point, this is a novel approach. We need to break outside the box. That is the reason I have engaged in advertising about citizens' rights under European law in order to empower them to use the sources of those rights. I have already carried out a preliminary evaluation of the first part of that campaign and noted that there has been a substantial increase in the number of hits on our website with regard to the freefone number and the telephone number of the representation. I see postive, tangible results. One of my colleagues informed me one morning that we had received a number of telephone calls from a certain county, which I will not name from a number of citizens who wanted to know how they could enforce their rights to safe water under the EU directives. This is a powerful empowerment of individuals. It may be a small step but we know what can happen from such steps. We must reinvent the European Union to make it more open, democratic and tangible.I fully agree with Senator Ormonde in citing the nitrates directive as an example of something that appeared to pop out from nowhere, even though it had been agreed many years ago. The new approach to which I referred in my opening statement will be to have much more open and early consultations on issues to enable people to give their views and to ensure we can understand their concerns about real life issues. In that respect, national parliaments would have a much stronger role under the provisions of the proposed constitution when it comes to scrutiny. That is an issue that can be revisited in time when we can see the way forward more clearly in the context of ratification or otherwise of the constitution.Clearly, the issue of education is important. We are working closely with the Department of Education and Science on various issues. We are producing materials for the CSPE course, for transition year students, among others. I appreciate the work being done on the issue by the Forum on Europe.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I welcome Mr. Territt and thank him for his comments on the events to be held next week and the good work done by the staff here regarding the advertisements. The problem is that we have been too successful as politicians. If we were to re-enact all the anti-liberal laws that were in the Statute Book and screw up the economy the way Fianna Fáil did in 1977, matters might be different. Part of the difficulty is the culture of contentment that prevails, not just in this country but also in others. We have moved as a political group. The stones in their sandals and shoes that used to really irritate people are gone. They do not, therefore, feel the need in many cases to participate politically because much progress has been made but that is not to say they are not interested in politics. Many young adults whom I encounter are passionately interested in global issues and many other matters. However, they now have a personal freedom and personal lifestyle that does not cause them to rail against the political system as was the case 15, 20 or 30 years ago.On the White Paper, it seems that, irrespective of the constitutional impasse and what will happen at the end of the period of reflection, there is no legal impediment to prevent the Commission acting here, whatever about anywhere else, as if the provisions of early consultation and scrutiny and notification had come into effect. Let me give a concrete example of what I mean. Through modern communications systems, it would be possible to notify every public representative at national and local level of another proposed nitrates directive. If, in the bundle of communications that comes from, say, Cork County Council, there was a communication from the Commission informing it that this month the Commission had initiated something, the Council had considered something or the Parliament had debated something — it does not have to more than one page — it would act as an alarm and one would ask what the directive was about. That is one matter I suggest Mr. Territt might consider.From an Irish perspective, when we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the 1916 uprising, a series of documents, including the famous iconic Proclamation and photographs, was produced and circulated to all our national schools. They are still in the classrooms of many such schools, of which there are approximately 3,500. Would it be possible for the Commission to initiate an information board suitably designed for children between the ages of six and 12 years outlining in some shape or form the organic nature of the European Union and how it functions? I do not know whether Mr. Territt was in the country at the time, but the celebrations and fireworks in honour of the day of enlargement two years ago were spectacular and attracted much attention. Those ideas are ones upon which we could reflect.As part of the Europe Day celebrations, this committee intends to prepare a comprehensive report of how the day's events went and to communicate it, through the Ceann Comhairle, to the chairpersons of the national assemblies — COSAC is the relevant committee. Subject to the decision of the committee, we could separately communicate it directly from this committee as a response to the White Paper.Mr. Territt stated in his paper that the Seville Council agreed that where the Council and the Parliament meet together to legislate, they would do so in public. Has that ever happened and, if so, what was the media response?I note also the provision for the publication of Eurobarometer twice a year at the fairly low cost of €600,000, which, by the standards of the Custom House, is a pittance. It generates a great deal of information and, in turn, generates stories. It would be useful for it to be published more frequently and for its spread of questions to be enlarged to give journalists hooks upon which to write stories and report.If there is to be a national TV channel dedicated to the proceedings of our public assemblies, such as the Oireachtas and local authorities, it might be capable of incorporating the proceedings of European institutions. Using modern technology, it would be possible to have the proceedings of every local authority and the proceedings of the Oireachtas broadcast in such a way that people could access them if they wished to do so. Some of the activities of the European institutions, subject to their suitability, could be included in that process.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I apologise to Mr. Territt because I was obliged to leave the meeting for 30 minutes. I read his presentation, however, for which I thank him.Anybody under 35 or 40 years of age on this island forgets that one reason for the establishment of the European Union was to bring nations together to eliminate the possibility of further war in Europe. That principle is repeating itself as we consider the accession applications of Macedonia, Croatia and other Balkan states. We need to reconnect citizens with the spirit of nations working together for their own good.I disagree with the Acting Chairman's analysis of the situation in France and the Netherlands. One of our problems is that during this so-called period of reflection, there is no effective connection with citizens here. There is a tendency to lecture people to the effect that the European Union is good for them. However, little attempt is being made to listen to people's concerns regarding what is happening in the Union. For example, Senator Ormonde referred to the impact of the nitrates directive on agriculture. There is concern among people to whom I speak about the erosion of jobs, the drift of industry from west to east, the undermining of agriculture. They also doubt the capacity of the Union to accommodate the enlargement to 25 members, and possibly further, with the inclusion of Macedonia and Croatia, to 27 and eventually, with Turkey's possible accession, to 28. People here fear an influx of immigrants who will undercut them in the job market. The message is not getting across that immigration is good for our economy and that we need people to come into the country to keep developing our industrial base.The message is too often simplistic in nature. For example, even the increase in road deaths is being attributed to the influx of people from the accession states and there are calls for them to sit driving tests. This ignores the fact that we cannot even test our own people. There is that anti-European attitude because we fail to listen to people and address their fears.Mr. Territt recommended listening to citizens during the reflection period, without prejudging the results of the dialogue and debate. I see little evidence of us listening to citizens. European day will provide an opportunity to listen to citizens and address their concerns. I do not wish to be critical of the National Forum for Europe but what happens at Dublin Castle on a fortnightly and monthly basis has little relevance to ordinary citizens. The forum has made an attempt to travel to provinces and cities but there is still no connection with citizens. Unless we address the concerns that exist, it is unlikely that any proposal put to the citizens will be passed in a referendum.Some of these fears are groundless.

As the Acting Chairman stated, the fears are irrational but we need to know the nature of such fears. If we do not communicate directly with citizens, the same submissions will be made by the bodies in the straitjacket to which I referred earlier. We must speak directly to the man on the street and he must feel that the Commission, not Irish politicians, is asking him about his fears. That would be a mammoth task but it might work.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-05-03 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Concerning the points raised by Deputy Quinn on early notification of proposals, the Commission is clear that it will not cherry-pick from the EU constitution because it must respect the decisions of the people in France and the Netherlands, as well as the decisions of the people in the 14 member states that ratified the constitution. Estonia is about to ratify and Finland may ratify soon. Therefore, it is a delicate issue.The importance of this period of reflection is to listen to various strands of opinion. At this stage, there is no consensus on the way forward. Different member states hold different views on how the process should be advanced. Chancellor Merkel suggested that a social protocol be added to the constitutional treaty as a potential way forward. There is disagreement between the President and the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic. The Netherlands' Foreign Minister, Bernard Bott, along with the opposition parties, has outlined the difficulties posed by putting the same question again. President Chirac and, to a certain extent, Prime Minister Verhofstadt propose a hard-core approach.This gives members some flavour at a macro level of the major differences on some of those issues. That said, I will give very favourable consideration to the question of how, from the Commission's perspective, we might achieve earlier notification of proposals from the Commission to this committee, the Houses of the Oireachtas as a whole, and local authorities. Over the coming year, we will be working with local authorities and regional assemblies to see what greater service we might render.That is also an important aspect of bridging the gap and while I can agree in principle with Deputy Sexton regarding trying to reach 457 million citizens individually, the task of doing so, as I am sure she would acknowledge, would present fairly obvious logistical issues and problems. That is why we are trying, through my appearance today and otherwise, to promote the direct involvement of citizens in order that they can, for example, give their views to us directly regarding Plan D and the White Paper via the Plan D web forum and the public consultation on the White Paper.We received many submissions from individuals, parliaments and governments, three of which have already given their views. Without labouring the point, we are pursuing an advertising campaign in Ireland so that people know where our website is and how to make their views known. During that advertising campaign, we intend to reach at least 66% of the population directly, which is quite a good initiative.Schools are certainly extremely important, and almost everyone has touched on that point. We are working quite closely with schools in developing initiatives and on 9 May, Europe Day, we will be producing several newspaper supplements in association with the three main broadsheets, and 25 copies of one will go to every secondary school in the country. It is being designed to be as user-friendly as possible for the younger population and is an important initiative. I agree that obtaining information at a young age is important. I had fairly lengthy discussions with the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science about how best to advance the process.Opinion polls, particularly Eurobarometer in the context of the Commission, are extremely important. We wish to increase the frequency and depth of Eurobarometer and we conducted a special survey in February and March on the period of reflection and the draft constitution. We will present the results, which will make for some interesting reading, this Friday. My briefing suggests that among the issues being picked up is the need for reinforced political leadership across the Union. I take from this meeting the need for leadership at all levels, including in Brussels.Regarding Deputy Sexton's comments, Brussels is not simply the Commission; it is the European Parliament and the 25 national governments. We have devised a very complex Community mechanism that is simultaneously supranational, national and local.Regarding television, much work can be done in the area and the issue is touched on in the White Paper. I acknowledge the innovative work done by the European Parliament in web-streaming some of its committee work. A lot of important, detailed work — like the work done in this committee — is done to bring it into the public domain. I have heard Deputy Quinn speak about the need for transparency in the Council and, on behalf of the Commission, I share his views in this respect. We refer to that in the White Paper. Perhaps we do not fully understand what happens on the Council, however. They do legislate in public, but often it is somewhat pro forma. For example, the President of the Council may declare that the Council will legislate in public on particular points within directives. They may be agreed and formally adopted. However, the detailed work is done prior to this point either in the Council itself or more particularly in COREPER, the Committee of Permanent Representatives, and the working groups that it empowers to bring forward legislation. The work of this committee on scrutiny also feeds into that process. If this work can somehow get a better public airing then so too will the work of the Council.Deputy Allen has referred to the question of listening and there are many aspects to this. The obvious one is Deputies, Senators and local representatives listening to their constituents. There is also the work of the Dáil, this joint committee and the National Forum. Our work, representing the Commission here in Ireland, includes promoting debates in universities and other fora. My colleague Niamh Carmody has led that work. We have conducted a number of debates already, listening to young people throughout Ireland, and we will continue this work in the colleges' post-exam season. Commissioner McCreevy has been very supportive by engaging with city and county councils in a number of regions including Limerick, Waterford and Galway where he received much feedback on his own portfolio and generally.The question of migration abounds. That is why I referred to it in my introductory remarks. It is clearly one of the reasons this committee conducted work in this area and produced a related report. The Commission's formal report on the application of the transitional arrangements concluded that the experience in Ireland was hugely positive. I would like to emphasise that today and put it on the record of this committee. Vladimír Spidla, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, will visit Ireland on Thursday and Friday of this week. I expect that he too will emphasise the positives in this respect. I was struck recently by a very positive article he wrote in a Czech newspaper on the good things he had seen, as Commissioner, in an Irish context. I have tried to be as comprehensive as possible and if there is anything I have left out I will be happy to come back.

He will have a range of meetings at Government level and will also address the National Pensions Forum in Dublin Castle on Friday morning. He will address some of the issues around the long-term sustainability of pension provision in the European Union. This is one of the issues identified by the Government and it has been debated by the House in the Lisbon reform programme. It is regarded as one of the issues that must be addressed in terms of the competitiveness of Ireland in the longer term.
